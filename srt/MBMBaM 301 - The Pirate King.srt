1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello everybody, welcome to One Brother, My Brother, and the Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, the real Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm your sweet, sweet baby brother, sweet-ass baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,120
Now, I have never had any doubts about the validity of your identity, Travis.

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,360
What did you feel the need to clarify that you were the real Travis McElroy?

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:17,520
Well, Justin, I am a grade-A, stamped, approved, real, 100% American, verified by Twitter,

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,000
Travis McElroy. My life has really turned a corner. I got that blue checkmark.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,160
Twitter has verified me. Everything's changed. Everything's changed.

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,040
So, from the way I understand it, you literally woke up and it was like any other day.

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,320
It was like any other day. Maybe you could tell me there's like a sweet smell in the air,

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,520
the sweet smell of honeysuckles, and you're like, something's changed.

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,120
The sun was a little brighter.

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,760
Well, that's just the warming.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,120
The birds were a little just better.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay.

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,320
Okay. I think it's funny because there's been a big social media push recently.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,760
Travis, do you know any of the ringleaders of that who are trying to get you verified?

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
The ringleaders at Change.org petition?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,480
That was Anna Giles. That was a huge part of it, I assume.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,880
But I also think it was just like my friends Kanye and Kim.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
A different Kanye and Kim. Not the famous ones.

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
Kanye Mendelsohn, your friend that works at Twitter.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
Yeah. And he was pushing really hard.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
Dave helped me out. Just not a specific Dave, mind you.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
Just like the general idea of Dave.

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,800
Yeah. I do just want to point out Twitter. Your verification process, it sounds really cool.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
Considering that it needed no feedback from Travis whatsoever.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,880
You're just like, yeah, that thug seems real. Click. Flipped it on.

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,320
He's real. I know. This is what they do. They go around in a circle.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,160
They say, you know Travis? And somebody says, oh, I know Travis. He's real as hell.

35
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
And I don't want to bite the hand that feeds me here because I'm very excited to be verified.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,760
But I didn't receive an email or a notification or even like a tweet from Twitter.

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,880
What would be the utility of telling you that you're Travis McElroy?

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,800
I guess that's true. But like, I only found it out because somebody who like follows all

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
verified accounts was like, congratulations on your verification. I was like, oh, what?

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,240
Cool. Cool. Awesome. I had a huge, like, I was going to throw a party. I was going to make a

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,160
banner. I was going to do a big champagne toast. And that was all taken away from me because I

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,760
didn't get any forward knowledge of it. By the official Wendy's Twitter account.

43
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,880
It was like, what's up Travis? Welcome to the club. Welcome to the squad. Free Wendy's for life.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,600
The confidence that I've gained alone, not to mention like the immense amount

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,400
of power and benefits that come from being verified, but the confidence alone has been

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,720
a game changer. You become a sort of vessel for the hopes and dreams of people.

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,880
Yeah. You are the orphan Annie of us. You are like, the sun will come out tomorrow

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,760
because I have a blue check mark. I'm like a folk hero of Twitter because they're like,

49
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,960
he's not one of the rich ones. He's not a tastemaker. He's not a powerful person.

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,000
And yet he is still verified. How did he get there? Is he a journalist? Does he work for

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
some big company? No. He talks into a microphone seven days a week because he's a dummy.

52
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Travis is an inspiring reminder that literally

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,120
anybody. Any old jag. Anyone. Anybody. Any fool. Anybody with like two brain cells to rub together

54
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
can get verified. Now Travis, you give me the confidence I need to pursue my

55
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,240
I live stream. Now that I've seen you accomplish yours with ease, you're going to see me accomplish

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,000
my life stream, which is to destroy Twitter from the inside out to eat away at it from inside.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,240
Like a, like a disease. We have a lot of people who work at the trades listening to this podcast

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,440
right now. What can we expect from Travis's new checkmark to Twitter account? What can we expect?

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,080
Maybe like more, um, like brand evangelism, some, some advertorials for like craft macaroni and

60
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,240
cheese. I've already been talking about Kroger. I've been talking about Nylabone. They're,

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,480
they're followers of mine. I'm not going to take my foot off the gas as far as weird,

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,840
funny tweets at 1159 just before I fall asleep will go. You're going to see like three,

63
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
four times what I've already been doing. Nylabone is launching a men's fashion line

64
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,480
and they're having a hard time getting that ball rolling down the old Hill.

65
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,640
But here comes Travis and he's wearing a Nylabone Dickie, which is their sort of their flagship

66
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,280
product. Um, and he looks fucking great. And you, you don't know whether or not to trust this,

67
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
this Nylabone, um, shill, but then you look at that blue checkmark and everything's okay.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
So Travis, do you think when you tweeted serious question,

69
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
shouldn't it be games of throne? You think people at Twitter were like, yes,

70
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,760
we've done a great job on that one. This is a taste like a good work here.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,920
This is a, this has been Travis's tweet review. Let's just actually do it. Justin,

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,720
if you and I want to do a comprehensive audit real quick, um, just see what, uh,

73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,040
verified Travis is up to. I know I've, I've been a little bit on fire for the last couple of days.

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,840
So you go right ahead. I'm pretty proud of some. A lot of tweets about Gallivant on ABC. Lots of,

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,040
wow, lots of, wow, lots of, wow, lots of, wow, lots of tweets about Gallivant, Travis.

76
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,880
You're one shot shop. It's a little bit up in the air Griffin and I, uh, I'm unpaid,

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,880
a huge proponent of Gallivant. I want people to watch it. I want people to go on Twitter,

78
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,280
tweet at ABC and say, Hey, more Gallivant, please. Thank you very much.

79
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,640
I do appreciate you, uh, tweeting with Ashley Burgess and Anthony Carboni about how great

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,040
monster factory is. I'm trying to get that word out. I want to use my power and influence to build

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,240
up my tiny, tiny brother's careers. You know what I mean? Do you feel an impetus, Travis? Now that

82
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,280
you're the real Travis McElroy, do you think that that may be as a point of meditation for you,

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,360
that like you always have to be bringing it real, 100% no games.

84
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,120
You know, it's actually the opposite, Justin. Cause I remember being in college and trying

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,920
to figure out who I was and I was like, what, what are the things I like versus the things

86
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,800
I think I like? Cause other people like it. And now Twitter has basically said, you are you don't

87
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,120
worry about it anymore. So now they've kind of let me off the chain because I know now I am

88
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,240
Travis McElroy. I have self-actualized you. Yes. I am the most Travis McElroy I could be.

89
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,000
Everything I'm doing is right. I never, in fact, I should be doing more of what I'm already doing.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
There's, um, I want to dive into just a subject that's important to me real fast, if I can. I know

91
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
this has been a very Travis centric intro, but I'd like to talk just more broadly about the whole

92
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,240
sort of McElroy universe. Um, you tweeted on April 29th post verification, I'm assuming. Um,

93
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,320
there's no subject I am more afraid to talk about on Twitter than at Scott Bakula. His fans can be

94
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,120
very intimidating. And then you got a response, um, from, and I don't think we should say her,

95
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,920
her, her handle. Cause I don't want to say she has known in the community. She, this,

96
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,320
this user said, that's because they are more intelligent than you. Uh, which you retweeted,

97
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,680
which like, I guess is fine. Um, and I looked and I realized that I had this person blocked.

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,920
And I realized this because I've tweeted about Scott Bakula before and this person has come down

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,880
on me like a flock, like a murder of crows. It's amazing. It's amazing. If you, if you mentioned

100
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,040
Scott Bakula, this person will respond. Is it a bot? Is it a bot? This, this fucking Scott Bakula

101
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,560
Kingsguard? No, because they drop in out of nowhere and they will put you on blast and it's

102
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,840
been like a specific blast. Like even if you're like Scott Bakula is the most amazing actor on

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,760
the planet. I love him so much. They'll come back like, fuck you. You have no idea what you're

104
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,560
talking about. You're like, cool, cool, cool. This is like highly targeted. No, it is like,

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,640
no, it is highly targeted. I know that it's real because when I tweeted that thing about

106
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,840
being intimidated by the fans, a bunch of people responded, don't listen to blank. They are the

107
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,000
worst. Even we in the community don't like them. So like, this is just an outlier, rogue Scott

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,040
Bakula fan. Don't track this person down and tweet at them, by the way. I do not want them to change

109
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,280
this game. I love this game. I'm sad. I blocked them. I'm going to unblock them right now,

110
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,720
honestly. Yeah. That's why I retweeted it. Cause I actually, I respect the avarice. I respect the

111
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,640
community. Can the three of us adopt the highway, so to speak, and each pick a celeb and then just

112
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,600
follow, like add a column on tweet deck. Anytime fucking anybody talks about them,

113
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,880
we swoop in like Batman, like, hey moron. And just like give it to them raw.

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,440
I think somebody said we're idiot. Like somebody said, why won't you go on, they tweeted at Scott

115
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,120
to say, why won't you go on the show? Still, please don't do that again. Thanks. Thank you,

116
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
please. Had a lot of that. Had a lot of that after the last episode. Thanks gang. Love your

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,120
fervor, but let's bottle that one, that particular channel of it up. We have channels and we've got

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,640
people to contact. Thank you very much. None of them will work, mind you. Someone swooped on them

119
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,600
and said, it's because they're idiot man children. It's like, whoa, he just came out of nowhere.

120
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,520
All right. Let's pick them. Let's pick them. Let's do a quick draft for our adopt the highway

121
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,440
project. This is tough. I know it's really tough. It can't be somebody. It can't be like fucking

122
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,480
Brad Pitt. Cause that's your, that's your, that's your whole life. And it can't be anybody. I was

123
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
gonna say like a David Tennant, but I feel like there's too busy too big. Are you kidding me on

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,840
the fucking internet? That's where David Tennant, David Tennant basically lives on the internet.

125
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,040
He's basically like that movie transcendence. Should we pick other Huntingtonians? Should we

126
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,080
do this for like Brad Dora for Michael Surfer? It's like where we get, if somebody tweets,

127
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:49,120
we can defend them. Like how dare you? Um, I like that. I like locking down the H H town game. I've

128
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,600
met Michael service and I would feel weird. Like, cause if I ever see him again, he'll be like,

129
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,160
Oh, you're my weird Twitter Kings guard. And I'll have to be like, yeah, that's that's me. I'm

130
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
sorry. It seemed like you, I thought you liked it and wanted it. I've got mine. I've got mine. Okay.

131
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,840
Hit it. Carry OS. Oh yeah. I think you're going to have a little bit of competition on that

132
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,920
for if you want to be the person that leaps to his defense, but I feel pretty confident. I'm a

133
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,120
big fan. Yeah. Yes. I feel like you say the name, people know the name. He's got name recognition,

134
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,800
but I don't feel like there's already like a lot. I, okay. I would have some competition,

135
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,280
but I think I could nudge my way to the front. Thanks to a little blue check mark.

136
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,120
Why is this verified person so defensive of me? Yeah. That's what I'm saying, Justin. I'm getting

137
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,280
through every filter on the planet. All right, Travis, I haven't until now, but I am to see if

138
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,600
you actually follow through this. I am going to start following you just to see if you actually

139
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,000
make good on this. I'm glad that I finally earned your follow. Okay. Listen, this is an advice.

140
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,760
Hold on. You don't want to know who I picked. Yeah. Who do you pick, Griffin? I'm putting up

141
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,560
my tweet announcement of who I picked right now, but I've decided to just go ahead and do Scott

142
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:12,160
Bakula because here's the thing. This mean, mean, mean woman is doing a poor job. She's got a fucking

143
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
itchy trigger finger. I feel like this is more indicative of her wanting to say mean things to

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,760
people on the internet and Scott Bakula is just like the vehicle, the hearty Tostito chip that

145
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,480
carries her hate salsa. I don't, I don't play that shit. He needs a better, he needs a better class

146
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,440
of defender. You know what I mean? Yeah, I think that that's an excellent choice. Okay,

147
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
this is an advice show. Justin, you're not going to pick one? You're just going to skirt the whole

148
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,120
discussion? I don't want to commit myself to it because then I don't want people tweeting about

149
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,840
me saying like, Hey, your boy Peter Stormare is under fire again. Maybe you need to like get in

150
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,000
there and help, help take him down. Well, I think you just threw your hat over the fence. I think

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,600
you just, here's the three. Okay, listen, listen, I'm just going to say this real quick. There is

152
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,080
an at Brad Dourif Twitter account. It has three tweets. They're from 2009 and 2010 respectively.

153
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,000
These are the tweets I gave Mr. Dorf's rep the info Twitter balls in his court. Now next week,

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
Mr. Dorf is still not using this Twitter account. Sad music. I thought he has publicist would use

155
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,320
it for updates someday. Third tweet looks around, takes a broom, sweeps out dusting cobwebs.

156
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,280
This place feels a little empty. Only one person could make this place.

157
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,800
It's so good. It's so good. He set up a little like Brad Dorf, a exoskeleton,

158
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:51,760
and they're just waiting for him to hop inside and take control. Oh man. Okay. I literally just

159
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,520
added a Scott back to the column on tweet deck and I'm going to be watching it during the show

160
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,720
just for any fucking anybody who steps because here's the thing. I feel like we need this is

161
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,880
volume two now, right? We need new segments and I feel like we should endeavor everything that

162
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,000
we do. Every question that we do, we just like, we, we, we try to make a segment out of it and

163
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
maybe a new segment is like Baccala defense force. I'm, I'm tweeting right now about my love of

164
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
carryaways. All right. Well, let's maybe let's, we should all close Twitter and do some advice.

165
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah. I think that that sounds good to me. I'll pick somebody at Peter storm air seems good.

166
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
Like, but I don't think Peter streamer needs me. You know what I mean? Not like Scott,

167
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,640
not like Scott. Baccala needs me. Has to have me, has to all Griffin. I must have him while taking

168
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,000
a small road trip to Chicago with my girlfriend. We pulled off into a rest stop to switch off

169
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,040
driving while there. I decided to buy a bottle of water from a vending machine. To my surprise,

170
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,280
there was a cold bottle of water in the bottom of the vending machine. Just sitting there.

171
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,760
I took the water, but now that I have it, I'm afraid it could be poisoned.

172
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,520
Should I trust this mysterious bottle of water from a dirty old Indiana rest stop or throw it

173
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,760
out the goddamn window? That's from water weary water. I cannot imagine that they are still

174
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,720
waiting on an answer to this question. Yeah. Travis sent this email 14 hours ago. So, um,

175
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,240
okay. What would you guys do in this, in this scenario? I don't think I'd drink it.

176
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:24,880
Oh, I don't know. I think I would. I think that if I was like, oh, I'm going to pay a dollar 75

177
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,640
or whatever for the sunny and then there in the trays, the dishonest would be like, oh, swoop.

178
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Um, I feel like, I feel like a true adulthood or maybe it's not even an adulthood, but like you,

179
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,920
you reach a point in your life of financial stability where the 0.0001% chance that you'll

180
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,520
drink something that will kill you no longer becomes worth saving a dollar. Yeah, but like

181
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,360
that doesn't like, okay. It just doesn't make sense to me that if you're going to go through

182
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,080
the trouble of poisoning something, why would you set a honey pot by which like the person probably

183
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,760
would be inclined not to drink it? You know what I mean? Like if you wanted to put a poison bottle

184
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,600
of water somewhere, it seems like you would put it in a, a refrigerator at like a speedway or

185
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,280
something, something that people would actually like drink. Not like you're not, why are you just

186
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,040
trying to poison people? You're thinking too much about like the physical poisoning.

187
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,440
What about like a curse or? Yeah, the curse is what I was thinking of also. Yeah, something

188
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,920
more along the lines of like, they have not physically altered the makeup of this Dasani at

189
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,640
all, except if you're the one who takes it, maybe you'll be thirsty forever. Well, we are all going

190
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,880
to be thirsty for like, that's, I hope. No, I mean like no amount of liquid, no amount of beverage

191
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,600
could. Unslakeable. Yeah, unslakeable, thank you. That would be the name of the movie,

192
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,480
Unslakeable. Unslakeable. I'm glad that we've pivoted away from poisoning advice,

193
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,120
which is what we were, oh boys, we were really dangerously teetering on the edge of becoming

194
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,080
a poison. Let me tell you how I'd kill a stranger at a speedway. How to get away with cursing water.

195
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,640
I bet if you could market cursed water, it would sell really fucking well. I don't know why you

196
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,480
would curse. Okay, the thing about a curse is that in order for it to work, there has to be

197
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
a sort of like- A sacrifice.

198
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,760
Like an irony behind- Oh, I see.

199
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,920
You have to, there's a re, okay, if you take a bottle of water out of the vending machine that's

200
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,960
already in the vending machine and you don't pay your money, you're just like doing what's best

201
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,880
for the environment. You're not throwing that in a landfill. Why should you be punished for that?

202
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:55,680
You know what I mean? Like if there was a table and on it said like, for service dogs only,

203
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,600
and you went over and just like drained it, right? Then I could see where you would be

204
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,720
punished for that karmically. Yes. And you'd wake up being a service dog the next day.

205
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
You'd wake up as a service dog, Shaggy, D.A.

206
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,440
And then like the evil wizard would show up and say, I said it was for service dogs only.

207
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,800
And then Tim Allen's like, Tim Allen's like, when the fuck am I going to learn my lesson?

208
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,200
When am I going to learn my lesson? I've got to dial it in. I know I'm going to eat this cursed

209
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,920
milk and cookies. Ah, shit. Santa Claus four, dog to Santa, kick flip.

210
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,680
Santa paw, wait, that's already a thing. Santa paws two.

211
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,400
It's like that time when he's, you know how the first one starts with Santa dying

212
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,360
and Tim Allen stealing his clothes out of Chili?

213
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
And then he's like, oh, I like these boots. And it's like, oh, God, I think I'll take these for

214
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,240
myself. I didn't think that the scene of Tim Allen stripping Santa's corpse needed to last for 10

215
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,840
minutes. Yeah, but it was like bold. And two of those minutes were just a close up on his

216
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,760
slowly engorging hog. Yeah, it's his wild hog.

217
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,320
It starts off- The long, long scene of him digging a shallow grave in his backyard as he

218
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,040
laughed covered in blood was, I didn't think it was appropriate for a kid's movie, but no one

219
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,520
mentioned it in any of their critiques. And his hog just fluctuated between different

220
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,920
states of firmness. As he laughed.

221
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,160
As he laughed. It was like, ha, ha, ha.

222
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
But then he got really chubby and grew a big beard.

223
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,200
And then we all had raging hogs. I think your problem was going to drink water anyway.

224
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
What's water going to do? Nothing. Yeah, that's it. If I'm going to try and poison

225
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
a fool with a vending machine honey pot, you know I'm going to put some fruitopia down there

226
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,520
and not some water. Because even if you walk up to that machine expecting to-

227
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,040
Even if you walk up to that machine expecting to get some water and you see a free fruitopia

228
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,120
waiting for you, my plans have just shifted in a wonderful new direction.

229
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,280
Like that HEB water you like so much, Griffin. What if they put that down there?

230
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,880
I've recently learned that it's being discontinued and I really don't want to fucking get into it

231
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,400
right now. Okay, sorry.

232
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
Do you guys want a Yahoo? I'd like that. Thank you.

233
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,520
This Yahoo was sent in by Aaron Keys. By the way, is there anything in that question

234
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
that we could turn into a new segment? Maybe like Travis's Curses or...

235
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,480
No. Aaron Keys sent this in. Thank you, Aaron. It's by Yahoo Answers user Darius who asks,

236
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,240
I want to be an explosive dunker, but I'm skinny and can do a basic two-hand dunk.

237
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:34,560
I'm 6'6 already and 16. I want to be able to catch oops, which is I believe a shorthand for

238
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,520
or hoops jams. I think it's short for Alex Oops.

239
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,960
That would be a great basketball name. You know how basketball players when they get super,

240
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,120
super famous, they can change their name to cool sounding shit like Larry Bird?

241
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
You think that was really his name? Because he flies like a bird.

242
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,080
Because he flies like a bird when he puts those dunks in the rim.

243
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,120
Explosive dunks, a little on the skinny side. I don't think that matters so much.

244
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,720
You got the 6'6. But he's got the height. You got the height is going to be good.

245
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,640
How can you learn to catch oops? Because I've always thought of that as being like sort of

246
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:22,640
bred into a child. What you need is you need a oops partner who is both taller and better at

247
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,720
basketball than you. Yeah, I guess that's a good point, Travis. A good oops is like a

248
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,880
contract of trust between two people. And ideally what you want is for them to already

249
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:44,240
be making the shot and you're just barely touching the ball and then you take all the credit.

250
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,480
I was the scorekeeper. You received a trophy for that, didn't you?

251
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,320
A trophy for that and everything. Yeah.

252
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,040
And so what did you learn from your time watching the people on the paint?

253
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,000
If I dunk every day, then I only know how I dunk. As the scorekeeper, the scorekeeper might

254
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,480
arguably be the best basketball player on the whole court because they have to watch like a hawk and

255
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,040
see every dunk that everybody does. That's why I try to tell people that I was the best one out

256
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,480
there. And you spent 10,000 hours as the scorekeeper, right? So you became like a basketball

257
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,800
expert. Sort of a basketball expert. You know, I got so into that groove. I tried to join the

258
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:28,480
wrestling team as a manager and it was me. And at the time to sign up for it, it was me and

259
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,360
seven girls. And one of the girls said that that job was only for girls and that I could

260
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
join the wrestling team. Wow. Sexism is alive in America.

261
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
I know, right? Finally.

262
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
This fucking fox catcher too.

263
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,880
Yeah. I was told that because of my gender, I was not going to fill that role. And I was like,

264
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,640
I get it. For too long, men have suffered under the thumb of the matriarchy.

265
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,720
Right. So when people talk about like the glass ceiling, for example,

266
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,520
and they say it's something that affects women in my head, I usually amend that to say just

267
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,040
women and Justin. Also, Willy Wonka shattered the glass ceiling with the Wonka Vader. I saw it.

268
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,080
Sorry, ladies. Sorry.

269
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
He destroyed sexism forever.

270
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,360
He destroyed sexism forever. He and Charlie. I don't know why naming another white man as his

271
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
successor shattered the glass ceiling, but I saw it in all of its technicolor glory.

272
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,040
I think he just replaced the glass ceiling with a glass elevator,

273
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,360
which is basically a little glass prison, which is arguably much, much worse. Explosive dunks.

274
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
Oh, guys. I had some bad old chili last night. Explosive dunks.

275
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,480
Oh, it's all raw down there. I think it's not about your size. It's about, it's not about,

276
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,680
it's not about the player and the pain. It's about the heart in the player.

277
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,560
You're on some Michael's Secret stuff shit right now. I want to give this person practical

278
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,480
explosive dunk advice. An explosive dunk, I think you would define going from zero on the floor,

279
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,000
you don't even have the basketball in your hands, to up in the fucking paint hoop from how fast you

280
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,280
can get up there and how scary you can be while you do it. It's an intimidation game, the explosive

281
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,920
dunks. I'm sick of this- But I think it's all a mental game,

282
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,800
Griffin. That's what I'm saying. You have to yell something out while you dunk. And

283
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,960
the first couple of times, maybe the first hundred times, you're going to yell something

284
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,600
and then the dunk won't happen and you'll look really foolish. But on the 100th and one time,

285
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,520
when you yell like, dunkums, and you do it and you nail it, everyone's going to be like, damn.

286
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Damn dunkums, dude. Damn, Daniel.

287
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,360
See, I'm not interested in yelling something when I'm on the court going for a sick dunk.

288
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,880
When I go for a nasty dunk, what I want to be remembered for by my fellow players,

289
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,520
I don't want to be remembered for my dunking ability. I want to be remembered for my kind

290
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,920
and generous heart. So before I go for a dunk, I normally say something quietly so that only my

291
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:07,520
fellow players can hear me, but in a conciliatory considerate thing to say before a dunk. So if I'm

292
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:17,120
going up off the paint, elevator, magic man, go for two, the sickest two, I look at another player

293
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,480
and I'll say something like, next time it'll be you, and then I'll go for it. Or like, nothing

294
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,000
personal, and then I'll take it down there. Or like, you know what I mean? You have a lovely

295
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,520
family. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Hey, your shoes are untied. But only if their shoes,

296
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,160
I can't say this enough, are untied. Because it's not a prank, okay? I'll salute your shorts here.

297
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,400
Yeah. We're trying to play basketball, gentlemen. What if you, every time you dunk,

298
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,720
apologize to everybody on the team? Because I think if I ever joined a basketball outfit

299
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,360
and I saw one of my co-dunkers get a dunk instead of me, I'd be like, I wish I was the one getting

300
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,600
up in the paint and dunking. So like, what if every time you dunked you'd be like, I know you

301
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,640
guys wish this was you, but it's me this time, and next time maybe the next time it'll be you.

302
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,000
You know what I found helps with that, Griffin? If I'm running up to take it downtown, like if I'm

303
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,040
about to nasty dunk, as I'm passing one of my fellow players, I'll say like, boost me, boost

304
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,520
me, boost me! So they'll get a hand on me and kind of like help lift me. So when I do the dunk,

305
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
they're not clear. In their head, they kind of feel like, I don't know if he would have made it

306
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,760
by himself. I would have. Yeah. But you know, I feel like that gets them involved. You know,

307
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,600
it's like fun for them. Michael Jordan did that to keep his relationship good with Larry Bird,

308
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,040
because Larry Bird's a very jealous man. Holy shit. And like every dunk that anybody gets,

309
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,280
even in the games he doesn't play, he can't even watch basketball on TV anymore because he sees

310
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,640
all these dunks happening. He's like, that should have been mine. And it's like, you don't even play

311
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:08,240
for the Charlotte Hornets. You could also act as though you're acting on, you could shout them out

312
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,800
as you're going for the dunk. So sort of like, as you're going up in the air, you're just like,

313
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,680
Vladi Divac taught me how to do this! Yeah. And then Vladi Divac's like, hell yeah. Thank you.

314
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,040
Thank you for the credit. Thank you. I think every time you dunk, because I've never done it,

315
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,400
and I imagine it's like the hardest, it's the hardest thing in the world, right? Dunking,

316
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,280
it's the hardest, it's the hardest feat in sports. A lot of people say pitch in a perfect game. Why

317
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,600
don't you get bonus points for dunking? Exactly. Yeah. It's worth a paltry amount of points,

318
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,920
but it's the thing everybody goes to the shit for the shit. I think you should get points for

319
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,400
fighting and hockey too, but that's a whole nother kettle of fish. I think every time you dunk,

320
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,680
you should be able to give an Oscar-style acceptance speech immediately afterwards.

321
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,000
Like immediately just pause the game for like, it doesn't have to be very long, like 20 seconds.

322
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,120
And just be like, for this dunk, I just want to say huge ups to the Space Jam soundtrack. Spent a

323
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,720
lot of hard days in the old asphalt jungle learning the ropes to the songs from R. Kelly.

324
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,600
And oh, it's over, right? Back into the regulation time. I think the problem with that-

325
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,040
Larry, I know you're watching. This one's- Larry, I know you're watching. Just fucking

326
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,320
cool it, dude. Stop calling my house at night. Stop with the tweets. Travis is getting exhausted.

327
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,640
I think the problem with that rule, they used to have that. You guys are too young to remember.

328
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,520
They used to have that. But the problem is you have players who started telling very interesting

329
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,280
stories in 20-second chunks. So at the end of it, they'd be like, and if you want to hear how this

330
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,760
one wraps up, if you want to hear how it got out of this grape, then you'll just have to let me

331
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,000
dunk again. And they had a big problem with players like, everybody back, back, back, back, back, back.

332
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
I gotta hear this. I gotta hear this. Larry Bird, get up. I gotta know what happened to that chicken.

333
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,480
Yeah. So where did the car end up? I think that when you dunk, not only should your team

334
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,160
get two points, the other team should lose two points. Oh, that's really good.

335
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Because really, that's what a dunk signifies. Like, I am dunking on you.

336
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,920
What if- Like, not like I shot a basket and made it. Like, this dunk is to embarrass you.

337
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:15,360
Yeah. What if dunking was like the golden snitch of basketball, and the first team that does it

338
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:24,000
gets 150 points. And the game's over. And the game's immediately over. And to sort of make it

339
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,280
a little bit harder to do, we're gonna raise that hoop up like 10 more feet, huh? Let's get that hoop-

340
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,800
And then everybody has to lift you up, and everybody's dunking together.

341
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,600
That's what I'm saying, bro. I'm talking about full-blown cheerleader pyramid to get- I bet,

342
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,560
but see, then you start getting folks like, I mean, Dikembe Mutombo doesn't need as many folks

343
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,520
helping him up. You know what I mean? And so like, Yao Ming is finally like, you know, he's not the

344
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,280
best shooter in the league, but I mean, he's gonna, he's the fucking Harry Potter of snitch dunking.

345
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:57,360
If you want to instantly improve basketball, start playing the game with a water balloon

346
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,840
shaped like a basketball, because what is that gonna lead to? No dribbles. Thank you.

347
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,960
Yeah. Soft passes. Absolutely. One dunk,

348
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,400
and the game's over. Yeah.

349
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,600
And it's like such an explosive finish. That's it. That's the end of the game.

350
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
What if it's a Gatorade balloon, and then it's two birds, one stone?

351
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,680
Yeah. Exactly.

352
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
You just put the coach right under the basket when you dunk.

353
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,120
Both the coaches have to stand under their baskets, too. That's key.

354
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
That's fun. And maybe we could, maybe it could be like a fundraiser.

355
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,960
Or a fundraiser. Oh, it's gonna be that for sure. There's a dog park near my work,

356
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,280
and sometimes I go there to eat lunch. I don't even ask to pet the puppies. I just sit on a

357
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,000
bench and eat a sandwich and watch the dogs play, and then I leave when I'm done. I feel like this

358
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,800
is totally normal, or at least not creepy behavior, but the other day a dude got all up in my face

359
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,600
about it. He said if I didn't have a dog with me, I shouldn't be there. I got flustered and left,

360
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,840
but now I can't help but wonder, was he the asshole, or am I unknowingly creeping out the

361
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:59,520
puppies? That's from Puppy Peepin Improvo. He is the asshole. No puppy. No, no, no.

362
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,800
The person yelling at him. Oh, okay, good, good, good, good.

363
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Real quick sidebar. Anthony on Twitter tweeted that Scott Bakula's decent at best,

364
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,680
and I responded, don't be a moron. First one down. I'm fucking trembling right now. I feel high.

365
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,760
17 minutes, no one's tweeted about carryaways. Okay. We'll get them. We'll get them. We'll

366
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
bring them in. I still haven't picked one. Yeah, it's fun, man. I'm like, who the fuck? I'm like

367
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,080
fucking hopped up right now. I'm feeling punchy. I did a Google search for the nicest celebrities

368
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,560
because I want to be worth it. Yeah, sure. I want to be-

369
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,680
Justin, can I pitch one for you? Yeah, sure.

370
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,480
Steve Buscemi. Yeah, is he active on Twitter though? It seems like he would have better

371
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,000
things to do. But no, that's going to be a rough one because I feel like Steve Buscemi falls into

372
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,840
this weird category of just everybody feels like, oh, it's okay to make fun of how he looks. Oh,

373
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,040
Steve Buscemi. It's totally fine to make fun of how he looks. That's okay. That's cool. We can

374
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,040
meme that. That's easy. Guess what? When you make fun of Steve Funny, see, even I'm in it.

375
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,640
I'm too deep in. When you make fun of Steve Buscemi's appearance, that's not a meme. That's a

376
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,120
meme. Just think about what you say. Just think about how your words would affect him.

377
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,520
What about Keanu Reeves? How is that- See, I think that would be a busy job for you,

378
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,720
but I think he needs the most defending. It seems like he might need some help.

379
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,920
I think he'd really appreciate it above all else, but in a really chill way. Thank you.

380
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,800
Oh, he's a chill bro. I didn't expect that. I can't believe this has happened to you,

381
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,960
and I want to apologize. I don't even own a dog. I'm not a part of that community. I want to

382
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,280
apologize on behalf of them because it's not a crime to look at some dogs. It's not like you're

383
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:52,320
posted outside of where the babies chill out after they get out. The baby park where they can go out

384
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,000
and just poop and run around all day. And do whatever. It's not like that. It's not like

385
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,040
you're scoping out somebody's kids. You know what I mean? You're just looking at some dogs,

386
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,800
and dogs are there to be looked at. That's just it. That's just it. Especially if you're not

387
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,040
bothering anyone, and you're not doing shit. It would be one thing if you were walking around

388
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,880
the park being like, oh, is that your dog? Nice, nice. How you doing? That's creepy.

389
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,040
But if you're just sitting on a bench outside the fence eating your sandwich-

390
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,000
Now wait, but wait. You've just said it. What's on that sandwich? What's on that sandwich?

391
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,600
Be honest with yourself. If you're eating a sandwich full of things that dogs would just

392
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:36,400
go fucking crazy for, like bagging the strips. A BSLT. A BSLT. Then you know what you're doing.

393
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,880
You know you just go to that dog park just to see who you can get riled up. And maybe you should

394
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,400
leave. Are you riling up the puppies? Are you sitting there whispering through the fence?

395
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,320
I heard Princess Tickle saying some bullshit about you, and you're trying to get a kerfuffle

396
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,160
going on in the dog park. Are you a dog park dirt stirrer? Well, maybe don't do that. But if you're

397
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,200
just going to calmly sit there, maybe do a little candy crush on your phone, eat a sandwich, and in

398
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,760
between candy crush levels, scope out the puppies, I don't see anything wrong with that.

399
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,600
I just remembered another person's joke, which I'd like to say on the podcast,

400
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,160
which was from the hit website, Steve Don't Eat It, which is maybe my favorite website.

401
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,040
And Steve Don't Eat It once reviewed bagging strips, which they ate,

402
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,800
and said that it tasted like the smoky puke of a thousand maniacs.

403
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,360
I don't think there's anything wrong to look at a dog. I really don't think there's anything wrong

404
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,320
to look at a dog. Are they saying that you're some sort of pervert for looking at a dog? If

405
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,080
that's the case, I've seen every Air Bud movie. Does that make me a pervert? Yeah, it does.

406
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,240
It definitely, definitely does. It definitely, definitely does.

407
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,560
I have a few names I want to float by you guys. Okay.

408
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,600
Just like celebs that have been rattling around my head, okay? Tom Cavanagh.

409
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,640
Ooh. That's a good pick, right?

410
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,840
I'm a big fan. I'm a big fan of Tom, but I feel like Tom is like... I feel like there's a chance

411
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,760
to... I don't want to be somebody who I think I'll meet, you know what I mean?

412
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,160
Exactly. I feel like there's a chance I can meet Tom Cavanagh.

413
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
Cavanagh can really hold his own too, you know what I mean?

414
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah, Tom Cavanagh doesn't really need to. I've listened to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks,

415
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,920
and I feel like he's a podcaster. That's another thing. I don't think

416
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,680
we should do a podcaster because that's fucking weird.

417
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Let me hit you with this. I'm pretty into this one. I'm kind of...

418
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,080
This one's been rattling around. What about Joshua Jackson?

419
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,920
Now, that's someone I could really sink my teeth into.

420
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,600
Now, Joshua Jackson I could get... Joshy, as I call it, I could get into.

421
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,320
I'm currently deciding between... It's going to be one of these two.

422
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
Either Joshua Jackson or Stephen Amell.

423
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:47,760
Who?

424
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
Stephen Amell.

425
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,760
See, I don't...

426
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,400
The arrow.

427
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,280
Now, see, that's going to be busy for you because now he's all up in the WWE.

428
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,120
Yeah, and I feel like he's a little bit too new on the scene,

429
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,680
where I feel like a Joshua Jackson, you're going to get people...

430
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,200
For example, I see this guy on Twitter talking about how Cary Elwes is so good

431
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,440
in Princess Bride and the worst piece of shit in everything else.

432
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,360
Oh, boy. Did you treat him yet?

433
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,480
Yes, I did.

434
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,200
What'd you say?

435
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
I feel like I could have been meaner. I think I just said...

436
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,200
Because he also said, I talked to Cary Elwes and he said he died after Princess Bride,

437
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,520
so he's sorry, but it's hard to act as a rotting corpse.

438
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,800
And I responded, he's alive and well and an amazing actor, thank you very much.

439
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
I think I probably could have been meaner.

440
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,120
I don't feel like anybody would say anything negative about Joshua Jackson.

441
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
And that's why when they do-

442
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,640
And that's why when they do-

443
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,680
You don't think you get a lot of like,

444
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,840
keep swimming in Dawson's Creek and stay out of such and such.

445
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,120
You don't think you'd get that kind of thing.

446
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,960
Okay, but here's the question, and this is really actually very important.

447
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,120
Do I keep a Twitter handle search for Joshua Jackson, of course, as Vancity Jaxx,

448
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,240
or do I keep a Joshua Jackson cowards column?

449
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,720
You're gonna have to do both. I've got both going right now.

450
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,440
Okay, that's good.

451
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,680
I've got an at Cary Elwes and I have just Cary Elwes sub-tweeting.

452
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,280
I'm ready to jump down anyone's throats.

453
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
Travis also has the Cary Elves with a V,

454
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,840
just like if people misspell it and they're trying to talk shit.

455
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,480
And C-A-R-R-Y Elwes and C-A-R, it's basically-

456
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,040
It's a lot.

457
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,400
I've had to get a second screen.

458
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,480
I do want to say, Justin, Joshua Jackson,

459
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,640
I don't think people are gonna say a lot of mean things about him.

460
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
And that's exactly why you need to defend him,

461
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,400
is because when they do say a mean thing about him, I don't think that he'll be-

462
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
I just wanna be active in this pursuit.

463
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,560
I don't want to be a hollow thing like everything else in my life, I'll lose interest.

464
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,880
Can we acknowledge the fact that we have been recording now for about 40 minutes-ish?

465
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
And in that time, in a 40-minute window in the universe,

466
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,520
people have said mean shit about Cary Elwes and Scott Vagala.

467
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,960
I didn't expect that kind of turnaround on this goof.

468
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
That like, nope, yup, yup, yup, there were-

469
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,760
Travis, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to take away your verified check mark,

470
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
because apparently you don't know fuck all about Twitter.

471
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,640
Yeah.

472
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,160
I was thinking like maybe once a day, somebody would say something mean about Cary Elwes.

473
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,840
I don't know that I've got the time.

474
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,840
Oh, I got it.

475
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,360
Pierce Brosnan.

476
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,880
Solid.

477
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,680
Don't even-

478
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,800
Boom goes the dynamite.

479
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,520
Don't even say anything about Pierce Brosnan on Twitter.

480
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,640
I will come for you.

481
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,000
Get pierced.

482
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,200
I like that, because I think that Pierce Brosnan seems tough,

483
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,760
but I think that he's probably a very sensitive soul,

484
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,920
that if you say like, yeah, go sit in your invisible car, dumbass,

485
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,760
like he probably cries a little bit.

486
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,800
Yeah.

487
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,960
And he should, that's mean, people shouldn't say that.

488
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm gonna spend more time standing up for Pierce Brosnan.

489
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,440
Not gonna follow him, it seems like.

490
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,960
Oh fuck no, there's no way on earth I'm following Scott Vagala.

491
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,320
It's new in CIS.

492
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
Fucking no way, are you kidding me?

493
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
That's too close to the heat.

494
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,600
I don't follow Cary Elwes.

495
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,560
Hey, quit saying my name rhymes with Dracula.

496
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,720
Scott, I fucking get it, okay, dawg?

497
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,480
Let's go to the money zone, please God.

498
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Yeah, here we go.

499
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:32,240
I'm almost done, let me, you guys go ahead and start.

500
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,720
I just gotta get my Pierce Brosnan column like up and ready.

501
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,040
Yeah, yeah, start the dragnet.

502
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm gonna start talking about me undies,

503
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,640
the best underwear that you can wear.

504
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,480
Whether you're wearing a suit, whether you're wearing sweats,

505
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
you spend 24 hours a day in your underwear.

506
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,800
The underwear that you wear down there all the time

507
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,120
against your most precious materials,

508
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,400
it's probably pretty boring.

509
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,280
Me undies wants to fix that, they wanna make it exciting.

510
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,840
They wanna liven up your downtown situation,

511
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,400
like a Mardi Gras or like Carnival.

512
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,520
All these underwear is made out of sustainably sourced modal,

513
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,840
and that's a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

514
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Gang, I have like seven or eight pairs of me undies now,

515
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,000
and it's like, I get excited to wear them.

516
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,480
And pretty soon I'll have replaced my whole collection

517
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,360
with me undies, and then it's just gonna be a nonstop,

518
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,360
just like cool breeze festival down there.

519
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll tell you what, the me undies has become my metric

520
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,480
for when it's time to like do laundry,

521
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,960
because it's like, oh, on my last pair of clean me undies,

522
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,160
it's laundry day today.

523
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,480
Yeah, me undies is dedicated to providing

524
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,840
the world's most comfortable underwear.

525
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,320
In this pursuit, I would say that they have already succeeded.

526
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,400
If you don't love your first pair, they're free.

527
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,160
No questions asked, here, have your money back.

528
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,280
Here, have your money back.

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
There's dozens of styles and limited edition prints

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,240
to help you make a statement with your underwear.

531
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,760

532
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,360
and you can save up to $8 a pair

533

It feels so good, they have cool designs all the time.

541

You get matching underwear for you and a loved one.

542
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
Travis and I wear matching underwear almost every day.

543
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,240
We text each other in the morning,

544
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,600
like, which one are you going with?

545
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,680
And Travis is like, the one with the different boom boxes

546
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,640
on it, and I'm like, hell yeah, son.

547
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,400
I sent him a picture of my bear dick,

548
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
and then I sent him a picture of my dick

549
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,560
with the me undies on, but like,

550
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,160
if you flip back and forth between them real quick,

551
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,600
it looks like a magic trick.

552
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,120
Yeah, it looks like a magic eye painting.

553
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,840
I'd like to take a moment, if you guys are quite finished,

554
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,120
to talk about Bowling Branch.

555
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,080
We have been sleeping on Bowling Branch sheets

556
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,680
here at our house for a couple months now,

557
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,000
and I can't sleep without them.

558
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,400
If I go out of town, I just lie awake,

559
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,440
staring at the ceiling, just praying for daylight.

560
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,840
And that's the way I've been ruined by Bowling Branch.

561
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,880
They'll let you try these sheets for 30 nights,

562
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
and I promise you, you're gonna need just one.

563
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,520
And if you don't love them, you can send them back.

564
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,240
You have nothing to lose.

565
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,360

00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,680

They're sheeps, also.

574
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,760
They'll sell you sheeps, but I wouldn't recommend it.

575
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,960
You don't know how to care for them.

about Smash Fiction, the podcast.

589
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
You should listen, you should subscribe.

590
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,960
Here's why.

591
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,120
The Power Rangers vs. Godzilla.

592
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,880
Gandalf vs. Dumbledore.

593
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,720
Batman vs. Dr. Doom.

594
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
The Smash Fiction podcast settles

595
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,240
the most important issues of the day.

596
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,080
Who would win if different fictional characters

597
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,480
clashed in battle of strengths or wits?

598
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,040
Smash Fiction is a debate-style comedy podcast

599
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,120
in which a rotating cast of nerds battle

600
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,960
on behalf of their chosen characters

601
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,840
and a single impartial judge decides who wins.

602
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,760
I think that that sounds pretty damn good.

603
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
Who would win in a fight?

604
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,720
Pierce Brosnan, Carrie Elwes, or Scott Bakula?

605
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,240
Scott Bakula.

606
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,080
I actually think it would be Pierce Brosnan.

607
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,000
I started listening to this podcast

608
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,320
and my first thought was, wow, this guy has a great voice.

609
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,160
And then I thought, man, I'm learning a lot

610
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,840
about architecture and design.

611
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,360
And then I realized I had been listening

612
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
to 99% Invisible and that was on me.

613
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,880
That's my fault. You goofed up.

614
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,800
I goofed up. You blew it.

615
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,840
I blew it, okay?

616
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,680
I just wanna get that off my chest.

617
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,640
I have another message here.

618
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,960
This one's for M Huff and it's from,

619
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,120
oh, a bunch of stuff.

620
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,880
It's from Weed Mom, Fish Ass Lover,

621
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,040
Cat Hustler, and One Lunch Man.

622
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,600
And this Motley...

623
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,760
My fish ass lover.

624
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,020
Nope.

625
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,160
This Motley Crue says,

626
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,480
happy birthday to our favorite whiskey dad.

627
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,920
We are so delighted to be friends

628
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,720
with a wonderful owlficionado like you,

629
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,160
even if you can't help it with all these gosh darn,

630
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,640
a little rude language in here,

631
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,240
ridiculous eggs.

632
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,880
Whether it's yelling about treats

633
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,960
or thirsting hard over ruinous elves,

634
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,480
you're our problematic fave

635
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,000
and we wouldn't have it any other way.

636
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,120
Here's to many more years

637
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,720
of nestling in the garbage together

638
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,880
and wallowing in our filthy...

639
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,800
Hey, let's look up that word

640
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,760
before we just say it.

641
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,160
I think it's a beast, bro.

642
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,480
Occasionally shortened to fujopan

643
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,600
or just a fujo,

644
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,720
this word is a slang term

645
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,920
for an extremely bad quality manga scanslation.

646
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,800
And now I gotta fucking Google that one.

647
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,800
The art of turning a manga from one language

648
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,680
into a different language

649
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,880
includes translation of the story

650
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,080
and editing of the actual artwork.

651
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,440
Scanslations are done by fans

652
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,560
for the whole fan community.

653
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,240
This seems okay.

654
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,440
Go ahead and say it, Griffin.

655
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,600
Wallowing in our filthy fujo ways.

656
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,320
If I just said,

657
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,400
like that's the most work I've ever done

658
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,080
to make sure something's not racist.

659
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
So please like, if I...

660
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,920
So the next time we say something racist,

661
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,280
please remember this

662
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
and just like give us credit for this.

663
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,840
But this may have been racist, whatever.

664
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,680
Their birthday is Saturday,

665
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,840
September 6th.

666
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,080
So they wanted this message around then.

667
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,360
So like this message so far,

668
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,160
I would say it's been just a complete catastrophe.

669
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,360
Just a complete fiasco

670
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,960
from fucking start to finish.

671
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,080
I'm sorry, Imhoff.

672
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,680
Imhoff, we did our best.

673
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,960
We literally did as...

674
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,920
That's the most effort

675
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,600
I've ever done on this podcast before.

676
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,200
Happy birthday, whiskey dad.

677
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,240
And just good luck.

678
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,960
Good luck to me.

679
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
I'm gonna need my own fucking Scott Bakula defender

680
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:26,320
after this episode goes up.

681
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,280
Yeah, I got one here.

682
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,720
And this one was sent in by

683
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,520
Love 9000, Yajra, Drew, Drew Davenport.

684
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:33,920
Thank you, Drew.

685
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,160
It's by Yajra Answers user, The Hooded One.

686
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,000
Who says, I've got a secret.

687
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,120
The Hooded One says,

688
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,360
where can you find lots of gold?

689
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,760
I'm a man in my late 30s.

690
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,120
I wanna have a lot of treasure?

691
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,360
Gold, jewels, rubies, diamonds.

692
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,480
Where can I find this?

693
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,000
I wanna have my own Steve Zahn Sahara quest.

694
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,360
I wanna have my own national treasure book of secrets.

695
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,680
I wanna have my own The Mummy 2.

696
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,440
The Mummy gets back in there.

697
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,920
The Mummy 2, still mummying.

698
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
The Mummy 2, too many mummies.

699
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,560
This is a good question.

700
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,800
And I'll tell you why.

701
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,960
Cause where is treasure kept?

702
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,120
In a treasure chest.

703
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,440
Okay.

704
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,400
Okay.

705
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,400
So like, it's really a chicken and the egg thing.

706
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Because if you buy the chest first,

707
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,160
and then you get some gold,

708
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,440
just like a regular amount of gold that you would get,

709
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,640
and then you dump in the chest,

710
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,240
I bet it looks ridiculous, right?

711
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,520
It has to be at least three quarters full

712
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,280
for it to even merit having a chest full of treasure.

713
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,120
How much treasure do you have to get

714
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,400
before you sit there and be like,

715
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
I need to get a chest for that.

716
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,120
I need to get a chest for this,

717
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,400
cause that problem is like before that moment,

718
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,080
what do you just have?

719
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,480
Like a Kroger bag full of gold?

720
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,880
You've got a reusable shopping bag of gold.

721
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,560
Do you think you start with a very, very small chest?

722
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,120
A big chest is mostly full of balled up socks,

723
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,760
but then there's some gold on top of it.

724
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,920
They never dig deep in movies

725
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,280
where treasure chests are unearthed

726
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,680
to see this just like USA Today's

727
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,120
that have been crumpled up to add volume.

728
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,760
We found old black beard pirate Carruthers

729
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,360
secret chest of goodies.

730
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,120
Ah, sick, look at all these gold nugs.

731
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,800
This is, ah, there's mostly socks in here.

732
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,360
Here's a note.

733
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,720
Yarr, gotcha.

734
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,400
Gotcha, suckers.

735
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,840
Please don't take the socks.

736
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,640
I need those.

737
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,840
I need these socks.

738
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,680
You know, the reason they have to have real food

739
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,960
in commercials is that Chunky was trying to sell

740
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,480
this new soup with lots of vegetables,

741
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,400
but the vegetables kept sinking to the bottom.

742
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,160
So they filled the bowl with marbles

743
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,480
and then dumped the soup on top of it

744
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,080
to make it look more veggie.

745
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,840
That would be, that would be chunky.

746
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,840
Yeah, it was very chunky.

747
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
That actually sounds mad chunky.

748
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,160
And exceedingly crunchy, I would say.

749
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,080
I learned that at 99% Invisible, by the way,

750
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,120
so kiss here.

751
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,440
Well, but so then did somebody eat the marbles?

752
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,360
Somebody, no, Travis,

753
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,680
they didn't put marbles in the fucking cans.

754
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,760
You couldn't go down, but then why would,

755
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,080
but you posed it as though they did that

756
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,520
and then there was some executive like,

757
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,640
hey, hey, hey, from now on, real food in the bowls.

758
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,320
No, it's crazier than that.

759
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,240
The federal government somehow unearthed their secret,

760
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,000
like what kind of deep throat marble mouth nonsense

761
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,720
is like, somebody's like, listen, you need to dig deeper.

762
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,840
Dig below the vegetables.

763
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,360
Dig below the carrots.

764
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,600
To see if they're, get an x-ray camera

765
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,280
and run it over the commercial

766
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,120
and see if you spy any marbles.

767
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,000
You gotta jump into the screen like Poltergeist.

768
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,560
I've always felt that like,

769
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,760
this question makes me think of

770
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,440
how much video games lied to me

771
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,080
about how this scenario works as an adult

772
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,560
of like walking around and like smashing a pot

773
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,040
or like opening a box and finding money.

774
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,440
No repeats in there, yeah.

775
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,680
And how much better the world would be if that happened,

776
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,240
except that like there's somebody on the other end of that.

777
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,320
Yeah, let me hit you guys with this scenario.

778
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,840
You take a baseball bat and a slingshot

779
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,520
for the jugs and vases that they have up on shelves

780
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,800
that you can't reach normally

781
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,400
and you wanna blast them like that.

782
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,760
I think if you took those two pieces of gear

783
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,880
and basically were allowed,

784
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,680
you were given 10 minutes to just supermarket sweep

785
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,920
fucking guys' grocery games, the whole space.

786
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,560
If you do that shit up in Glenn Beck's house,

787
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,040
cause you know, if there's one motherfucker on this earth

788
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,720
that wants to leave behind a legacy of a pirate hoard,

789
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,960
is that fool that's like, sell me your gold.

790
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm good for it.

791
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,520
Why do you need all that gold, Glenn Beck?

792
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,720
I'll tell you why.

793
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,160
Cause you wanna be the new pirate king.

794
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,360
That's what's up.

795
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,160
If you go up in his house and you do smash open a jug,

796
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,600
he's like, oh no, you found it.

797
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,520
Like a hundred golden coins comes out.

798
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,240
I'm saying when that dude dies

799
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,000
or just retires from television and radio,

800
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,080
he's gonna be like,

801
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,000
I know I've been kind of an abrasive figure, but-

802
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,360
Somewhat polarizing.

803
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,120
But anyway, I'm about to kick off my own rat race.

804
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,840
And then he drops a full blown-

805
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,600
In my house with bats.

806
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,400
A full blown-

807
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,160
I hate all my stuff so much.

808
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,680
You know it's not in his house.

809
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,640
His house will include the first piece of the map.

810
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,360
You know what I mean?

811
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,720
Yeah, you're gonna need to look behind a portrait of him.

812
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,400
Fuck that, no, oh my God, you guys.

813
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,280
Look at every chalkboard doodle he's ever done

814
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,240
on his crazy show.

815
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,960
And if you look up in the top left corner,

816
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,360
there's a little bit of the map every time.

817
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,800
Every time.

818
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,440
It's all so obvious now.

819
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,760
It's all been waiting there for you.

820
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,600
Pirate King backyards.

821
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,920
Me, Obama's a Muslim.

822
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,880
Yarrr.

823
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,560
Yarrr.

824
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,920
You crack open the chest and it's like,

825
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,280
fuck yeah, it's full of gold coins.

826
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,720
You dig in a little bit deeper.

827
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,720
And it's full of also some socks

828
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,680
and a note that says,

829
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,320
everyone forgets about the Hussein

830
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,760
in the middle of Barack Obama's name,

831
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,280
but I think it's important.

832
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,640
Anyway, congratulations.

833
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,240
Enjoy these $150 and socks.

834
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,480
I feel like the video would talk about

835
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,680
how it's all leading you

836
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,200
to the greatest treasure imaginable

837
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,960
when you open the last chest.

838
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,200
It's just a note that has the word freedom

839
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,400
written in block letters.

840
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,080
It's like, ah fuck.

841
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,040
He's right though.

842
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,920
Is he right?

843
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,640
He's not right.

844
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,840
No, he's not right.

845
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,200
What if you open the chest

846
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,800
and it had a million dollars in it

847
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,400
or like a lot of money in it,

848
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,520
but all in pennies?

849
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,720
So like it was really full,

850
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,920
but like it's pennies.

851
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,680
Yeah, for sure, Travis.

852
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,440
What if Sahara ended

853
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,480
and Steve Zahn and McConaughey

854
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,240
and I forget who else was in that picture,

855
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,440
finds, I think maybe a Beck and Sale,

856
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,360
finds the old sunken plane full of treasure

857
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,400
and it's like, fuck yeah, guys,

858
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,560
we won, we beat all the pirates and we did it.

859
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,600
And they crack it open

860
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,480
and it's 700,000 pounds of pennies.

861
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,040
It's like, well, let's just go home

862
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,240
because like we're in the desert.

863
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,320
Nevermind.

864
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm not carrying this out.

865
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,280
The amount of money it would cost

866
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,640
to get these pennies from one place

867
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,520
to the other would cost more

868
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,400
than the pennies themselves.

869
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,760
You got us again, Glenn Beck.

870
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,320
Damn you, Pirate King.

871
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,640
Classic Glenn.

872
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,840
Do you think there's a piece of the map

873
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,800
in Glenn Beck's body?

874
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,020
Yeah.

875
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,040
Like the blue lady from Fifth Element?

876
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,440
Like a Horcrux kind of thing?

877
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,520
I was imagining more like Cheech Marin

878
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,000
in I think Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

879
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,440
You pop out that eye,

880
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,320
that fake eye.

881
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,280
What is that back there?

882
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,520
It could also be the tattooed

883
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,640
top of the dude's head.

884
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,840
Holy shit.

885
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,520
Oh, don't say it.

886
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,240
Oh, what is it?

887
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,880
Oh, Cutthroat Island.

888
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,680
Oh, whew.

889
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,920
It could also be tattooed

890
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,840
all over his body like Blindspot.

891
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,760
You always see Glenn Beck.

892
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,440
He's got a tightly buttoned up shirt

893
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,720
and his pants are always on.

894
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,480
You never see Glenn Beck without his pants on.

895
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,360
And apparently I'm the only person

896
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,480
that is weird too.

897
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,840
Because if you took those pants off,

898
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,440
Blindspot treasure map.

899
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,720
I've never seen Blindspot

900
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,160
except when John Hodgeman was on it.

901
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,960
But I think it's about one

902
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,240
with a treasure map on her body.

903
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,560
Something like that.

904
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,240
Which is also like Prison Break, right?

905
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,520
Oh God, all these shows are connected.

906
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,600
The last shot of the first episode

907
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,840
of Prison Break is a young man,

908
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,280
I believe Wentworth Miller,

909
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,480
taking off his shirt to reveal

910
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,520
that he has tattooed a map

911
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,400
of the prison on himself.

912
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,120
And that's why I said,

913
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,560
well, I won't be watching this.

914
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,040
Thank you.

915
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,160
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

916
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,920
Thanks for having me.

917
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,280
This has been a lot of fun,

918
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,560
but I think I'm gonna go ahead

919
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,520
and hop off here

920
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,040
before this train really gets moving.

921
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,960
I think I can still walk back to the station.

922
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,960
I would love if that scene happened

923
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,160
and you revealed the map

924
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,080
and one of the other prisoners was like,

925
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,280
fuck, do you think the problem was

926
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,680
we didn't know how to get around the place?

927
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,280
Like we know where those rooms are.

928
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,880
We've been in here for 20 years.

929
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,600
They give this to you in a brochure

930
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,400
when you come in.

931
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

932
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,120
It's on the wall.

933
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,400
Do you think they refer to that

934
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,000
frequently during the escape attempt?

935
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,920
Like, hey, I'm lost.

936
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,200
Whitworth, take off your shirts.

937
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,240
I can stare at your belly.

938
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,800
Remind me where the broom closet is.

939
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,480
So we're behind your nipples right now,

940
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,880
I guess.

941
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,000
Or what are your nipples?

942
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,760
And we gotta get to your other nipple.

943
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,280
We just have to get to this hole.

944
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,400
That's my belly button.

945
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,880
Fuck, that was what the whole plan hinged around.

946
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,920
That's our escape hole.

947
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,000
Into your tum-tum, damn it.

948
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,560
I think we took a left here

949
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,960
and then we took a right

950
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,320
at this art Chrome drawing

951
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,000
that says keep on trucking.

952
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,040
No, actually, that one was on there before.

953
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,960
That's not actually part of the map.

954
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,560
I should have clarified.

955
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,080
I kind of worked around that.

956
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,720
Just real quick.

957
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,320
I think we're probably winding down.

958
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,080
It seems like we're on sort of

959
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,400
the slow sunsetting of Yahoo Answers.

960
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,200
If it were up to me, we'd do it forever.

961
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,360
But I feel like Yahoo Answers is like,

962
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,480
you're going to wake up one morning

963
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,400
and it's just as quickly as Travis was verified,

964
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,080
Yahoo Answers is just going to be obliterated.

965
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,920
So I want to celebrate the good times

966
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,720
while we still have them.

967
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,280
And Brooks Oglesby sent in this Yahoo.

968
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,960
It was asked by an anonymous user,

969
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,120
which kind of defeats the point of it.

970
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,000
But this anonymous user says,

971
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,640
I'm sorry for trolling?

972
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,880
And then confesses,

973
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,440
I posted the diarrhea questions online.

974
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,760
And I realize now, it might've annoyed some people.

975
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,800
I won't do it anymore.

976
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,680
I'm really sorry.

977
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,600
That's the thing.

978
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,320
We talk, I mean, that's the thing.

979
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,560
Like we harp on people for saying some stuff

980
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,680
on Yahoo Answers.

981
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,920
And I feel like when somebody is a bigger person

982
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,200
and tries to get back on our good graces

983
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,760
and like accepts and acknowledges what they've done,

984
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,800
I feel like maybe we should recognize that as well.

985
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,400
You're right, Griffin.

986
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,360
Not enough people make amends sort of online, you know?

987
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,840
I just don't want to paint everybody on Yahoo Answers

988
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,160
with the same big dumb brush.

989
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,840
I posted the diarrhea questions on,

990
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,800
like they're owning it.

991
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,360
They own it.

992
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,760
Is the diarrhea questions capitalized like the white,

993
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,680
like is it like-

994
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,920
Like the Panama, like the Panama papers?

995
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,160
Yeah.

996
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,880
Because she tapes?

997
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:07,920
Yeah.

998
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,360
Is this a thing that everyone,

999
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,080
like when you say the diarrhea questions,

1000
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,440
you don't have to say like which ones

1001
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,640
because it's not some,

1002
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,000
it's the diarrhea questions.

1003
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,440
It's the diarrhea questions.

1004
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,920
I'm really sorry though.

1005
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Listen, if this person's listening, I pardon you.

1006
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,440
You're pardoned.

1007
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,640
I feel like the three of us would be the ones to do that.

1008
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,800
I feel like we would have the legal ability

1009
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,560
to pardon people on Yahoo Answers.

1010
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,640
I hope that we get a fucking email from Marissa or Melissa,

1011
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,160
the owner of Yahoo,

1012
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
just like giving us like a one week heads up.

1013
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,560
Like, hey boys, I know how important this product is to you.

1014
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,320
Just wanted to give you a one week head up

1015
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,720
to like record all your Yahoo's videos.

1016
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,520
Record all your Yahoo's for stockpile them.

1017
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,920
Like take shelter and stockpile your shit.

1018
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,440
Screenshot the shit out of it

1019
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,760
and then build a house out of those screenshots.

1020
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,840
I kind of feel like our regulars

1021
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,760
need to start like field stripping,

1022
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,360
like conserving them.

1023
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,800
You know, like they need to start,

1024
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,640
like have a bunker full of Yahoo's.

1025
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,920
Just pickled Yahoo's, yeah.

1026
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,400
Yeah, they can keep stored.

1027
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,240
Listen folks, that's gonna do it for us on our podcast.

1028
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,240
My brother, my brother and me, this one.

1029
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,600
The one you're listening to.

1030
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,120
The 301.

1031
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,320
301.

1032
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,640
Thanks for listening.

1033
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,880
We have a lot of fun stuff coming up.

1034
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,720
We have a couple live shows that we can't announce yet,

1035
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,760
but they're soon.

1036
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,120
When are we gonna announce them?

1037
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,680
Like next week?

1038
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,920
I think next week.

1039
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,200
That sounds about right.

1040
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,200
Yeah.

1041
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,320
That's not a subtle hint.

1042
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,440
We're not going to Canada.

1043
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:44,720
Sorry.

1044
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,760
Yeah, yeah, no.

1045
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,840
I mean, we can say where we're going, right?

1046
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,320
No.

1047
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,040
But it's good.

1048
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,080
You're gonna love it.

1049
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,920
We can't say where we're Chicago.

1050
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,880
We're not doing Chicago, sorry.

1051
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,920
We're not going Chicago.

1052
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,760
No, we're not going there.

1053
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,960
But we're gonna announce, it'll be two cities, big shows.

1054
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,560
It's gonna be a lot of fun,

1055
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,160
but it's gonna be like a quick turnaround.

1056
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,920

Oh yeah, he did that.

1074
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,240
Yeah, no, he did it.

1075
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,080
We didn't do shit about it.

1076
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,840
Well, if you do, oh, by the way, yeah,

1077
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,000

to get me verified on Twitter.

1090
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,120
I have no idea what ended up pushing it over the line,

1091
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,760
but everybody was really on board with it

1092
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,800

1098
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,960
everybody should go watch Gallivant

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,920
and then tell ABC-

1100
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,120
Jesus, all right, no, stop.

1101

1130
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,240
Okay.

1131
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,520
You can't be burning through them

1132
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,080
like you did last week.

1133
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,880
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1134
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,160
This is like a finite thing.

1135
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,440
Aaron Keys sent this one.

1136
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,000
Thanks, Aaron.

1137
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1138
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,080
They're anonymous,

1139
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,920
but they did ask this important query.

1140
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,360
Can I still vape when I have walking pneumonia?

1141
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,440
Gotta have my vape.

1142
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,360
My name's Justin McElroy.

1143
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1144
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,760
I'm Griffith McElroy.

1145
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,960
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

1146
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,760
Kiss your dad.

1147
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:42,000
Square on the lips.

1148
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,920
Maximumfun.org.

1149
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,960
Comedy and culture.

1150
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,080
Artist owned.

1151
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,200
Listener supported.

1152
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,680
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon

1153
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,360
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

1154
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,600
And he says, what do you do adventures?

1155
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,800
I'm a dragon man.

1156
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,680
I cast fire on him.

1157
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,560
It's very good.

1158
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,480
I address the red dragon to say,

1159
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,560
us, we're the hosts of the Adventure Zone,

1160
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,760
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

1161
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,880
Very good synergy.

1162
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,680
Commit to the bit.

1163
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,280
I roll to charm new listeners.

1164
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,160
It is very effective against all odds.

1165
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,120
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

1166
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,160
We host the Adventure Zones,

1167
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

1168
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,520
It's a comedy podcast.

1169
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,880
We don't take the rules too seriously

1170
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,920
because there's a lot of them

1171
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,280
and we did not take the time to learn them.

1172
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,000
Maybe listen to us.

1173
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,640
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

1174
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,360
You can find us on iTunes or on Maximumfun.org.

1175
01:02:37,360 --> 01:03:03,920
I think this promo is a critical hit.
