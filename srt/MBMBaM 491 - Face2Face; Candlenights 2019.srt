1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
the McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:15,580
Travis claims he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his wall I haven't

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:26,400
seen it. Also this podcast kind of is for kids I guess just in case you babies out

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,960
there know how cool you are for listening. What's up you cool baby!

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:17,040
Hello everybody and welcome to my show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:36,880
McElroy and I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy and I'm your sweet baby

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:48,000
brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy. Now I want to say as a

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,600
longtime Huntingtonian first off welcome to our city. What a joy it is to have you

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,840
here. I want to tell you it is a genuine honor and a pleasure to be playing here

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,520
in the beautiful and historic Keith Albee Theatre. Now you will know the Keith

11
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Albee from its storied history as the place where that it's trash gif was made.

12
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,040
Damn Justin I was gonna make that exact joke. So it's not a joke it's history

13
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,320
Travis. It's a notable feature of this building that downstairs I opened a door

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,440
and said it's trash and it became a very useful gif for a lot of people from 2016

15
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,680
on. I'm sorry for that it's a storied theater and a lot of great times here.

16
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,120
Griffin you had kind of your own adventure. Yeah fun time. Earlier today.

17
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,280
Beautiful so glad to be here. Can I tell it from my point? Sure I think it'll hit

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,240
harder if you hear it from Travis's point of view. So I got a okay this came

19
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,600
after Griffin's wife Rachel said where is Griffin? There she's known for other

20
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,820
things than being Griffin's wife. What I should say is Rachel's husband Griffin had

21
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:08,440
gone missing and she said where is my husband Griffin and Justin and I

22
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,560
simultaneously without checking said party and then five minutes later I get

23
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,100
a call from Griffin that says hey it's your brother Griffin. You may know me

24
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:28,360
from being Rachel's husband. And then he said I'm on the third floor I'm stuck in

25
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:40,800
the bathroom so first I tried to go up that set of stairs and almost ate it on

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,040
the stage in front of you all and then I learned you can only get to the third

27
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,240
floor from that set of stairs and then I reached it and I said Griffin are you

28
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,280
locked in? And he said no just stuck. The dang door got stuck. Listen folks hey it's

29
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,520
me Griffin McElroy. It was not my finest moment and the worst part is that I

30
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,760
don't only ask Travis to come help me out. So I heard the news ripple literally

31
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,400
up a flight of stairs onto a completely different section of the theater because

32
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,200
I called Travis in the basement and then I heard very quickly people on the first

33
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,080
floor saying yeah Griffin's stuck in the bathroom. You probably heard my my peals

34
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,040
of laughter my absolute delight. While I was still on the phone with Griffin I

35
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,360
looked at Justin and said he's stuck in the bathroom. Yeah it was another I

36
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,960
announced yeah I did announce it mid call. It was a good few minutes there

37
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,040
before anyone came to fetch me from the bathroom and I do want to I do want to

38
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,080
point out Griffin was not locked in just couldn't physically open the door

39
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,720
the paint the paint of the doorframe and the door had like see a bit I I did to

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,320
be fair have the shoulder jacket open. I have I I have a weak body I love this

41
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,000
theater I love this theater it does say on the signs hanging over the toilets

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,240
backstage says don't flush anything other than toilet paper to help preserve our

43
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,400
historic plumbing and I wanted to respond to this bathroom sign and say

44
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,960
this is history still in the making. I could have a I could have an important

45
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,720
chapter in the history of this toilet. History is a living document. Yes so as you

46
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,760
certainly guessed. Griffin's fine now. I spent three minutes locked in a bathroom knowing

47
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:44,920
everyone backstage knew I was in there. There was an army of carolers laughing

48
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,280
at me. To the point where three different people walked by and as I went up I heard a

49
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,760
carolers say we might as well just keep the stairs open. So as you've guessed by

50
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,200
this point it's an advice show that we do around here. It is a genuine pleasure

51
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,000
to have you all on Huntington. I've met many of you at Jolly Pirate Donuts. I met

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,280
you in line when I brought some of you Jolly Pirate Donuts. I met some of you

53
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,760
when I tried unsuccessfully to park in the parking lot outside the theater and

54
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,680
was chided by our fans so rippledly that I chickened out of parking and drove

55
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,280
away. Now J-Man we did get an audience question that said why did Justin try to

56
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,720
run me down in the parking lot? I was going very slowly and why were you in a

57
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,360
parking lot? You can still kill someone slowly. It's for cars and softly. It's for cars. It's an

58
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,840
advice show. Pleasure to be here in the historic Keith Albee theater. I am a master model builder

59
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,120
for Legoland Discovery Center. Every day I have dozens of parents that come

60
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,760
through and comment on how easy and fun my job must be. While this is true for

61
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,040
the most part I still have the deadlines and paperwork of any other office job.

62
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:21,000
Any other office job? Come on this is me Justin. There are lawyers. Yeah there's lawyers and stuff.

63
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,080
There are doctors. My question is this how do I keep their fantastical view of

64
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,280
the job alive while still preserving my fragile ego with the amount of real

65
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,680
work I do? That's from Self-Centered in Central Ohio. Are you here?

66
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:49,040
Do you have any paper made of Lego bricks you could write upon? Because

67
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,400
then they would have to watch you make the paper and then maybe a pen made out

68
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,720
of Legos and then you try to write and it doesn't work. This is a fantastic world

69
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Travis has swept us all away into. A subtle way to do it is if you just left

70
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:14,200
all around Legoland just a little bit of blood from your hands and you wouldn't

71
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,880
even make a big deal. I'm not saying you walk maybe you do walk around with

72
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,720
bandages all over your hands and you let the parents piece it together. Oh and

73
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,680
maybe like a Lego sign that says it's been zero days since our last incident.

74
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,120
Just a bunch of headless Lego dolls scattered around the park. Maybe just a

75
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,200
bin of heads and you can be like oh those we don't talk about those. This is what

76
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,520
happens when I lose focus for a second. Look at that Chewbacca. I spent all day on

77
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,960
that Chewbacca's leg fell off. Fell the heck over. And OSHA's on my... OSHA's on my

78
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:56,200
keister. Oh yeah this is a no cursing show. We're gonna do our best. OSHA's on my

79
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,520
keister. It has to happen right that something you're building collapses.

80
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,400
Maybe not all the time. Hopefully. No you are going to have to sabotage some of

81
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,380
your own creations. Something so beautiful it cannot exist. Right. Something

82
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:17,400
maybe you're making the Sistine Chapel and maybe God destroys it. God destroys

83
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,720
your Lego Chapel because it's not it's better than his chapel. Yeah and then you

84
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,080
just fall to your knees and you curse to the heavens like you do. Next thing you

85
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,920
build out. And Tom Hanks comes in and says yeah. Okay wait wait wait. Was that a

86
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,480
Da Vinci code? I'm trying to think of literally any other Tom Hanks movie that

87
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
it would be. It is but I also just assume that at this point Tom Hanks is a mouthpiece for

88
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:52,720
God. And he is also at Legoland most days. He loves them. He loves Legos. He likes the noise actually. That's the thing. It's not the

89
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:02,560
aesthetic. It's the snap noise. It's his ASMR. Hey how about a Yahoo? Yes please.

90
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,600
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles. Are you here? No. Wait. Shh. Are you here?

91
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,800
Oh maybe not. Oh man. I thought Adrian was supposed to be here. I may be putting

92
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,280
Adrian on blast and maybe Adrian doesn't want to be put on blast. Adrian are you not here? It's not good.

93
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:26,360
Okay anyway Adrian Cowles is a hero to all. It's from Yahoo Answers user Jamooka

94
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:35,520
who asks with all the milk Santa drinks where does he go when he has to go?

95
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:44,640
Obviously in the sleigh. Oh. That would be my guess is he's got a Santa's Little

96
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:55,760
Helper if you know what I mean. I don't. Viagra? Not Viagra. A bucket? That you call Santa's Little Helper?

97
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,720
A suction like kind of like the mass that drops down on an airplane but he's

98
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,600
got a tube. He's got a tube in there. He's got a tube in there and he just

99
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,720
pees into it and then it fills up a pouch. Just one? Because it's a lot of

100
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:22,760
milk. It's a lot of pouches and they're. The sleigh is most it's 10% presents 90%

101
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,720
Santa pee pouches. Griffin have you seen that thing that you attach to a spigot

102
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,800
and it fills up a bunch of water balloons at once? Yes. It's like that and

103
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,160
then he dumps them in to the ocean. Okay Santa has been studying with Sting and

104
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,840
just at the end of once a night. Oh wow Travis has just introduced a

105
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,720
fascinating new concept into my life which is how long can sting go without

106
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:57,960
having to drain the main vein as they say. Okay if Santa had to stop every time. I'm just

107
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,480
realizing that as Sting gets older he will be able to have tangerine sex

108
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,920
without. Hold on one second. Nutting.

109
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:19,400
It's on the line for more and more time but have to go to the bathroom more and

110
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:26,040
more frequently. So he will have to. Listen I'm not gonna you know. I don't

111
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,440
want you to think. I don't want you to think that I'm gonna you know. I just

112
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,040
gotta you know. The other one that comes out. The make some of the. I'm gonna keep my

113
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,160
lapel mic on. I gotta make some of the fields of gold if you know what I'm

114
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,840
saying. I will not. And then I was going to say the c-word but I think that's I will not nut.

115
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Little Gordon's gotta. Yeah I want to move away from. No. This region.

116
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,400
Impossible. I'm just saying that if Santa had to stop yeah every let's even say

117
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,360
one hour two hour to relieve himself. That's a lot of time lost. I think he has

118
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,920
to make it to the end of the night. And then. A two hour long. Crazy. Okay you know what.

119
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,120
Here's the only thing that makes sense. Alright okay. That's a thousand. Okay

120
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,960
that's that's a quarter in the swear jar and I'm sorry.

121
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,960
The only. Also this whole conversation I forgot we had an ASL ASL interpreter.

122
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:39,360
And I'm sorry for that. I am so sorry for you and you and us. So anyway the only

123
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,600
thing that makes sense is that Santa's peeing in your house and he's doing it

124
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,520
while he's eating the cookies. It's the only time. The time lost. The time lost.

125
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:57,120
His pee lost. Neck neutral. He's taking the cookies into the bathroom. He's urinating.

126
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,040
He's eating the cookies and drinking the milk. Ouroboros the snake eat its own tail.

127
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:16,000
The cycle continues ad infinitum. Unless. Unless. Santa Claus is just always going

128
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:30,320
a little bit. ABP. Just a little bit. That's what they don't tell you in the

129
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,160
Santa Claus film. Says here no matter what my beard grows back all the time

130
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,920
because I killed a man and that's my eternal punishment and I'm always kind

131
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,800
of peeing sort of. That's the thing you see only eats and drinks one night of

132
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,920
the year and then pees a little bit for the next 364 days. I have another question here

133
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,560
and I'm sure you're all relieved to hear that. Not literally relieved. I'm a zoo

134
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,600
keeper at a small zoo in West Virginia humblebrag. Sometimes people who come to

135
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,080
the zoo think that some of our animals are fake. Alligator, Burmese python, etc.

136
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Those are some animals. They usually ask me if they are real because they don't

137
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,520
move around a lot. I respond with a yes but even then they aren't convinced. What

138
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,120
are some ways I can absolutely convince them these guests that our animals are

139
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,960
real. That's from real wild and real wonderful animal keeper. Are you here?

140
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:38,200
Hello. Hello. To be fair some of those people also think they're dead. Are those

141
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:48,200
real and also alive? Because I'm a zoo cop. That is fair. I'm a bad zoo man. I've taken

142
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,880
my three-year-old to a lot of zoos too and most of the time when she sees any

143
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,080
animal even an active animal she's like is that real because there are

144
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,400
animatronics and holograms now it's hard to know let alone like an alligator

145
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,160
who's just sitting there. If we're being honest the alligator isn't bringing a

146
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,600
lot to the table. Yeah, alligators are whack. That's a deepfake puma. That's not a real...

147
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:24,640
I think the way you can get around this especially with the alligator and

148
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:33,440
especially with the Burmese python is to open the door and just say go on in. Now

149
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,240
wait Griffin okay. Maybe it's real maybe it isn't. Are you brave enough to find

150
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,720
out? Okay it's not an escape room Griffin. Let's see you put up or shut up if

151
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,200
these are real or not. If they're real you're gonna be real dead. Hey Griffin

152
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,040
you know a zookeeper is not mostly there to protect the animals right? Listen they

153
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,880
are if you ask me. Here's the other thing. How many times do you think a

154
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,240
professional zookeeper gets to say the phrase go on in then before they lose

155
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,440
their job and charges are pressed against them? Like once right? It's just

156
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,640
the one. Hold on if that is if that is started with did you sign the waiver go

157
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,520
on in. Because there are things where you can go in and meet penguins and sometimes

158
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:30,680
penguins are having a real bad day. But the kids will see. The kids will see. The

159
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,160
blood. The kids will see the blood as the beautiful beautiful python eats the

160
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,440
disbelieving grandma. And then the kids will go I've learned a lot about

161
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,880
humanity. This is an educational zoo thank you for bringing me. I've learned about snake-anity today. Oh that's one thing you

162
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,320
do is you could put a fake python in the python zone but have like a human

163
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:58,040
outline sort of inside of the fake python and then be like go on in then.

164
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:05,400
That guy thought the pythons were fake. Look how he fared. Not good it seems. How

165
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,800
about a yahoo? I'd love that Griffin. Thank you. A lot of people sent this one in.

166
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:17,600
It's from an anonymous yahoo answers user who is I'm going to call Torbance

167
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,680
asks Torbance asks what happened if the cops are arresting someone on December

168
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:32,440
23 and it hits midnight on Christmas Eve will they stop as they close Christmas?

169
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,760
So the premise is you're free to go shoot we're close Christmas. But more

170
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,360
than okay if they meant every word of that intentionally what it is saying is

171
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,120
oh we've hit midnight it's now the 24th and this paperwork will take us at least

172
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,760
24 hours. No they're closed for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Why do you want them to work all the time?

173
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,920
Come on. Let them have a good time with their families. When are they going to leave cookies out for dinner?

174
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,920
That's fair. You're right you've got oh you did murder eight people but I gotta get

175
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:20,920
home and put that goose on the stove. It's okay I can't murder on Christmas Eve anyway.

176
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:28,360
Good night coppers. I'll be back on Boxing Day when I'm putting all those people in boxes.

177
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:37,000
Sorry fellas it's December 24th there's Santa's problem now.

178
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,400
What I'm suggesting is this he knows when you've been sleeping he knows if you're awake

179
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:56,280
he knows if you did larceny so he's the cops now and I'm saying December 24th and 25th Santa's

180
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,920
out there he sees everything that's happening Santa can be cops on those days. That is why no murder has

181
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,640
ever happened on the 24th or 25th. I'm not saying it doesn't happen I'm just saying they don't get toys

182
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,760
which is I think we can all agree the worst punishment worst thing that can happen.

183
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:21,080
There has to be a third list yes if Santa's cops for two days. Oh so naughty nice death penalty.

184
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:34,280
Naughty nice list naughty list slay. Slay's pretty good. Nice list naughty list naughty list special

185
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:47,640
victims unit. When him and his partner Christopher Maloney go out I would watch that show.

186
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,720
I would watch that show. I don't have anything else Santa's cops for two days.

187
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,840
Santa's cops that's where we're at. Santa's cops for two days. Should we move on to another question?

188
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,880
I have a segment. Oh no.

189
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,400
So I have a segment you might not have heard it yet it is a newer segment. Oh this one's good okay.

190
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:21,880
Bum bum bum bum reach for the stars. In this segment I'm going to read some reviews from

191
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,760
Amazon and Justin and Griffin have to guess what the product is. Now this this is only two. This

192
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,600
is only two reviews. I've got three different products here. This is a short one. Okay.

193
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,280
This is a three-star review out of five. The subject line is short-lived.

194
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,040
I love this guy but sadly I got him out for a second season and he no longer works. Wish he

195
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,000
would have lasted longer and also I've never mentioned this before but one person found this

196
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,560
helpful. Okay I'm gonna say it is a Christmas themed Big Mouth Billy Bass. Okay.

197
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:15,960
Christmas sprinkler. Okay this one might give it away. This is from Roger. This is the five-star

198
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:25,720
review. For my granddaughter she loves it. He can really twerk. Is it a twerking Santa

199
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,680
Trout? Yes it is a twerking Santa. Yes it is a twerking Santa Justin. That poor first person.

200
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,920
I know. What is this broken twerking Santa look at this poor low energy.

201
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:52,760
Wouldn't wouldn't you have given anything to be in the room when this old man stares down

202
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,880
at his Santa and says dang thing's supposed to be twerking. Hey hey watch I'm gonna plug him in watch

203
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:10,120
this. Oh oh man I thought he'd twerk. You can do it put your back into it. Okay so these next two

204
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:18,520
the last two uh there's a theme these are both Christmas movies. Okay. This is a one-star review

205
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:29,320
with the subject line heartwarming but strange. If you have a taste for the strange this is the

206
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,800
Christmas movie for you. Bad in every way but we were able to watch it to the end.

207
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,920
Congratulations that's great. Uh I'm gonna say jingle all the way to starring Larry the Cable

208
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,960
starring Larry the Cable Call. Uh National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Incorrect.

209
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,760
Two. Nope. Eddie's Island Getaway. This subject line one star review subject line

210
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,840
Spartan helmets don't float.

211
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:12,920
And the rest of it is and also everything else was just hot garbage as well.

212
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,880
Do you want me to read it again? Is it is it um 300 Crazy Nights?

213
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,840
That's funnier than anything I was gonna say. Okay this is a three-star review. The subject line

214
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:41,480
is so dumb. I watched this to the end because I was hoping it would get better but it never did.

215
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:49,080
I gave it three because tween girls would probably love it. So this is one film that tween girls

216
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:56,680
would probably love and Spartan helmets don't float. And it's what was the first one it's they

217
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,320
hated it but they did. Yeah heartwarming but strange. Heartwarming but strange.

218
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,240
It's a wonderful life.

219
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:15,400
National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 3. That's what I made up. That's gonna be a mermaid for

220
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:26,680
Christmas. A mermaid for Christmas? Okay now this these these reviews make me so happy. All right.

221
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,040
Subject line soft porn.

222
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:40,760
One star. This has been advertised as a classic Christmas movie. We sat down to watch it with our

223
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:48,680
teen-aged grandchild. I ignored the r-rating thinking it must be incorrect. It was not.

224
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:57,880
It is a piece of trash full of the most vile cursing I have heard. It is full of soft porn

225
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:06,360
showing naked adults acting out copulation. I turned it off and threw it in the garbage where

226
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:14,040
it belongs. I am not a prude but was much embarrassed to have played a part of it

227
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:20,840
for my relatives. Amazon should move it to their adults only section. Does Amazon have a

228
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:29,400
pornography section? This is a question I'm genuinely asking. Before you guys guess I just

229
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:37,800
have to keep reading them because it goes on and on. It is the bad Santa. Is it the bad Santa?

230
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,600
This is a one-star review. Subject line nudity shocking.

231
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,760
Was shocked by the nudity.

232
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:57,880
Inappropriate for viewing. Will need to only watch the edited version on TV.

233
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,960
The rest of the content has a great positive message about the holiday. This is a one-star

234
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,040
review and the subject line is one star. Should be x-rated. Went in the trash.

235
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:19,160
One-star review. This is not a family Christmas movie. Would not have rented this movie if I had

236
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:26,280
seen the R rating. Filthy language innuendo. Not suitable to be listed as a Christmas movie.

237
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,320
Very disappointed that I cannot get a refund. I rent a lot of movies.

238
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:40,040
I rent a lot of movies. Okay one more. One-star review. Yuck.

239
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:49,640
Seriously this movie is one creepy situation after another. Sleazy unprofessional work

240
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,760
relationships. Old men and young women. Very bizarre fake sex on a movie set.

241
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,080
Okay this movie does not age well. It's a wonderful life.

242
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,920
Do y'all know what it is? Because I haven't. Justin guess. I don't know. It's Love Actually.

243
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,080
Yuck.

244
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,720
Now I have not. Oh no we wore out the first interpreter.

245
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:33,960
Was it all the yelling? Yes. The hand movements had to be bigger. Okay. Now I've never seen

246
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,000
Love Actually. How close did I approximate it? The summer camp I work for holds an annual ravioli

247
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
eating contest among the staff. I have been whiplash from what Travis just did to the first

248
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,360
thing you just said. I have been dubbed the ravioli champion as I have won for the past

249
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,480
five years due to some changes in my health. I'm okay. I just gotta eat better. Yeah. Yeah. We all

250
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:08,360
do. Time passes. Yeah but also you're the ravioli champion so I assume you do indeed have to eat

251
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,080
better. I've come to the conclusion that. My one defining feature is I consume a lot of ravioli.

252
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,280
Anyways I have some health concerns. I've come to the conclusion that I won't be able to

253
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,160
participate next year. When I tried to tell my co-workers this they all thought I was joking.

254
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,280
They even got me a certificate framed and all to hang on my wall for my past achievements

255
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,400
engorging myself on pasta. Brothers how do I resist the peer pressure to eat a ridiculous

256
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,920
amount of ravioli and remain a champion. That's from stuffed in Scotch Plains New Jersey are you

257
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:51,080
here. That's a ravioli king if I've ever. You know the one thing I do have to say before we begin

258
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:58,520
with the great goofs and spoofs a ravioli eating competition. Is this a common thing that I'm just

259
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,800
not plugged into. No no here's what I will say because I edited this question down for time

260
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,680
but there was a line in it where they said that there was a restaurant in the town of the summer

261
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:15,400
camp that had an all you could eat ravioli night. Okay which in and of itself seems like it should

262
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:24,280
be shut down by the CDC. Yeah ravioli is not a type of food that I think I could stomach infinite

263
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,880
of. No ravioli is not the type of food where I eat a heaping helping and I say I could eat

264
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,160
three to four more heaping helpings of ravioli please. It actually seems like you could like

265
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,560
set up a weird drinking style game but ravioli game where you set up a chess board with different

266
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,160
ravioli squares and if you land on one the other person have to eat it and they die. That's a fun

267
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:57,080
game that you just invented. Thank you. I think I think you have to participate. Wait cool let me

268
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:06,840
finish. You can't be ravioli champion and then just bow out and not let people take a shot at

269
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,560
the master of ravioli at the ravioli champion right. They gotta have a shot at the crown.

270
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,640
What you gotta do is go in and I'm sorry eat a tasteful amount of ravioli.

271
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:29,400
Just a regular healthy portion of ravioli. You know six. Yeah it's six. You're no longer able to

272
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,520
compete at the maximum level and it's fair for you to bow out but honestly you do have to lose.

273
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:42,200
I think you should have to lose. Now here's what I will say bet against yourself. Okay take a fall.

274
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,920
Yeah now you're the ravioli champion there is a certificate in your cubicle or whatever.

275
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,400
Put a large amount of money against yourself. Is there a danger Travis? Is there a danger that you

276
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,600
won't make it into the ravioli hall of fame? No that they'll start eating the ravioli and then

277
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:12,760
well I do love this wonderful stuff. Oh don't get that ravioli madness. I do have the fire of

278
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,760
competition in my belly and I do have the plaque and all. That's always a risk Justin. I guess I

279
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:26,840
should go ahead and pound more ravioli. I'm worried about that. It might happen. And then

280
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,160
that stinks because you die of ravioli poisoning and also you lost your dang money is the other

281
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:40,440
thing that you bet against yourself. You may eat what you think is a normal amount of ravioli

282
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,400
make it to the end and they're like you won by a lot and you look at everybody else like what's

283
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:52,440
wrong with you all? This stuff is amazing. That is a good question. Have you often won by two

284
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:59,400
or three times as much as everyone else? Because it might just be when you've eaten one more than

285
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:11,000
the next person. Stop. I'm just now realizing I'm really hungry for ravioli. I know right?

286
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,000
I could go for some ravioli right now. I need to be the devil's advocate here and say

287
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,640
don't enter the ravioli competition. Follow your instincts. Griffin's right. Don't enter the ravioli

288
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:34,680
competition. Let someone win then challenge them. It's the second movie. You train someone to win.

289
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:41,800
That's ravioli one. Then you're coming back for ravioli two to beat the person you trained because

290
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,400
they got pretty cocky and you need to show them what a real ravioli champ looks like. It's like in

291
00:33:47,400 --> 00:34:05,160
Rocky 2 ravioli three yeah someone else eats your friend. Yes it would be like if in Rocky 2 Rocky's

292
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:13,160
doctor was like hey your cholesterol is crazy. You can't just keep drinking eggs out of a pitcher.

293
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:20,520
All you have to do is stop eating. No one's paying you to eat eggs. I'm the best egg eater.

294
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,960
That's not it Rocky. That's nothing. The movie's not about you being a good egg eater. Then what's

295
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:33,160
it about? You could just have some celery. You burn more calories eating. I want to eat eggs.

296
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:51,000
But I'm the egg eater. Did you say egg-rian out loud? I did. That's fun. It just came across my...

297
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,760
What if just slowly behind that hut a doll rose up?

298
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:06,120

Jess McRoy. Haunted doll Jody sad paranormal doll story on Jody. I just got her last weekend along

308
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,120
with many other dolls but I have a few dolls that are getting upset that there are so many in my

309
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:22,120
home now. That will happen. Hey Jody is it the dolls or is it your niece Vicky? Are the dolls upset or

310
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,600
does Vicky say you need to clean this house or I'm moving out? Oh I thought you said that the dolls

311
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:33,240
didn't like Vicky. I have a few other dolls getting upset. There's so many in my home now. With this

312
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:41,160
being said I work with all my dolls and many of them have many stories to tell. Expect this little

313
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:52,840
doll. That's just what it says. It says expect this little doll. Expect it. I will deliver. Jody is

314
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,800
near five inches tall. She is old and she was found when my son and I did a paranormal investigation

315
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:07,720
on a private property that was abandoned. Private property. So you looted. You robbed. I think a private

316
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,120
property that is abandoned is a public property right? I still think it's right. No one was in the

317
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:20,280
house when we broke in. Yeah to look for haunted dolls. Along with her there was many other dolls

318
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,240
that I had found. The owner said I could have the dolls. Wait hold on. Hold on. I don't believe you.

319
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:33,480
It was a private property that was abandoned and you said hey can we loot your house and they were

320
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,400
like take whatever. Yeah you don't want me to loot. Stay perfectly quiet. They told me by how

321
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:46,600
asleep they were. The owner said I could have the dolls. They have been there for such a long time

322
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,760
and he never really bothered with them. So after bringing these dolls into my home I decided to try

323
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,840
to work with this one first doing a spirit box on this doll. Yeah. I can't really get clear answers

324
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:06,040
from this doll other than her name is Jody. She won't give me an age but she says she's very sad

325
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:16,360
and she was locked away too long. I don't feel she is bad just sad. That sounds like you apologizing

326
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:23,480
for a friend that none of your other friends like. Yeah. They're not bad. They're just

327
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,920
sad. So I don't have time right now. He's just hungry. I don't have time right now to keep trying

328
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:40,680
to get answers from her. I'm busy. So why are you getting rid of your dog? I just can't with Jody

329
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:48,040
anymore. Woof. This doll would be great if you have time to talk to her and maybe get the answers

330
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:57,640
yourself. So if you work for yourself from home adopt Jody. I do feel sad when I hold her. I must

331
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,680
have this doll. I would love to have something to blame my sadness on. Griffin why are you so sad

332
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:13,720
all the time? I don't know but I'm holding this doll. I cannot guarantee your doll will quote

333
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:21,080
perform for you. These are real individuals that lived real lives and are worthy of respect.

334
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,200
None of those three things are true. They may take a bit of time to warm up to you or they may

335
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,240
show themselves to you right away or they might just be an empty doll. Please do not adopt a

336
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,920
haunted object with no intent of offering them attention. They're like a Tamagotchi folks. You

337
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:48,360
have to take care of them or communication. They're human beings. They're not though.

338
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,960
Even if they're ghosts they're ghosts. They don't need to eat or sleep or drink or anything.

339
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:03,880
They're human beings not party tricks or meant to just sit on a shelf. So you want don't expect

340
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:11,400
them to do tricks but don't not expect them to do tricks either. Have them do some tricks.

341
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,280
An adoption to be taken seriously particularly with children that need a motherly touch.

342
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:25,080
Wait whoa hey big joke. That sentence is a journey.

343
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,240
English was not meant to convey this level of information

344
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:37,000
with just a scant few words but suddenly this person's entire world has been opened up to.

345
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,880
Come walk in the door of those 10 words and see their entire existence laid bare.

346
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,600
If you have any questions feel free to ask. Oh I have questions. What was the last thing you just

347
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,760
said all about? Jump back 10 words one more again. Due to eBay rules I must pose this.

348
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,760
All paranormal dolls and stories are for entertainment purposes but I'll let you be the

349
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:10,600
judge of that. If you have any questions feel free to ask me. All caps. I will be listing many more.

350
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,640
The end. That's Haunted Doll Watch. Do you think when they list in the thing like this is for

351
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,360
entertainment purposes only but I'll let you be the judge of that. eBay like contacts them like

352
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:29,960
hey you can't. You can't actually say psych at the end. It's like a rule. We asked you not to do

353
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,720
like it's like if we said you can't sell weed and like this is a weed but it is. It is weed.

354
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:42,040
It's not weed but it's green and when you burn it it gets you high. Great. All right we can do

355
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,360
audience questions. We have some sent in by you all. If we can get house lights turned on. No

356
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,360
listen there were no seat numbers so we have like names we'll do first initial and if there's any

357
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,800
confusion all right first. We're gonna say the first initial of a first name. I meant the first

358
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,480
initial of the last name. All bees rust the stage. Yes. All bees. So we have a microphone right here

365
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:56,280
question about some bones. All right. What's the deal with these bones? We're gonna need more house

366
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,360
lights because weirdly you're illuminating everybody but the people standing at the

367
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:06,120
microphones. That may be all we got to work with. It's a historic theater. Okay friend over. Hey

370
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,720
it's kind of working. Hello over here. Hi. Hi. If you're directly in front of the person we probably

371
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,400
don't need to do that. Okay go on. Um okay so my grandmother. Oh what's your sorry what's your name?

372
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,120
Oh yeah sorry hi I'm Maddie. Hi Maddie. Thank you Maddie. Yes if you want to give your pronouns that

373
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:39,880
would be very helpful. Thank you. So my grandmother is in the hospital and she like went to the

374
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,640
hospital like three days ago and so we were like oh no she is not going to be out for Christmas.

375
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,080
Um but my grandmother. Turn it around. Come on. Yeah I'm bringing it around. You got this. You can do it. I believe in you.

376
00:43:53,080 --> 00:44:01,160
My grandmother is an old Irish woman who is um resilient so shall we say. You already said old

377
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:09,000
Irish woman. Yeah so um she texted my cousins and I in our group chat and asked if we could throw

378
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:20,840
a Christmas rager in her hospital room. Okay. Yeah. I cursed. I'm sorry. And so I just want to know the best

379
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,880
way to pull this off uh without getting us or grandma kicked out of the hospital. Kicked out of the

380
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:33,560
hospital. I don't know. Wait hold on. Can they kick people out of hospitals for that? Hey you are too

381
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:41,720
cool. Get out of here. Francis Ford is pretty wild. Uh yeah they can kick you right out of hospital

382
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,840
Travis. You're not granted diplomatic immunity because you're inside of a hospital. But I it's

383
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:53,160
hard to make sure the dean of the hospital. You don't understand. Hospital official she's sick.

384
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:00,520
Okay and she wants to have a party. There we go. There's some more lights. Uh yeah um you're gonna

385
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:13,960
need some IV bags full of vodka. Or gin. Yeah or White Claw. Or Bloody Mary. Probably not the Bloody

386
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,000
Mary. Probably not the Bloody Mary. It looks like blood. That would be fun. You're right that would be fun

387
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,120
Trav. Yeah that you're right Trav. Don't no don't put it in your arm. Don't put any of them in your

388
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,360
arm. Oh my gosh. Listen do everybody got they got the hospital booties? Get a little like old-time

389
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,240
rock and roll like slide like dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. That's good. Like in risky business and you slide

390
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:44,760
around. Little cups of jello shots. Okay that's good. I mean listen they hospital gowns don't have

391
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,480
hospital gowns don't have backs. You're halfway to a party already. Okay. I've been to a lot of

392
00:45:51,480 --> 00:46:01,160
parties. Rarely do they feature open butt cracks. Maybe I'm going to the wrong parties. Is there a

393
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:07,080
way and I'll just base this on some of my like party expertise. Is there a way that there could

394
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,040
be a comfortable couch in an entirely different room and a cat that you can just kind of hang out

395
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:20,840
where where maybe Mario party is happening? Yeah. So last time she got sick I did sneak my cat into

396
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:26,280
the hospital. All right so my you would you say that my idea has been the only good one so far?

397
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,320
I don't know those little jello the little jello cup shots that's a pretty good one too. So you're

398
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:39,640
saying that we've helped? You guys have yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Is this close enough to the mic?

399
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:46,520
If we could get some more cell phone lines over here. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh yeah. You all rule. Thank

400
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,720
you guys so much. I like the people over here holding up their phones. Thank you. Thank you.

401
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,880
Hello. Very sweet. Hello I am Christy. Hi Christy. So for my birthday yesterday I got tickets to

402
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,960
come here. I was very excited. Oh that's so nice. Is the person standing with you with you? Yes this

403
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,120
is my little sister. She's here for emotional support because I'm just so excited right now.

404
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:15,160
Well all of the under lighting didn't help with Travis's sort of presumption. That was not a

405
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:22,920
criticism of everybody's lighting job. Yeah I saw you all reach up higher. We'll get an angle. You're too

406
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,520
sweet. Okay. Yeah so on my way here I was really excited and we were listening to Taz. But now

407
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,960
you're disappointed. No I was just swept away by the tapestry that I didn't realize I was

408
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,880
speeding a little bit. Oh no. The adventure Zane does have that effect on you. What would Zane do?

409
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:49,000
I got pulled over for my first time on the way here. Oh no. By a West Virginia police officer?

410
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,920
No by Ohio. That's why. I'm sorry. Hey listen here's a non-joke. As you're going home tonight

411
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:07,240
don't speed in Ohio. Yeah you will watch the speed limit go like 55-60, 55-60, 55-60.

412
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:14,520
There's real laws over there. Over here in West Virginia there is no law about the number of

413
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:21,400
people riding in the back of a pickup truck. Where in Ohio that number is zero. In West Virginia

414
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:28,360
this is true. The open container law is it has to be out of the reach of the driver.

415
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:36,600
So you you as the driver could just sort of play t-rex and just be like.

416
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,080
Anyway tragic we should have this honestly this one's on us we should have warned you. The first

417
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:54,520
time I ever got pulled over was in Ohio. Wait wait wait what's your question? So um my little

418
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,000
sister's in the car I was freaking out and then I was. Blame it on her. My parents paid for the

419
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,240
tickets to come here how do I get them to pay for the ticket for Christmas? Okay so the first time

420
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,880
I ever got a speeding ticket I was going 15 miles over the speed limit. That's what happened today.

421
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,360
That's what I did today. That's what you did today? Yes and the officer who brought me over said I'm

422
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:22,120
going to list it as being nine miles because if it's 10 or more it's reckless endangerment. This

423
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:28,600
guy was not as nice. They said what? He was not as nice and caught me. Oh okay so then I as they

424
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,920
were writing the ticket I called my father Clint McRoy and I told him what happened and he goes

425
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:41,640
can you talk about of it all the way and I said dad I feel like he's already being pretty nice

426
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:51,400
and dad said come on and I refused to try to talk the police officer out of it to the disappointment

427
00:49:51,400 --> 00:50:01,720
of my father. Can you get our father to guilt you in the past? No probably not. This is also. Where

428
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:09,000
are you from? Columbus. Oh you should have known then. Okay so my advice is gonna be don't go to

429
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,240
Ohio anymore and you're fine. That's a real city. That's a real city you should know about cops.

430
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,280
Maybe talk to some police here and see if they get because one time another story about my dad

431
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:31,400
I got a ticket for expired uh like stickers on my license plate and I had to go to uh city hall

432
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:42,600
and talk to someone and my dad said and in this tone of voice ask them if they know who we are.

433
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:51,000
He didn't mean podcast luminaries to be fair. And I did and they did and it was fine.

434
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:02,680
Wait it worked? Yeah. Oh that's what's wrong with America. So maybe try that. Has your dad been on

435
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:09,000
radio for 40 years? Is that an option? No. If not you tell him he was they don't know it's radio.

436
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:19,640
Listen. Yes. Are your parents cool? Pretty much cool yeah. Do they listen to the show? No but

441
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,400

Wait did that help? Wait I know it did. Yeah absolutely thank you. This is so beautiful hello. Hi

451
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,840
um I'm Charlie. Hi Charlie. It's a great name. Can you angle the microphone up just a little bit?

452
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:07,400
That's fine no worries. Jesus. And apologies in advance if like um something doesn't make sense

453
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:16,440
I just got back from wisdom teeth surgery so. Whoa hey everyone grab the armrests go on. Okay um

454
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:26,760
so I live on on a farm and my stepmom hikes a lot and um she's gotten this hobby of collecting bones.

455
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:33,960
Oh a bone collector. Yeah like the documentary. Yeah they're pretty much everywhere in our house

456
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,280
like um our house is decorated in um uh they're scattered throughout the yard because our dogs

457
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:52,680
get them too. Oh it's a family affair. Are you here to turn her in? Um maybe um I there's also piles

458
00:53:52,680 --> 00:54:04,760
of them on the front porch. Bone piles. Yeah um and as one might see in Castlevania. Yeah um they've

459
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,880
been there for about three years now I asked her once why and she said she was bleaching them but

460
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:17,320
I feel like after three years they should be bleached. Hey and also that's not a good answer

461
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:25,000
for why you have bones. That's as if somebody said why you know the only reason to say why I have

462
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:34,600
bones so I can stand up and move my arms and eat food. Um but I mean basically my question is how

463
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:41,240
can I get her to take the bones off the porch at least. Well here's the good news if you steal them

464
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:50,200
um what's she gonna do? Call the police? Good luck with that call. Hey is this the police?

465
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:58,920
Someone stole my bone. You should make a you should make a bone pit but work real hard on it

466
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:05,240
and paint it and stuff with good colors. Put that on YouTube. Put up a fun sign and be like I spent

467
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:11,400
all day making you a bone pit you're not gonna move them to the bone pit? I made this for you.

468
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,520
And then it's kind of a guilt thing that works that works on me. And maybe start signs like 50

469
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,400
miles out like don't miss the bone pit. Don't miss the bone pit it's a tourist attraction I made it.

470
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,480
What else is she saving them for if not for people to see them because if she doesn't want

471
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,400
people to see them she killed those things. Well I would assume she does want people to see them

472
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,480
because they're like all over our house and she's not exactly hiding them on the porch there just

473
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:46,120
have piles next to the door. When no one's coming you have to get the word out. Okay. If in the Texas

474
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:54,600
Chainsaw Massacre. The documentary. The documentary. If the teens had rolled up to the house and there

475
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:03,560
had been an affable guide who was like look at all my great bones. I don't think the bones would

476
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:11,160
be very scary. Sure. I think we're all putting a lot of stigma on these bones. So what Griffin is

477
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:18,120
saying is it's not a problem at all. Apparently it's not a problem. The problem is branding.

478
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:28,680
Yes. Yes. So maybe if you got on board with it. Maybe the problem is with you. If you petition

479
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:38,840
the Department of Transportation to put up an official sign on the highway advertising the bone

480
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:50,280
zone. Now it's fun. Now it's a money maker. Hello. Does that help? Yes it does. Thank you so much.

481
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,560
I need I need my fireflies. We're gonna help you extremely quickly because we're running out of

482
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:16,840
time. Hi. I appreciate it a lot. I'm Logan. She her. So I like getting gifts that I know that

483
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:22,920
people are going to use and that people can like use like over time and stuff. So would it be like

484
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:29,480
entirely too inappropriate to get my roommate cleaning supplies for Christmas?

485
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:40,120
There. Logan. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. 10 seconds. Why is it a good idea to do this thing? Because

486
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:46,360
I feel like it could save a lot of time. You know busy people. Hey Logan is there any sort of

487
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:54,200
little bit of like a kind of slight hint of maybe you could use these around the house? Well anyone

488
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:04,600
could. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Is there maybe like are these maybe like shade brand? Like you're kind of

489
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,920
throwing a little bit. So I was thinking of like those like I don't know. Okay. So those litter

490
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,000
boxes that I've seen online for years that are like the there's like a top layer that you can

491
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,720
like like sit it out and then just like toss it. Logan they don't do it do they? They don't clean

492
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:31,080
it out very much do they? Logan. Okay that might cut out. Thank you so much Logan. Thank you.

493
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:40,760
Logan. Logan. Do it. Just do it. It'll be weird for a while but they might appreciate. At least

494
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:48,920
you're given the greatest gift which is a story of why they moved out. Does that help? It does.

495
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:55,080
Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay you can go ahead and lower the house lights down. Thank you. Thank

496
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:05,320
you so much. Oh that's brighter. The other way. Grab the knob. Okay. Yeah. So I have this is so

497
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:13,400
cool. I'm really excited. So tonight's event is a a benefit. This is the sad part of the show is

498
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:22,680
we're going to tell you don't make any money. And there's. I lost money on this show because I bought

499
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:29,960
this sweater. There's so many and it seemed like a good idea but then there are so many of you here

500
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,600
that it started to feel a little bit like hubris. The good part of that though is that tonight's

501
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:41,720
event is a fundraiser for Harmony House which seeks to help non-sheltered people in our community.

502
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,480
Are there any reps from Harmony House here? Any Harmony House folks in the audience?

503
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:53,880
Hey. Thank you. So I've got some good news for y'all.

504
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,560
Actually Harmony House folks do you want to stand up so everybody can give you another round of

505
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:12,440
applause because you do amazing work? Okay. So we have friends at a company called Me Undies and I

506
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:19,400
know that underwear is always a need for y'all. Our good friends at Me Undies have donated 200

507
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:26,520
pairs of underwear. They have sent to. Well it's in a box at my house but when Sydney comes to work

508
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,800
I'll have her bring it. But so that thank you so much to Me Undies. That's super cool if they

509
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:38,680
read another round of applause for Me Undies. That's great. So here's the here's the even more

510
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:46,360
exciting news. The folks here have bought tickets. They've bought posters. They got fired by my

511
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:55,640
father-in-law. A service I received for free. They donated and not counting what everyone is going

512
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:03,080
to go out and spend on posters and what have you after this. We are going to be able to donate to

513
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:22,360
Harmony House 43,355 dollars. So that is cool. And here's the thing that I cannot stress enough.

514
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:31,480
When we say we, we mean we. Yeah all of us. It is through you all that this is done and this is what

515
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:37,960
our seventh. Hundreds. Yeah we've done a lot of candlelights in every year whether it's through

516
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:47,000
the Candlelight Show or NBNBN Angels or whatever. You all have continuously blown us away by your

517
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,320
generosity and your willingness to support our hometown and the people here who need help.

518
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:57,800
And I don't have words for it. Thank you so much. Give yourselves another big round of applause.

519
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,680
We can lower the lights now. That's great. Harmony House you all do amazing work. Thank you

All right time to wrap up.

535
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,640
Everybody come on up to the microphones. Please don't be shy. We're all family here. Nobody's

536
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:48,120
moving. Let's just start playing. Just give me like a one two three four. Nibbling on sponge cake.

537
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:57,000
Everybody. Watching the sun bake. All of the tour is covered with oil.

538
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:06,280
Strumming my six string. Now on my front porch swing.

539
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:14,760
Smell those shrimp they're beginning to boil. Bubble bubble bubble bubble. Everybody.

540
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:26,040
Whisting away again in Margaritaville. Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

541
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:36,920
Salt salt salt. Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know

542
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:46,520
it's my own dang fault. Justin take a verse. I don't know the reason

543
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,280
I stayed here all season.

544
01:04:50,280 --> 01:05:09,960
But it's a real beauty. A Mexican beauty. How it got here I haven't a clue.

545
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:18,120
Wasting away again in Margaritaville.

546
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,080
Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

547
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:35,960
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know

548
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:43,160
it's my own dang fault. Third verse I guess.

549
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:49,400
Threw out my flip-flop. There we go. Stepped on a pop top.

550
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,760
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home.

551
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:04,040
You know these words. But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render.

552
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,080
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on.

553
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Y'all know the chorus. Sing the chorus.

554
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:24,440
Wasting away again in Margaritaville. Searching for my lost shaker of salt.

555
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:35,400
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know

556
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:42,280
it's my own damn fault. One more chorus I think. Yeah one more everybody let me hear you.

557
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,960
Wasting away again in Margaritaville. Griffin drop out the guitar let's just hear it.

558
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:57,160
Searching for my lost shaker of salt. Salt salt salt.

559
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:08,920
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame but I know it's my own damn fault.

560
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:14,760
Everybody thank you so much for coming to Canada. I swear to 19. Drive home safely.

561
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:28,520
