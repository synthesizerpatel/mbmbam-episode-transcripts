1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,520
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,920
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Let me check my show notes right here. Yes,

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,560
it says I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm Griffin. I don't need show notes. I got my name from my mommy and daddy at birth,

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
and that's the one I've stuck with using, so I don't need show notes like Travis did.

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
Justin, did you have an intro? You kind of just barreled into this.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
Yeah, we had barely finished syncing up our count, and you were just like,

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,880
I don't know. What's that mean? Where are we? What's happening? Set the scene.

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm looking at the movie release calendar, and I'm just pretty excited about all the upcoming

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,040
releases we got coming to movie theaters. I mean, is this a watch watch? Are we watching?

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
It's watching for the future watches. All right. We're watching The Watchman.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,440
What's the slate look like ahead of us? I want to talk about the upcoming slate

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
in the context of this. Cool.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Will people risk getting COVID-19 to go see it? First up, War with Grandpa.

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Tell me about War with Grandpa. Wait, can I guess? I'm just going to guess.

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Is Johnny Knoxville in it? No. No, you're thinking of Bad Grandpa.

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
This is not a sequel. Although, if I'm going to go to war with a grandpa,

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
it's going to be a bad one. Yeah, right? I'd feel terrible going

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,640
to war with a nice grandpa. Is this in the Focker's verse?

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,800
Oh, good question. Robert De Niro is Ed.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,440
He did one with that Zac Efron, right? Where he was a bad grandpa.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes, but in this one, he's a bad grandpa who's going to war with, let's see,

27
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
the tagline for this one is old school versus new cool.

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
And there's a boy. Say it again.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,760
Old school versus new cool. Oh, fuck yeah.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,640
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure, I realize they're different movies in reality,

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
but I'm pretty sure that could also have been the tagline

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,280
for the Robert De Niro Zac Efron movie. Or Grumpy Old Men, or Grumpier Old Men,

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800
or Road Dogs. Or Meet the Fockers.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Was Focker especially cool? You could use it for Fockers.

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,160
You could use it for Camp Nowhere. You could use it.

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,360
Here's the thing, because I'm so glad this tagline's out there,

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
enticing people with this fucking Pied Piper siren song

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,120
into these COVID filled theaters, that they finally popularized the phrase

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,160
new cool. I'm saying that on the regular.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm always saying like, oh, did you check out this guy on Instagram,

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
his board shorts? That's the new cool, baby.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,960
What happened to Robert De Niro? Do you think that he went from like,

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
you know, in Oscar winning movies, and I assume he has won an Oscar,

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't know for sure, to then just like, from now on,

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm going to play the grandpa. I'm just going to play,

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,960
but not even the grandpa in Oscar contender movies,

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,000
but I'm going to play him in like college comedies,

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
where maybe there's like a spring break scene, or the whole movie spring break.

49
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
That's me. That's Robert De Niro now.

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
None of what you're saying makes any difference whatsoever,

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
because I'm going to talk about Oaks Fegley.

52
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,920
What? Oaks Fegley,

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm not even sure what that is. Oaks Fegley.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,400
Is that the name of a movie or a person or a place?

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,040
Oaks Fegley is going to war with grandpa.

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
Wait, it's a person?

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,160
You may remember him from some previous rules.

58
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,080
Like Boy, Paul, Young Brian, Pete, Ben.

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,120
I love Young Brian.

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,400
Young Brian's funny.

61
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm literally just reading, this is his credits.

62
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,680
You ready? This is just names.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,920
Boy, Michael, Paul, Young Judd, Young Elias Thompson,

64
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Young Brian, Pete, Ben, Boy, Little Josh,

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,200
Young Theo, Decker, Peter, Jeffrey, Tommy Callahan,

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,080
war with grandpa.

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,160
He's playing Peter in Pete's Dragon and played Pete,

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
so I don't know if we're continuing the Peter-verse.

69
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
Maybe this is the verse that we're taking part in.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
Peter-verse, Focker-verse, crossover film.

71
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,520
Do you guys see that Pete's Dragon movie, by the way?

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,240
No.

73
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
First 30 seconds, total party kill.

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,480
They just like, aside from Pete, Pete lives,

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,960
but they show you the car accident

76
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
that takes away his parents.

77
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,640
Okay, that's, it's a super cool Batman-esque move

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,200
that shows you how Pete became the Dark Knight.

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
That's unfortunate,

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,480
but Pete's getting his revenge in this one

81
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
because he's going to war with grandpa.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,560
Oh no, my parents died in a car accident.

83
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,240
Now it's time to kill my grandpa.

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
His parents are very much alive.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
Oh, it says a prequel.

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
The second tagline of this one, it says

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
old school versus new cool.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,080
Oh, fuck, baby, I got chills again, man.

89
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,480
The war with grandpa, there's another-

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Needed two taglines.

91
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,360
There's another tagline.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,760
Oh, I thought you were saying that was the second tagline too,

93
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,240
as if to say like, did you hear that the first time?

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
How good is this?

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,720
The second tagline is a comedy for the whole family.

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,280
Huh.

97
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,880
Fucking good, yeah.

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,080
Fucking good.

99
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
And then the third tagline by Justin McElroy is

100
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,280
fucking everybody's slumming it in this one

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,600
because you've got Uma Thurman.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,320
Oh boy.

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
Married to Rob Riggle.

104
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,160
Oh boy.

105
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,600
As the parents of Peter,

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,320
who have given away Peter's room to Robert De Niro,

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,440
the salty Ed.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,720
He's going to war.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,760
He's going to war with this kid.

110
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,880
Man, for a second, I was kind of hoping that it was literal.

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,800
It's starting to shape up like a Home Alone kind of war,

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,040
where probably pranks and such.

113
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,040
But I wanted it to be like maybe Robert De Niro's character

114
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,200
was the dictator of one country and a young boy

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,280
ascended to the throne of another country

116
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
and he had to go to war with his own grandfather

117
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
and it was a very touching Oscar-baped piece.

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
Well, Dennis the Menace sort of-

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
There's a super precedent established by Dennis the Menace

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,800
who did perpetrate war crimes on poor old Walter Matthau,

121
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
or at least an actor who looked a lot like Walter Matthau.

122
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,840
No, it was Walter Matthau.

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,200
And sometimes I think about that scene

124
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,600
where he puts chiclets in as his fake front teeth.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,160
Yeah, that was briefly-

126
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
I used to get really sad.

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
That was briefly before he was elected.

128
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
That's the new cool.

129
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,360
That's the new cool.

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
That's the super president.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Walter Matthau was recently elected

132
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,600
our nation's first super president.

133
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,200
He is in charge of the other president and he is dead.

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Cheech Marin's in this one.

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,280
Oh boy.

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
Jane Seymour, Christopher Walken.

137
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
Wow, they're not into making any other movies, huh?

138
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
Is this the only movie they were making?

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
I guess you get a call and you're like,

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,440
I guess I'll be in the war with grandpa.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,160
Nice, dude.

142
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,960
That's the script.

143
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Dude, that was fucking-

144
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,040
My agent, is there any other movie?

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,840
What is this?

146
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,160
I could be in Cyborg.

147
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,760
Oh, that was Jane Seymour, sorry.

148
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
That sounds like, that was Jane Seymour.

149
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,600
That sounds like a tape recorder

150
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,520
that's being thrown down a flight of stairs.

151
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,840
I am happy to take a roll.

152
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
That was my impression of Torgue.

153
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm going to war with grandpa.

154
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,160
So my problem-

155
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,000
2,725 IMDB users have rated this film already.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,840
They are sitting at 5.3 in just their excitement

157
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,840
or I guess pleasure that they've already derived

158
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
from the promotional materials surrounding the war

159
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
with grandpa.

160
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Is that fair to say?

161
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,600
Yeah, I think, man, here's the thing,

162
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,680
is that you've got De Niro, you've got Walken.

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
This movie sounds like it's going to have

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,600
a lot of sort of mature themes.

165
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,840
These two fellows are always doing films

166
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
with mature themes.

167
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,000
So I'd love to take my family to this film,

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,120
but I have no evidence to point me towards the conclusion

169
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,840
that this film would be satisfactory for me

170
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,280
to watch with my whole family.

171
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,200
Yeah, I'm with Griffin on this one.

172
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,960
It kind of seems like this might be fun

173
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,640
for some of my family, like maybe the older kids

174
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
or they're downplaying it

175
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
and it's just good for the younger kids.

176
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
What's amazing is I can actually break these ratings,

177
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
IMDB ratings down by demographic.

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
So if we zoom in, if we enhance here,

179
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,760
kids under 18 are given this one a 6.3.

180
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,240
Adults older than 45 are given it a 5.2.

181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
So the kids are saying, yes, I would like to go to war

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,000
with grandpa and the grandparents are saying,

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,920
actually, I would prefer that we not go to war.

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,840
Well, they know, they know.

185
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,960
Now, if I'm not mistaken, Justin, this is out of 10.

186
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,320
So saying that 6.3 is I would like to go

187
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
is awful generous.

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,320
It's a sort of cautious, in theory,

189
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,400
I would like to go to war with grandpa.

190
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,080
It's as if to say, I'm afraid of what the other options

191
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,480
might be.

192
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
If this is the best one, then yes.

193
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,400
But if there's something better, I would like to do that.

194
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,840
This is the episode.

195
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,560
Let's really get into the war with grandpa.

196
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,960
It's called the war with grandpa,

197
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,600
which seems to intimate a back and forth,

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
a firing of, just looking at the trailer here,

199
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
prank salvos that seem to escalate fairly quickly.

200
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
Here's Robert De Niro putting foam sealant on his face

201
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,560
instead of shaving cream.

202
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,400
That would tear the man's flesh.

203
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,080
That would rend the grandpa's flesh.

204
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
That's an emergency room.

205
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
That's an emergency room, for sure, for sure.

206
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,240
Apparently, he sneaks a very big poisonous snake

207
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
into his bed while he's sleeping.

208
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
So now that's attempted murder.

209
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,880
This film, it would be pretty fucking wild

210
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,920
and also not suitable for me to bring my whole family to

211
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,680
if the grandpa reciprocates even once.

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
This is a war on grandpa.

213
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,800
Grandpa is not going to pull out an aluminum baseball bat

214
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,440
like now, my fucking turn.

215
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
It's not gonna do it.

216
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
He's just gonna take his licks, I guess.

217
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,880
Now, here's the thing, though, Griffin.

218
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,080
I would give an Oscar to a movie in which a child

219
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,000
mercilessly pranks, and I'd say prank,

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,720
with quotes around it, an old man,

221
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,640
and those pranks include poisonous snakes and such.

222
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
And the old man is just like,

223
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,920
please, I just came for a visit because I love my family.

224
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,800
I just wanted to spend time with my grandkid

225
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,680
and get to know you.

226
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,400
Why are you doing this?

227
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,160
Maybe the title is actually not.

228
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,600
Maybe the prank war is like the first five minutes

229
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,960
and then seven minutes in, Oaks Vaguely gets drafted

230
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
into the war with the robots.

231
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
And he has to go to war with his grandpa.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,440
They're both conscripted into the battle against AI

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
and he has to go to war with his grandpa also.

234
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,040
Okay, here's my fanfic for the movie.

235
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay, the prank war,

236
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,480
it's the first five minutes of the movie.

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,120
And then grandpa says,

238
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,840
this isn't the first war I've been in.

239
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,120
And Oaks Vaguely says, what do you mean grandpa?

240
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
And so then grandpa starts telling him about the great war

241
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
that he fought in and Oaks Vaguely is there with him.

242
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,000
We could fill that in with whatever war is like,

243
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
we'll focus group that one.

244
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
It's timeless.

245
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
When we remake this movie.

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah, and so then Oaks Vaguely is there with his grandfather

247
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
as the grandfather is telling him the story

248
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
and you see young grandpa,

249
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
which is what we'll call the character

250
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,520
and like his time in probably France.

251
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,080
I mean, I just assuming France.

252
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,560
When he's young grandpa, can we just call him dad?

253
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
Yes, and he's drinking a lot of absinthe

254
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
and then basically it just becomes like Moulin Rouge.

255
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,400
And that it's fun for the whole family.

256
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,640
That's where we get the family fun aspect.

257
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,200
Right.

258
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
I do see a clip in this trailer

259
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
between the knocking him off a roof

260
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,280
while he's dressed as Santa Claus

261
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,880
and putting a poisonous snake in his bed

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,200
where the grandpa and this grandson

263
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
give a hug to each other.

264
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
And I'm not sure where in the sequence of events

265
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,400
that's gonna fit in,

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,120
but it's fun for the family is here

267
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
and it's new cool.

268
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Well, you have to imagine the movie ends

269
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,840
with them reconciling, right?

270
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
Or does it end with them like,

271
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
I still fucking hate your guts.

272
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
I don't know, man.

273
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,800
This movie was finished and ready to be released

274
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
February 23rd, 2018.

275
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Ooh, it had the mature in the bottle.

276
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Ooh, we gotta let this one age a little.

277
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,360
Ooh, this one's a barrel-aged comedy.

278
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
Get that oaky finish.

279
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,800
It's got peaty notes.

280
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,600
Oh wait, it does.

281
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,840
It has Pete's dragon notes.

282
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,440
I wish I could be there with Bob, Bobby,

283
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,800
when he opens the newspaper

284
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
and sees that big one sheet in variety

285
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,120
and go see The War with Grandpa

286
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
and he has to sit there and stare at it

287
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,080
for five solid minutes.

288
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Wait, didn't I already put this movie out?

289
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,640
And then he'll just quietly say to himself,

290
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,560
there's no fucking way I did this movie.

291
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,920
This does not seem right.

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Did they let me make three of these?

293
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
How many of these movies I make?

294
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
I told them that hologram Robert De Niro

295
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,800
was to be used only in case of national emergency,

296
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
not for films like The War with Grandpa.

297
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Oh no, I'm seeing here on IMDb in the trivia

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
that this movie is made all, well,

299
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,600
with deleted scenes from Cool Grandpa.

300
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,880
Where, yeah, the Oaks Fegley was just reacting

301
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
to footage that they already had.

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
Right.

303
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,560
Okay.

304
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, yep, yep, yeah.

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
Oh, and a little bit, it says here,

306
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,920
just a little bit of Baby Fockers.

307
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
Just a touch.

308
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,840
A drizzling of Baby Fockers, yeah.

309
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,400
Yeah, he was in there just sort of

310
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,720
Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow-ing,

311
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
just kind of pranking a tennis ball.

312
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,840
But they put in De Niro using Adobe After Effects.

313
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

314
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,840
Anybody could do that.

315
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,120
My kid could do that.

316
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,520
And they had me do the ADR.

317
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,520
They had Travis do the ADR.

318
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,040
Travis, give me some, Travis, say like,

319
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,000
you just threw, say like-

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,840
Hey, hey, hey, is this a snake in my bed?

321
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
Wait, there's a fucking,

322
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,200
there's a fucking snake in my fucking bed?

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
You little fucking piece of shit trying to kill me?

324
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
Yeah, it says that in the script at least on GitHub.

325
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,960
And can you read that one line that's like,

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
you're gonna throw a beehive at my penis?

327
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,520
Can you say that line?

328
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,120
Yeah, you got it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
You're gonna throw a fucking beehive at my penis?

330
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
So the bees sting my balls?

331
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,920
Do it PG-13.

332
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,160
I love, Travis, I love the sting in the ball stuff.

333
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,720
It's so funny.

334
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
Okay, yeah, I'll work on it.

335
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,480
Like this film is for the whole family.

336
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,440
So we cannot actually show balls.

337
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
I'll allude to it, okay?

338
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,400
We wanna paint the image.

339
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,160
So it's like a Pixar thing where like,

340
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,640
you can say a dirty thing and then the parents will get it

341
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,080
and think about like sexy stuff.

342
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,440
Got it, got it, got it.

343
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,240
Okay, let me try again.

344
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,600
Try again, but don't curse on it.

345
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,760
You're gonna throw a fudgin' beehive at my fudgin' genitals?

346
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,280
So that they sting my old man testicles?

347
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
No, that's a little too clinical.

348
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,360
I just really want you to exercise.

349
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,320
Okay, let me try again, can I try again?

350
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,240
Just don't say fucking and don't say fudgin'.

351
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
Let's, because this is gonna, this is real now.

352
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

353
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,120
What, you're going to throw that GD, is that okay?

354
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,400
I just don't-

355
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,480
Okay, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

356
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120
You know what, go back to saying fucking and we'll fix it.

357
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,620
Okay.

358
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
What are you, fucking asshole?

359
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,680
Is that better?

360
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,440
No, okay, hold on.

361
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,200
Hold on, but the line there that you gave,

362
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,480
and that was an inspired read,

363
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,400
is what are you, fucking asshole?

364
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,720
And it's like-

365
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,360
What are you?

366
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,640
Okay, I left that out of it.

367
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,920
It's incoherent, but at this point,

368
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
his balls have been so stung so terribly by these hornets.

369
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,800
Ah, these fucking bees are stinging my fucking old balls.

370
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,040
And I'm here trying to flirt with this lady at this pool party,

371
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
and you threw these fucking bees at me,

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,400
and I'm going into anaphylactic shock.

373
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,440
I can't breathe, and you took my EpiPen,

374
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,520
and you smoked it like a vape,

375
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,880
and now I'm dying because of my allergic reaction

376
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,080
to these fucking bees stinging my fucking balls.

377
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,960
Guys, the reviews are in on this fucking movie.

378
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,400
The war with grandpa, everyone is talking about it.

379
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,080
Somehow it has over 70 ratings on Google.

380
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
Just to give you some of the highlights,

381
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,680
here's a four-star review from Anthony.

382
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,040
This is out of five, I should mention,

383
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
so you're gonna like it a little bit more.

384
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
One of the funnier movies I watch these days,

385
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,600
reminiscent of the epic Home Alone series,

386
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
I thoroughly enjoyed the gentle comedy,

387
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,000
which I bet is fucking right on the money.

388
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,560
Whoa, we've already established

389
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,360
there's a scene with a snake in the bed.

390
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,280
I thoroughly enjoyed the gentle comedy

391
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,400
provoked by the war between a grandpa

392
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,080
and sixth-grader grandson.

393
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,720
There's enmity without malice and revenge without vengeance.

394
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,800
I don't know why he became fucking William Faulkner,

395
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
halfway through this review, but here we are.

396
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,320
Lovely little family movie.

397
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,920
If anyone ever referred to our jokes

398
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,000
and the things that we do on these shows

399
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
as gentle comedy, I feel like that would be

400
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
a pretty huge letdown for me.

401
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,760
I feel like, and I'm not saying we're, you know.

402
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,320
Edgy.

403
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,360
We're edgy.

404
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
I don't think that that's true,

405
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
although we did do an extended bit

406
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,040
about throwing a beehive at Robert De Niro's

407
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,600
reproductive organs.

408
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,100
Genitals.

409
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,520
I think we're just sort of normal comedy.

410
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,240
I don't know what gentle comedy entails.

411
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
He misspelled genital.

412
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,800
Does that mean that it's just not funny?

413
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
And it's like, is that what gentle comedy is?

414
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,440
It's a thinker.

415
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
It's funny, because Brad Barrage says,

416
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,560
this movie was hilarious, loved it throughout,

417
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,720
funny all the way, a total time killer.

418
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,000
Hold on there.

419
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
A great movie to watch with family

420
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
and have a great time together.

421
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
This movie will make you laugh a lot.

422
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
A total family entertainer.

423
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,360
Cool.

424
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,320
Now, a TFE, a total family entertainer.

425
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,520
Always looking for those.

426
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,800
Now, here's what I will say.

427
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,280
If someone was describing something I had made

428
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
and they were like, oh, so funny, so wonderful,

429
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
really killed some time,

430
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
I think that that last one would take away

431
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,080
from the first two.

432
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm just like, I liked the way that when I sat down

433
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,800
to watch it, it was one time.

434
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
And when I was finished watching it,

435
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,840
it was a later time.

436
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,200
And I enjoyed that.

437
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
I enjoyed how time continued its linear flow.

438
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,960
Here's one, a five star review.

439
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,720
You hardly get to watch movies like that these days.

440
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, loved it.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
I had all the favorite casts there.

442
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,680
Where are they watching this movie?

443
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,400
Is it out?

444
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,280
Can I watch it?

445
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
I don't think so.

446
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
How come they get to watch it?

447
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,480
Here's one, it's three stars out of five.

448
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,600
This is kind of the other side of the coin,

449
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
which we've been very positive about

450
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,840
War with Grandpa to this point.

451
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,560
I don't want to hear any bad shit about War with Grandpa.

452
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,080
Movie for kids only.

453
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
Or maybe a family.

454
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
Maybe a family of kids.

455
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,920
Like a Camp Nowhere thing.

456
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,760
You know, like the Herdman's from worst Christmas

457
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
present ever, that kind of deal.

458
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,680
You get it.

459
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,560
I like it.

460
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,520
Some good laughs and typical comedy performance.

461
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,160
And damn, Robert De Niro is very old.

462
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
Does this say that?

463
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't be ageist to Robert De Niro.

464
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Robert De Niro is very old, but still kicking.

465
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
Still kicking ass?

466
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,400
Or still like...

467
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,240
There's that prolonged scene I'm watching on the trailer now

468
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,680
where Robert De Niro just kicks that kid a lot.

469
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,040
That's probably what he's referring to.

470
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
Here's one, five star review.

471
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,680
Five out of five stars.

472
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,040
Greatest movie ever.

473
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,800
It's actually a pretty good movie.

474
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,400
Love the scenes between Grandpa and his grandchildren,

475
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
which I would assume for what I've gathered

476
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
has got to be the majority of the scenes, right?

477
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,760
They were very sparing with the interactions

478
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
betwixt Grandpa and grandson.

479
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,480
They just sprinkled it in.

480
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
This is just a total family entertainer.

481
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
Just a total family entertainer.

482
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,440
Angie says, I love this movie.

483
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,680
Also, the characters are really pretty.

484
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,180
Huh?

485
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
All right, all right, all right.

486
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,160
But not the actors, huh?

487
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,360
The characters.

488
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,760
Like their hearts?

489
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,840
Maybe they have an inner beauty.

490
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
I think that's maybe what we're talking about.

491
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
You can see the twinkle in Oak Svegli's eye.

492
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
Is that a first name or first and last, by the way?

493
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,880
It's a symbol.

494
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,320
I just want to go down the quick hit

495
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,680
of all these other five-star reviews.

496
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,160
Awesome movie after so long, especially in COVID.

497
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,160
I like that one because it's like, listen,

498
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,440
if the COVID shit hadn't happened,

499
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
I probably would not be enjoying this flick.

500
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,960
But right now, it's about all I can sew it.

501
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
So yes, good on that front.

502
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
Yes, good, gentle.

503
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,720
It's like in the scene where it's just like,

504
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,760
I've been crawling through the desert forever

505
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,720
and I find like a stagnant pond and I'm so excited.

506
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,600
You know what I mean?

507
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
I wouldn't drink that day to day.

508
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
It's not just me crawling through the desert, Travis.

509
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,480
It's my whole fucking gosh dang family.

510
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Yeah.

511
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440
And then we find not one Oasis.

512
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,320
Griffin's family of kids.

513
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,480
Griffin's Fagan style family of kids.

514
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
His little town style of kids.

515
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
It is many Oasis.

516
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,480
A total family entertainer, Travis.

517
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
Like bring into noise, bring into funk.

518
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,000
A total entertainment package like Blue Man Group, baby.

519
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
And no one's upset by Blue Man Group, right?

520
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,560
I can't.

521
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,840
I mean, I don't know.

522
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,120
Okay.

523
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
We will find out.

524
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,480
Hey, do you guys think Blue Man Group has done a zoom yet?

525
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
Do you think they're doing private zooms?

526
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
Probably just with each other.

527
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,560
Excellent movie.

528
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Good, good, love it.

529
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
That's like they got asked by Google

530
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,440
as they were trying to get to work on time.

531
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,200
Like Google's like, hey, real quick, real quick.

532
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,760
What'd you think?

533
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
All right, yeah, it was good.

534
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,600
This is a good movie.

535
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,100
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
James Hare says, books butthole.

537
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,840
Don't know what that means.

538
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

539
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,400
One more time?

540
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
Books butthole.

541
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,000
Wait, like this movie is a books butthole or?

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,160
Let's explore that.

543
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,880
Or maybe the book that, or with grandpa's based on.

544
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Grandpa's War.

545
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,080
The last review here, five stars from three days ago.

546
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,960
And this is, I, this is actually, it seems to sum it up.

547
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
Good, but could be more, all caps, fun.

548
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,920
Good, but could be more fun.

549
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,760
I don't think it looks like it could be any more fun.

550
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,920
Do you think grandpa dies in this movie?

551
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

552
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,040
No, absolutely.

553
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Okay, see, I don't actually think so.

554
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,960
Oh, interesting.

555
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,520
No, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think this whole

556
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,640
movie might just be a ploy to get people to be on better

557
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
terms with their grandparents.

558
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,120
And I think it's, I think it's that this boy just completely,

559
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,800
just, just savages this, this older gentleman.

560
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,800
And then not because of a prank, I'm not saying that the boy

561
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,480
like pushes him off a ladder as he stresses Santa Claus and he

562
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
falls, although he does do that.

563
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,160
Or like he puts a poisonous snake in his bed and the snake

564
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,760
bites him and he dies from that.

565
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,720
Although he does do that also, unrelated thing.

566
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,520
And then the boy's like, man, I should have been cooler to him.

567
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,040
Here's what I think happens.

568
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,680
Yeah, sure.

569
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,760
All that prank stuff, everything we see in the trailer,

570
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
that's the first five minutes.

571
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,920
And then the grandfather gets bit by a snake and dies.

572
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,000
And the boy is so sad that he goes to heaven to fight the

573
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,600
angels to save, to bring back his grandfather's soul, much

574
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
like, and it's been a while since I've seen it, but what I'm

575
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
pretty sure happens in what dreams may come.

576
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,400
It's what happens in what dreams may come is what happens

577
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,920
in Dante's Inferno.

578
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,320
It's what happens in the Poisonwood Bible.

579
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,920
This movie is a movie.

580
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a total family entertainer.

581
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,760
It's also a total literary omnibus.

582
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,720
Yeah.

583
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,800
The boy goes to war with God to bring back his grandfather's

584
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,560
soul and it's fun for the whole family.

585
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,480
Teams up with fucking Constantine.

586
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,360
Yeah, baby.

587
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,240
Fuck yes.

588
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,880
Fuck yes.

589
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,560
Oh God, yes.

590
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,760
Oh, and maybe I like, maybe there's a fallen angel trying

591
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
to get his wings back.

592
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,240
It's a whole thing.

593
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
Oh fuck, I'm excited for this movie, you guys.

594
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,000
Guys, speaking of this movie, I don't want to like diminish

595
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,720
because I think that things are often made more beautiful by

596
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,440
their imperfections, but I did want to jump into some goof.

597
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,920
Okay.

598
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,800
Oh man.

599
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,400
The internet, you know.

600
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,800
Yeah.

601
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,120
Sherlock's are already out at this one.

602
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,880
Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.

603
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
Nitpick, pick, pick, pick.

604
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
And I think, but you know what?

605
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,120
You know what I like about these goofs though?

606
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,160
What, Justin?

607
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,680
Let's give me an early look at the war with grandpa because

608
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm getting a sneak peek into some of the scenes.

609
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,360
Cool.

610
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,240
Before me, a common American is able to watch and enjoy this.

611
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh, did they release this in like France?

612
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,920
Perhaps.

613
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
I mean, there's all these reviews and goofs.

614
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,880
Let's see, we got a couple of character errors.

615
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,040
Ed is told at Jerry's friend's funeral that he died in his

616
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,640
sleep while skydiving.

617
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Well, this is a funny joke.

618
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,160
In real life, all parachutes for sport jumping are equipped

619
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,320
with an automatic activation device designed to activate

620
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
the parachute to open if the user becomes unconscious or is

621
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
otherwise unable to deploy the parachute when getting too

622
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,200
close to the ground.

623
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,320
Who wrote this?

624
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,560
What stupid fucking idiot wrote this movie?

625
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:24,720
Yeah.

626
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,080
Can I, hey, can I point out a goof in that goof?

627
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,560
Yeah.

628
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:28,960
Yeah.

629
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
Fucking goof.

630
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,120
If he died in his sleep, he's dead before he hits the ground.

631
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,960
It doesn't matter if the parachute goes off or not,

632
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,600
you goof.

633
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah, if he explodes into old jelly, then it's like-

634
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm saying he's dead before he hits the ground.

635
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,400
Yeah.

636
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,720
I would love to know how they did the analytics on that one.

637
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,000
But yes, Travis, that's an excellent point.

638
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,560
Can I say this?

639
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,440
Can I say this, though?

640
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
It is fucking funny.

641
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:47,760
Right?

642
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,880
It's funny.

643
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,000
He died in his sleep while skydiving.

644
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Okay, this next one's good.

645
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,840
Ed tells his, what is this fucking movie?

646
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
Ed tells his granddaughter that, quote, pretty much every

647
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,000
foundation I dug, I found a marble or two.

648
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,600
And, quote, if you count all those marbles in the glass jar,

649
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,120
you'll know how many houses I built.

650
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,200
Pretty much implies he did not find a marble at the start of

651
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,680
every house.

652
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,240
And for the others, he found one or two, which means he found

653
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,080
one, two, or more.

654
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,240
Circumstances which would not give even a rough count of the

655
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,960
number of houses he built, let alone an accurate one.

656
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,640
I think the jury will find I don't want to pick holes in

657
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,200
Mr. De Niro's film, but what the fuck?

658
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,720
Why would there be marbles just...

659
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,880
So this film opens with a different grandpa's funeral.

660
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,160
So there's got to be a grandchild who goes-

661
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,200
Who's won his war.

662
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,160
Who's won his war, or at the very least experienced it, who

663
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,360
goes to Pete's Dragon and he's like, don't you don't want to

664
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,560
I'm telling you, I'm going to live with this weight, this

665
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,280
guilt for the rest of my fucking days on this earth.

666
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,800
Don't do it, Pete's Dragon.

667
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,760
Oh, shit.

668
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
Yeah, but he does it anyway.

669
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,000
This movie is a backdoor sequel to Problem Childs.

670
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah?

671
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,640
Okay.

672
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,640
That kid is like, I murdered my grandpa and it's great.

673
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,120
I get all the like sweets and treats I want.

674
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,680
Yeah, also inspired by the Poisonwood Bible.

675
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:22,960
Are you sure?

676
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
Got a couple of real quick plot holes.

677
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,280
I'm skipping continuity.

678
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,760
Okay.

679
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,960
Ed demonstrates his ignorance of simple electronic devices,

680
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,080
such as the self-checkout, an iPad, and a drone.

681
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,080
If I can take a second just to kind of keep my sides from

682
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,960
splitting, I just got to say that fucking sounds funny.

683
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,360
Yet he somehow manages to log on to his grandson's presumably

684
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,240
password protected computer, find the game his grandson has

685
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,840
been playing, enter it, locate, and subsequently destroy the

686
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
castle he has been building for three years.

687
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
Oh, my God.

688
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,720
I got to see this flick.

689
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,440
That sounds great.

690
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,160
I know, right?

691
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,520
I got to see the seat.

692
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,720
I just want one time in my life to see the old raging bull

693
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,680
get in there and tear down some kid's Minecraft castle.

694
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,880
That's where he's at now.

695
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,880
Am I talking to you?

696
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
Not while I'm gaming.

697
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,640
Hey, can I eat all your redstone?

698
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
I figured out a way to eat all your redstone.

699
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,600
I ate it all.

700
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,040
No more switches for you.

701
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,760
I made your fortnight guy do the forbidden dances and got

702
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,320
your band.

703
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,840
Now I'm Twitch streaming.

704
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,400
But that's just for me.

705
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,240
That's not it's not part of the prank.

706
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
And this is where I do.

707
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
I think we should probably put a pin in the intro and move

708
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,360
on with the show after this.

709
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,200
But I have one more plot.

710
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
Okay, great, great.

711
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,680
And this may be actually getting into a little bit of

712
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,560
a spoiler territory.

713
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,480
So skip ahead about 10 minutes.

714
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
Skip ahead 10 to 15 minutes.

715
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Make it 20.

716
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,800
Just stop listening.

717
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,760
Just stop listening.

718
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,280
We're going to have the money zone soon.

719
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,240
So don't actually skip.

720
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,760
Okay, just start listening to it at like five times speed.

721
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,400
Justin has to say that to keep the advertisers happy.

722
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,720
But I want you to go into this film with fucking

723
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,720
virgin ears and eyes and a heart and soul of a child's mind.

724
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,000
So don't listen to this next fucking part, no matter what

725
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,480
you do.

726
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,120
It's cursed.

727
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,680
I'm going to put a ring curse on this next 20 minutes.

728
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:25,920
Nice.

729
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,760
Don't interrupt me for a second.

730
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,000
Okay.

731
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,920
After the many accidents at the birthday party, Sally is

732
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,480
angry with Ed for citing the war as being the cause of all

733
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
the events that transpired.

734
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,120
However, almost everything major that happened at that

735
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,000
event, with the exception of the ejector seat chair, started

736
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,440
as a direct result of a rat chewing through a cable and is

737
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
not connected with the war at all.

738
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,200
Therefore, not his nor his grandson's fault.

739
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,440
This sounds like fun for the whole family.

740
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,400
Sounds like a fucking total family entertainer is what it

741
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,800
sounds like.

742
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,640
There's a fucking rat chewing a cable that makes an ejector

743
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,200
seat.

744
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, fuck.

745
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,160
You know, an ejector seat at a party.

746
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,760
Fuck, that's funny.

747
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,960
It's really funny and I'm kind of losing it.

748
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,920
Old school versus new cool.

749
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,400
Get it in theater.

750
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,720
I still don't even want to joke and say that part.

751
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,800
No, this one's coming.

752
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:24,960
Yeah.

753
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,320
So that's our first movie in the intro segment that was

754
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,120
supposed to be one of many films we've talked about.

755
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
The War with Grandpa is coming.

756
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,000
Don't see it in theaters.

757
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,840
It's going to be out October 9th, 2020.

758
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,320
You know, you've waited two years to see this flick without

759
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,040
knowing it.

760
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,160
I think you could probably wait until it's out on a home

761
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,960
viewing options.

762
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,640
And that is our first ad.

763
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,400
And now let's move on to some more ads in the money center.

764
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,400
If you want to hire a family to watch War with Grandpa with

765
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,040
you, you're going to need Zip Recruiter.

766
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,480
I don't think Zip Recruiter will be a good fit.

767
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,240
Yeah, let me just put a quick disclaimer here.

768
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,600
I don't know that you can hire a family through Zip Recruiter.

769
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,480
But if you could hire a family, Zip Recruiter would be the

770
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,560
place to do it, right?

771
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,160
Because it's hard to find the right person.

772
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,600
And if it's hard for you, why not switch to Zip Recruiter?

773
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,000
You can try it for free at ziprecruiter.com slash my

774
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,480
brother.

775
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,680
Zip Recruiter will send you the best candidates for the role

776
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,040
you're looking for in around five minutes or so.

777
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,680
And you can hire them the next day if you want to.

778
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,200
And with the results like that, it's no wonder that four out

779
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,080
of five employers who post in Zip Recruiter get a quality

780
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
candidate within the first day.

781
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
And right now you can try it for free.

782
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
That's right, free at ziprecruiter.com slash my

783
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,200
brother.

784
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,600
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

785
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
So let's say you're watching the War with Grandpa and you're

786
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,520
seeing the iconic scene of the war.

787
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,280
And you're seeing the iconic scene where Robert De Niro,

788
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,320
Ed, as we know-

789
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,960
Salty Ed.

790
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,240
Salty Ed is in his fucking cardigan and cabby cap and-

791
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Looking so choice.

792
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,880
He looks fucking good.

793
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,520
He looks cool.

794
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,880
He looks cool.

795
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
He looks sexy.

796
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
And you're like, I want to get that look.

797
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,640

798

emulate with your fashion.

808
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,560

809
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,400

exact outfit.

They will sync with War with Grandpa to find the exact look.

813
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,120

814
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,800
based on a look from War with Grandpa.

815

the course of an hour because that's what we do every week on

835
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,440
story break a writer's room podcast where three Hollywood

836
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,080
professionals have an hour to come up with a pitch for a movie

837
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,200
or TV show based off of totally zany prompts like that time we

838
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
reimagine Star Wars based on our phones auto complete Luke

839
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,840
Skywalker is a family man and it's Star Wars, but it's a good

840
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,340
idea.

841
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,640
How about a time we broke the story of a bunch of Disney

842
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,120
channel original movies based solely on the title and the

843
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,620
poster.

844
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,040
Okay, Sarah Hyland is a 50 foot woman.

845
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Let's just go with it guys.

846
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
Or the time we finally cracked the Adobe Photoshop feature

847
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,480
film stamp tool is your woody and then the autofill is the

848
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,960
new Buzz Lightyear join us as we have a good time

849
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,600
imagining all the movies Hollywood is too cowardly to

850
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,560
make story break comes out every Thursday on maximum fun.

851
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,920
I don't know why I'm using this voice now.

852
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,080
Question or Yahoo.

853
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Well here I feel I feel like we need to I have to make an

854
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,680
apology and maybe you guys can join in too because I feel like

855
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,320
we've been talking a lot about we've been talking a lot about

856
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,720
we've been talking a lot about wars grandpa, but we've been

857
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
talking a lot about how it's fun for the whole family.

858
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,600
Yeah, and I feel like we should clarify like that includes

859
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,480
found family.

860
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,120
You know what I mean?

861
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,760
Because not everybody has a good relationship.

862
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,160
Maybe your grandpa is more of like a Dr.

863
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,600
Brown scenario where you have like a found grandpa you want

864
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,120
to go to war with and I just want to make it clear that like

865
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,160
I think it's fun for the whole found family as well.

866
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,480
I just don't want you know, you're sitting there with maybe

867
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,520
it's your roommates or yeah, you know like your coven or like

868
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,600
you know, just your high school friends who you're still really

869
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,680
tight with and you talk about how good you did in the big

870
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,240
game like no matter who it is, right?

871
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,880
I think every literally everyone will enjoy watching war

872
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,360
with grandpa.

873
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,280
I think that this movie is really going to bring people

874
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
back together after we've been pulled apart by covid.

875
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,720
Yeah, that's actually a great point Travis.

876
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,960
You got to remember that when you're watching war with

877
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,280
grandpa at your house, you're actually watching with

878
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,760
everybody else on planet earth that is also enjoying this

879
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,360
film and that's something you can't you can't get for free.

880
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,920
Yeah.

881
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,160
Yeah.

882
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,920
I mean everybody's everybody came from the same sort of

883
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,160
Adam and Eve.

884
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
We're all family if you think about it.

885
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,280
Yep.

886
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,560
That's so true.

887
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,200
That's so true.

888
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
We all came up out of Abraham.

889
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,120
So we got it's all we're all family.

890
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,480
All came up.

891
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,280
Yep.

892
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,680
Thank you.

893
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,640
Thank you.

894
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,000
And you know, I think maybe we should do like a widely

895
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,560
synchronized now.

896
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,360
I'm not saying me.

897
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,080
I'm saying the world.

898
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,200
This is a wide the whole world should just all watch war

899
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,120
with grandpa at the exact same time.

900
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,240
I think that could be cool.

901
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,360
I think that could be like to buy the world a limited time

902
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,600
streaming copy of war with grandpa for them to enjoy and

903
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,880
then we'd all be united.

904
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,120
Yeah.

905
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,560
And here's here's like can I put like a little cool spin on

906
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,200
it? Yeah, we're not going to schedule that time.

907
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,120
I want everyone to just feel it.

908
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,520
I want them to feel it like there will come a moment where

909
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,440
you're like this is it and you're right.

910
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800
It's everybody will just we'll all sync up and it might be

911
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
now it might be 10 years from now.

912
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,640
But like we want there will come a moment where all of our

913
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,720
breeding patterns and our heartbeats and yes, our periods

914
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,600
will all sync up and we'll just know it's the time to watch

915
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,040
war with grandpa.

916
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,840
Well, I mean it'll also have the title song war with grandpa

917
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,800
that chance the rapper did for the soundtrack of war with

918
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,360
grandpa.

919
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,720
So maybe we'll just like play like you'll just you're just

920
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,560
going to hear it and not from any kind of a radio or CD

921
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,280
player.

922
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,840
No, you're just going to it's just going to be you're just

923
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,560
going to hear it and you'll know that it's time to race to

924
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,960
the Blu-ray player and or sorry streaming your wrote your Roku

925
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,280
and or your Goku on your Goku to watch this film or however

926
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,560
we're watching movies at that point.

927
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,600
Because like I said, it might be a long time from now.

928
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,640
Am I reading this right?

929
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
This movie's four and a half hours long.

930
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,760
How could that possibly be?

931
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,400
Not nothing was left on the cutting room for it's all on

932
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,040
screen and I mean including like where they would cut and

933
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,600
like reset and make film scenes again.

934
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,080
They didn't edit anything out.

935
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,400
They made it kind of like boyhood where they've been

936
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,280
shooting this movie since Oaks Fagley was born and he's

937
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,240
26 now.

938
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,960
I would love to talk about Tim Hill.

939
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,520
Oh, the I hate I want to pivot a little bit really thought

940
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,800
we were about to do a question.

941
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:37,760
No.

942
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,080
Yeah.

943
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,760
No, I just want to get this one last thing.

944
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, we'll get to the episode super quick.

945
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,160
I want to start the episode very soon.

946
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,640
I did want to hit this one last thing about Tim Hill and

947
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
just go through his now.

948
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,240
Who is that?

949
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,800
Like he's the director of a film called The War with

950
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:54,960
Crime.

951
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,080
Oh, right, right, right, right.

952
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,720
Of course.

953
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,120
Yeah.

954
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,040
So let's pretend we're doing like a maybe this is like our

955
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,200
neck if we're if we're a blank check.

956
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, we're doing like our blank check mini series.

957
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
Here are the films we be enjoying in this series Muppets

958
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,000
from Space.

959
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,440
Wait, sorry Justin before you continue.

960
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,680
Are you going chronologically back to front or front to

961
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,960
back back front?

962
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,360
Okay.

963
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,000
Muppets from Space, Max Keeble's Big Move.

964
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,880
Oh, great.

965
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,600
Good one.

966
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,080
Fun flick.

967
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,760
The SpongeBob SquarePants movie he did not direct so we can

968
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,560
skip that one.

969
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,880
Unfortunately, the one of these that I would have wanted to

970
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,120
watch.

971
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,320
Fuck, you don't want to watch Max Keeble's Big Move?

972
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,640
Max Keeble rips ass, dude.

973
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
Max Keeble is a fine film.

974
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,480
Tears it up every viewing.

975
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,160
I've worn out the spindles on my VHS of Max Keeble's.

976
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,360
Here's the right here.

977
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,960
Okay, so then he's got Garfield Tale of Two Kitties.

978
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,520
Oh, wow.

979
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:45,920
All right.

980
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
Oscar win.

981
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
And then Alvin and the Chipmunks.

982
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,600
All right.

983
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,080
And then Hop.

984
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,440
Huh?

985
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,320
If you remember that one.

986
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Sure.

987
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,200
Russell Brand is a cute little bunny firing on all cylinders.

988
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,360
Then Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever.

989
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,600
Whoa.

990
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Whoa.

991
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,280
And then for six years, nothing.

992
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,000
Huh.

993
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, once you nail it, you know what I mean?

994
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,040
Yeah.

995
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,000
And then in 2020, he's got both the SpongeBob Movie

996
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,280
Sponge on the Run and The War with Grandpa.

997
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
So Tim Hill is back.

998
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,920
He's on fucking fire.

999
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Can I say, okay, J-Man, when you started his filmography,

1000
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,880
I was not expecting this laundry list of certified hits.

1001
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,360
Yeah.

1002
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,440
Huge hits, all bad.

1003
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,920
Huge hits, though.

1004
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,000
But all recognizable, though, which-

1005
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,280
Recognizable hits.

1006
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,520
There's been one thread tying to-

1007
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,760
I feel like we have probably talked about Tim Hill's movies

1008
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,760
on this podcast more than a lot of huge directors.

1009
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,280
We have definitely, definitely talked about

1010
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,040
Garfield Tale of Two Kitties.

1011
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,120
Oh, I'm almost certain that it also inspired an episode-long

1012
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,920
fever dream like the one we currently find ourselves

1013
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,560
embroiled in.

1014
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,720
This is just the intro, we'll get to the episode.

1015
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,680
We're going to get to the-

1016
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,760
I'm saying that sometimes you get these

1017
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,400
and it's like College Bobsled 3 or whatever,

1018
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,200
and you're like, what?

1019
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,000
Who is this person?

1020
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,120
But Tim Hill has had a storied career.

1021
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,240
Tim Hill has also done some amazing work on TV.

1022
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,120
Welcome Freshman, Rocko's Modern Life, Bobby's World,

1023
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,240
Ka-Blam, Action League Now, don't mind if I fucking do.

1024
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
Is War with Grandpa really good?

1025
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,960
Is it kind of-

1026
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,440
What if War with Grandpa fucking rips ass?

1027
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,160
Rips ass right alongside Max Cable's.

1028
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,720
I'm saying.

1029
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,360
We're going to look so smart when this movie fucking rips ass.

1030
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,800
This- you have convinced me, I am-

1031
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,440
I feel comfortable being swept away in the-

1032
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,240
Sorry, what?

1033
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,560
Sorry, stop.

1034
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
I don't think I could say it like that again if I tried.

1035
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,680
Say it again.

1036
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,160
Just like that, baby.

1037
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,200
Comfortable.

1038
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,600
Comfortable.

1039
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,640
Comfortable.

1040
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,200
Comfortable.

1041
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,400
Comfortable.

1042
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,840
I'm comfortable in the arms of Tim Hill.

1043
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,400
To Tim Hill, comfortable.

1044
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
To tear me away to Tim Hill.

1045
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,280
Where does he go from here?

1046
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,720
The grandpa's been bad.

1047
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
We've gone to war with him.

1048
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,160
He's got to be reborn.

1049
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,320
The next thing should just be Love Grandpa.

1050
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Grandpa struggles in peacetime.

1051
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,560
No, the next one's just going to be Love Grandpa,

1052
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,320
and people are going to see that and be like,

1053
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,440
Love Grandpa, that sounds a little gross for me.

1054
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,200
And then Tim's going to have to go on a sort of door-to-door

1055
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,040
grassroots marketing campaign and be like,

1056
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,720
no, you pronounce it Love Grandpa, like a command.

1057
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,680
Oh, I thought it was like love actually.

1058
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,880
No, Love Grandpa.

1059
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,800
Love Grandpa.

1060
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,280
You must love Grandpa.

1061
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,600
You have seen him be bad.

1062
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,600
You have seen him be dirty.

1063
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,480
You have seen him at war.

1064
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,120
Now you must love Grandpa.

1065
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,640
You must love Grandpa.

1066
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,280
Can we real quick, I hate to do this on the show,

1067
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,840
but real quick, can we just enjoy together the trailer

1068
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,880
for War with Grandpa?

1069
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,200
Is that like a good use of our time?

1070
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Okay, give me just one second to get it kind of

1071
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,240
spooled up here.

1072
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm going to do a little Bluetooth pairing.

1073
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,360
Imagine while I'm doing this,

1074
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,600
what if I was Ed from War with Grandpa?

1075
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,880
You wouldn't be able to figure it out.

1076
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,680
You couldn't do it.

1077
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,720
I was trying to do this.

1078
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,080
Can you fucking imagine?

1079
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,080
You'd be losing it.

1080
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,560
You'd be absolutely losing it.

1081
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,600
I'm already losing it.

1082
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,880
Just picturing it.

1083
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,320
I'm losing it thinking about it.

1084
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,440
Yeah, it's really funny.

1085
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,480
Gotta say, Juice, it is taking you about as long as it would

1086
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,080
take Salty Ed to figure it out.

1087
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,400
I haven't seen him even thinking about that.

1088
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,200
Yeah, right?

1089
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,320
Even thinking about that is fucking busting me off.

1090
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,920
It's kind of bringing us all together.

1091
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,760
Our whole family so far loves it.

1092
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,320
It really is a total family entertainer.

1093
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,240
War with Grandpa.

1094
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,000
This one's got 4.7 million views.

1095
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,720
More views than any we've ever gotten in our entire lives.

1096
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,280
No, it's okay.

1097
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,400
Let's do this.

1098
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,480
This is the War with Grandpa official trailer.

1099
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,360
He's in a grocery store.

1100
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,480
Can I help you, sir?

1101
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,000
You can help me find Maria.

1102
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,120
All Maria's gone.

1103
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,800
We're completely self-checkout now.

1104
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,240
Please scan your item.

1105
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,840
Please scan your item.

1106
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,560
I just did.

1107
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,760
Please scan your item.

1108
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,600
Then he leaves.

1109
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,320
He gets arrested.

1110
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,560
This can't keep happening.

1111
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,160
He hits a mailbox.

1112
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,760
You're not putting me in a home.

1113
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,360
What if it were our home?

1114
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,000
Oh my god.

1115
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,500
Grandpa!

1116
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,680
Jenny!

1117
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,560
Hi, Grandpa.

1118
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,520
Hello, sweetheart.

1119
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
How's your daughter's place at?

1120
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,680
She gave me my grandson's room.

1121
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,160
That's great.

1122
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,880
You're welcome.

1123
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,760
How do you like your room?

1124
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,320
Kid, look.

1125
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,400
I didn't want it to be this way either.

1126
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,760
I just want my room back.

1127
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,440
Jesus.

1128
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,960
The kid runs into a...

1129
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,360
I want to put up with this.

1130
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,920
A little hanging.

1131
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,080
I didn't have my room back or else it's war.

1132
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,560
Declaration of war.

1133
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,760
Give me back what is mine or face the consequences.

1134
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:14,980
Okay.

1135
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,020
Okay.

1136
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,520
Okay.

1137
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,500
You got your wish.

1138
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,700
It's got a power drill.

1139
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,540
Last drying foam sealant.

1140
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,500
I'm gonna get this kid.

1141
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,740
This shirt was off in that scene.

1142
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,660
You want me to help you and your buddies.

1143
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,900
To help beat up your grandson and his buddies

1144
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,460
because the two of you can't figure out some way to live in the same place.

1145
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:31,960
Funny.

1146
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,500
Well, when you put it like that...

1147
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,460
I'm in.

1148
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:35,940
What?

1149
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,340
What?

1150
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,140
What?

1151
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,340
This kind of aggression shall not stand sympathize.

1152
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,540
I didn't know you were a marine.

1153
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,100
Oh my god.

1154
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,180
It's because we're walking on a hoverboard.

1155
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,740
Just saying.

1156
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,340
It ain't enough.

1157
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,060
Let's do this.

1158
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,500
Do you even remember how to do this?

1159
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,540
So you don't need your diaper.

1160
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,340
Your shit's blowing up, Justin.

1161
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,260
They're playing dodgeball.

1162
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,620
Why are we doing it this way?

1163
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,900
When you have peace talks, you need someone neutral to mediate.

1164
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,180
He gave me a cookie.

1165
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,700
It is true, a cookie was given.

1166
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:10,980
That is funny.

1167
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,300
That's good.

1168
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,020
Yeah.

1169
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,140
That actually is pretty funny.

1170
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,900
That is funny.

1171
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,900
I think your grandpa might be a ninja.

1172
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,020
We gotta end this somehow.

1173
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,780
He's falling off on a ladder onto a bouncy castle.

1174
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,900
It's dead.

1175
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,260
Did you see that?

1176
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,860
She said he's dead.

1177
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,220
It was Chris for walking towards the sand.

1178
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,860
It's gonna be cool.

1179
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,100
Okay.

1180
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,900
It's so fucking good.

1181
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,700
And then here comes the...

1182
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,380
And there's a snake.

1183
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,420
Yeah, it's like a godfather thing.

1184
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,980
It's like a kind of a godfather thing.

1185
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,620
It's fucking great.

1186
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,740
So that is War with Grandpa coming to theaters.

1187
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,540
What did we say?

1188
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,500
Let's probably not theaters.

1189
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,060
October.

1190
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,540
Oh, no.

1191
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,420
Sorry.

1192
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,060
Sorry, only in theaters.

1193
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,860
So don't even try to see this one.

1194
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,580
That is gonna be...

1195
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,500
I have been very good about this whole quarantine thing.

1196
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,500
That is gonna be sort of an incredible rigid hell for me.

1197
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,940
Too tempting.

1198
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,140
Yeah, too tempting that people are out there loving this movie,

1199
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,700
enjoying this movie, the War with Grandpa.

1200
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,980
Please no spoilers.

1201
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,500
Now listen, there was a moment in that movie, if I'm not mistaken,

1202
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,700
and granted it was playing clearly through Justin's phone,

1203
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:22,340
where Jane Seymour, who is the Maria, I believe,

1204
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,700
is the Maria that he is asking for at the beginning of the grocery store.

1205
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,580
Okay, Justin's putting the pieces together.

1206
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,020
She works at the grocery store.

1207
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,460
She works at the grocery store.

1208
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,020
She, and she, they probably will.

1209
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,340
Yes.

1210
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,580
Okay.

1211
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,980
And she, is she Pete's mom?

1212
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,100
No.

1213
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,340
No.

1214
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,820
Uma Thurman is Pete's mom.

1215
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,300
Yeah.

1216
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,140
Okay, see, this is why I was confused.

1217
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,060
Maria is his sexual partner.

1218
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,860
Yeah, no, they're gonna pork for sure.

1219
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:56,740
Uma Thurman, I imagine, has no knowledge of this conflict.

1220
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,620
That's why I was confused,

1221
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,100
because it did sound as though the mother character was like,

1222
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,540
yeah, let's beat up my son.

1223
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:08,420
No, no, it's, no, it is, I guess it is Salty Ed's lover.

1224
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,420
Yes, so they're going to beat up a child

1225
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,140
as like an aphrodisiac.

1226
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,980
They're gonna try to kick ass.

1227
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,580
And Jane Seymour says it.

1228
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,220
She doesn't even, she's not joking.

1229
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,980
Yeah, she says that, yeah.

1230
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,020
Let's beat up some fucking kids.

1231
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,980
That should be a moment where even if you're Ed,

1232
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,700
and you are craving her wave, right?

1233
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,780
And you have deep beef with your grandson,

1234
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,940
but then this other human being seems very excited.

1235
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,340
That's where you should go like, oh, uh.

1236
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,820
Yeah, you should call somebody about that.

1237
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,060
Man, I would rather, oh, Bob De Niro,

1238
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,660
give me a four alarm ass whip

1239
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,820
and then delete my fucking Minecraft save.

1240
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,260
I'd let that dude just fuck me up with a two by four

1241
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,300
before I let him anywhere near my Minecraft village.

1242
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,500
I'd love it if he was like a 20 minute scene

1243
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,660
of him destroying his Minecraft castle.

1244
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,140
And then Oaks was like, yeah, okay.

1245
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,420
And just reloaded it.

1246
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,980
It's clocking, I got a cloud save, my dude.

1247
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,900
Yeah, it's in the cloud, dumb dumb.

1248
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,780
I, was there also a moment in there

1249
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,860
that was just brushing up against a little stolen valor?

1250
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,340
Yeah, a little bit stolen valor from Chris Walken.

1251
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,260
But you know what?

1252
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,860
Later you see him in a suit.

1253
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,860
Later you see him in a Santa suit.

1254
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,580
So that's stolen valor twice in one trailer, Chris.

1255
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,940
You sure?

1256
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,860
Just gently brushing up stolen valor there.

1257
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,260
Yeah, I'm the real Santa Claus.

1258
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,220
How dare you, sir?

1259
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,220
I need a 10% discount at the movie theaters.

1260
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,700
Oh, holy shit.

1261
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,500
The real one.

1262
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,540
Okay, so the most baffling shot in this trailer,

1263
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,740
if you're watching this trailer,

1264
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,580
you're watching this trailer and you're loving it.

1265
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,540
You're losing it.

1266
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,980
I don't want to distract you too much

1267
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,420
from how much you're enjoying it.

1268
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,300
But I do want to draw your attention to 155,

1269
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,540
where I'm going to give you a shot for shot breakdown

1270
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,220
because I cannot make fucking heads or tails of it.

1271
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,540
Okay.

1272
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,260
Okay, we see in sequence.

1273
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,980
Sorry, let me slow down the playback speed

1274
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,660
to the slowest possible.

1275
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,660
Okay, so we see a shot of,

1276
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,300
at the top of the ladder is Bob De Niro.

1277
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,500
He's hanging Christmas lights.

1278
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,820
Got it.

1279
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,060
He gets shocked by the wire.

1280
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,460
We see an elf look up from the snow

1281
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,380
and Bobby D is falling.

1282
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,820
An elf?

1283
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,100
A little child elf, probably Oaks.

1284
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,820
I think it's Oaks.

1285
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,900
He's dressed as an elf.

1286
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,660
He looks up and sees his grandfather falling.

1287
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,780
The ladder is falling backwards into a bouncy castle.

1288
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,820
And we see a shot of Ed looking very distraught

1289
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,020
in his Santa cap as he falls plummeting.

1290
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,940
Probably he has to assume to his death.

1291
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,260
Yeah, then we see a wide of him falling in the bouncy castle.

1292
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,020
Let's hope it's a stubble.

1293
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,540
Probably I'm just going to say a red herring for the trailer.

1294
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,900
And then the next shot at the cutaway

1295
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:12,340
is someone in a Santa costume landing on the ground.

1296
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,460
That's what I'm saying.

1297
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,060
But it's different.

1298
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,860
It's different.

1299
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,220
It's Santa falling on the ground and it's Christopher Walken.

1300
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,260
So this shot has taken us a composite

1301
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,820
of Bobby D falling into a bounce castle

1302
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,540
and then he rises again as Christopher Walken dressed as Santa.

1303
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,620
Yeah, it's almost like he died.

1304
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,140
And then Oaks Fegley had to go and bring the soul back,

1305
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,780
but the soul got lodged in Christopher Walken, if you will.

1306
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,700
Here's the part that fucking does piss me off.

1307
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:37,940
Okay.

1308
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,220
Oh, this is my favorite segment when we do,

1309
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,940
when we talk about this movie for an hour.

1310
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,860
Listen, just the one thing else.

1311
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,300
Okay, this is maybe the last thing.

1312
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,180
At 201 in the trailer of The War with Grandpa,

1313
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,420
at least on the MovieClips upload,

1314
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,980
at 201, we see a scene of Oaks and Salty Ed hugging.

1315
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,940
Yeah, huh.

1316
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,300
So like, I guess that's how it ends.

1317
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,380
Thanks, right?

1318
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,420
Like, why did we even have the entire fucking war?

1319
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:08,900
Red.

1320
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Apparently at the end of it, they're just going to...

1321
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,860
How am I supposed to get excited about this war with grandpa

1322
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,540
whenever I know it ends with peace?

1323
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,020
Justin, it's a red herring, do not worry.

1324
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,020
That is something they put in the trailer

1325
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,540
that will not be in the actual movie

1326
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,740
because in the end, they mutually assured destruction.

1327
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,940
This is what I've decided now.

1328
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,940
Layers within layers within layers within layers.

1329
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,740
They both put snakes in each other's beds.

1330
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,260
And as the fangs sink in and they feel the injection of venom,

1331
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:40,180
they will both say, we weren't so different, you and I.

1332
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,700
As they stare into each other's eyes

1333
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,980
and die simultaneously like in the notebook.

1334
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,820
Now, I hate to continue to ruin this,

1335
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,020
but we do zoom out to see that Christopher Walken

1336
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,820
has been watching this entire scene play out

1337
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,660
from about three feet away.

1338
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,580
The camera pans down and we see in his hand

1339
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,740
a bottle labeled snake venom entered there.

1340
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,860
And he says, I guess it's true, we are all but shadows.

1341
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,780
And then he walks out the window.

1342
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,220
Yeah, he walks out the window.

1343
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,300
And he's wearing, he's dressed as Santa

1344
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,740
and he falls to his death.

1345
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,100
Okay.

1346
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,020
Yeah, he walks out the window dressed as Santa,

1347
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,220
falls to his death.

1348
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,380
His fingers, lifeless fingers,

1349
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,100
uncurl the bottle of anti-snake venom

1350
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,540
and Uma just starts screaming.

1351
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,540
She knows what's happened, she's lost every year.

1352
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,380
And this is not the first time this has happened to her,

1353
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,300
by the way, we find out about this later,

1354
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,140
but she's already lost an entire extended family

1355
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,580
to snake-related accidents.

1356
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,540
In the distance, there's just a man in a white suit

1357
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,380
who checks something off of a clipboard

1358
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,660
and then vanishes.

1359
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,420
The shitty thing is, it's not even,

1360
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,780
the snakes aren't even because of the war with grandpa,

1361
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,540
it's because the rat chewed through the damn cake.

1362
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:53,860
Yeah.

1363
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,340
Fuck.

1364
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,020
So we don't even learn that till the end.

1365
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,260
Yeah.

1366
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,220
Thank you for listening to our podcast.

1367
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,140
We have run out of...

1368
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,900
We don't have time for a Yahoo or...

1369
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,740
No, we don't have any time for anything in this one,

1370
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,260
but gosh, it was a good discussion

1371
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,300
of the war with grandpa.

1372
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,060
Maybe the best we've ever had.

1373
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,180
One of our top discussions,

1374
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,100
we're gonna keep a really close eye on this flick.

1375
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,220
And what a treat, what a treat we have to look forward to.

1376
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,580
This is just a quick reminder, don't go to movie theaters.

1377
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,580
Don't go to the movie theater, even if it's a fucking goof,

1378
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,580
to go see this movie and send us your ticket stuff

1379
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,500
or whatever, don't, don't, don't do it.

1380
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,580
Well, okay, if you wanna buy a ticket to something

1381
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,700
then not go into the movie.

1382
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,260
That's fine.

1383
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,340
Or this great flick, I'm absolutely into that.

1384
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,100
We have to get to the hundred year war with grandpa.

1385
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,540
Yeah, no problem at all, but thank you.

1386
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,540
Thank you also to...

1387
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,060
No, sorry, we'll do Travis then Griffin.

1388
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,060
Okay, we wrote a how to podcast book

1389
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,380
and we just got like the first like preview copies of it.

1390
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,140
And listen, I'm not just saying this

1391
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,380
because it's our book, it's really good.

1392
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,580
It's like a well-made book, all the pages stay in there

1393
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,900
no matter how hard you flop it around,

1394
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,780
you're gonna love it.

1395
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,300
And it will teach you how to make a podcast

1396
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,700
that you're proud of and it's like fun and funny.

1397
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,660
And funny, Teresa was reading it and laughing out loud

1398
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,500
and it is hard to make Teresa laugh.

1399
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,020
Wow, so there it is.

1400
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:12,740
You can pre-order it.

1401
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,100
Maybe his wife read his podcast.

1402
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,620
She chose to, sir.

1403
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,420
Grim.

1404
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,820
It's called, everybody has a podcast except you.

1405

Sure.

1408
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:21,940
I think.

1409
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,620
No, it's except.

1410
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,100
Except?

1411
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,340
Yep.

1412
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,540
But?

1413
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,260
But would have been better.

00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,260
who's theme song is set apart,

1426
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,620
chopped the album, putting the days to bed

1427
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,980
and also to maximum fun.

1428
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,340
Both of these fucking good guys are the new cool.

1429
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,420
Yep, for sure, for sure.

1430
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,780
I almost feel like maybe we don't do a final Yahoo.

1431
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:02,260
Yeah, I think that's the end of the episode.

1432
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,220
I can do a movies one.

1433
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,100
I have a movies one.

1434
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,860
Here's a final movies one.

1435
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,340
Just cap off our little popcorn bucket to the stars.

1436
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,740
This was sent by Graham Roebuck.

Thanks, Graham.

1438
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,620
It's a Yahoo answer user named Aaron who asks,

1439
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,820
Kevin Smith, if you're out there

1440
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,980
after you and Bruce Willis feud,

1441
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,940
can you still watch and enjoy Bruce Willis movies?

1442
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,780
My name is Justin McElroy.

1445
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,380
I can't believe we've done this.

1446
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,300
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad

1447
