1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, and like, I think it was, it was a deep cut. That would

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,160
be like episode 38, I think? It was back there. No, it was like episode like three.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,280
It was like episode negative eight. We have, as promised, the godfather of

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,240
deep singing rock music. It's soul, I guess. It's soulful. Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,040
Mr. Tom Waits. Hey, everybody. Really, really nice to be here. Thank you. Now, Tom? Yeah.

10
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
First of all, how the fuck did you hear about this show? Because you're like super famous

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,840
and busy all the time. Right. Well, when I was, when I was playing the role of the engineer in

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,480
a film called The Book of Eli with Mr. Denzel Washington, he said- A fellow deep voicer.

13
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,720
Another deep voice fellow. He said to me, there's going to be a podcast that's going to start in a

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,240
few months, and you are really going to want to get into it. Well, let's explain, because before

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,920
we did this as an independent venture, we tried to get it greenlit at Denzel Washington's independent

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,000
film studio. The movies of Eli. It's just called Denzel. Denzel. Right. And he said, Justin, there's

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,920
going to be an advice show for the modern era. There's going to be three brothers, basically.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,280
They're going to take people's questions and they're going to turn them into wisdom. He said,

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,360
it'll be like alchemy. And I said, that's a good line. You should send it to him. Yeah. Everything

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
we say on this show, if you think it's funny, just send a thank you letter to Denzel Washington.

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,040
He said it was- Which you should be doing anyways. Yeah. You should. Yeah. Just to tell him that you

22
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,200
appreciate him. Thomas, can we get a, maybe a few bars of your favorite song that you did?

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,880
You have any requests in particular? How about The Moon and the Devil and the Whiskey Bottle

24
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:57,440
makes three. Okay, here we go. Can I see you tonight on a downtown train? Every night,

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,240
every night is just the same on a downtown train. That's good. That was beautiful. Thanks. God,

26
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,520
so full. You've still got, you've still got it. And by it, I mean, just like upsettingly,

27
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,680
like the devil's voice. You basically have the devil's voice and you, but you still have it.

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Well, thanks. You know, it's a, it's a kind of love it or hate it type thing. You know, a critic

29
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,480
by the name of Daniel Derscholes once said, it sounded like it was soaked in Nevada bourbon,

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car.

31
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,200
So that's kind of what, good line I always thought. Hey guys, April Fools.

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,840
Oh, you were waiting. I know you all were waiting for our goof and our spoof and this was it.

33
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,480
What do you mean? You're not, you're not really Tom Waits. I sound like Tom Waits. You do.

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,720
But that, I mean, I, you're not the person that you sound like. Right. To make it clear though,

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:10,960
that was a goof of necessity. Yeah. Really? Mother Necessity is the inventor of all good goofs and

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:20,880
spoofs. Electricity was originally a goof. Gotcha. He wanted to shock somebody in the tuchus.

37
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,400
Hold this kite with your butt. Pranked him. Hold this butt kite. I'm going to shock you in the

38
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,880
tuchus. Put this, put this key in your anus. I'm going to shock you. Put this key in your butt

39
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,400
for science. Justin, what happened to you? Cause it does sound like your voice got hit by a car.

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,320
I, I got a cold. I can happen. I'm human. No one gave me advice not to get a cold. That's

41
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,160
one of the hazards of having your own show. You guys though, I got to tell you guys, you're lucky

42
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,680
you caught me this early to record because as soon as this show's over, I am going to take a bunch

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,200
of texts from a Thor fan. I'm going to get really high and I'm going to watch, uh, Twin Peaks just

44
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,080
in like a marathon. Don't do that. The original idea that I had was instead of being Tom, Tom

45
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,600
Waits, I wanted to be the weird dwarf. We live in a land filled with music. Well, that's been a great,

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
that's been a dream of yours for a long time, hasn't it? Like you've been wanting to do that

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,480
for a while now. This is my cousin. She looks like Glora Balmer. Can I, can I be the log lady?

48
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,920
Yeah. Hey, what's up everyone? 1989.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,880
Reagan did a great job. I thought just came out on Netflix and sync queue. That means it basically

50
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,560
just came out. Finally, people can see Twin Peaks. Uh, we weren't old enough to watch it the first

51
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,120
time. Hey, uh, let's answer some questions. What do you think? Okay. All right. Get balls deep.

52
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,040
Griffin, I'm going to ask that you take over the question asking for this to preserve what's left

53
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,440
of my dainty pipes. Okay. People are gonna learn that I'm not a good, like the strongest reader.

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,480
You know, I could, I could maybe read a couple now. All right, Travis, go ahead. No, no, no, no.

55
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,080
Travis is right. He's right. Okay. Kill it. Brothers. There's this nice bike. Nope. Stop.

56
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
Stop, stop, stop. No, no, no, no, no. So close your inflection thing. Thank you for the opportunity.

57
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,520
You sound, you sound like you're talking down to the question. Well, okay. Then you do it.

58
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,640
I don't know. I want you to really just give it your all. I want you to do it. I just want you

59
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,960
to do it. Not shitty brothers. There's this nice bike that's been changed to a pole by my job since

60
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,400
October. It's remained unmoved through several snowstorms, hail, rain, and all other bad weather.

61
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,480
I want it. I haven't seen any signs of an owner and I even left my forwarding address on the seat,

62
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,680
but got no response. Would it be terrible if I just clipped the chain and outright took it?

63
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,080
It's starting to rust and that comes from the urban Robin Hood. No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't.

64
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,440
It doesn't come from urban Robin Hood. Robin Hood didn't steal from the missing and keep for himself.

65
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,240
I steal from the absent and keep it. And give to the me.

66
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,200
Um, I, why do you want a bike, dog? Hey, what's up? Public transit not good enough for you?

67
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,520
I think that this is like an age. I have this problem all the time when I'm like stuck at a

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,760
really lengthy red light and there's no one around. There's no other cars in no way. Is this like

69
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,200
a threatening a traffic accident? And I'm like, I could just go. This isn't going to bother anyone.

70
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,480
This is a victimless crime. Yeah. Is what you're saying. Except for the victim of the guy who has

71
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,440
the bike. It has been months. It's been sitting there since October. Oh, since October. Yeah,

72
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,200
that was just an eyesore. Yeah. Is it possible that this is an art installation? You have to be

73
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,440
so careful these days. So careful these days. Half of the things you see on the street are

74
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,000
art installations. And I think there's an equally good chance. It's an angel test.

75
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh my God. Half of the things you see on the street are art installations. The other half

76
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,960
angel tests. Never. They don't ever, they don't ever meet. They're never, they don't ever,

77
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,080
if they meet the world will end. That's true. Um, I, uh, I think that if you want the bike

78
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,960
and you're going to put it to good use, take it. Just chain like a note. This is like,

79
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm sorry, I stole your shit. I owe you one bike. Here's where the bike is. Come get it.

80
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,440
Did somebody maybe, somebody maybe park it there. Maybe somebody had a few

81
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,040
drinks. Some they're riding their bike. Is that legal? I think you can operate a bike.

82
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,240
As long as it doesn't have a motor on it. Right? Okay. Anyway, they're drunk. I'm biking.

83
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,480
There's, there's Denny's workplace. I'm going to chain it up right there and walk the rest of the

84
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,400
way home. Wakes up the next morning. Dude, where's my bike? I don't know. Hey, why don't you take the

85
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,600
bike, but put an ad on Craigslist that says, I got your bike. Got your bike. If you want it, come

86
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,280
talk to me about it. Run, tell that. Come tell me about your bike and I'll, if your bike matches

87
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,600
this bike, I'll give you this bike. It is covered in decals now, but you can have it back. It's

88
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,600
tricked out and I did, I took it off some ramps. So just keep that in mind. I hope you like snakes.

89
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,840
It's now used to adrenaline. Your bike is hooked on adrenaline. I hooked your bike on dread because I

90
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,320
I've been taking off so many ramps and, and half pipes. That's an old wise bike. I feel bad for

91
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,360
that bike. Bikes aren't, a bike chained to a pole is safe, but that's not what bikes are for. They're

92
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,120
for sweet ramps and sweet snake decals. Yep. And deliveries. Man, I want a bike. Yeah, I'll get you

93
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,640
I'll get you one. Don't worry. This next question comes from Miss Molly May 12. That was good.

94
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,640
You'll find it. Yeah. And the question is, how do you act around a guy friend who you just rejected?

95
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,000
Uh, absent. You act like you're not around him. See, I'm going to say, I'm going to say victorious.

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,040
You wear his shame, like some sort of, some sort of belt, like some sort of championship belt. You've

97
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,400
bested him in the field of love. Yeah. In the game of love, he basically forfeit. Like that was the

98
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,560
equivalent of like killing him with the first strike before he even got a couple swings in.

99
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,240
It's his fault. Cause he fucked up. Cause he read the situation so bad. It's like, Oh, Miss Molly May,

100
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,200
she gave me half of her snack pack the other day. Snack pack? Yeah. She gave me half of it

101
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,640
and it was good. So she must love me. Like she must love me. There's no doubt about that. She

102
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,760
gave me half of her Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. So like she's down to fuck. I know this. I know

103
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,080
this thing. That is actually a good tip. Uh, if you could stop doing whatever you're doing,

104
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,440
that is actually a good tip. Uh, if you could stop doing whatever slutty thing made him think

105
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,760
you were a DTF, that would probably help. Is that it? Or is this guy a psychopath? And like,

106
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,360
she made him a friendship bracelet in fourth grade and he's like, Oh, still into it. Gonna have that.

107
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't. You don't owe this guy shit. You beat him. Justin, I, I couldn't tell if you were

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,400
joking or not because you've lost all inflection somewhere in your gravel pit of a voice. But

109
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,760
I think you're right. Like about the being absent thing. I don't think there is a good way to

110
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,800
interact with this dude after you've broken his tiny pitiful heart. I think you just need to walk

111
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,160
away for a while and then come back and be like, Hey, are we cool now? Are we gonna start? No,

112
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,320
you don't think so. I think you got to start fresh. No, fuck that noise. Like he's not going

113
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,680
to chase you off because he advanced and you reposted. Yeah. It may be actually less awkward

114
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,720
for him if you just act like nothing ever happened or more awkward, but regardless, but fuck that guy.

115
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,040
It's like getting fired from a job, but then asked to still complete your work.

116
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
He's the one who set this off. He set it off is what I'm saying. So you shouldn't be the one who's

117
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,880
like, Oh, I better hide. That's a good question. He should be asking us how to hot out after out.

118
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,400
Hey, I don't goofed so hard with my best friend. I goof guys. I wish I'd asked you before I asked

119
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,080
this girl out. Ask us before you do anything. Oh, that's it. Then don't. So after you reject them,

120
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,040
just look at them and say, you're free to go. Now I've booked you an exciting travel package

121
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,080
in the Alps. Fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of my life. Denny Griffin. Yeah, I got you.

122
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,400
Um, I, uh, I was drunk last night, uh, and I ended up asking for Yahoo questions on Twitter,

123
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,120
like eight times. Yeah, you did. I kept forgetting that I had done it. You're like,

124
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,160
my heart's totally eclipsing. Yeah. Give me some Yahoo's. So thank you. Everybody who,

125
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,680
cause people responded each and every time. Okay. Uh, this one was sent in by Louie dog.

126
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:18,320
Uh, it's by Yahoo answers, user hams hams asks what's a gnarly catchphrase to say after I score

127
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:26,880
a touchdown, something, something like protect this house or all day, every day.

128
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,200
Oh my God. There's let me, let me, let me set the bar. K C A M responded.

129
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,840
Fuck you bitches. Fuck you bitches. That's good. That's good. Maximus prime says, I like to call

130
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:52,320
that an old fashioned ass whooping. That's a little wordy. Yeah. I like to touchdown six points.

131
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,840
I like to call that an old fashioned ass whooping. Nobody. Yeah. It's gotta be simple. It's gotta be

132
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,560
something you can just project. You can just shoot out like buckshot from your mouth. When you get

133
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,920
that, that sweet, good six point run and you pick six and a football match. Didn't crack my pants

134
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,440
this time. Too long. You got to shoot, explode. It's just got to explode. Like scored them.

135
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,760
How about that? Eat my farts. See that's good. If like, um, you've just been sacked in the,

136
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,640
in the red zone. You just got that pick six and you get sacked in the red zone, but you scored them

137
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
and you can say, eat my farts. And like, there's a bunch of dudes on top of you. Like the ball

138
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,880
across the plane of score. I got the ball past the plane of score. Eat these farts. That's good.

139
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm the Superman of points.

140
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,360
That'll be pretty good. Um, how about big game? Big game? Yeah. Because like, you're letting

141
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,720
everybody know that this is like a big deal for you. Well, you should just shout momentous. Best

142
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,880
day ever. Um, did you guys see that? There are one of any number of Harry Potter spells that you

143
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,080
could check. That would be perfect. Flipendo. Levitarla. No, that's a Spanish word for live.

144
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:24,880
Expelliarmus. Um, yeah. Summon your expecto, expecto patronum. Yeah. Cause your dad,

145
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,160
cause you want your dad to be able to see it. I wish my dad was here. That's a good one.

146
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,400
I wish my dad was alive. I wish my dad was alive. I wish my dad was alive. I wish my dad was alive.

147
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:44,800
That's a good one. I wish my dad was alive. Dad, check this. Pick six. Ghost dad beat my moves.

148
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:55,920
Cosby. Cosby is so great. Just yell Cosby. See how Cosby I was on that move. And then do the

149
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:04,880
Cosby dance from the Cosby show. I stiff armed him and it was straight cause. Yeah. No joke,

150
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,920
full cause. Cosby swag over here. Maybe you should use your moment of glory to make a statement

151
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,040
that's, that's really important. That's impactful. Okay. Maybe you shout like, like as soon as you

152
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,080
touch down, you're like free Tibet or maybe like, or maybe like bring back Dunkaroos.

153
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,960
Like something like that. Those two things are, are roughly equal on the important spectrum.

154
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,680
In the spectrum of time I spent thinking about them, they're pretty close to equal.

155
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Mm-hmm. I used to, I used to do all my philosophical discussions and ponderings

156
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,440
about the state of Tibet while eating Dunkaroos. And I find that without them,

157
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,560
it's hard to do the first thing too. Exactly. That's exactly my point. Is there a,

158
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,280
is there a, can we boil this down and set of words? Is there a thing you can do with your body?

159
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Wiener out.

160
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,600
See, but you're covered in so much gear and it's hard to get to the, it's, you have like a cup.

161
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,200
Maybe there's pantomime wiener out. Oh, yeah. I don't know. And then kind of a back and forth

162
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,480
swing, which you guys can't see me because I'm of course speaking into a microphone,

163
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:20,400
but I totally just did. I've known you for 23 years. I know when you're pretending to pantomime

164
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,080
a dick swing. Maybe pantomime is something from another sport. Like you score a touchdown,

165
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,480
then pantomime shooting a free throw. Wouldn't that be, because people won't know what you're doing.

166
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,520
What if you're like Michael Jordan and you're proficient at every sport and also my best friend

167
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
and then every sport you do, you do something fucking awesome. And then you do a thing from

168
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,680
the other sport. Or like one step further and like pantomime reading a book, pantomime pouring some

169
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,160
tea. Yeah, right. Exactly. Kiss one of them on the mouth. What if you sat on the ground and

170
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,840
scooted your butt across the grass like a dog? Hey, get off of there. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Make

171
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,280
the ref come over and swat you on the nose. When you score a touchdown, just kind of meander around

172
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,680
and look real confused. Did I do it? What was that? What if while you play football, you just

173
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:24,240
constantly yell what you're doing? I'm running. Pass. Catch. Sack. Avoid. Juke. Juke. Steroids.

174
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,880
Fake punt. Oh shit. Dog fights. So Justin, I want you to know I've never fully appreciated

175
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,640
your job as the question reader. But like the feeling of when it's time to move on to a new

176
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,000
question is something like I think it's a science. I think it's an art that I don't have yet. But I

177
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,200
feel like that time is now. Yeah, the touchdown question ended like four minutes ago. I know.

178
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Do aliens exist? My boyfriend is terrified and thinks that he's been abducted before.

179
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,400
He watches UFO videos a lot and has shown me some. And sometimes they look very real. It's

180
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,200
not that I'm not open to the possibility. I'm just worried that he thinks and worries too much about

181
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,480
it. Are they real? What should I do? And that comes from Steph from Gmail. You know what looks real?

182
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:21,360
Independence Day. Yeah, those looked real. Are they real? Absolutely. In this in this crazy,

183
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:28,800
like huge universe. Yeah. I think the chances that we are like the only planet with habitation,

184
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,360
I mean, it's it might be true, but I think that that is a little ridiculous to assume.

185
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,560
But I also think it's ridiculous to assume that if there are other creatures on other planets,

186
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,560
they totes want to come down and take us like. No, they want to they'd want to hang out.

187
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah. Well, that's a pretty cool species. But it's like me thinking that because there's people

188
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,320
in other countries, they want to come kidnap me like just because other people exist in the

189
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,760
world in the galaxy doesn't mean they want to come get you. That's a good question.

190
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,120
They just want to come down and hang. Yeah. Yeah. And if they were going to abduct someone,

191
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,320
why wouldn't they take like George Clooney or the president? I don't know what. Explain to me your

192
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,520
thought. Like, why? Why would they take those people? Well, because they are important. That's

193
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,400
fine. But as we've established, these aliens just want to bro down. Right. They just want to hang.

194
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,600
They just want to hang with some cool bros and like watch watch a movie or something. So they

195
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,480
just came down to like check out the chicken wing situation and they came down and they abducted the

196
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:40,000
president. They would be fucked. The whole planet would be on lockdown. Like a full blown ID4 panic

197
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,800
and nobody they don't want that to happen. So the stakes are too high in that situation. So instead,

198
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,400
they want to take like Jimmy from Sheboygan and just like chill fucking want to take a game

199
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,800
bro out. Yeah. Crack up. Crack a heinie. By which I mean a Heineken and not his not his but

200
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,560
although they may do that, too, because they're aliens, those fucking nasty aliens. Gross. Up

201
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,480
until that moment, aliens were starting to sound pretty cool. Yeah. Always that always that loophole

202
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,240
by which I mean your butt. It's not they're not doing it to they don't know what they're doing.

203
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,240
That's how they talk in their in their language. They talk telepathically and.

204
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,720
But a path of rec rec. Yeah. Rectal level. Rectal path. Rectal allowably.

205
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,160
Megalovale. Suppositorily. I think Stephanie should tell your boyfriend. I think of worrying about

206
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,160
aliens is sort of like Todd Snyder, a singer songwriter. Todd Snyder says about a gay marriage.

207
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,440
What do you say? That's that's something that worries people that ain't got shit all else to

208
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,760
be worried about. And I think that your boyfriend needs to get worried about some real things.

209
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,280
He's worried about you. If you're happy, your happiness, financial stability. That's a real

210
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,080
thing. Global warming. Libya. What's going on over there? I don't know. Superflu. Superflu.

211
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah. The oncoming pandemic. There's all kinds of shit. What do you mean oncoming? You sound like

212
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,920
like you sound like. Well, I'm patient zero, so I like a bunch of rocks in a bucket right now.

213
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,040
You've got it already. You're hurting my feelings. No, I'm saying it's a good sound.

214
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,600
It's OK. Oh, you like it. Yeah. But you do sound like a bunch of rocks just

215
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,240
shuffling around in a bucket. Sure. I get it. Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,320
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo for us that you might be able to toss our way? Yeah,

217
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,080
I I have like sixty six and I'll do one of them. OK, thank you. This one was sent in by Rob Starabin.

218
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,880
Thanks. It's by Yahoo Answers user Mr. Chocolate, but asks.

219
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I am looking to start my own porn website. I'm serious. Only answer if you have suggestions.

220
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,120
But we are like we're made of suggestions and names for content. I want to start a website

221
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,320
because porn is a billion dollar industry. I feel as though this could be one of the easiest things

222
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,360
to do. I visit these sites. Doesn't seem to be much to do. Any suggestions on how to get the site

223
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,320
up and running. I can take care of the other details. See, it does. It seems easy, but there's

224
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,200
a lot of administrative decisions that you have to make when setting up this this sort of website.

225
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,560
And setting up this this sort of like you. You need a business plan is what I'm saying.

226
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,280
So wait, I'm confused here as to what exactly he's like, how to put something on the Internet.

227
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,560
I mean, that that seems he doesn't seem to mention any specifics like. Yeah, I dig this guy because

228
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,240
he's saying I have lots of videos of women having sex. Well, I just don't. It's women. Do we know

229
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,800
it's not like alpacas? Do I have something? Alpaca porn is a billion dollar industry. Can you

230
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,400
explain to me what is it just alpacas fucking? Well, there's some romance there, too. I mean,

231
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,880
it's not just fucking. Oh, it's all about the story. Yeah. Are you saying the plot? Yeah.

232
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,960
You know, like there's not about that. Like an alpaca delivery man rolls up and he's like,

233
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,680
hey, I brought these alpacas you were looking for. And she's like, but I've already got six alpacas.

234
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,880
But then they find that they have a lot in common. And then the alpacas fuck.

235
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,520
Okay. Oh, cool. I've heard. It's not that I've ever seen that or anything.

236
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,920
No, no, no. This I mean, this guy asked for suggestions. Alpacas fucking romantically.

237
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,520
Romantically fucking. Yeah. I mean, it's it's sensual. It's not like there's no like

238
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
there's no like anger in it or anything. I mean, it's just very sweet. And then they

239
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,120
kind of you would be you would probably think there was anger because alpacas make

240
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,720
weird noises when they're not fucking. I can only imagine like mid coitus, like the kind of grunts

241
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,520
that those things can produce. It's the worst. It sounds like that. Like it sounds like Justin

242
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,160
right now. Yeah. And I said my voice sounds like bourbon soaked alpacas that have been hit by a car

243
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,160
and then fucking while fucking. And then they fucked afterwards because they were so happy

244
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,240
to be alive. We make it. Let's suck the marrow out of this, Deborah.

245
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,200
All right. Carpe my alpaca tape.

246
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,600
I've got a notepad and a pin out. I'm writing number one. Alpaca fucking. Mm hmm. This spitball.

247
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
What about alpaca farming? I hear that's a billion dollar a year industry too.

248
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,520
That's as long as we're at it. You can get what about full house slash Vic?

249
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:46,960
Oh, my God. That always goes down right. Can you? I almost hesitate to ask.

250
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,040
Don't Google it. I don't think you want me to do this. This is I've been working on this one.

251
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,920
This is my magnum opus, you guys. It's a Danny Joey romance.

252
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,840
This one I call it a novella. It's pretty long. It's called Late Night, San Francisco,

253
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,160
Danny Joey Mida. So we're workshopping the title.

254
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,640
Workshopping the title, but check it totally out. Going to give you some rad boners.

255
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,600
And it's got maybe a little bit of nostalgia, too.

256
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,120
It's got MMM. It's got MFM. MFM. And it's got MMF.

257
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:32,480
It's got Comet. Comet's in the mix. Yeah, but I made him an alpaca, so.

258
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,200
They make Kimmy Gibbler watch. I made Comet an alpaca,

259
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
and I made Kimmy Gibbler watch. So it's it's a pretty messed up story.

260
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,520
But you're really going to like the plot twists. Don't forget to comment if you dig it.

261
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,320
What about fucking ghosts? Has anybody done that yet?

262
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,520
About fucking ghosts, because that opens up a lot of doors.

263
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:02,320
Because it could be it could either be a really high fi, like Ghostbusters II production,

264
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,120
where you can fuck any woman in history. In history, if you've got the SFX right,

265
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,760
if you get what works on that, if you get the like the Peter Jackson industrial light and

266
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,280
magic and sound on that, that could be a high quality, very erotic porno.

267
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:25,440
Or you can lo-fi it and just have you fucking the air.

268
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,240
And you're like, pretend that you're fucking a ghost.

269
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
You don't have to have a second party there.

270
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Hey, it's me, Madam Curie.

271
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,760
Let's do it on top of this stack of Nobel prizes that I won.

272
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,680
You and me, buddy. It's a working radio activity,

273
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,680
and I'm going to do some work on radio act-dickety.

274
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:54,080
Well, on that note, ghosts, full house, alpaca,

275
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
one of those three is sure to be taking right to money.

276
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
Or all three. What about all three together?

277
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah. Hey, Danny, yes, Joey, I'm enjoying having sex with you,

278
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,760
but what's with this ghostly alpaca?

279
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,840
This spectral tiny llama, what's his deal?

280
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,320
If you could just shore him and make me a coat from his ghost fur,

281
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,800
I bet we could fetch a high price.

282
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh, you're always thinking about money while we're trying to make love.

283
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
What do you think about the name-

284
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,600
Classic jelly.

285
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,640
Specter Smut. What do you think about that?

286
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,200
I like it.

287
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,480
Just for a site name.

288
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,080
I like it. You'd have to buy it from that 70s funk band,

289
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,160
but I think other than that, it'd be okay.

290
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:45,600
How do you feel about the name Full House Fuller Buttholes?

291
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,480
I like it a lot.

292
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,920
So I think it's time-

293
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,200
How do you feel about the name-

294
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,760
Oh, God.

295
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,400
You can call me Alpaca Pornography, but you put the emphasis on the Al.

296
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,800
I think you can get that URL for sure.

297
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,480
Yeah. We can GoDaddy it. No, we can't.

298
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,800
Yeah. How did that guy fuck up that bad?

299
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,960
Hey dog, you did a really bad job.

300
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,240
Hey dog, you owned the internet basically.

301
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,880
Like anytime anyone's like, I need a website.

302
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
There's like one dude in the game, or maybe there are more dudes,

303
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,160
but in their minds, it's like, oh, this one dude's got this whole game on lockdown.

304
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,360
And the only thing you have to do to keep the internet on lockdown

305
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
was not shoot an elephant.

306
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,720
The only thing you had to do was not shoot an elephant.

307
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,600
You could even shoot an elephant as long as you don't video it

308
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,040
and put it on YouTube.

309
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,360
You silly bitch, you had the internet.

310
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
Do that in your secret time.

311
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,080
Don't tell people about it.

312
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,480
I like to shoot things I shouldn't do, but I don't go around squawking.

313
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,040
Yeah. I'm sure Facebook like organizes his own like bum fight rings.

314
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:49,920
Yeah.

315
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,400
But God damn, he's got the common sense not to put it on the YouTube.

316
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
Don't shoot elephants, everybody.

317
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,280
What happened? Do people like elephants?

318
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,160
Yeah, dude. Like everybody likes elephants, I think.

319
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,920
Everybody loves elephants and Raymond.

320
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,840
Hey, Griffin, I, I, uh, if you want to see elephants,

321
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,280
you got to take a journey.

322
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,080
Oh man.

323
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
This is a trip.

324
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,760
All right.

325
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
I can already tell this is not your best,

326
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,080
but, uh, I'm not in the mood to see elephants.

327
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:36,960
So I'd rather take a trip to the money zone.

328
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,160
What do you want from me?

329
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,440
Like what you expecting?

330
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,320
I just want a touch of class.

331
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
You thought I'd do it again?

332
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
There was something more insightful.

333
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Guys, this is a special money zone trip.

334
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,520
Oh, good.

335
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,960
It's our first personal message.

336
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,560
It's from, um, it's from listener Tony Zito.

337
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,440
Uh, and Tony Zito, uh, wants to thank his lovely friend whose name is Grace

338
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,320
because Grace is looking after his cat for six weeks.

339
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,560
While Tony Zito is in Tibet.

340
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,560
I don't know what he's doing.

341
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,080
I'm assuming he's in Tibet, just partying or freedom,

342
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,080
freedom and bringing Dunkaroos back in the style.

343
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,160
Um, and Grace is doing this shit for free.

344
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,320
Have you guys ever taken care of a cat before?

345
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
No, it's hard, hard work.

346
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
It's like the hardest work.

347
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,640
Um, so he provided us with funds and we are shouting her out.

348
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,520
Um, Travis, why don't you say something nice about Grace?

349
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,560
Um, well, she sounds really great.

350
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,600
Um, oh God.

351
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,880
Um, and I trust her not to kill that cat.

352
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,280
You fucking dumb shit.

353
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,000
It's right there on the sheet though.

354
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,240
Okay.

355
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,720
Here.

356
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,680
She is obviously the sweetest and a great friend.

357
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,040
Well, if you're going to be shitty about it, God damn it.

358
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,520
I think we need to hire her to watch you for a week.

359
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,240
Well, I'm sure that Tony's cat, Prebella, um, is, is super grateful.

360
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,080
Yeah.

361
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,400
Griffin's a lot like grace cause he's going to have to clean up your shit for a month.

362
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,240
Hey, do you, do you guys know, um, where these crazy kids met?

363
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,280
No.

364
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:26,160
Tell me the maximum funtastic convention, which is shortened to max fun con.

365
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,000
I did not know that.

366
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,120
That's not true, but they met there.

367
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,640
If you guys want to meet some friends, you're going to have to wait till next year.

368
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,720
Cause I'm pretty sure it's all sold out.

369
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,360
Um, but man, that joint is going to be a party.

370
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,040
I bet it's going to be blown up.

371
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
Uh, she has a little bit of a TV addiction from what I hear.

372
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
What do you think she's into right now?

373
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,440
I don't know.

374
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,560
He's got that sweet cable.

375
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,360
She's probably, she's probably really into a show about cake.

376
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,880
She used to be a lot of that these days.

377
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,520
Cake wives, cake wives.

378
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,600
That's the wives of men who make cakes.

379
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
Sister cake about cakes that are sisters.

380
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,080
I love this cake.

381
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
If you love this cake so much, why don't you marry it?

382
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
I already did sister cakes.

383
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,640
I like cake hunters international because they go all over the country and look for the greatest cake.

384
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Have you guys ever watched river cake monsters?

385
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,680
Hey, you know what?

386
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,360
I like dirty cakes with micro.

387
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah, get this.

388
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,880
This cake has a tire on it.

389
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Why did you, why did you leave my cake in a sewage treatment plant?

390
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,760
This cake is ruined.

391
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,880
So, um, she has her own business cleaning houses and taking care of babies.

392
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,600
What's it called?

393
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,520
Give me a name or give her a name.

394
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,920
What?

395
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,960
For a business.

396
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,920
Babes and suds.

397
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,720
Babes and suds.

398
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,640
Baby with the bathwater.

399
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,800
Baby and bathwater.

400
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,520
Bathwater.

401
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,840
Yes.

402
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,680
You nailed it.

403
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,040
So thank you to Grace.

404
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,680
Thank you, Grace.

405
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,480
Thank you, Tony.

406
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,000
You guys are going to be best friends forever.

407
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,360
For life.

408
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,760
For life.

409
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,080
If you ever split up, don't tell us about it.

410
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
Well, like break up, like friend break up.

411
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah.

412
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,720
Friend break up.

413
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,600
Okay.

414
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,040
Maybe that'll happen.

415
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,720
If Purbella, say, um, goes on a trip to heaven.

416
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
To a farm with a lot of other kiddies.

417
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,840
That's not funny.

418
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,440
Don't joke about a man's cat eye.

419
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,480
Okay, I won't.

420
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,760
Purbella's fucking dead.

421
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,240
What's up?

422
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,600
But listen, we don't just do personal messages on the show.

423
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,440
We like, we like businesses too.

424
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,280
I prefer business actually.

425
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,400
I actually prefer, Grace, you're great, but you're not a business.

426
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,560
I have a heart for industry.

427
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,440
My mom always said.

428
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,360
We're tycoons of business.

429
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,240
Robber barons.

430
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,840
We're carpetbaggers of the business industry.

431
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,920
Cool.

432
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,360
So is there a business?

433
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,400
I just want to keep going.

434
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,720
You think there's, is there any certain business or just like,

435
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
we celebrate the idea of corporate.

436
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,920
Well, let me, let me pitch.

437
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,120
Let me pitch to you this.

438
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,080
Okay.

439
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,560
Hit me.

440
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,000
Have you ever wished that you lived, we'll say a decade in the future.

441
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,080
10 whole years in the future.

442
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,920
Where business is no more.

443
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,040
It's a dystopian, dystopian, wasteland, business free.

444
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,640
Okay.

445
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,240
You know, I'd never wish that.

446
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,120
Can it be like a, um, one of those futures where like businesses run the whole show?

447
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Okay.

448
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
So not dystopian.

449
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,920
It's fully topian.

450
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm the last free man though.

451
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,240
Like I'm the last like non-corporate man.

452
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,560
When everyone else is branded with the sigils of industry.

453
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,520
Yeah.

454
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
Justin is free.

455
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm on the run.

456
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
Justin's on the run.

457
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
And I need flexibility.

458
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
I need something flattering.

459
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,080
Yes.

460
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,880
Where?

461
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,280
Yeah.

462
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,520
You need, obviously this is a ballsy move.

463
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,800
So you need something that is really going to showcase your whole dick to the people,

464
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
to the business tycoons.

465
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,880
It's going to make your dick so aerodynamic.

466
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
It's not even funny.

467
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,960
Your dick will seem like it's been fletched by an aeromaker for maximum.

468
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
The finest aeromaker.

469
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,440
My dick has been fletched by the finest aeromaker and now it sails through the wind.

470
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,240
Thank you, Rootsuit.

471
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,960
This, this, this innovation is called a Rootsuit.

472
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Um, and, uh, I don't think we can describe it with our voices.

473
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,040
You, this is a Rootsuit is really something you need to Google and you will Google it.

474
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,880
And you'll, you will say it does look like his dick's been fletched, um, or vagina.

475
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,380
Uh huh.

476
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,640
Since these are, these are, um, these are high quality suits for ladies and men.

477
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,480
What are they, Griffin?

478
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,200
What are they?

479
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,840
All right.

480
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,440
They're, they're very futuristic.

481
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,880
First off, just off the bat.

482
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,880
Um, they are flatteringly, they fit flatteringly on your frame.

483
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,360
Um, they hug.

484
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,800
It's like wearing a suit that's hugging you the entire time.

485
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,240
What is the purpose of this?

486
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,680
Why would I wear this suit?

487
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,000
Um, to look futuristic.

488
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
Okay.

489
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,680
And the details that were provided, it says it's great for Harry Potter fans.

490
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,160
Oh yeah.

491
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,280
I don't understand that.

492
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Don't recall.

493
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,280
Is it maybe for like sporting events?

494
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,480
Like I'd wear a multicolored Rootsuit and, uh, and then I root for the home team.

495
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,320
It could be that.

496
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,480
I think you're making a statement, you know, with a Rootsuit.

497
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,200
In this economy, I think that the greatest thing about it, it is 100% American.

498
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,840
Not one of those foreign Rootsuits you hear about.

499
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,680
They are based in New Orleans.

500
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
100% American made.

501
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,800
Do you know what it is?

502
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,520

503
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
look like Pepsi man.

504
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,760
It's a good look.

505
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,440
It's a cool look.

Sports, interpretive dance.

Scaring the fuck out of your kids.

513
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,400
Scare.

514
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,960
Oh my God.

515
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
These things are kind of fucking scary.

516
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,280
But just because you can't see their face.

517
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,400
If you, if you're superheroing, obviously.

518
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
Oh God, yes.

519
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,480
If you want to recreate the buddies from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

There you go.

So they want people to like their Facebook page.

523
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,680
If you're too broke for Spanx.

524
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Yeah, these are full body Spanx.

525
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,280
Oh man.

526
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,920
You know what?

527
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,480
I need to tone down my neck.

528
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,680
If I could just like Spanx my neck down a little bit.

529
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,280

541
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
What color should it be to support my brother?

542
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,700
Yellow.

543
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:08,800
Yellow.

544
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
Bright yellow.

545
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:09,920
Yeah.

546
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,320
You want people to look like a pee pee person?

547
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,520
And then write mustard across your chest.

548
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
Yes, yes.

549
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,200
I would appreciate that.

550
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,520
As long as it's condiment themed or condom themed.

551
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,400
And you're going to like what you see when you Google Rootsuit.

552
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,560
If you get a yellow Rootsuit, a red Rootsuit, and like a green Rootsuit,

553
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
and do like mustard, ketchup, and relish,

554
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,760
you'll be like the coolest fucking people at the ball game.

555
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,600
But people are going to know that that's my bim-bam.

556
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,760
Like we're not, we're not here.

557
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
We're just really into toppings.

558
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
Yeah. Hi, we're the Condiment Brothers.

559
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,480
But we'll know.

560
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,040
You know us.

561
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,600
We'll know.

562
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,120
Griffin.

563
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,840
Oh my God, I have to do a jingle.

564
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,800
Yeah, and I need you to do a jingle about Tony Zito's friend, Grace.

565
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,760
Okay.

566
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,960
And Rootsuits.

567
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,040
Oh, well that should be easy to portmanteau.

568
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,560
Let me just portmanteau that together.

569
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,200
Thank you.

570
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,080
Oh my God.

571
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,040
I really forgot.

572
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,560
No pre-pro?

573
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,160
No pre-pro on this one.

574
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,480
All right.

575
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
That's my chord progression.

576
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,080
All the best songs start out with the singer saying,

577
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,280
that's my chord progression.

578
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,160
Who's that whispering in the trees?

579
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,880
It's two sailors and they're on leave.

580
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,520
Pipes and chains and swinging hands.

581
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,800
Who's your daddy?

582
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,240
Yes, I am.

583
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,320
Fat cat came to play.

584
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,440
Now he can't run fast enough.

585
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,600
You had best stay away when the pushers come to shove.

586
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,640
Rootsuit riot.

587
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,920
Rootsuit riot.

588
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,700
Grace.

589
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,740
Grace, it's time to feed the cat.

590
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,340
Throw back a bottle of beer.

591
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,940
Pull a comb through that cat's black hair.

592
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,460
Rootsuit riot, yeah.

593
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Rootsuit riot.

594
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Rootsuit riot.

595
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,400
Nope.

596
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,460
I loved it.

597
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,220
That's Rootsuit.com.

598
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,260
Travis hit me with a new question.

599
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,780
Rootsuit riot.

600
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,060
I think if I took it to the minor.

601
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,620
You're done.

602
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,500
You're out.

603
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,780
Travis, next.

604
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,420
I'm a young college student and I'm having some issues with my wardrobe.

605
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,060
You see, I really like dress shirts because I feel like they make me look classier,

606
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,180
even on a bad day.

607
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,620
So I tend to wear them a lot.

608
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,460
I just have a nice shiny silver watch that I wear to try to classify.

609
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,660
I just have a nice shiny silver watch that I wear to try to class myself up as well.

610
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,820
The issue is that because we are in college,

611
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,060
a lot of my friends don't feel like putting in the effort to avoid looking sloppy unless

612
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,180
they're going out.

613
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,620
And when I'm hanging out with them, I feel awkward and overdressed.

614
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Is there a way to beat this feeling without having to hang up the dress shirts for good?

615
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,780
Or do I just have to surrender to the slob and stop giving a shit?

616
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,380
Hopefully handsome Hawkeye.

617
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,820
Oh, I don't think I think you should always look as classy as you possibly can.

618
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,580
I completely agree.

619
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,300
No one.

620
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Do you guys know that every time we record the show, I'm wearing sleep pants and wearing

621
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,860
a T-shirt, but I'm also wearing a boutonniere.

622
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,380
That's fancy.

623
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,020
I like that.

624
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,140
That's a classy touch.

625
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,620
I'm wearing a cummerbund and nothing else.

626
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,500
I should have been.

627
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,100
I am also wearing a cummerbund and that's why I keep the boutonniere pin.

628
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,780
I think that, you know,

629
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,100
I think that, you know, like I've never.

630
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,540
I think if you got to be one of them, you've got to be overdressed or underdressed.

631
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,820
You always want to be overdressed.

632
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,460
Yeah, sure.

633
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,140
You always want to be the classiest guy in the place.

634
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,940
Because you can flip that around.

635
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,540
It's like, hey, what's up?

636
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,580
Fancy pants for a game.

637
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,940
You'd be like, yeah, I look nice.

638
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,740
Like, look, you're nice.

639
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,580
And I feel nice about the way I look.

640
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,740
Yeah, I look like, you know, I don't.

641
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,900
I don't think I've ever felt too under too overdressed to go somewhere.

642
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,220
But I've definitely felt too underdressed.

643
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,220
Like when I've just finished like building a set and I'm covered in paint and dirt and everything.

644
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,380
I'm not going out somewhere classy like that.

645
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,580
But man, it always feels nice to get dressed up.

646
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,860
Like I did.

647
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,660
I did one time wear khakis to a comic book convention to Mid-Ohio Con.

648
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,420
And I got I actually got some shit from people there because I did you.

649
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:32,820
Yeah.

650
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,940
Well, that's because khakis are like the worst clothing ever.

651
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,100
Yeah, I was young.

652
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:38,660
I didn't know.

653
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,540
Yeah, I know.

654
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,580
I have I have a certain amount of vehemence towards khakis.

655
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,140
I hate them.

656
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,460
Because you got to wear them for work.

657
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,540
Well, that and like khakis say, hey, I want to get dressed up.

658
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,700
But without all the hassle of getting dressed up.

659
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,140
Like, it's just such a sloppy commitment to getting dressed up.

660
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,380
Just put on some dress pants and commit to it.

661
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,340
So you're saying khakis are like fancy, ugly jeans, basically.

662
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:00,580
Yes.

663
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,980
Fancy, ugly sweatpants.

664
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,020
Yes, that's exactly.

665
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,940
Because they they're supposed to be fancy, but everybody knows they're actually totally cash.

666
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,180
Yep.

667
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,660
Fuck khakis.

668
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,460
That's our new motto.

669
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:11,940
Fuck khakis.

670
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,900
Fuck khakis.

671
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,900
You also get the benefit of you get the benefit with with addressing too classy.

672
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,500
It's a lot easier to unclass an outfit, you know, untuck the shirt, undo a button.

673
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,620
It's a lot easier to do that than it is to like tuck in your T-shirt and straighten your collar

674
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,180
that you don't have.

675
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,740
Yeah, I was going to say that's a fucked up T-shirt.

676
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,060
Yeah, pretty gross T-shirt.

677
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,020
Is that the new style?

678
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,540
I guess.

679
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,420
I can't keep up.

680
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,620
I think that from what I remember of college, God knows.

681
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:49,380
I never understood the idea of like rolling out of bed and rolling up to class in like

682
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,220
pajama pants and your scuzzy T-shirt and shit.

683
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,820
Like, I don't get it.

684
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,820
It seems like you're putting so much effort into looking like you didn't put any effort

685
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,780
into your outfit.

686
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,820
Like, I just don't get it.

687
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,100
Like, I don't get, hey, we're young, attractive people.

688
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
So let's make ourselves look like shit.

689
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,540
Like, just put in a little effort, clean yourselves up.

690
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,460
Yeah, you're in your sexual prime.

691
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:13,700
Yeah.

692
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,900
Get some partners going.

693
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,500
Don't waste it on that.

694
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,020
Take those sweatpants off.

695
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,020
Take off those fucking khakis and get yourself some partners.

696
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,700
Get yourself some partners.

697
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,300
You're in your sexual prime.

698
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,820
Dress to impress.

699
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,100
You're good to go.

700
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,220
Dress to undress.

701
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,460
Dress to undress, yes.

702
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,300
Dress to undress.

703
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,660
That's magical, Travis.

704
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,420
You hit a, go get that on a T-shirt.

705
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,860
Sorry to do that.

706
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,580
Or a dress shirt.

707
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,780
On a dress shirt.

708
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,300
Get an Airbrush dress shirt.

709
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,100
Do you guys, do you guys want a yahoo?

710
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,460
Yes, please.

711
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,380
Yeah, give me a yahoo.

712
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,700
Too bad.

713
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:56,980
You don't get one.

714
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,180
What?

715
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,540
Instead, guys, you know what we did?

716
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:08,740
We tore another page off of our Gregorian,

717
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,420
our Gregory Hines calendar.

718
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,420
We tore it right off and we threw it away.

719
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,860
And now it says I'm real.

720
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,380
Shit.

721
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,980
It's time for a new monthly observance.

722
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,900
God damn it.

723
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,820
I did not put in the pre-pro required to choose one.

724
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,740
So we're going to have to do it like we did it last month.

725
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,180
Oh, good.

726
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,620
That was much better, I thought.

727
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,900
I'm just going to name off some shit.

728
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,420
And when you think we've struck gold,

729
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,180
then we'll just dig right into that thing.

730
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:32,580
Okay.

731
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,700
It's like pre-pro during, it's like during pro.

732
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,340
Cur pro.

733
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,700
Cur pro.

734
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,860
Atlanta food and wine month.

735
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,660
No, I'm not.

736
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,700
I don't know why Atlanta's getting its own shit.

737
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,140
Brussels sprouts and cabbage month.

738
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,100
Cranberries and gooseberries was.

739
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,660
There it is.

740
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,380
That's pretty funny.

741
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,780
I didn't know.

742
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,420
That's really good.

743
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,300
I didn't know gooseberries was the, was an actual thing.

744
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,300
Yeah, go figure.

745
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,100
Go fig.

746
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,500
Emotional overeating awareness month.

747
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,420
It makes you really disgusted when people have read.

748
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,380
Is that an emotion?

749
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,020
Does that count?

750
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,100
I'm repulsed by you, Becky.

751
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,100
Grilled cheese month.

752
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,180
What's her to say?

753
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,780
Who does it?

754
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,540
Who doesn't love grilled cheese yet?

755
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,100
It is, it is Grange month.

756
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,340
But I don't know if that means it's love Grange month.

757
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,100
Cause I can fucking totally.

758
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

759
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:28,500
It's.

760
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,220
Hey, that's good.

761
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,380
Try.

762
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:29,780
Thank you.

763
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,300
It's like having the top right here.

764
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,060
I wish I could stop you though.

765
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,540
That's a different.

766
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,660
No, just keep going.

767
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,220
Keep going.

768
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,780
We'll just, the rest of the podcast is going to be Travis singing Grange.

769
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,700
And I'll do the guitar part.

770
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,460
Holy humor month.

771
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,540
What?

772
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
I think holy humor month is our best one so far.

773
00:47:51,540 --> 00:48:00,340
There's also home improvement time, because it's not exclusively a month.

774
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,460
It's just the time of home improvement.

775
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,260
It's an entire month to appreciate the comedy of Tim Allen.

776
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,380
Have you ever wondered what Jonathan Taylor Thomas is doing these days?

777
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,420
It doesn't matter.

778
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,340
All of her improvements on DVD.

779
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,060
Just go get it.

780
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,860
Month of the young child.

781
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,540
National decorating month.

782
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,500
It seems awfully.

783
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,660
Can I say something about Tim Allen?

784
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,500
I don't care for the man's comedy.

785
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,220
Let's just hold on.

786
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,780
Let's stop.

787
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,100
Let's just do home improvement time.

788
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,500
Okay.

789
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:28,820
Okay.

790
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,060
I want to say something about Tim Allen.

791
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,580
This is a public service message from your friends and my brother, my brother, me.

792
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,060
Okay.

793
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:42,100
I don't enjoy the man's comedy myself, but do you realize what kind of a sailor you are?

794
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:50,660
To walk into the studio exec's office and say, I'm going to make a show about a guy who hosts

795
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,380
a home improvement show, and he has a fat bearded friend and a man that lives in a fence.

796
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,580
Can I have a million dollars?

797
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,660
Let's run this for 12 seasons.

798
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,700
I want to run this for, it's going to run for 12 years.

799
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,500
It's about a man and a fence and a dwarf.

800
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,700
When you say man and a fence, he sounds like some sort of fable.

801
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,220
Hi, my name is Wilson.

802
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,180
I'm a fable.

803
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,700
I'm your neighbor.

804
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,500
Here's some wisdom.

805
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,300
You did Grant Wishes.

806
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,620
Everybody on that show, I think they all sort of simultaneously realized they weren't going

807
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,460
to do any better work, and then just kind of fell off, right?

808
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,740
Do you know how many executive producers that show has?

809
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,220
I don't know how many executive producers that show has.

810
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,740
Right? Do you know how many executive producers that show had?

811
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,460
Um, I bet you're going to tell me.

812
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,980
Nine.

813
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,620
That just seems to me.

814
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,300
So here's the public service message, okay?

815
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:43,540
Okay.

816
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,100
I feel like your life is directionless.

817
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,940
They probably need someone to executive produce home improvement.

818
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,500
Why not go over there and put in an app?

819
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,900
My brother, my brother, right?

820
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,100
That show's been off the air for like 13 whole years.

821
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:58,900
But they're still making it.

822
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,700
Well, what are these guys doing?

823
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,220
I mean, they're still making it.

824
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:01,940
It's just not being-

825
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,780
They're still making it.

826
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,460
We still make home improvement.

827
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,060
You might not see it.

828
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:08,900
It was part of that.

829
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,980
You know how we have a strategic oil reserve?

830
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,220
We have a strategic reserve of home improvement episodes.

831
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,060
The price of home improvement is so high.

832
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,660
We have got to bring it down.

833
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,260
Somebody send out some VHSs.

834
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:26,020
Well, ever since the war in Libya started and Muammar Gaddafi started like hoarding

835
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:30,900
his home improvement, like we've had to start slowly releasing our home improvement to keep

836
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,340
the costs down.

837
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,620
Hey, we don't-

838
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,780
Guess what, Mr. President?

839
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,580
We don't approve of trading young soldiers' blood for episodes of home improvement.

840
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:41,940
Yeah.

841
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,220
That is not acceptable.

842
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,460
Do you know how we're going to fix that situation in Libya, though?

843
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:47,940
For real?

844
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,420
Do you know how we're going to fix it?

845
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,700
How we're going to air it out?

846
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,420
How, Griffin?

847
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,420
Wait, I have a guess.

848
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:54,920
How?

849
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,740
More power?

850
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:01,060
Yes!

851
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,060
Here, let's do some actual PSAs.

852
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,060
Hey, hey-

853
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,820
Well, that's not-

854
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,020
PSAs don't start out with hey.

855
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,300
They're really that conversation.

856
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:09,940
We'll do it anyway.

857
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,540
Hey, if you see Zachary Ty Bryan on the street, why don't you give him a buck or two?

858
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,860
He could really use the help.

859
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,660
My brother, my brother.

860
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,900
I know it seems like a good idea at the time, but don't put a V8 engine in a dishwasher.

861
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,580
It only leads to pain.

862
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,780
My brother, my brother, and me.

863
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,140
My brother, my brother, and me.

864
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,580
Richard Karn is swag as fuck.

865
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,820
My brother, my brother, and me.

866
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,740
Dude, don't let Richard Karn turn into the next Ray Combs.

867
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,660
Tell him how much you appreciate him today.

868
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,860
My brother, my brother, and me.

869
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,460
Have you hugged a Richard Karn today?

870
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:48,820
We think-

871
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,100
Can't find your keys?

872
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,460
Check Richard Karn's beard.

873
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,180
My brother, my brother, and me.

874
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,820
Did you put my keys up there again, Dick Karn?

875
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,220
I put my keys in Dick Karn's beard in 1994.

876
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,220
They were never seen again.

877
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,380
That's where we keep the reserves.

878
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,940
That'd be a good thing to shout after a touchdown.

879
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,140
It's just Richard Karn's name.

880
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,600
Karn?

881
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,540
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

882
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,740
But first, Travis is going to tell you about some of our housekeeping items.

883
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,700
Well, thank you, Justin.

884
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,140
So coming up, I think most of you know by this point,

885
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,780
I hope that we have a live show coming up in Chicago.

886
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:36,100
You can go to MaximumFund.org for ticket information and stuff like that.

887
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,180
So if there's still tickets available, you should probably go ahead and buy them.

888
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,460
That's the worst pitch ever.

889
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,860
What else are you doing on April 17th?

890
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,740
It's going to be us.

891
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,060
It's going to be JJ Go at Second City.

892
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,260
It's going to be fucking killer.

893
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,460
It's going to be the best night ever.

894
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,580
This party is going to be so fun, you will die.

895
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,420
Dan Telfer is going to be there?

896
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,460
Dan Telfer is going to be there.

897
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,980
So goddamn funny.

898
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,100
Go buy a ticket, dummy.

899
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,780
It's $12, and it's my birthday.

900
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,260
Come see Griffin for his birthday.

901
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,460
Come see me on my birthday.

902
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,820
We're going to go out afterwards.

903
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,820
I'm going to die on drinks.

904
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,700
My dad's going to be there.

905
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,740
We're going to hang out.

906
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,340
Okay, chill.

907
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:12,980
It's going to be me.

908
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,540
It's going to be Justin.

909
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,420
It's going to be Travis, Dan Telfer, Jordan, Jesse,

910
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,660
and my dad, and we're all hanging.

911
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,540
Where are you?

912
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,940
You're not there because you didn't pay $12 for a ticket

913
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,580
because you're a dummy.

914
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,380
Cheapo.

915
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:23,940
You're a dummy.

916
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,820
All right, that was good.

917
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,220
And you hate birthday.

918
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:25,940
That was a good pitch.

919
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,500
If you're going to be there, you want a question answered,

920
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,020
email us.

921
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,060
We want you to email us a question.

922
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,660
If you're going to be at the Chicago show,

923
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,900
put something in the subject like Chicago live question

924
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,820
or something so we know what it is.

925
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,660
Because we, and then we'll humiliate you.

926
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,660
We will savage you.

927
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,260
Yeah, but it'll be a good time.

928
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,140
I don't mind.

929
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,780
It'll be fun.

930
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,580
This is my birthday.

931
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,380
My dad will be there.

932
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,220
Also, if you're interested in becoming a citizen of the Money

933
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,300
Zone, getting your Money Zone green card with Gerard Depardieu,

934
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,660
then you're going to want to contact Teresa Thorne.

935
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,020
And that's Teresa at maxfund.org.

936
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,140
And that's Teresa with an H.

937
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,900
And she'll give you all the pricing info and availability

938
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,620
and stuff like that.

939
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,300
And just let her know.

940
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,900
And you guys should totes hook that up.

941
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,220
Totes.

942
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:15,940
What?

943
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,100
You should like totally hook that up.

944
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,060
If you do this, you get a free tote bag.

945
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,060
No, that's not true.

946
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,100
You get a totes umbrella.

947
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,780
What if I want to talk about how uncomfortable it made me

948
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,220
that you just said totes hook it up?

949
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,900
What should I got to do that?

950
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,580
You should go to the forums on maximumfund.org and talk about

951
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,020
this episode and other episodes from other max fund shows and

952
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,900
stuff like that.

953
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,660
Or just use it to connect with people and hang out and build

954
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,300
like a community and stuff.

955
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,340
I'm not very good at these.

956
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:48,740
I love it.

957
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,020
I'm really bad at these.

958
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,780
Just finish it up.

959
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,340
Just finish it up.

960
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,860
Finish it up.

961
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,300
Also, we're on Twitter.

962
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,540
We're on Twitter, you know, at MBMBAM if you want to send us

963
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,020
a message.

964
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:04,180
But we prefer that you use hashtag MBMBAM for any messages

965
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,940
about the show, you know, quotes from the show, anything

966
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,420
like that.

967
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,060
Let us know if you're going to be at the live show.

968
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,660
It's exciting to find out people are excited about it.

969
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,580
We're also all individually on there, but, you know, we're not

970
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,940
as funny separate.

971
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,980
We're like Voltron.

972
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,980
I don't know about that.

973
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,480
No?

974
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,260
Well, I get drunk and solicit Yahoo answers eight times in a

975
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,060
single night.

976
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,420
I think that's pretty fucking funny.

977
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,100
It's follow worthy.

978
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,180
I'd say that's very followable.

979
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,260
Some people have been hooking us up with shout outs on Twitter

980
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,700
this week, like green cardigan five converted a friend.

981
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,100
That's my chunks.

982
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,460
Our buddy Fred says episode 15 is the best starter for a new

983
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:47,960
fan.

984
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,100
Michelle Mittens is just the best.

985
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:56,580
Always 100% Sean MD listens to eight episodes in a row.

986
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,100
He's a doctor.

987
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:58,900
He's a physician.

988
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,460
That's a terrible listen to eight episodes.

989
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,020
He shouldn't be qualified to touch people after two.

990
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,820
I got a prescription.

991
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,860
Slow down.

992
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,100
Yeah.

993
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,980
You got a problem.

994
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,280
Yeah.

995
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,020
I got to diagnose you with a total case of yucks.

996
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,100
Guys, are we trending?

997
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,900
It's hard to say.

998
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,740
How can you how can you monitor that?

999
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,140
I think there's probably an app.

1000
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,300
These are the things that are trending right now.

1001
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:30,740
Okay.

1002
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,860
Are we any of these things?

1003
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,500
Let's see.

1004
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,460
Are we hashtag things that piss me off?

1005
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,900
Hashtag since we being honest.

1006
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,280
Okay.

1007
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,980
Hashtag whiz.

1008
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,540
Follow me.

1009
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,660
Jonas are much better.

1010
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,940
Oh, my God.

1011
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,180

1012
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,940
Oh, that's us.

That's actually us.

1014
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,860
That's the name of our live show.

1015
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,540
Jonas are much better.

1016
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,740
Here's the top tweet on that one.

1017
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,740
Jonas are much better because they taught me that there's more

1018
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,980
to life than just to live.

1019
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,900
That instead of just hoping, I need to start trying.

1020
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,300
Thanks, JoBros.

1021
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,900
Thanks for the message.

1022
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,540
JoBros changed me.

1023
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,820
All right.

1025
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,660
This final question, which by the way, guys, thanks for sticking around.

1026
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,540
This is a weird app.

1027

And you made it to the end.

1028
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,660
We'll never do another one like this again, unless Justin's
