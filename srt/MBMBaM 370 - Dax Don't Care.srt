1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,720
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media, Luminary Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:05,840
Um, I have recently returned from a vacation, um, on which, uh, during which, yes, within which,

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,000
I listened to, uh, three different Hercule Poirot novels.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,760
Mmm, now we- he is, of course, everyone's favorite-

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,720
Belgian.

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,040
Philos- Belgian philosopher.

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,280
Uh-huh.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,960
I- I don't want to derail you, Travis, but being deeply into Poirot was sort of my thing.

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,120
No, no, no, Justin, I- don't get it twisted. I'm not about to claim that, but I have been

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,560
inspired by the Poirot novels and also, uh, Sherlock Holmes stories I've listened to.

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,600
I would like to- to bring back a word, um, in its original meaning.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:43,920
Oh.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh, wait, wait, wait, let me hold my breath here just to kind of brace myself for Twitter.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,360
I already said-

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,080
Okay, go ahead.

22
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
Ejaculated, um-

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Let's put it right back, and then let's put it right back in its grave.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,440
They use it a lot in the books to say, like, my God, I ejaculated, and-

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,760
Okay.

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
Um, I- I think that I would like to bring that back, so, like, if I was telling a story and I

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,200
said, like, I was walking down the street and I saw my friend, hey, Todd, I ejaculated.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,520
Yeah, so-

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah, I love that.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,600
This is not a critic podcast. We've never- we've never been critical of one thing this entire time

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,600
except juggling- the juggling arts, and I don't know that we possess the critical faculties

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,160
required to sort of dissect the original artist intent, and so if it's like Sherlock Holmes

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,480
shouted, get back here with my- with my soup, Dr. Watson, he ejaculated.

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,000
How are we to know that he wasn't coming while he was, like,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
trying to get his soup back from that squirrely Dr. Watson?

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
I leaned out the window. I ejaculated. Get back here.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,160
Yeah, maybe it was Sherlock Holmes is just nasty just blasting one out the windows of 221B Baker

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Street. Maybe it's to say.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
I would like you both to try. Maybe tell a story and try to use it within the story.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay.

41
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,640
Okay.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
Do you have one, Griffin? You're a starter.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Yeah, sure. Watch this really hot stuff, and then you heard, I ejaculated. I ejaculated.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
That's pretty good.

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,080
That was really good. Okay, here's my story.

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,520
One day, my dumb middle brother tried to make ejaculated a thing.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
Several days before that, I was at Margaritaville.

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
See, this is what I thought- this is what I wanted the introduction to be.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
I thought we were going to have a deep Margaritaville exploration.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Work it in naturally. Work it in.

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,720
No, I did- I already worked it in.

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
Just ejaculate it right into the podcast.

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,040
Right. My brother tried to make the word ejaculated come back.

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
Come back. Nice.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
It's a comeback.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
God. God, we're all dads. We're all adults.

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,480
I want to talk about Margaritaville, but I do want to say another weird quirk of language

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,360
in Agatha Christie books is that she will often say a minute or two when I have to assume she

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
means a moment or two because there's a lot of instances of people being like,

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,400
so, uh, in any way, Poro, that's how my dad died.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
And it said, and Poro pause for a minute or two and then reply.

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,760
That would be so fucking crazy to think about Poro just like,

63
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
barreling them for two minutes straight.

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,640
Just like, uh huh.

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
So he's the character, not the author.

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,760
She also refers to mustaches as individual mustaches.

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Like these are my mustaches. They're very luxuriant.

68
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,440
Um, so Justin, how's, how's James?

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
So I rolled up, this is true.

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,720
The exact same back on Myrtle beach, exact same, uh, Margaritaville.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
That brought me so much torment.

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,920
The pilgrimage.

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Got back there.

74
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
Good news. It's a little bit more off season.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Little bit rainy.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,640
Still had to wait 35 stone cold minutes to get into JB's place.

77
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,760
You would think I'd get on some sort of preferential treatment list,

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,080
but there was no Joe's Crab Shack for me this time.

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,760
We went straight there and then just went to the beef jerky store

80
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,000
and the wine store that's right across the street.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Had a wine slushie. It was delicious.

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh, I was with Justin. I should make that clear.

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
Travis was with me.

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
Uh, so we go in, we finally get the thumbs up.

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
Come on in J-Man, the water's fine.

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,280
And here it was more amazing than I, okay.

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,000
So when you first walk in, here's what I literally saw

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,400
when I first walked into Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

89
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,560
A giant, her like tornado cyclonic cloud.

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,880
And when I say giant, I mean like 20 feet across,

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,800
huge sculpture of a cyclonic cloud with like flip flops

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
and shark fins emanating from it, spinning wildly.

93
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,080
I'm scared. I'm scared of this.

94
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,240
It's a scary vision.

95
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
That does not put me in a chill head space for this restaurant.

96
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,400
As an upended bottle of a giant upended bottle

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:26,240
of a Margaritaville brand tequila dumped into a 15 foot tall blender

98
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
while a woman clad all in pink and on stilts

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,440
humped the blender as she shouted, I love margaritas.

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,160
Whoa.

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,920
As the song Margaritaville played and the cyclonic cloud spun and-

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,320
Jesus.

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,760
There was a fake weather report about a hurricane party

104
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,920
headed from Myrtle Beach that I thought was in poor taste.

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,560
Yeah, really poor taste maybe a bit.

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
But I'm assuming it's pre-programmed.

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
Was this a real woman or a statue of a woman?

108
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
No, it's a real woman.

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,160
No, this is a real woman who's doing some balloon animals for the kids.

110
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,000
She took breaks from humping the giant blender to make balloon animals for the kids.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
The blender sex acts are for adults only.

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Now, Griffin, I texted you a picture of this happening,

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,920
so I know that you know I'm not lying about it.

114
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
You texted me some pictures?

115
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
I don't think that I, I guess, digested them enough.

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
I guess I didn't really pour over them.

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,040
There's a lot visually to-

118
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,880
Wow, heck, you're not joking.

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,760
There she is.

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Yeah, there's a woman on-

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,120
Yeah, it's true.

122
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
I'll put that on social media or something.

123
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,040
Kind of took a break off the social media.

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,120
Did get a huge drink called a five o'clock somewhere

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,760
that tasted like turpentine and raspberries in a blender cup

126
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,560
that I brought home with me to savor the experience.

127
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,120
It was raining so bad after we left the restaurant

128
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
that I had to go back into the gift shop

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
and buy a $27 Margaritaville branded umbrella.

130
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,000
How'd that hold up?

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,560
Both.

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
How'd that protect you from the elements?

133
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,000
It was fine.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,640
Travis and I had to huddle underneath one Margaritaville brand umbrella

135
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,280
as we made our way back to our car to pick up our families.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,080
A lot of weird tunes that weren't necessarily Jay.

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,400
You think, you would think it would be all Jimmy Buffett music all the time.

138
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
And then a couple of people at our table remarked that like,

139
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
hey, they aren't playing Jimmy Buffett music constantly.

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,760
Why do you think that is?

141
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,600
And my assumption is that people work there

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
and they don't want to go insane.

143
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
I would assume at the beginning it was all Jay music

144
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,520
and they just went like clinically chill.

145
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,840
Like almost terminally chill would be my fear there.

146
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,720
So there was some Kenny Chesney in the mix.

147
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,960
I think some LaBouche, which was an odd choice.

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,200
Anyway, all the food was great.

149
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,960
You paid a premium price for it.

150
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
The waiter was chipper and very business-like.

151
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,840
Not very chill, I thought, but that's fine

152
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,160
because your speed is of the essence

153
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
when I'm waiting for my five o'clock somewhere

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
to be delivered to the table.

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
But it was everything I could have hoped for.

156
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,280
JB didn't come out of the...

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,800
That we know of.

158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
Well, he's busy in the kitchen cooking up all the bad food.

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,200
He was.

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
The food was great.

161
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,920
Food was great.

162
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,240
And I'm assuming one of his disguises he was employing

163
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,400
because he likes to watch people really enjoy.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,080
Now, I did find an old man wearing a large hat

165
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
that I told my daughter Charlie was Jimmy Buffett,

166
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,080
which she then loudly started pointing at him

167
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
and telling everyone at the table who would listen

168
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,960
that there was Jimmy Buffett, that she had found him.

169
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,440
I don't know if he noticed this fun prank

170
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
that I played on this elderly gentleman.

171
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,000
I would say that, yes, Margaritaville was a highlight.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,080
We also had another dining experience

173
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,520
at a local eatery known as Pirate's Voyage.

174
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,520
Yes.

175
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,760
And I realized two things.

176
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
One, it was an incredible show with stunts, thrills, chills.

177
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
And original music by Dolly Parton.

178
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,080
Wait, what?

179
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,680
Yes.

180
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
You heard me.

181
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
She did the OST for this pirate themed restaurant?

182
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,480
Correct.

183
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,240
It's all Dolly.

184
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,720
There was a spooky scary number

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,280
with a giant animatronic Davy Jones

186
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,960
that scared the shit out of my baby.

187
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,840
But most of it she was down with.

188
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,680
But I realized that there is a small infinitesimal chance

189
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,600
that one of the performers at Pirate's Voyage

190
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,520
might listen to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

191
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
And if that is true, I wanna say,

192
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,000
if you're listening to this, it was incredible.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Yeah, great job.

194
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,520
It was great.

195
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,360
They bring the food out to you pirate style,

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,480
which I didn't know what that meant.

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,840
What's that mean, Justin?

198
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,800
So here are some of the items that-

199
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
They steal it, they take it back from you by force

200
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
as soon as they give it.

201
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
I'm reciting the menu from,

202
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,400
like the entirety of the menu from memory.

203
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,080
It started with a Voyager vegetable soup,

204
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,320
which they sell a mix for in the gift shop

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,120
if you would like to get some Voyager vegetable soup.

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
And that was served with a buccaneer bread.

207
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,680
All right.

208
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
And the bowl that they had,

209
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,400
they brought you the bowl for soup,

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,200
but there was no spoon available.

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,000
And my father-in-law didn't,

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
just like left it in front of him

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
because he couldn't,

214
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,480
he just didn't know what he was supposed to do.

215
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
What they expect you to do is drink it,

216
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
like mug like, like a pirate.

217
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
But he refused to deign to their wishes.

218
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
So he just left his Voyager vegetable soup.

219
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,400
As a gentleman who's played Captain Hook

220
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,320
in several permutations of Peter Pan musicals in Huntington,

221
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm very disappointed in Tommy's failure

222
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
to commit to the bit here.

223
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,920
They then brought out the half a roasted cackler,

224
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
which yes, was chicken.

225
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,520
That is chicken.

226
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,400
That one's chicken.

227
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
You're killing me Pirates Voyage.

228
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,520
And there was a captain's BBQ roast,

229
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,040
which is just pulled pork.

230
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,840
Then they brought out the pirate herb-based potato,

231
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,440
which I think was just,

232
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,960
they just put pirate on there.

233
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,800
I couldn't think of a way to say the best one,

234
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,760
Justin, say the best one.

235
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
Oh, they brought out a Cabo buttery,

236
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
which is what they call corn.

237
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,200
All right.

238
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,280
Well, it sounds like you guys had fun.

239
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,720
Cabo buttery and some apple oh my,

240
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,080
some apple oh my eye pie, the Cabo buttery.

241
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,640
And they brought it out in like secession.

242
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,640
So like first they brought out the potato

243
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,240
and that one was just there.

244
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
And then they brought out the chicken like two minutes after.

245
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
And I was into the impression that I didn't know

246
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
if I was supposed to be keeping pace.

247
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,080
Like if I should be eating the,

248
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,400
like the potato better be gone by the time they get back.

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
The last thing I wanted to say is as we were leaving,

250
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,120
there was a sign for another Dolly Parton similar thing.

251
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,760
This was like red pirates versus blue pirates.

252
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
That was actually the Crimson versus Sapphire crews.

253
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,600
They had to battle each other for supremacy.

254
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,440
As we were leaving, we saw a sign for Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede,

255
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
which is a similar thing, but cowboy themed.

256
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
And you have to sit on one side of the restaurant or the other

257
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
to root for the north or the south.

258
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
I bet that's an awkward hang right now, eh?

259
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,760
Yeah, that's not a good hang.

260
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,960
I might argue that that's never been a good hang.

261
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,840
Yeah, Dolly.

262
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,360
I hope you all, it sounds like you had a lot of fun

263
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
on your beach adventure.

264
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,760
I had a lot of fun here down in Austin where my son got pink eye.

265
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,280
And also I got in an on-box style group fight

266
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,760
for two gallons of diesel gasoline.

267
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
So we've been having a lot of fun down here in Austin,

268
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
fight for gasoline, get pink eye.

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm sorry about it.

270
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,040
I missed everything, Griffin.

271
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,720
I wasn't able to emotionally support you.

272
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,440
No, it's fine.

273
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,600
I wasn't able to emotionally support you

274
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
when you went to these themed restaurants.

275
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,720
I wish I could have been there for you through that.

276
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,600
And of course, though I should have mentioned it before,

277
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
we talked about the pirate restaurant we went to.

278
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
Our thoughts are with everybody who's affected by the hurricane.

279
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,440
I don't know if anybody listening was affected by that.

280
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,840
I have to assume at least tangentially some people were.

281
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,920
Yeah, absolutely some folks were.

282
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
And best of luck.

283
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
And we hope you all can, you know, Texas is tough.

284
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,000
And Griffin has taught me that.

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
Oh, we've been seeing lots of that from certain Texas politicians

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
like we're going to get that hurricane.

287
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
You're not going to get the hurricane.

288
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Like we're going to be cool and stuff.

289
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,440
And we're going to like help each other rebuild

290
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,640
and support each other or whatever.

291
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,840
But you can't fucking kill.

292
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,400
You understand that I can't go buy the biggest gun at Walmart

293
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
and shoot the hurricane.

294
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,640
And then the hurricane's like,

295
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,120
like literally every Texas like conservative bill.

296
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,840
You can do it.

297
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,120
Wrestle that hurricane.

298
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Don't mess with Texas hurricane.

299
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,280
You can't, the hurricane's not messing with Texas.

300
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,440
It's just doing what hurricanes do.

301
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,760
You can't go buy a fucking big, big gun

302
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
and shoot it into the heart of the hurricane

303
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,560
and the hurricane dissipates.

304
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,800
And you're like, oh, Teddy, Teddy got him.

305
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
Did you try, did you try?

306
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
No, I didn't really get up to Austin enough

307
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,800
for me to really get at the, you know, the heart of the thing.

308
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,800
The blender at the heart of this, this Jimmy Buffett hurricane.

309
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
But they should probably have a different fake news feed

310
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,200
to play during the, the Margarita explosion.

311
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,080
Like it would, I'm assuming that that has probably occurred

312
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,720
to them that like sometimes parts of America

313
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
and you know what other countries,

314
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,920
as long as we're talking about it, Jimmy's an international star

315
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,080
are being ravaged by hurricanes.

316
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,880
So maybe the fake hurricane party is not always

317
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,280
so great all the time.

318
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,080
Should we get to the meat of the matter?

319
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
I believe that's in order, Griffin.

320
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
This is an advice show where we take your questions

321
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,400
and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

322
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,960
And we're gonna start right now.

323
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,040
I'm ready to go, I ejaculated.

324
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,520
Oh, boy.

325
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,020
Okay.

326
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,220
My best friend in the world moved away a little while ago.

327
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,380
Start over, you said my breast friend, Justin.

328
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,060
We can't, we talked about ejaculation

329
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,180
for the first six minutes of the show.

330
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,140
I didn't.

331
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,820
We stopped in Winston-Salem on the way back.

332
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,460
There was a theme restaurant called Twin Peaks

333
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,020
and I was so excited until I found out

334
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,540
what the Twin Peaks was referencing

335
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,980
and it was not a good scene for me.

336
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,740
It was a restaurant.

337
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,100
Shall we say, oh, okay.

338
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,420
Just gonna dive right into it.

339
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,620
Justin just ejaculated that.

340
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,580
Please say this question.

341
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,020
I just ejaculated that.

342
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,460
My best friend in the world moved away a little while ago.

343
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,940
A few weeks before he left, he offered me his bike

344
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,180
that he said he didn't want anymore

345
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,500
and didn't want to spend time and money moving.

346
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,220
I gladly took the, that's just lazy, by the way,

347
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,180
because you could ride it.

348
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,780
I gladly took the bike.

349
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,020
A few days before his going away party,

350
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,500
his wife asked me to bring the bike back

351
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,380
so they could pack it.

352
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,980
When I asked my friend what the deal was,

353
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,420
I thought he gave me the bike.

354
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,700
He said, don't worry about it

355
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,180
and don't mention it again and I can keep the bike.

356
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,540
The bike wasn't brought up again until recently

357
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,020
after they had already moved halfway across the country

358
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,700
when his wife texted me asking

359
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,460
when I was going to send them the bike.

360
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:13,940
Come on.

361
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
I told them my friend was sending the bike back,

362
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,060
but he keeps insisting I don't.

363
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,740
His wife seems very annoyed

364
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,420
and I have no idea what to do.

365
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,220
Please help.

366
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,140
That's from potential bike thief.

367
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,780
Woof.

368
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,140
How do you send a bike?

369
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,100
You go roll up, you fucking ride it to FedEx

370
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,780
and you're like, do you have a big box for this?

371
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,020
And also I need cab fare for the ride home.

372
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,700
What the fuck?

373
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,660
I'm just gonna force dump this across the country

374
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,580
and lead a revolution of people

375
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,860
who are inspired by my insistence

376
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,780
on pedaling a bike across the nation.

377
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,500
This bike life movement is gonna be so disappointed

378
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,860
also when you get there and you're like,

379
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,780
I'm done because it's not mine.

380
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,060
I have a theory as to what's going on here.

381
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,260
Okay.

382
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Let me know what you guys think.

383
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,660
I think that best friend wants a new bike

384
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,060
and doesn't wanna move the old bike across the country.

385
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,820
But best friend's wife thinks that old bike is still fine,

386
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,140
right?

387
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
And doesn't see the need for new bike.

388
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,140
So best friend tells wife loaned it to question asker.

389
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,940
Oh God.

390
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,780
And then the plan was once they had moved me like,

391
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,740
oh, we didn't get it back from question asker.

392
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,420
Ah, beans, you're caught up in that.

393
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,540
Guess I gotta get a new bike.

394
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,820
You're embroiled in something so much bigger

395
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,100
than this bike though.

396
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,340
Cause there's some scandal level deception happening

397
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,380
in this couple.

398
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,700
And what Mr. and Mrs. Agent Smith,

399
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,100
what are they not saying to each other?

400
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,340
Are they gonna get in a big knife fight in the kitchen

401
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,260
when their identities are revealed over this bike?

402
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,980
You've got a tiny little liars scenario here.

403
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,300
You've got a baby liars situation on your head.

404
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,420
Itty bitty liars.

405
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,580
If you are in the middle of two people

406
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,340
and they're telling you to do different things

407
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,940
and one of the people,

408
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,020
if you don't do the thing,

409
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,180
you'll be a thief.

410
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
You should probably defer to that one.

411
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,580
That's the one that I would-

412
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,020
If you have two options,

413
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,380
and one of the options is you get a sick cool new Huffy

414
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,900
that you can take behind the Kroger

415
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,220
and go up the big dumpster ramp.

416
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,260
I think that might be,

417
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
that's the cool Huffy option.

418
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,380
And I want that one.

419
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,740
Can we make that one work?

420
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,620
Can the Huffy stay in the picture?

421
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,060
Yeah, but the thing is,

422
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,620
whenever you visit your friends,

423
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,460
Dylan and Vicky,

424
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,420
Dylan's gonna be like,

425
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,860
hey bud,

426
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,140
Vicky's gonna be like,

427
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,860
you're a thief,

428
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,340
you're a bike thief.

429
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,180
You're a fucking thief, yeah.

430
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,260
You stole this fucking bike.

431
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,860
Let's talk logistics.

432
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,900
Okay, okay.

433
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,580
The cost of shipping a bike

434
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,700
is twice the price of buying a bike where you are.

435
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,860
This is ship me a bike.

436
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,900
I'm still so-

437
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,620
What?

438
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,380
Nobody's ever shipped anybody a bike.

439
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,740
You can't ship a bike.

440
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,540
It's like shipping a car.

441
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,260
You can't do that.

442
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,740
They gotta put them on the big truck and drive it away.

443
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,020
What if this bike,

444
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,380
I think we're all thinking like,

445
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,020
maybe you bought it at the Toys R Us or the Walmart.

446
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,140
Maybe this bike is like a sick custom job,

447
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,620
like racing with all the accessories.

448
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,540
A West Coast customs Huffy.

449
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,380
Yeah, it's got like streamers

450
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,300
and like whatever the actual adult good version

451
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,100
of like a baseball card in the spokes

452
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,620
and like light up wheels.

453
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,260
It's a credit card.

454
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,980
It's an insurance card in the spokes.

455
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,060
And just the cushion.

456
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,180
Yes, butt cushion.

457
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,540
I think you've already,

458
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,260
question asker,

459
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,060
thank you for listening.

460
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,740
You've already fucked up pretty bad

461
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,540
in not dealing with this before they moved away.

462
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,700
But at this point, let's be honest,

463
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,820
they're living a long distance from you.

464
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,820
You're probably not gonna maintain

465
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,860
that relationship so well.

466
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,980
I think you need to come clean to the wife.

467
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,220
Just throw that little pipe bomb into the relationship.

468
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,700
This is officially your friend's problem to deal with

469
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,820
and not yours.

470
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,700
The good news is,

471
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,540
when you stir up this dookie,

472
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,020
you got a means of exit.

473
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,940
Hey, by the way,

474
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,180
you've been lying to each other about the bike.

475
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,540
See ya, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.

476
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,420
Don't worry about it.

477
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,900
Maybe, ooh, let me hit you with this.

478
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,100
We should have never taught Griffin,

479
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,300
when we were teaching Griffin to ride a bike,

480
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,100
we should have never taught him

481
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,580
that he had to say pedal every time that he battled.

482
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,740
Although I will give it to you, Griffin.

483
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,300
I do not know how Michael Winslow style

484
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,940
one would replicate sound of bike being pedaled away.

485
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,380
It's like, that's right.

486
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,580
And so maybe there's a lot of cocaine in the bike

487
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,820
that the wife put there.

488
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,300
Okay, okay, yeah.

489
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,460
Everywhere, everywhere.

490
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,660
You fucking go to fill up the tires,

491
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,820
you overfill them, explosion,

492
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,860
a cocaine explosion all over yourself.

493
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,220
You pull off one of the handlebars

494
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
when you take a left over that dumpster ramp

495
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,300
behind the Kroger too hard, pops out,

496
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,060
and just like a pixie stick you tore up

497
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
and just like cocaine, cocaine, cocaine, cocaine,

498
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,780
all over the place.

499
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,940
What do you mean you gave Dave the bike?

500
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,620
The jewels are in the bike.

501
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,260
And then it's a whimsical cross country bike race.

502
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,100
If the bike is full of cocaine,

503
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,620
the wife is certainly horny

504
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
to be taking that across state lines, eh?

505
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,180
Seems like she wants it to ship Justin.

506
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,620
Now it's on question asker.

507
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,300
Oh my God.

508
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,660
So you're saying that wife is using question asker

509
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
as a drug mule.

510
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,260
An unwilling, unknowing mule.

511
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,460
I don't know there wasn't cocaine in it

512
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,260
when we gave it to him.

513
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,580
I don't know why you filled it up with cocaine.

514
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,020
I don't know why you better do that.

515
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,860
He said he's doing some mountain biking

516
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,220
and wants some more weight in it

517
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,500
to really grip the road.

518
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,180
I don't know why that weight had to come from

519
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,420
that chunky crystal white stuff,

520
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,460
but here we are.

521
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,980
Here we are.

522
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,700
How about a Yahoo?

523
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,060
Hit me.

524
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,140
Yeah, this one was sent in by Seth Carlson.

525
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,220
Seth Carlson, the delivery man?

526
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,940
Yep.

527
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,500
All right.

528
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,420
Sorry, I got a YouTube ad.

529
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,900
There's a video audio playing.

530
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,700
And it's of Taylor Swift's bad new video.

531
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,820
So let's just destroy that.

532
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,700
Okay, stop all flash plugins.

533
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,420
Siri.

534
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,140
Here's one.

535
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,940
Thank you, Seth.

536
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,060
It's Yahoo Answers user.

537
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,740
Earl the girl asks,

538
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,300
what are the terms of your friendship contract?

539
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,580
No additional details needed or posted.

540
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,300
You got a buddy.

541
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,260
You got a new buddy.

542
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
And of course, you can't just go into that shit

543
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,620
willy nilly.

544
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
You got to protect yourself and your assets.

545
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,420
What's the terms of your friendship contract?

546
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,300
Hey, Jeremy, you seem nice.

547
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
I'd like you to sign some paperwork for me

548
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,060
before we go to the big baseball game.

549
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,020
I need to protect myself and my assets

550
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,900
in case you end up being a real jerk sword.

551
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,220
Okay, I know one of my stipulations would have to be

552
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,660
you have to let me know about two out of every three sick hangs.

553
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,180
It's okay.

554
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,700
It's okay if you want to go hang a couple times without me.

555
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,940
But if I find out three times in a row

556
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,580
there were sick hangs that came up

557
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,220
and I was not informed about it,

558
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,500
we're going to have beef.

559
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,780
I think of a hang has a certain number of involved parties.

560
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,340
Once it gets over three of my buds

561
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,580
who are all also on contract with me.

562
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,080
Yep.

563
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,340
Once that happens, if I do not receive the evite,

564
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,620
then something's broken down in this process.

565
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,260
What are the terms of your friendship contract?

566
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,940
I am allowed to get totally spooked

567
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,260
at a scary movie we went to together

568
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,140
and you can't post about it on Facebook or make fun of me.

569
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,460
Don't you dare goof on me like that.

570
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:45,960
Right.

571
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,540
You know how I get spooked.

572
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,380
I went and saw Annabelle shit my pants in a theater right there.

573
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,020
Made a real bad soil mess right there in the theater.

574
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,580
Don't you dare get on Twitter about that.

575
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,080
Right.

576
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,660
Because if you do, I'll sue you for $50,000

577
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,860
for breach of contract.

578
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,860
I think rule number one is don't fall in love.

579
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,660
Because that's an issue.

580
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,260
That's a whole different deal with it.

581
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah.

582
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,980
What are the terms?

583
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,100
Now here's Yahoo Answers user weaselmcweasel says-

584
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,500
Untrustworthy.

585
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,260
Well, it's hateful.

586
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,620
Number one, don't touch my Coca-Cola.

587
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,540
Yeah, for sure.

588
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,900
Well, hold on, I would say don't touch without permission.

589
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,060
No, when would I ever give anybody permission

590
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,900
to drink this good brown stuff?

591
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,740
Number two, I have the right to kill anyone that does.

592
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,900
So if you sign this and you touch this good brown drink

593
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,420
and I fucking kill you,

594
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,780
and then I go to court and the judge is like,

595
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,060
ooh, I don't know about this.

596
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,860
You killed him.

597
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,380
And I was like, look at the contract.

598
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,340
I had legal authority to kill him

599
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,660
for touching like sweet Coca-Cola.

600
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,740
What do you think your life is like

601
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,380
when the best thing you have going for you

602
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,300
is some Coca-Cola?

603
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,060
The most important thing in the world to me

604
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,820
that nobody better, not my children.

605
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,500
Not my children or my money, my bank accounts,

606
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,660
my social security number, my stocks and bonds.

607
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,340
You better not lay a finger on my Butterfinger.

608
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,380
Or is that just like accepted?

609
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,940
That's it, that's it.

610
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,380
Because Bart Simpson said it.

611
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,060
When you tear open the package of a Butterfinger,

612
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,980
you are agreeing to a contract

613
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,900
that is printed on every Butterfinger label.

614
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,740
Which is to say, if you touch my Butterfinger,

615
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,420
the one who opens it, if they are not the one who eats it,

616
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,340
you have legal authority to kill that second person.

617
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,820
Just real quick, Weasel McWeasel does have a rule number three.

618
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,220
If you drink my Coke, see rule number two.

619
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,260
This is a little redundant, I feel.

620
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,780
The secret to a good contract is you gotta keep it so tight.

621
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,500
And so saying, number one, don't touch my Coca-Cola.

622
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,260
Two, I have the right to kill anyone that does.

623
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,580
And then having a third rule that's just like,

624
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,900
seriously though, number two is-

625
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,260
Griffin, I can't fault you there.

626
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,060
Because everyone knows that one of the hallmarks of contracts

627
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,220
is how brief and easy to read they are.

628
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,580
So yes, agreed.

629
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,660
What about like, you're my best friend forever sort of clause?

630
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,180
What about if I kill someone,

631
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,660
you have to say I was with you at that time?

632
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,700
That's a little, that's a lot.

633
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,540
What if I like to kill people a lot?

634
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,020
Yeah.

635
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,820
And then it gets like-

636
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,580
Man, you hang out with Jeremy a ton.

637
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,300
One crime committed and covered seems fair.

638
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,980
Like, I feel like most of my friends could do something once.

639
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,140
If it got like a little dextery,

640
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,780
I think I might start to have bigger issues.

641
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,140
I just think I would want,

642
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,180
why are we having friendship contracts, I guess?

643
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,100
Yes, why can't we just be good to each other?

644
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,540
That's a contract.

645
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,820
It is.

646
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,420
We all signed it when we were born.

647
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,820
That's your member?

648
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,500
With your hand, with your little hand.

649
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,140
That's what they do

650
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
and they make you stamp your fingerprints down.

651
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,740
It's just, and you look up and it's like,

652
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,980
here's Griffin, 20 pound baby.

653
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,100
Jesus Christ!

654
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,500
The 20 pound baby and he promises to just be cool about it.

655
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
Speaking of being cool,

656
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,980
I think it's time for us to take a trip to the money zone.

657
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,220
I want to start off this week by telling everybody about Zip Recruiter.

658
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,420
Are you hiring?

659
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,220
Do you know where to-

660
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,860
Yes.

661
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,060
I'm always hiring.

662
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,020
You never know when I might find someone else I want to enlist.

663
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,620
I'm hiring friends and you can apply at ziprecruiter.com.

664
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:50,580
Really?

665
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,300
You can post your job to 100 plus job sites with just one click.

666
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,500
I mean, you can't beat that.

667
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,020
It's so much easier.

668
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,020
And get this, 80% of employers who post a job on Zip Recruiter

669
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,660
to get a quality candidate through the site within one day.

670
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
You can find out today why Zip Recruiter has been used

671
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,220
by businesses of all sizes to find the most qualified job candidates

672
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,660
with immediate result.

673
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,340
Not immediate, probably.

674
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,620
That would be weird.

675
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,340
If someone replies to your job listing immediately,

676
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,980
they are probably scoping you out.

677
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,380
Absolutely.

678
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,020
I feel like that-

679
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,620
They are casing you.

680
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,340
They're casing you.

681
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:28,900
That's no good.

682
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,740
But right now our listeners can post jobs on Zip Recruiter for free.

683
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,300
That's right.

684
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,420
You heard me right.

685
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,540
For free.

686
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Just go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

687
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,980
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

688
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,140
Try it for free right now.

689
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,060
Ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

690
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,940
If you go to ziprecruiter.com and you just search Griffin McElroy,

691
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,660
very tall friend, you'll find the current opening.

692
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,100
It's unfortunately like times are tight.

693
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,500
And so that's the only one that we are hiring right now.

694
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,180
And of course the contract is like, fuck, like 600, 700 pages long.

695
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,580
How tall, Griffin?

696
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,380
Give parameters.

697
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,740
So what I put down on the listing was as big as my refrigerator.

698
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,100
So I left a little wiggle room there because you don't know how tall my refrigerator is.

699
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,860
But needless to say, it's very large.

700
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,660
I need a very tall friend to help me get the big jug up there.

701
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,580
It's been up there for years.

702
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,180
I don't know how I got the damn thing up there.

703
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,340
Must have thrown it up there like a basketball or something.

704
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,020
But anyway, I do need a very tall friend to come over here and get that jug.

705
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,620
And then if you do, maybe we can go see a movie or something.

706
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,500
Is there a full time position that you're looking for or just like-

707
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,700
I really just need you to get the big jug from on top of my tall fridge.

708
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,140
How often do you need that?

709
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,500
One time.

710
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Just one?

711
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,100
You're not gonna put it back up there?

712
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,820
I mean, I'll be honest.

713
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,300
I got a tall fridge and there's lots of tall shelves up in there.

714
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,620
And there's a lot of old stinky food up there that I just can't get.

715
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,140
And the stink goes down in the cold air.

716
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,860
And so I need somebody to help me because my produce, I just put it in there.

717
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:01,140
And then it gets the stink of the cream cheese up there and some bread.

718
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,300
What if they want to go see the movie before they get the big jug off your fridge?

719
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,020
Oh, then they'll be fired immediately because that's not what the contract says.

720
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,060
You're right.

721
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,940
Read the fine print.

722
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,020
It's all fine print, baby.

723
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,740
700 pages of like font number four.

724
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,660
Hey, I want to tell you all about Lyft.

725
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,260
That's L-Y-F-T.

726
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Because what they do is you get in their car and they drive you wherever the fuck.

727
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,420
And it's simple formula.

728
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,860
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

729
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,500
Maybe that's why nine out of ten Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

730
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,180
It's the first ride share platform with tipping built right into the app because getting tips

731
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,620
shouldn't depend on your passenger having a crumpled bill in their pocket.

732
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,060
And if you're a driver for them, you just keep 100% of the tips and they add up fast.

733
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,740
Drivers have been paid over $200 million each.

734
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,740
No, drivers have been paid over $200 million since the feature was first introduced.

735
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,380
Man, you have ten little cigarette boats there.

736
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,860
Yeah, I made $200 million driving with Lyft.

737
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,500
It was awesome.

738
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,940
Anyway, you can join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better

739
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:07,060
if you go to lyft.com slash brother today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

740
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,700
That's going to get you a little bit closer to that cigarette boat.

741
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,020
That's lyft.com slash brother, lyft.com slash brother, limited times only.

742
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,900
Terms do apply.

743
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,820
Now, when you hear the term cigarette boat, do you, like me, picture the Oscar Mayer

744
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,620
Wienermobile but like cigarette shaped in a boat?

745
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:31,700
I just picture a big ugly boat where I can go and smoke my Marlboros in peace without

746
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:39,300
having, you know, all of my coworkers, you know, pulling at my coat, pulling at my pants,

747
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,500
trying to pull my pants down.

748
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,900
Every time I go to the office and I smoke my smokes right there at my desk like I should

749
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,980
be able to do and my coworkers just come up to me and try to rip my pants right off.

750
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,580
So I want to get on my big old nasty barge that I bought for like 30 bucks and then just

751
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,060
smoke it right there in the barge and then just went home.

752
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:05,540
I always imagine just a boat so filled with cigarettes and the person driving it is like

753
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,380
so happy because they love them.

754
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,180
Yeah, they love the stuff and they're like just sailing around the pier like I can't

755
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,100
believe I have so many but that's dangerous because the weather, you know, you get any

756
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,900
sloshing.

757
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,020
If you get a cigarette wet, that's pretty much it for that cigarette, I feel like.

758
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,500
Do you guys remember Pepsi points?

759
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,740
I always picture like a cigarette boat was a boat you bought with cigarette points.

760
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,220
Oh, yeah.

761
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,660
You smoked enough that you earned a boat with cigarettes.

762
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:32,900
Yeah.

763
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,620
Camel cash.

764
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,420
Yeah.

765
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,500
I got so many cooch balls with those camel cash dollars.

766
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,460
I got a windbreaker just so I could show people like you can't believe how many I smoked for

767
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:45,700
this.

768
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,820
I like to get on my boat and show off all the fish my cigarette tricks I do.

769
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,460
Wait, what?

770
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,500
Do the fish do the cigarette tricks or you show the fish the cigarette tricks?

771
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,860
I show the fish the cigarette tricks, you dumb ass.

772
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,140
Why would the fish do it?

773
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,260
They got wet mouths.

774
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,220
The fuck stinks before you talk.

775
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,700
Mr.

776
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,260
Yeah, Mr.

777
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,460
Olympid out there just huffing my Marlboros, just chucking them down.

778
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,340
What are you talking about?

779
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,820
It's a fish.

780
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,420
It's 100% water.

781
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,220
The fish vape?

782
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,900
Now, fish can vape.

783
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,340
Yeah, fish can go digital for sure.

784
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,740
I was within striking distance.

785
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,180
One additional breath of beginning to speak about Mr.

786
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,660
Olympid.

787
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:27,060
I'm so happy that you took that burden from me.

788
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,500
I feel like we talk about Mr.

789
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,900
Olympid one in five episodes.

790
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,940
Is that true?

791
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,740
We talk about Mr.

792
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,780
Olympid a lot.

793
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,500
Yes, true.

794
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,420
If a dolphin or a whale vape.

795
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,540
And this is a question that you can have as like a party game at home.

796
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,300
Like the minister's cat.

797
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:51,140
If a whale or a dolphin did vape, would you plug the carb or whatever the fuck into their

798
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,980
mouth or into the blowhole?

799
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,940
Discuss.

800
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,180
No, I think you'd have to mouth in, blowhole out.

801
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,500
That's weird.

802
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
But that's how you get the sweet tricks, right?

803
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,780
Like with your blowhole.

804
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,860
But I think that's just not a trick.

805
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,420
I think that's standard vaping protocol for a dolphin or whale or any blowhole equipped

806
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,180
mammal, a platypus, I think has one.

807
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,660
I'm almost certain blowhole is in an inn.

808
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,180
I don't think they can breathe in through the blowhole.

809
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,500
Well, that's what makes it a trick, Travis.

810
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh.

811
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,100
Play with me in this space, will you?

812
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,540
For God's sakes.

813
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,980
They do have mouths.

814
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,820
Why do dolphins need blowholes?

815
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,860
Like they have mouths.

816
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,420
It's greedy.

817
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,260
It's greedy.

818
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:35,140
I mean, I guess I have a poop hole so poop doesn't have to come out of my mouth.

819
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,660
So go to lyft.com slash brother, lyft.com slash brother.

820
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,260
Limited time only, terms do apply.

821
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,300
Hey, tell me about this next time.

822
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,380
Limited time only and we've wasted half of it.

823
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,880
Sorry.

824
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,180
Time's ticking down.

825
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,060
So if you love sibling based humor, which I assume you do because you're listening to

826
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:59,300
this show, join the brother and sister Emma and Luke as they review every Disney Channel

827
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,260
original movie one month at a time.

828
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,620
That's incredible.

829
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,580
Join us as we completely trash these movies, which are all definite classic works of cinema

830
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,420
and hold special places in our hearts.

831
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,140
Okay, first of all, I don't know how I feel about that because I don't think I could trash

832
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,980
Luck of the Irish, which I loved as a kid.

833
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,340
Yeah, I mean, Zetas will beat us, dude.

834
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,420
Like, you cannot talk shit about these DCOMs.

835
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,740
What's the one where the youngest Lawrence brother cloned himself?

836
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,340
Clone of my own?

837
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,100
Clone Wars.

838
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,140
Clone of my own?

839
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:38,660
No, there is a one where the tiniest Lawrence cloned himself.

840
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,460
What was it?

841
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,180
Jesus God.

842
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,060
And I think he did a dance with himself.

843
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,140
Clone of my own is like such a good name for that movie.

844
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,740
I can't imagine that's not it.

845
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,460
It wasn't.

846
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,260
I'm on Wikipedia.

847
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
Do you hear how fucking frantically I'm typing?

848
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,060
The other me.

849
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,500
The other me.

850
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,100
Yes, of course.

851
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,780
So if you want to have probably better listening experience than you've just had for the last

852
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,860
30 seconds, you can search for their podcast DCOMedy.

853
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,060
So D-Comedy, D-C, Disney Channel Original Movie-ody.

854
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,620
I'll just spell it D-C-O-M-E-D-Y.

855
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,020
Get it?

856
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,580

So go check that out.

859
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,420
Boy, they kept making it.

860
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,780
I just Googled the list.

861
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,100
I thought I was going to know a lot of the things on this list.

862
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,860
What with Brink and what have you.

863
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,020
But it's a lot of they've been making a lot of stuff.

864
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,500
They made one in 2013 just called Teen Beach Movie.

865
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,380
Couldn't get a title going for that one.

866
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,700
I just went with Teen Beach Movie on that one.

867
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,220
I was excited.

868
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,980
Timothy Amundson, who was great in a bunch of things, but I was most excited when he

869
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,700
responded to my tweets because he was in Luck of the Irish as the evil leprechaun.

870
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,020
And I enjoyed his performance.

871
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,380
I don't think I've ever told him that.

872
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,260
Hey, everybody.

873
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,980
Please don't tell my sort of Twitter friend, Timothy Amundson, that I most enjoyed his

874
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,340
performance in Luck of the Irish.

875
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,220
Thanks, everybody.

876
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,660
Bye 2000.

877
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,460
Year 2000.

878
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,060
Year 2000.

879
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,220
Travel back with me, will you, to the year 2000?

880
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,660
They made fucking one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12

881
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,180
of these fucking things in one year.

882
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,060
That's one a month.

883
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,220
Quince, the other me.

884
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,580
Mom's got a date with the vampire.

885
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,540
Phantom of the Megaplex.

886
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,500
The ultimate Christmas present.

887
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,460
Miracle in Lane 2.

888
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,740
Stepsister from Planet Weird.

889
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,300
Rip Girls, Alley Cat's Strike, The Color of Friendship, Up, Up, and Away.

890
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,540
All of them 2000.

891
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,660
How's your fucking like production schedule?

892
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,580
We do want to encourage everybody.

893
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,020
Make sure to advertise with your podcast with my brother, my brother, me.

894
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,780
Because if we like your format, we'll apparently just start doing it.

895
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,340
Yeah, okay.

896
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,540
Xenon Girl in the 21st Century was an amazing movie.

897
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:53,460
And the guy who played Protozoa, I ran into him at a cafe in Yellow Springs, Ohio.

898
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,660
You dropped this name, Travis.

899
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,420
I can't remember.

900
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,900
Let me pick up this name for you, Travis.

901
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,780
Protozoa.

902
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,220
And I'll hand it right back to you.

903
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,660
You're such a fucking show off.

904
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,900
Hollywood Travis McElroy, I always talk about Protozoa.

905
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,340
I always talk about his best friend, Protozoa.

906
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,500
God, you've changed.

907
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,980
I thought you don't live in LA anymore.

908
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,700
But you've changed.

909
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,380
Always talking about Protozoa.

910
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,820
Once a Hollywood guy, always a Hollywood guy.

911
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,220
God, all these movies are incredible.

912
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,500
Um, hey, I've got a personal message for Rebecca.

913
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,780
And it's from Michael, who says,

914
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,740
Hey, Rebecca.

915
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,420
Hey, hey, you know what?

916
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,220
You know what?

917
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,980
You're great.

918
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,980
You're doing a great job of being a human being.

919
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,940
And I'm the luckiest.

920
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,220
Happy B-day slash secret anniversary slash becoming a mom slash official anniversary.

921
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,980
I can't wait to meet our baby.

922
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,180
Oh, also, I'm in the bathroom and we don't have any toilet paper.

923
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,980
Can you get some?

924
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,540
I'll wait.

925
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,660
Now, they don't have a time, like a preferred time for this message listed here.

926
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,740
But I assume that it's been a while.

927
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,060
And that not only do they have a baby,

928
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,140
but that Michael is just a skeleton in that bathroom still with poop all over his butt bones.

929
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,140
Hey, Londoners.

930
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,220
Do not miss out on your chance to see the Beef and Dairy Network,

931

938
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,820
Go, do it.

939
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,660
Here's another question.

940
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,980
Wow, we only did one.

941
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,300
Yeah.

942
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,340
Okay, here's the second one.

943
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Well, we talked about protozoa for about 40 minutes,

944
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,060
so you're not going to get a lot more content in this one, I think.

945
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,580
I recently moved to a new city and one day after work,

946
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,780
I went through the drive-through at a Dairy Queen I've never visited before.

947
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,500
When I pulled up to the window, I immediately recognized the cashier,

948
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
but I didn't know her name or how I knew her.

949
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,340
She also expressed some similar recognition of me.

950
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,420
We talked for a bit and determined we didn't go to a school together

951
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,780
and are not from the same area.

952
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,220
How do I find out who she is?

953
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,180
Is my brain broken?

954
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,460
That's from Lost in Louisville.

955
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,940
How are we supposed to know this?

956
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,140
How are we supposed to possess this information?

957
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,300
Well, I think my suspicion is

958
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,980
that you might be dealing with maybe like a past life scenario

959
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,020
where you two were like BFFs in Egypt or something.

960
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,300
Either that or you kind of look like somebody they knew

961
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,780
and they kind of look like somebody you knew

962
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,580
and memory is shit.

963
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,100
Maybe it was Christmas in New York

964
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,780
and you both tried to buy the same pair of black gloves at Blue Kicks.

965
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,340
Okay.

966
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,540
And then you fell in love, but then you were like,

967
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,580
we can't right now.

968
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,540
It's not a good time.

969
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,700
And so you write down your name and love in the time of cholera

970
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,380
and you send it out there.

971
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,140
And if we find it again, we're going to get back together.

972
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,180
But then you forgot.

973
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,820
You both forgot.

974
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,900
And then she got to work at Dairy Queen.

975
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,220
You move there and you're like, hey, you look familiar.

976
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,420
Is it the Seren did?

977
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,140
No, you said she had a different face.

978
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,740
All right.

979
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,220
See ya.

980
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,780
And this is our movie, 51st Serendipities.

981
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,980
I heard Travis on the way, when Travis stopped at her house

982
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,860
on the way back to his house,

983
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,220
and I heard him determine a route home

984
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,220
based on proximity to Dairy Queen.

985
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,260
Travis, what's up with that?

986
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,780
Hey, Travis, what's going on, bud?

987
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,300
Dairy Queen's my favorite travel food.

988
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,260
I think I've talked about that.

989
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,180
You have not, no.

990
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Oh, well, Dairy Queen's-

991
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,300
Yes, he has because the chicken strips

992
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,460
are so dippable and they're gravy-centric.

993
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,700
And we lambasted him for that choice.

994
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,020
Thank you.

995
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,820
I believe.

996
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,020
Here's the thing.

997
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,060
Dairy Queen's to me are a little bit mythical

998
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,700
because I've never lived in what I would consider

999
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,220
close proximity to one.

1000
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,620
And so when I see one, I get excited

1001
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,060
because it's not like a McDonald's

1002
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,900
where there's one every 10 feet.

1003
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,540
A Dairy Queen is like, oh, and like a Sonic.

1004
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,900
A Dairy Queen and a Sonic, you see them,

1005
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,100
you're like, oh, Dairy Queen, a Sonic,

1006
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,060
and you get excited.

1007
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,260
At least that's how I am.

1008
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,340
So when I'm traveling,

1009
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,180
if I'm going out of my way anyways,

1010
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,580
I like to plan my route by a Dairy Queen.

1011
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,780
There's nothing funny about it.

1012
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,900
I'm just a fan.

1013
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,420
I can take my coffee mug right now

1014
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,780
and open up my office window

1015
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,420
and throw it and hit a Dairy Queen down the street.

1016
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,100
This is not an exotic treat to me.

1017
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,540
And in fact, I don't know how I feel

1018
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,180
about the Dairy Queen

1019
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,380
because if I'm being honest,

1020
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,660
hot eats and cool treats,

1021
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,940
it's unfair that you get to do both.

1022
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,980
When I went to the country's best yogurt,

1023
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
there was a reason why we're the country's best yogurt

1024
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,460
is because we weren't also making chicken strips.

1025
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,860
So as we focused on a discipline, on a craft,

1026
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,340
and we mastered it and became the best at it.

1027
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,900
Why did they ever become the world's best yogurt, Griffin?

1028
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:01,060
Well, there's this fucking dope spot over in Barcelona.

1029
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,940
And like we know,

1030
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,020
it's actually required in the TCBY training session.

1031
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,420
You watch the video and then you practice.

1032
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,420
You gotta get seven ounces on the small.

1033
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,180
You gotta get nine ounces on the medium

1034
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,460
and 13 on the big.

1035
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,060
And then you gotta just practice that

1036
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,820
until your hand, it's just muscle memory.

1037
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,260
Always seven ounces, always seven ounces.

1038
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,460
And then you go to Barcelona

1039
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,260
and it's technically gelato there,

1040
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,180
but holy shit, you eat it and you're like,

1041
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,300
oh yeah, our shit sucks.

1042
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,980
Our shit is garbage.

1043
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,340
Wait, you study abroad at TCBY University?

1044
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for like six months.

1045
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,820
It's so you don't get a big head.

1046
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,220
Like you start thinking you're cock of the walk,

1047
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,660
making the world's best yogurt,

1048
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,580
but then you go to Barcelona and it's like,

1049
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,460
ah, clearly not.

1050
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,660
Oh, I'm nothing, I'm nothing.

1051
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm nothing, I'm a zilch over here.

1052
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,300
You know, Dairy Queen, they have to,

1053
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,780
when you get a blizzard,

1054
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,540
they have to up in the blizzard in front of you or it's free.

1055
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,940
That's a wild thing, huh?

1056
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,100
Like I don't know of any other restaurants

1057
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,020
that require food-based stunts when the food is ordered.

1058
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,820
I can't think of,

1059
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,220
it's not like when you go to McDonald's

1060
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,460
and they're like, they drop your Big Mac

1061
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,820
to show you that it stays together as a sandwich.

1062
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,940
Like you never have to,

1063
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,020
like they never have to, at Olive Garden,

1064
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,860
they don't like take a handful of your spaghetti

1065
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,020
and throw it at the wall to show that it sticks

1066
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,220
and it's properly cooked.

1067
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,500
There's a place here called Piteri's.

1068
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,540
It's a good little burger restaurant,

1069
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,820
beats the shit out of In-N-Out.

1070
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,780
Don't at me.

1071
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,180
And what they do is they have to take a drink of your lemonade

1072
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,860
and a bite of your burger and a bite of your fries

1073
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,100
just to prove to you it's not poison every time.

1074
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,340
If they don't, it's free.

1075
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,100
If they don't, it's free and it's also poison.

1076
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,660
Don't eat it.

1077
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,860
How about this Yahoo that was sent in by-

1078
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,820
Free poison burgers.

1079
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,780
Sent in by, they're so good, I would still fucking do it.

1080
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,860
Hold on, I want to hear this Yahoo very bad.

1081
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,020
I'm very worried that people have started tweeting

1082
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,300
to Timothy Amundsen that Travis didn't enjoy his performance

1083
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,060
in Lucky Irish.

1084
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,180
No, no, no, I loved it.

1085
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,620
I'm concerned that Travis just enjoys all your work

1086
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,020
but not your performance in Lucky Irish.

1087
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,580
That is my-

1088
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,820
You said your shit sucked in that Irish-

1089
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,020
No, no, no, I didn't.

1090
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,900
I loved it.

1091
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,900
That's when I first became a fan.

1092
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,220
I just don't want him to know that.

1093
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,600
Okay.

1094
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,520
Okay.

1095
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,180
Jesus.

1096
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,780
Okay, so I was about to read this Yahoo,

1097
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,820
but I saw one in the suggested questions sidebar

1098
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,700
and it says, solve my Harry Potter riddle.

1099
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,500
Well, hint, I'm not sure where your loyalty lies.

1100
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,740
Keep your chin up to the royal skies.

1101
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:32,820
That's it.

1102
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,940
That's all that's in your riddle.

1103
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,940
Your riddle sucks so bad.

1104
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,460
Your riddle sucks really, really bad.

1105
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,260
I mean, I think it's the-

1106
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,620
Give it to me one more time.

1107
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,020
It's the-

1108
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,580
Give it to me one more time.

1109
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,460
I'm not sure where your loyalty lies.

1110
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,300
Keep your chin up to the royal skies.

1111
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,580
It is another one, this user, whose name is not appearing.

1112
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,980
Can you solve my Harry Potter based riddle?

1113
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,020
And then there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1114
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,500
nine, 10, 11 empty spots.

1115
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,460
That's it.

1116
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,100
That's all it is.

1117
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,900
It's like 11 letters, but you didn't tell me what it is.

1118
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,100
Voldemort, is that 11?

1119
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,260
I'm going to assume it is, asshole.

1120
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,340
All right, anyway, I've lost the original question.

1121
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,540
Can we end the show?

1122
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,940
No, no.

1123
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,900
Is one-

1124
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,340
It's been sent in by Aaron Keys.

1125
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:20,820
Thank you, Aaron.

1126
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,260
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

1127
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,700
It was asked by Voldemort, who says,

1128
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,020
I'll get you Harry Potter.

1129
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,100
Can you become a celebrity for arguing-

1130
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,620
I put mayonnaise on my fries.

1131
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,020
All right.

1132
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,620
Can you become a celebrity for arguing with a celebrity

1133
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,820
on Twitter and winning?

1134
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,900
So a lot of motherfuckers seem to think so.

1135
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,060
Oh, man.

1136
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,980
Well, here's what I think about global warming Whoopi Goldberg,

1137
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,300
and then fucking you watch the news that night.

1138
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,420
It's like, he got her.

1139
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,620
Got her.

1140
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:59,460
Luke James from Des Moines really burned the shit out

1141
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,660
of Whoopi today.

1142
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,460
Oh, my God.

1143
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,660
Y'all got to see this.

1144
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,740
He's got a book deal.

1145
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,980
He really went to town on Whoopi's just logic here.

1146
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,780
Really jumped on all the gaps in the reasoning here

1147
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,860
of Whoopi Goldberg from Sister Act.

1148
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,700
This is actually what celebrities hope nobody ever finds out,

1149
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,820
which is that that's how the mantle passes.

1150
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,780
You have to win specifically a Twitter argument.

1151
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,420
You can't like find Joaquin Phoenix in real life

1152
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,300
and be like, chocolate's better.

1153
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,580
And like, that won't work.

1154
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,180
But like, if online you start a fight with Joaquin Phoenix

1155
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,140
and you win, and that can be hard to prove sometimes,

1156
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,580
you got to run it by the judges,

1157
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,020
and you win, you get to be in her too.

1158
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,780
Oh, you become the celebrity.

1159
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,340
Exactly.

1160
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,740
And then Joaquin Phoenix is out.

1161
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,540
That's what that weird Joaquin Phoenix movie happened

1162
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,540
when he got a shit done on his face.

1163
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,180
Was he had a break there because he was talking about like,

1164
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,340
I think pit bulls are dangerous.

1165
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,460
And somebody was like, oh, no, you didn't Joaquin Phoenix.

1166
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,540
And then the news was like, did you hear?

1167
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,780
Jeff James got Joaquin Phoenix so good,

1168
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,900
dunked on him so high, and now he's the her man.

1169
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,020
Now he's the her two man star.

1170
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,300
He's the Herman.

1171
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,660
Do you have to take over the career of the star

1172
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,940
that you beat in a Twitter argument?

1173
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,980
Absolutely.

1174
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,300
Sister L3 is during me, Griffin McElroy.

1175
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,660
It's farther than that, Justin.

1176
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,260
Actually, it's you swap bodies.

1177
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,620
Oh, no.

1178
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,660
So if you've ever seen a star and it was like,

1179
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,740
why does it seem like Zac Efron jumps back and forth

1180
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,380
between making like Nicholas Sparks movies,

1181
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,300
but also bad grandpa?

1182
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,900
And it's because he's really bad

1183
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
at arguing with people on Twitter.

1184
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,460
Yeah.

1185
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,780
So it's just like somebody else takes over his body

1186
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,620
and then it's like, I'm making the new beach movie.

1187
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,060
And then another person takes over,

1188
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,300
like, I'm making a movie where I sail a boat

1189
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,340
and my little brother died.

1190
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,940
That's because he's always trying to start shit.

1191
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,900
He gets on Twitter and he's like,

1192
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,540
I don't know why we don't just call Pringles potato chips.

1193
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,020
And then somebody's like, I'm famous.

1194
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,540
I'm gonna get this fucking guy.

1195
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,620
That is a good point, Travis.

1196
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,420
Thank you for bringing that up.

1197
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,180
If Zac Efron ever tries to start an argument with you

1198
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,620
on Twitter, do not engage with him

1199
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,860
because he's trying to claw his way back up.

1200
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,540
He's starting low and you should be careful of that

1201
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,140
because you don't want him to be like,

1202
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,380
and now I'm the assistant manager at Borders.

1203
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,780
Like, okay, well, that's fine.

1204
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,340
And now you have to be Zac Efron, like, in his body.

1205
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,140
You understand?

1206
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,420
It's very confusing.

1207
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,900
Definitely, but that's why John Cusack's

1208
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,100
always trying to fight with everybody.

1209
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,100
He doesn't wanna be John Cusack anymore.

1210
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,420
I don't, there's gotta be some sort of reward

1211
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,420
either in this life or Valhalla

1212
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,300
that you get for arguing with celebs

1213
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,900
because it's literally every,

1214
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,140
at Dax Shepard, great day today.

1215
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,420
No, it isn't, you fucker.

1216
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,940
First and through 100th response,

1217
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,740
fuck you, Dax, it's a shitty day.

1218
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,620
Got him, now I'm the Dax man.

1219
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,780
There's gotta be some reason why people are like,

1220
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,820
I've got like, what, five billion minutes on this earth.

1221
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,580
I'm gonna spend one of them just dunking

1222
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,580
right on Dax Shepard from Punk'd.

1223
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,740
What are you guys doing?

1224
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,500
Because there's other stuff you could be doing.

1225
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,060
You could go out and try and catch a butterfly or something

1226
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,780
and then let it go.

1227
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,940
And Griffin, that's why it's sad.

1228
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,820
They don't want to fight with celebrities,

1229
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,340
but they have to.

1230
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,460
Go out and catch a butterfly

1231
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,060
and tell them it's wrong about climate change.

1232
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,060
That's the thing, it's the only way

1233
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,460
to thin the celebrity herd, Griffin,

1234
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,020
is if you fight with them and it's like,

1235
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,740
okay, that's the only way we can cycle through new movies.

1236
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,700
How do you think the new Chips movie got made?

1237
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,300
Because Dax Shepard fought with someone

1238
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,740
about whether or not it was a nice day,

1239
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,100
you know, and then Chips gets made.

1240
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,020
It's the only way we get movies.

1241
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,620
Dax don't care.

1242
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,620
I cannot stress this enough.

1243
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,940
If you ever get in a fight with Dax Shepard

1244
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,100
or enter any celebrity name here,

1245
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,020
Dax don't care.

1246
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,580
Dax might even reply and Dax ain't gonna care.

1247
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,500
That one's just gonna roll right off Dax's back,

1248
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,060
his famous happily married back.

1249
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,060
It's been sneaking up on me lately

1250
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,660
that I think Dax Shepard might be,

1251
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,940
and I don't know, I don't know anyone's mental standpoint,

1252
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,780
but he's got a pretty good deal going on.

1253
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,220
Yeah, he's doing good, it's Dax.

1254
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,940
And so if you tweeted him saying,

1255
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,980
you know, your thoughts about anything

1256
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,380
that Dax Shepard has very strong opinions about,

1257
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,180
which based on my only exposure to Dax these days

1258
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,220
is those washing machine commercials

1259
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,820
he does with Kristen Bell

1260
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,140
is just what a good laundry machine is.

1261
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,500
He doesn't give a shit.

1262
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,860
Nobody gives a shit.

1263
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,260
I have people that I know who tweet at celebrities like,

1264
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,420
well, here's what I think of that movie you just talked,

1265
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,940
he doesn't fucking care.

1266
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,060
Nobody, they don't care.

1267
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,260
They're not gonna read it and care.

1268
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,380
Yeah, the thing that is different

1269
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,220
about celebrities versus us,

1270
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,580
and everybody's always wondering,

1271
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,860
what do they do differently?

1272
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,700
Is that they don't fucking give a shit

1273
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,220
and they don't read their replies

1274
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,340
and they're not saying like,

1275
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,060
well, except when they are,

1276
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,500
and that gets a little uncomfortable

1277
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,180
because sometimes they definitely do.

1278
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,180
Sometimes, oh yeah, that's a good caveat.

1279
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,940
Sometimes they definitely care.

1280
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,460
I've actually been campaigning.

1281
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,380
I've been campaigning on this one for a while.

1282
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,300
Never tweet anything.

1283
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,740
And if someone responds to you,

1284
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,700
don't ever respond,

1285
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,140
I didn't expect you to read it.

1286
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,980
Then why did you tag them in it?

1287
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,380
Tagged them right in it.

1288
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,540
You don't have to at them if you don't like,

1289
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,620
that's like handing me a note

1290
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,260
and then being like,

1291
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,780
I didn't expect you to read the note.

1292
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,140
You handed it to me.

1293
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,060
Just keep it in your pocket.

1294
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,500
There's a certain level of pseudo celebrity

1295
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,180
where you read them all.

1296
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,220
And there's, I don't know anybody on this podcast.

1297
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,180
Not anymore.

1298
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,060
Not anymore, bro.

1299
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,940
Yeah, I don't, I try to,

1300
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,500
it got to be too much at a certain point.

1301
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,460
But I do still dip in there.

1302
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,900
And you know, the funny thing about it

1303
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,220
is the ones that I seem to notice and remember

1304
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,260
are the mean ones.

1305
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,300
That's weird, isn't it?

1306
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,500
That seems weird to me.

1307
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,420
But thank you for all your kind tweets.

1308
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,780
Just reading about on Dax Shepard's feed right now.

1309
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,580
I'm trying to find it.

1310
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:20,980
What's he into?

1311
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,460
What's he up to?

1312
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,180
How's he doing?

1313
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,460
Let's click over it.

1314
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,420
Dax, Dax Shepard.

1315
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,860
We cannot have a show where two thirds

1316
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,500
of people are reading Dax.

1317
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,460
He's at Dax Shepard one.

1318
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,260
Couldn't get at Dax Shepard.

1319
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,340
Oh, who's holding out?

1320
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,140
I'm going to look and see what.

1321
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,140
Yeah, find me the original Dax Shepard.

1322
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,820
Oh, hasn't tweeted.

1323
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,540
Just sitting on it since April 2009.

1324
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,060
Dax, talk to them.

1325
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,180
And it's, oh, oh, oh.

1326
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,980
The description is punked employee of the month

1327
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,700
without a paddle, et cetera.

1328
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,900
That ain't you.

1329
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,500
That is not at Dax Shepard.

1330
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,220
Dax, if you want it, it'll just cost you one night

1331
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,340
with you, Dax Shepard.

1332
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,740
Come on.

1333
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,020
Come on.

1334
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,420
Come on.

1335
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,380
You want this Tweeto?

1336
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,300
Come fuck this, Dax, please.

1337
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,300
Come punk this butt.

1338
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,860
Punk my butt, Dax.

1339
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,260
Happy birthday, happy birthday, Kristen Bell.

1340
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,340
And like a million tweets of people like, great.

1341
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,140
Love this wedding.

1342
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,020
Love this marriage.

1343
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,340
I don't think he, maybe he does care.

1344
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:14,900
I don't know.

1345
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,780
I'm, I can't.

1346
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,860
I'm so deep down the Dax hole right now.

1347
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,620
It's just, if you're listening to this podcast,

1348
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,820
if you're under the power of my voice,

1349
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,140
don't tweet at Dax Shepard.

1350
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,420
Please.

1351
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,900
But do follow him.

1352
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,460
Absolutely.

1353
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,300
A source of great insight in comedy.

1354
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,260
We did talk about without a paddle for a couple minutes

1355
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,660
a few years back, and I don't think that any of that

1356
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,220
was admissible in Friendship Court.

1357
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,180
At least I hope not.

1358
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,220
Tough shit, dude.

1359
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,660
We burnt like four bridges there.

1360
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:47,620
Dax, Seth, the Scooby Doo one.

1361
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,060
So good on Twin Peaks, by the way.

1362
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,900
Mr. Lillard, if you're listening.

1363
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,860
Everybody's great.

1364
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,980
All, you know what?

1365
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,740
I'll go on record.

1366
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,380
All celebrities except the racist and terrible

1367
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,900
problematic ones are great.

1368
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,380
There.

1369
00:55:59,380 --> 00:55:59,940
I said it.

1370
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,580
They're all great.

1371
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,140
They all make good work unless they are incredibly

1372
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,140
problematic, at which point they are not great.

1373
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,460
Not.

1374
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,220
Not great at all.

1375
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,180
You heard it here.

1376
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,140
And sometimes they go from the first group into the second

1377
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,220
group, and that's challenging.

1378
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,380
If they did, we knew it the whole time, and we retroactively

1379
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,740
didn't mean them.

1380
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,540
Fucking Tim Allen ejaculates into group two,

1381
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,820
and I'm like, mm, called it.

1382
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,780
I'm a piece of shit.

1383
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,420
Uh-huh.

1384
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,460
Called that one.

1385
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,180
Gotcha, Tim.

1386
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:38,740
I got Tim on that one.

1387
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,180
And then you're like, fuck you, Tim.

1388
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,980
He doesn't care.

1389
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,340
He don't care.

1390
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,020
He doesn't care.

1391
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,140
Now, that's a man with a Twitter bio right there,

1392
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:47,940
is Tim Allen.

1393
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,180
This is so good.

1394
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,140
Tim Allen, his bio says, Santa?

1395
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,980
Buzz Lightyear?

1396
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,260
The Toolman?

1397
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,460
Mike Baxter?

1398
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,860
Hey, I'm still that wisecracking kid from the

1399
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,500
Midwest looking for answers to life's big questions.

1400
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:05,940
You're Buzz Lightyear.

1401
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,540
I'm doing time for selling drugs.

1402
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,820
You're Buzz Lightyear.

1403
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,140
Your header image is Santa Claus looking lovingly at Buzz

1404
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:13,860
Lightyear.

1405
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,860
You are not the wisecracking kid from the Midwest.

1406
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,340
You are Santa and Buzz Lightyear, the Toolman,

1407
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,580
and whoever the fuck Mike Baxter is.

1408
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,980
If you look at Tim Allen's Twitter header,

1409
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,020
it is so fuckwild because it's Santa Claus in the middle,

1410
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,540
and then Buzz Lightyear to the right,

1411
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,660
and then a blank void to the left as if he's leaving room

1412
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,060
for another treasured character that he may create in the

1413
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,460
future.

1414
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,500
The other treasured character is him,

1415
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,060
a wisecracking kid from the Midwest just looking for

1416
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,900
answers to life's big questions.

1417
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,340
My dude, you are looking in all the wrong places because

1418
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,820
your shit sucks now, Timothy.

1419
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,740
It might have always sucked, but now you're just kind of

1420
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,820
being a little bit more public about it,

1421
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,340
sliding right into group two.

1422
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,220
I knew it.

1423
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,100
I knew.

1424
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,620
I was the one who knew about Timothy.

1425
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,500
He also has a picture of himself as him and him,

1426
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,380
and it says Tim and him.

1427
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,140
That's on his Twitter.

1428
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,860
There's a lot of great things and not so great things

1429
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,660
waiting for you.

1430
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,260
A lot of bad content, actually.

1431
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:08,580
Hmm.

1432
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,940
Try this.

1433
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,420
Try this.

1434
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,580
If Jimmy is from August 19th, try this.

1435
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,980
If Jimmy cracked corn and no one's cares,

1436
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,900
why did we sing a song about him?

1437
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,700
Looking for answers to the big ones,

1438
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,780
the questions, because that's me from the Midwest,

1439
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,940
a wisecracking kid, not Buzz Lightyear.

1440
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,340
I want to address something on his Twitter feed.

1441
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,740
He tweeted a while ago, and a lot of people addressed this.

1442
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,420
He tweeted, if we evolve from apes,

1443
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,780
why are there still apes?

1444
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,420
Okay.

1445
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,940
And some people said, that's not serious.

1446
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,140
He was joking.

1447
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,420
And then he did the next day tweet, comedy ain't pretty,

1448
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,260
and to some, not so funny.

1449
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,180
And then on the 18th tweeted,

1450
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,460
maybe I will do the ape evolved bit at the Gig

1451
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,540
and Wonderful Paramount Theater in Illinois.

1452
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,420
Now, here's the thing.

1453
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,660
One of two things is possible.

1454
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,220
Either he sincerely tweeted, if we evolve from apes,

1455
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,180
why are there still apes?

1456
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,540
Or he thought that was a hilarious joke.

1457
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,260
And the second one is more like, oh, his classic,

1458
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,140
if we evolve from apes, why are there still apes bit?

1459
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,620
Yeah.

1460
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,140
Well, that's how he does it.

1461
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,380
He's looking for answers to life's big questions.

1462
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,780
Questions like, if we evolve from apes,

1463
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,300
why there are still apes?

1464
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,620
And then a billion people on Twitter are like,

1465
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,940
tool man, you're a fucking idiot.

1466
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,020
And then he's like, okay, so that's not one of them.

1467
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,940
That big question's still out there about the apes.

1468
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,820
You know what though?

1469
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,420
Apparently people got real rides out of it.

1470
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,780
I'm gonna do it at my comedy show.

1471
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,020
My bad comedy show that you paid $30 to come see.

1472
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,700
Doing stand up, huh Tim?

1473
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,540
Gotta see that wisecracking kid from the Midwest

1474
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,460
for $30 at Aurora, Illinois.

1475
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1476
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,860
People just fucking shitting their pants, screaming.

1477
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,380
Chris, grunt more.

1478
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,580
You're not Buzz Lightyear.

1479
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,580
You're a wisecracking kid.

1480
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,380
Is that Santa?

1481
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,340
No.

1482
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,740
Santa's on stage with us, it's not Santa.

1483
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,340
That's not Santa up there.

1484
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,780
That's just a humble wisecracking kid.

1485
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,940
Look at him ejaculate up there, hilarious.

1486
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,860
Is that Mike Baxter, whoever the fuck that is?

1487
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,580
No, that's just Tim, just Tim.

1488
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,860
I think that's from his wack new show

1489
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,460
that we've somehow allowed to continue

1490
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,820
for many, many years.

1491
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,220
Many years longer than Last Man Standing

1492
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,980
should have been standing.

1493
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,260
If your kid looks at Tim Allen and says,

1494
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,260
is that Santa Claus, things have gone terribly wrong.

1495
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,740
Things have gone desperately wrong for you as a parent.

1496
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,380
Santa Claus is and always will be John Hammond

1497
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,220
from Jurassic Park, Actor Man.

1498
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,420
That's gonna do it for us on this episode

1499
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,980
of My Brother, Me, We Hope You've Enjoyed Yourself

1500
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,220
and had a good time.

1501
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,300
Is there anything we wanna talk about this week?

1502
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,100
Anything going on?

1503
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,820
Oh yeah, I need lots and lots of yahoos, please,

1504
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,060
because we are about to do three shows back to back

1505
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,940
this coming weekend in New York, DC, and Boston.

1506
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,100
I think tickets are all sold out on this leg.

1507
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,340
But if you wanna come see us in October, November,

1508
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,860
you can still get tickets, I believe,

1509
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,060
for the Milwaukee show.

1510
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,500
I think Minneapolis is done so.

1511
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,660
You can find ticket links and everything

1512
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,980
at mackleroyshows.com slash tours, is that right?

1513
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,700
And we have other shows on that thing,

1514
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,300
including a new show that me and Rachel are doing.

1515
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,380
Well, it's sort of a revamped version of Rose Buddies

1516
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,820
that should be launching this week,

1517
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,820
which I'm very, very excited about.

1518
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,700
Excellent.

1519
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,660
I wanted to make two quick notes

1520
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,020
about those shows this weekend.

1521
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,940
Sometimes at those shows, the tickets are released

1522
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,500
at a very, very limited number of tickets

1523
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,940
are released at the window.

1524
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,500
So if you wanted to try for that,

1525
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,020
that may be a possibility.

1526
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,700
There's no guarantees, it may not happen,

1527
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,300
but I know it has happened in the past.

1528
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,340
So just so you know.

1529
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:51,300
Also, we have traditionally gone out after the shows

1530
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
to sign things and what have you.

1531
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,220
I don't think we're gonna be able to do that

1532
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,420
so much anymore after the shows because-

1533
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,180
Yeah, not during these tours.

1534
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,100
It's gonna be real tight.

1535
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,420
It's just tough, cause we have shows every day,

1536
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,220
so we kinda have to go back and sleep

1537
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,820
and then drive the next day.

1538
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,940
So we probably won't be hanging out after those,

1539
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,540
which I only mentioned because I don't want people

1540
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,020
to wait around thinking that we're gonna be popping out

1541
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,780
to sign stuff, and I'm sorry about that.

1542
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,020
But also, we're traveling with families and stuff,

1543
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:27,020
and it gets really tricky to keep everybody there so late.

1544
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:31,460
So that is the deal with that, just so y'all know.

1545
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,700
I also wanted to let everybody know,

1546
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,820
here in Cincinnati at the Noh Theater of Cincinnati,

1547
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,780
I am, starting in November, teaching a weekly class

1548
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,340
about podcasting called Podcast 101.

1549
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,300
And so even if you're not in Cincinnati,

1550
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,460
and it is already sold out in Cincinnati,

1551
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,700
but we're also going to be videotaping it

1552
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:56,660
and then sending links to the videos to people who sign up.

1553
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,540
It's $100 for six hour and a half long videos

1554
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,740
about podcasting.

1555
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,780
If you're interested in checking out the details,

1556
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,980
and maybe signing up,

1557
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:11,980
you can go to bit.ly forward slash podcast 101 video

1558
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,220
and sign up for it there.

1559
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,860
Let's see, what else?

1560
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,700
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1561
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,660
for the use of our theme song,

1562
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,900
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1563
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,580
John has been kind enough to let us use that song

1564
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,260
for like six years now,

1565
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,260
and I cannot imagine our show without it.

1566
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,060
So thank you, John and the Long Winters.

1567
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,820
Oh, along with sending in Yahoo's,

1568
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,700
if you're gonna be at the shows,

1569
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,300
make sure you send in regular questions.

1570
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,260
Send regular questions too,

1571
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,740
and put in the subject which show you're going to be at,

1572
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,780
so we can sort them easier.

1573
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,380
I don't think I've ever promoted this on here,

1574
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:50,340
but Justin and I, and Travis pops in a lot too.

1575
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,780
We do videos for Polygon.

1576
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,620
If you go to polygon.com slash YouTube,

1577
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,660
you can check out all of the different videos

1578
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,500
that we do there.

1579
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,660
Justin and I have a series called Monster Factory.

1580
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,780
We play Player Unknown's Battlegrounds every Tuesday.

1581
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,340
We live stream it for like a couple hours,

1582
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,660
and Travis usually joins in in a series called Awful Squad.

1583
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,980
You can watch like a bunch of archived videos of that.

1584
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,380
It's a very, very fun little series.

1585
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,660
And that link is also youtube.com slash Polygon,

1586
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,300
not the inverted one that Griffin just said.

1587
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,180
What did I say?

1588
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,700
Polygon.com slash YouTube?

1589
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,540
Yeah.

1590
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,380
Oops, that's not right.

1591
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,420
Yeah, youtube.com slash Polygon.

1592
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,940
Yeah, so how about that final?

1593
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,860
Wait, I have one more thing.

1594
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,140
I just remembered, quick.

1595
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:25,540
If you're in Cincinnati or the Cincinnati area,

1596
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,540
my friends and I are organizing a puzzle-themed pub crawl

1597
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:35,020
where you go from bar to bar and solve puzzles

1598
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:38,420
and get points and compete and that kind of thing.

1599
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,820

01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,920

1609
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,140
I'm a wisecracking kid who came from the Midwest

1610
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,620
looking for answers to my question for McElroy.

1611
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,860
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad.

1612
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,140
Square on the lips.

1613
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,140
Hey girls, do you wanna just say hey I wanna?

1614
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:18,980

Going into a bullseye interview,

1618
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,220
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

1619
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,760
but it's an actual conversation.

1620
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,260
I don't know where it's headed.

1621
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,780
Absolutely, you're absolutely right.

1622
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,340
You said it actually better than I did,

1623
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,600
so I have to think about what that means.

1624
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,440
Hmm.

1625
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,700

1626
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,340
