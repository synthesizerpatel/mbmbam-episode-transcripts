1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a new craze, and good girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, a mean advice show for the

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and it's time to pay the piper.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
I'm the middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I agree with the statement about the piper.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and look at how sticky my hands are. Gonna put them

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,160
right in your pockets and get all that sweet change out. We're the sticky bandits of podcasts.

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,320
It's a max fun drive. That means a long episode, some of which is begging,

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,600
but a lot of it is comedy still. Well, comedy. I used air quotes.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I don't like to think of it as begging as much as I like to think of it as self-serving

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,720
suggestion in the fiduciary sense. I mean, is it begging when the waiter

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
brings the check to the table, Justin? I don't think so.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,160
It's comedy check. It's time to pay the comedy check,

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,680
and you all said you would split it, but then Debra had the comedy salad,

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,080
but Steven had the comedy T-bone, so do you split the comedy evenly? It's hard to say.

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,480
Do you tip on the comedy tax? Who knows? Listen to my brother and my brother and me.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,320
It's like going to a very expensive comedy dinner with you and a million to two million of your

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,600
closest friends, and you all said you would split the check except some people died in the dash,

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,960
and you just gotta assume everybody else died in the dash, and you are picking up their part of the

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,680
tab. And by really fancy dinner,

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,720
you mean like a ponderoso once a month. Yeah, and by millions, I meant significantly

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,320
not that. And it's fun because every year we talk about like what we need the money for,

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,080
and we always say like, you know, kind of general stuff like make the show better,

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
and we have a very specific need this year. Yeah, I'm buying pizza right now as we speak.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Two very specific needs. For my wife and baby, and they're like, are the donors? Payment method?

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,200
Credit card? Nope. No dice there. Checking account? No, don't have it. Donors? Question mark?

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,960
Donors, can you supply us with this sweet Italian podcast fuel that we call pizza?

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,160
The other reason that we discussed before we started was that we need to hire a team of

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,280
lawyers. Okay, we need flavor defense because everybody, everybody is constantly coming for

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,920
our flavor. And we tried to mail our flavor to ourselves and then not open the envelope so that

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,640
we could prove that in court. That doesn't hold up in court. Didn't hold up. Does not work. The

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
Yahoo answers, those were funny. You know who else thought so? Everybody. Every fucking person.

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,120
Everybody. And everybody else is doing sad libs now.

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,280
Well, that one, that particular zeitgeist hasn't-

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,120
I saw it on Comedy Bang Bang. It was on Nerdist. It was on Midnight. Everybody's doing sad libs.

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
Hoda was busting them out.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Hoda's doing some sad libs.

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,360
And then today we see this, like all of a sudden Vice and NPR in the past two days

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
have both gotten on haunted dolls.

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
I feel like I've heard about that somewhere before.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,520
Yeah, I know. And people send us these links gleefully like, guess it's catching on,

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,200
and I see those links and I think, fuck. That's now a thing we can't do anymore because now it's

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,600
a thing.

47
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,520
You see those links as-

48
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,640
You know we're not getting a cut of that? We don't get a slice of that.

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,480
You see those links as negative food in your baby's tummy.

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,400
Are they stealing from us? No. Is it just that we've holistically, as a culture,

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
like, the time has come for haunted dolls to be widely known and we just like,

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,680
it was so amazing that we couldn't keep it to ourselves.

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Does Terry Gross listen to my brother and my brother and me? She's chomping our flavor 24-7.

54
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
Occam's Razor. Occam's Razor.

55
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,880
Occam's Razor is that Terry Gross, TG, is chomping our Flav 24-7,

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,760
and we need a team of flavor defense lawyers to get her into jail.

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,640
We need to get the firm of Flav and Flav.

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,520
Yeah, to protect our Flav.

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,480
I want her breathing stale air in a jail cell.

60
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
No more fresh air for you, TG.

61
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
So it's Maximum Fun Drive every year we-

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
What is that? Can you explain what that means to people who haven't-

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
I'm about to if you can just wait, Chris Farley voice.

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,520
Every year. Okay, let me back up.

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
You have forgotten what we do.

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
We're part of the Maximum Fun Network, which is a network of beloved podcasts.

67
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Us, Jordan and Jesse, go stop podcasting yourself.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
New additions like Baby Geniuses.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
The Flophouse.

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Flophouse. You know, so many others.

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,560
We're part of this podcast network, and every year, once a year,

72
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,080
we come to you, the listeners, and say,

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,680
hey, can we have some support for the stuff that we're doing, right?

74
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,520
That makes sense so far.

75
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
And then that's basically it.

76
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,760
If you've been enjoying the shows,

77
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,840
you know, we ask that you maybe give a little bit,

78
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,920
a monthly donation to help support the network,

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
and in return, you're going to get a ton of really great stuff.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,920
We'll be telling you about this later.

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,680
We'll tell you about all the cool stuff you can get.

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,400
There's a lot of cool stuff, and we will tell you how to donate.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
It's maximumfun.org slash donate, spoiler alert.

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
But we'll be breaking in later to tell you about that.

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
For now, though, let's get on with the show.

86
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
Hey, I'm inspired, Griffin.

87
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm inspired.

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
Let's start with the Yahoo this time.

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
Whoa!

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,760
I know, right?

91
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,640
Whoa!

92
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
Is it opposite day?

93
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,480
Let's start with the Yahoo this time.

94
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
This is fun.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
This is fun precedented.

96
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,440
Also, you don't have the email open, do you?

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm trying to finish ordering the pizza.

98
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
You're fucking going on a pizza adventure.

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,640
No way.

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,080
I'm going to sit here obstinately.

101
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,560
Let me zest my baby for a second while you do your dumbass show.

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
You zest your baby on your own goddamn time.

103
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah, it is.

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,160
That's my favorite Dr. Spock book, by the way.

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,760
It's post 5 p.m.

106
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,440
I am on my own goddamn time.

107
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm trying to feed my baby.

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,480
Can you please just repeat a delicious pizza?

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm trying to get my baby delicious.

110
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,320
Listen, we're trying to get this baby flavor blasted in here,

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
and Griffin's copying your swag.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Do you know how much focus it takes to be on the Pizza Hut website

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
and order a full baby bottle of marinara?

114
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,200
Justin, I thought that you guys were breastfeeding marinara sauce.

115
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
So it's genetically, it just didn't pan out for us.

116
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
How about a Yahoo?

117
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,600
Can I tell you the best part about the pizza hut.com experience?

118
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,800
At the end of the ordering process, step number three is,

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,480
do you want this order as soon as possible, or do you want this on a future time?

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,560
Like, hi, I'm getting pizza.

121
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
I am anticipating that in three hours time, I will be a hungy boy.

122
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,360
That's not, that's like, that is so crazy to think that anyone,

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,400
you order pizza when you have nothing left to lose.

124
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,560
Like, it's so crazy to me that anyone would like get out in front of this.

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,880
Here in a few hours, I'm gonna order pizza.

126
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Can you do it three days time and say like,

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,880
bring me a pizza on Thursday when I'm least expecting it.

128
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,440
All right, Griffin, give me, I have the questions now, by the way.

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,880
The pizza has been ordered, our national tragedy has been averted.

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,120
Okay.

131
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Hit me.

132
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
This Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Shannon.

133
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,520
Thank you, Ashley.

134
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Shades, who asks,

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,240
Wendy's drive-through service time, too fast.

136
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,360
Weirdly timed, considering our previous conversation.

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it possible for a drive-through service to be too fast?

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,960
I went to a Wendy's restaurant and had forgotten,

139
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,280
because I haven't been in about one and a half years.

140
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,320
How do you go that long without some sweet Wendy's in your mouth?

141
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
How fast the drive-through service is?

142
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,400
Is it odd that as soon as you get to the pickup window,

143
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,560
your meal is ready so fast that you don't have to stop,

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,520
step on the brake, just fucking chuck it in.

145
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,840
What?

146
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Give me a crispy chicken hand grenade right in the window,

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
right in the driver's side.

148
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,840
And on top of this, the cashier at the first window

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,040
oddly knew what denomination of money I was going to give her

150
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
and had the exact change ready when I got to the window.

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,440
Wait, okay.

152
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,360
It's spinning out of control.

153
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,320
This is ridiculous.

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,280
Is it weird that I go to a prescient?

155
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
We go to a precog Wendy's.

156
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,520
They have three red-headed teenage girls in tanks,

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,600
and they just, every few minutes or so, their eyes pop open.

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
He's going to want the nugs.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
He's going to get the nugs.

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Spicy chicken deluxe.

161
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,920
And then every so often, one of the three will be like,

162
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,840
it's probably a junior bacon cheeseburger.

163
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,560
It's like, no.

164
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
No, no, delete that.

165
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Looks like we've got a Hyundai Elantra,

166
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
pulling around 2003 Hyundai Elantra,

167
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,800
and here comes a little brown ball down the machine.

168
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,120
Okay.

169
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
He wants diarrhea.

170
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
Surprise, that's every brown ball.

171
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,760
That's all of them.

172
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,320
I get it.

173
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,520
Like, it not only freaks me out because of witchcraft,

174
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,040
obviously, it sort of shatters the illusion

175
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,320
that this food is being, at the very least,

176
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,080
resuscitated to order.

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,360
You know what I mean?

178
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
Like, I am under, I am not expecting-

179
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,280
Somebody gets the petals out on your junior bacon cheeseburger.

180
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Like, clear.

181
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,680
No, no, hold on.

182
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,320
Do you guys expect that the person working at Wendy's,

183
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,680
like, when a burger's ordered, you're like,

184
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,320
you know what?

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
I know what I was taught at Wendy's U.

186
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I'm going to reinvent the burger on this one.

187
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
I'm going to need a solid 20 to 30 minutes.

188
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,400
No, but let's split the difference.

189
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,800
I also don't think there's any char grilling going on.

190
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,560
What if the meat is the bun?

191
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,320
You're crazy, Randall.

192
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
Well, that's how, I mean, that's been like KFC

193
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,280
and Taco Bell's basic MMO.

194
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,200
Just let crazy Randall do whatever.

195
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah, crazy Randall like,

196
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,880
oh god, a bunch of taco, but shell's all cheese

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,520
and the meat's all cheese and it's cheesy all through.

198
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,840
It came to me in a flavor dream.

199
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,400
Don't make, you can't cook anything with KFC

200
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
with a hole in it,

201
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
because Randall will try to stuff a potato in there.

202
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,680
Yep.

203
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,180
Yep.

204
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,400
I don't want,

205
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,960
I'm not pretending that there is an artisanal,

206
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,840
like, level of craftsmanship going on,

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,360
but when it's instantaneous, it just,

208
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
I can't, I can't get over that.

209
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,560
It's too fast.

210
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,760
The food is too fast.

211
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
Do you think it's not so much,

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
it's not about the food quality for me.

213
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
I just don't like the idea that I'm not unoriginal.

214
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,240
Like, I kind of like them to have to make it special for me.

215
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Well, that's what it is.

216
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
Is it kind of the thing where it's like,

217
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,840
no like sentence,

218
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,560
no combination of words has ever not been said

219
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,360
and they said like,

220
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
we've said so much that there's no new way to say anything.

221
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,040
Like, everyone's ordered everything from this Wendy's

222
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
and that's how they even know like the change.

223
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
It's like, okay, it was 13.81.

224
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,840
He's gonna give me a 20.

225
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,160
Like, I've just got a drawer set out

226
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,680
with like $6.19 to hand back to him.

227
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk.

228
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,160
That's been said.

229
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
That was in-

230
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
No, that's garbage.

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
That was fucking it.

232
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,760
That was the first time he birthed that concept into being.

233
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
The bigger concern is how furious is the food?

234
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,240
That would have been a good thing to say 17 minutes ago.

235
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
Griffin, did you edit that in

236
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,960
to the first time you said it was too fast?

237
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,440
Yeah, and what I'll do is I'll also take

238
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
and make that be the first thing anybody hears

240
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,640
when they turn on the episode.

241
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay.

242
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm gonna actually edit that

243
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,400
into the beginning of every episode we've ever done.

244
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,120
All 243 episodes all gonna kick off.

245
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,680
It's gonna be-

246
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,440
The Lenny Kravitz breast milk reverberated back through time.

247
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
Yeah, preceding Bob Balls opening monologue.

248
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
We're gonna have a Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk

249
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,440
just as like a teaser of things to come.

250
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
And now the singularity has occurred

251
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,000
and now we can move on.

252
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,240
I got a question.

253
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,960
My friends and I have developed a bit of an unofficial rotation

254
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,640
for hosting dinner get togethers. They're always a blast.

255
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,080
My friends are all great hosts and awesome guests

256
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,640
and never show up without some food or booze in tow.

257
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
It worked out perfectly until one couple invited everyone over

258
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
and sent out the message that rather than contributing

259
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,640
any alcohol or food, everyone who attends

260
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,560
should just pay them 15 bucks a piece.

261
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:14,960
What the fuck?

262
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
They would take care of all the drinks

263
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,520
and food stuffs themselves.

264
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,160
I think this is some ghoulish shit.

265
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,120
If I wanted to conduct-

266
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,600
Or some goulash shit if they have goulash.

267
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,960
I think these are the high quality ghoulish

268
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,160
you're paying for, Derek.

269
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,680
That would be $30, please.

270
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,320
Yeah, bad news.

271
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
Just by listening to that goof,

272
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
you don't have to give us another quarter.

273
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,080
If I wanted to conduct a business transaction

274
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,720
for my dinner, I'd go to a restaurant.

275
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,200
Something just skews me out about forking over cash

276
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,120
to my friends for the meal they prepared.

277
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
Am I crazy?

278
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
That's from neurotic guests in the Midwest.

279
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
Of course you're not crazy.

280
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
Your friend is charging you tickets to enter their home.

281
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,840
Yeah, this is just across the board terrible.

282
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
This is a pot fuck is what it is.

283
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,960
You're getting screwed over.

284
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,880
It sucks.

285
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,440
It's terrible because it is literally taking the idea

286
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
of a potluck party, which I adore.

287
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,080
It is maybe my number one sign of adulthood.

288
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,920
It is my favorite thing.

289
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,800
It's like, ooh, I wonder what Garrett's going to bring.

290
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
Oh, last time he brought some kimchi.

291
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
It was very exotic and exciting.

292
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
I can't wait to see what he brings in this.

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,640
That is my favorite thing because it's not only

294
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,360
you get to eat a bunch of really great food most of the time.

295
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,960
It's that you get to cook and you get to prepare.

296
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,080
And it's such a way of showing that you care about people.

297
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,560
And I don't know, it's such a wonderful,

298
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,680
warm friendship feeling to have all this food

299
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
that everybody's prepared for each other.

300
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,000
And this is literally the goddamn diametric opposite of that.

301
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,320
Okay, all right, counterpoint.

302
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,040
One counterpoint is what if you're a picky eater

303
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,320
and your friends always make a bunch of just mayonnaise-y shit?

304
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
Just like they're mayonnaise boys through and through

305
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
and they put mayonnaise in everything.

306
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
And like different variations of salads.

307
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,800
Like what if you just hate the things they make

308
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
and you're like, you know what?

309
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm hosting this at my house.

310
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm gonna, I'm gonna not have,

311
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm not gonna eat some mayonnaise today.

312
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,560
Not today.

313
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,080
No mayonnaise soup for me today.

314
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,760
No mayo, no mayo.

315
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,120
Joshua, that will be $15.

316
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
And I will take that mayonnaise soup you brought

317
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
because I guess you didn't read the email close enough

318
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
and I'm gonna dump it right down the sink.

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
Oh, you don't have $15?

320
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,280
You can go home.

321
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,760
You can go right now.

322
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,320
They also may have just not wanted to like coordinate.

323
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
Like kimchi's great, but then there's that one party

324
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
where everybody brought kimchi.

325
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,760
It's like, do we have enough?

326
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Is there other kinds of kimchi that people should bring?

327
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,320
Or, or.

328
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,640
But Justin, I would say that the social contract then

329
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,360
is like if you are just inviting people over

330
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
to eat dinner at your house,

331
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,760
you're volunteering to cook dinner for everyone.

332
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,440
Like, I don't think you get to say like,

333
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
hey, I wanna have everyone over and cook for you guys

334
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,360
and also charge you for it.

335
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
Like, no, hold on.

336
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,880
Either you invite everyone to bring a dish

337
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,640
or you're cooking for everybody.

338
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,240
Like you don't get to charge people admission to your house.

339
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,680
What if the thing they wanna get

340
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,320
is really bodacious and expensive?

341
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,080
Like ancient grain fed chicken nuggets.

342
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Now I would say that if that's the thing,

343
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,680
if you're like, hey, we wanna host a luau.

344
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,520
Do you guys wanna like go in on a pig?

345
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
A suckling pig and also where do you buy those

346
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,400
and how do you cook them?

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,920
Then that's a thing.

348
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,960
That's a deal.

349
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,240
If it's like Thanksgiving

350
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,920
and you're all going in on the turkey,

351
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
yeah, that makes sense.

352
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
But just the idea of like,

353
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,520
we're all gonna have everyone over

354
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,800
and we made a pasta dish,

355
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
that'll be 15 goddamn American dollars, please.

356
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,960
Well, then the other problem with that

357
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,120
is you've just entered like a value equation

358
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
into the food that you made.

359
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Oh, it should be like you get to pay

360
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
how much you think the dinner was worth.

361
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,760
Or $7.

362
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,960
That's great, Daniel.

363
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,320
Thank you so much.

364
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
Here's an idea.

365
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,840
Instead of $15 for this pasta dish

366
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,000
that you've cooked up for them at your house,

367
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
you can have them pay $99

368
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
and then for the next six weeks,

369
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,520
they can come to your house

370
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
and have as much pasta and soda

371
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,160
for themselves and a friend as they want.

372
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,200
That sounds like a terrific deal.

373
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Because if you're gonna open a goddamn Olive Garden,

374
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,600
then fucking do it right.

375
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,280
No, you're not crazy.

376
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,040
That was not a cool thing for them to do.

377
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,280
If they wanna volunteer to cook everything,

378
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,000
that's the deal.

379
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,120
Like I've had lots of friends

380
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,080
where it's like we all took turns hosting dinner parties,

381
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
as opposed to a potluck,

382
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,680
like we're gonna do a full on dinner party

383
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,120
and invite our friends over.

384
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,600
Cool.

385
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
That's a totally adult awesome thing to do.

386
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
But the adult awesome part of that is saying,

387
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
I've got to a point where I can provide for my friends.

388
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,600
Like not like I've got to a point

389
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
where I can charge you for friendship.

390
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,560
Who are these goddamn monsters

391
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,120
who have not only ruined the very idea

392
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,960
of a potluck forever for everybody,

393
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,720
but also want to spend their entire evening

394
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
fucking managing their accounts?

395
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
Who are collecting money from friends for anything

396
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,800
is the worst.

397
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
So you only do it for big, big, big shit,

398
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,880
like group vacations and shit,

399
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
not for fucking fettuccine Alfredo.

400
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah, that's a horrible thing.

401
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
I could see the worst.

402
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,400
I could see where maybe they had a really misguided thought

403
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
of like, we're gonna save everyone the trouble

404
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,720
of coming up with something to cook and cooking it.

405
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,560
And we'll take it off their hands

406
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,680
and cut out the middleman,

407
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,720
except that like that ruins the fun.

408
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,440
That's like saying,

409
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm gonna have a birthday party,

410
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,680
but we're not gonna have cake

411
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,200
because I don't want you all to be so exhausted

412
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
after eating all that cake.

413
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
Like, oh, you've missed the point.

414
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm livid now.

415
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
I haven't been to a dinner party I think ever.

416
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,200
What?

417
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,440
What?

418
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,560
I don't think I have.

419
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,240
I can't believe that's true.

420
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
You're an American adult.

421
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Huntington's not really built for that kind of thing.

422
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
You need to throw one too sweet, sir.

423
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,000
Who?

424
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,480
Who?

425
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,280
With who?

426
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,680
I don't know.

427
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
You know people.

428
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,480
Do you not have friends, Justin?

429
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,160
Hey, time out from the podcast real quick.

430
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,800
Hey, a quick T.O. for a fucking

431
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,320
St. Elmo's fire intervention

432
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,760
with our oldest brother.

433
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,320
What's going on?

434
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,200
I have a baby.

435
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,720
That's my best friend.

436
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,280
No, well.

437
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,840
Like, that's all I have anymore.

438
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,800
I just have a baby.

439
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't have friends.

440
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,720
What are you talking about?

441
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,480
What happens at a dinner party?

442
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,120
What am I-

443
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Hey, hey guys, quick question.

444
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,840
What am love?

445
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,800
What am love?

446
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,840
Do you guys want to know why you're out here?

447
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,400
Why?

448
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,800
Yes.

449
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,280
Wow.

450
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,320
Really burning through them.

451
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,960
All right.

452
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,320
This Yahoo was sent in by Nathaniel Claxton.

453
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,160
That's a fucking super sick name.

454
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,800
Thank you, Nathaniel.

455
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,200
That's awesome.

456
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Diamond, who asks,

457
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,560
I think I am in love with my guardian angel.

458
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:48,800
Oh.

459
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
Interpret it any way you'd like.

460
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,720
I will.

461
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,200
Thank you.

462
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,920
I don't need your permission.

463
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,440
Thank you for giving me that option.

464
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
But I've always believed that every person

465
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
has a guardian angel.

466
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,880
If you would like to disagree,

467
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,280
that's fine too, but these are just my opinions.

468
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
I'll mention a few things about my angel.

469
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,800
His name is Eric.

470
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, hold on.

471
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,320
Hold on, Diamond.

472
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,520
I don't want to poke holes too early in your argument.

473
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,040
This is my angel, Eric Estrada.

474
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,240
He often appears to me with messy brown hair,

475
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
deep brown eyes, very tall, and a toned body.

476
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,240
Oh, Eric.

477
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
He says he's just my neighbor, but I know the truth.

478
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,400
Of course he looks good.

479
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
He's an angel.

480
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,800
Have you seen Michael?

481
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,560
Because that movie starred John Travolta.

482
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,000
He has saved me from danger numerous times.

483
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,760
I can't tell which of this is you

484
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
and which of this is the person.

485
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
Did the person mention Michael?

486
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,760
No, I did.

487
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
He has saved me from danger numerous times.

488
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
Again, this is still me talking about John Travolta.

489
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,520
He has saved me.

490
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,880
Eric has saved this question asker from danger numerous times.

491
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,800
And I can be a very clumsy person.

492
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
I was in an accident just over four years ago.

493
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
I apparently passed out for 20 minutes

494
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
and I came out without a scratch or any kind of pain.

495
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,960
My truck rolled over six times and it was completely totaled.

496
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
I came out without a scratch.

497
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,240
Another incident happened when I was with a friend of mine.

498
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,360
He was driving us on the highway

499
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,320
and we were in the far left lane.

500
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
A transporter truck almost collided into us

501
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,320
but swerved into the other side of the road.

502
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
There would have been a split second left until he hit us.

503
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
I almost died as an infant when my mother was giving birth to me.

504
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,560
I was also almost involved in a plane crash in 2010

505
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,160
right before my car accident.

506
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,920
He tells me that he's always there for me when I'm alone

507
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,040
and I feel a strong protective and loving force whenever he's near.

508
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Oh no.

509
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,240
I always feel arms wrapped around me when I sleep.

510
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,600
Sometimes we even travel together in my dreams.

511
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,320
He takes me to different countries that I've never been to

512
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
because I have always wanted to travel the world.

513
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,120
Oh no.

514
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,920
I was planning on writing a book about him

515
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
so that everyone can know how wonderful he is.

516
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,240
There is a part of me though that can't help but love him

517
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,360
on a romantic level.

518
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,560
I want to know what your thoughts on this are.

519
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,440
Eric always says to keep that part to myself.

520
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
He's watching out for me always.

521
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,280
I want to know what your opinions on angels are

522
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
even if you do not believe in them.

523
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,080
Thank you, Diamond.

524
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
Is the argument with guardian angels

525
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,600
that when something bad does happen,

526
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
it's like, well, it could have been way worse.

527
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,280
They should have gotten there a little earlier, you mean?

528
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, it's just like, I stubbed my toe

529
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,240
and it's like, thanks, guardian angel.

530
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
And the guardian angel's like, if I hadn't been here,

531
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
the chair would have fallen over and broken your neck.

532
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,600
And it's like, what?

533
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
That's a lazy guardian angeling.

534
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,560
You're suggesting that every injury anybody has ever suffered

535
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,200
is a lessened version.

536
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,200
That just doesn't make any sense.

537
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,920
Well, otherwise, it's the guardian angel going,

538
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,560
oh, sorry, I was looking over there.

539
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,840
I didn't see the chair.

540
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
That one's on me, you guys.

541
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,200
I was watching angels in the outfield again

542
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,760
and I, okay, so the car thing, right.

543
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,400
If the angel was there and he was like the only one

544
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
that helped protect you in a car wreck,

545
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,040
why couldn't the angel have come like a minute earlier

546
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,800
and just been like, hey, slow down?

547
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, hey, look out.

548
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,680
Slow down and look out.

549
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,720
Because he talks to you other times, apparently.

550
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
Why was he so mum and things like that?

551
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
Why wasn't he like, you should merge?

552
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Well, okay.

553
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
And when you're a baby, like, can I just say something?

554
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
There are many things about this question

555
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,160
that I find upsetting.

556
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,840
Number one among them is that an angel was there

557
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,040
in the delivery room when your mom was giving birth to you

558
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,720
and he was like, hey, mama, this one's for me.

559
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
Dibs, dibs.

560
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
And sometimes he spoons you.

561
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
Hey, everybody, Michael.

562
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,080
Nicholas Cage from City of Angels, listen up.

563
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,040
Dibs.

564
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,160
Dibs wasn't mine.

565
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm gonna spoon him.

566
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm gonna play a long game with this one.

567
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,920
I don't want no strings to tie me down, you know what I mean?

568
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,360
I'm not a one woman angel.

569
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
Christopher Lloyd, not from angels in the outfield,

570
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,160
just the real Christopher Lloyd.

571
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,840
Just in general, back off.

572
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,280
Keep your hands, this one's mine.

573
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,080
It's mine.

574
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,960
Listen, we're ignoring the obvious truth

575
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,720
and that is if you go to Ponderosa Steakhouse

576
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,000
and you go there every day for every day of your life,

577
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,320
you're not gonna get the same service every time

578
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,000
because there's gonna be some variability

579
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,280
in the skill of the Ponderosa waiters.

580
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,160
They're waiting on you.

581
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,720
I don't know why I picked this very specific example,

582
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,560
but I got some.

583
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,400
Especially since I'm not sure Ponderosa has waiters,

584
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,040
but go on.

585
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,240
I got the rosa on the brain.

586
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,640
We are ignoring the fact.

587
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,920
Not every person.

588
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,880
If every person in the world had the same job,

589
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,400
there would be a very large range of skill.

590
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,960
There would be a variety of talent at that job.

591
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,680
What I'm saying is that some angels are probably shitty.

592
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,800
So you're saying we're looking like a goof has gotten Eric

593
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,560
and Derek situation and it's like,

594
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,840
Eric is a good guardian angel and save you from a car crash.

595
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,280
Derek is a bad guardian angel unless you get kidnapped.

596
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,360
Eric, I think maybe sleeps in maybe

597
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,080
and he misses some stuff from time to time.

598
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
But he does, I would say an average job,

599
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,240
but God damn is he toned.

600
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,920
Holy shit.

601
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,360
When he lacks in dependability,

602
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,000
he more than makes up in fuckability.

603
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm just gonna assume that this woman

604
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,680
never watched City of Angels with Nicolas Cage

605
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,040
because that put me off of angel romance pretty much Kaiser permanently.

606
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
It's basically the worst ending to any movie ever.

607
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,560
I don't know if you watched that.

608
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,120
I'm assuming you probably would watch this film.

609
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,520
There aren't a lot of cinematic bomb bonds

610
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,360
that came to your particular tastes.

611
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
It's pretty much just Michael and City of Angels.

612
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,200
But can you imagine if she just found out about it?

613
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
Like, wait, what?

614
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,920
Say that again.

615
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,560
Gotta go.

616
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,800
And then there's just like a Deborah-shaped hole in the wall.

617
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,320
If you watch the end of that movie, you're like-

618
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,280
Diamond, please.

619
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,000
Diamond, yes.

620
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,240
Well, that's confusing.

621
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,040
That's what I need.

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,760
I can't imagine.

623
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
Can we all agree, though,

624
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,760
that we would read this woman's book so hard?

625
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,880
Oh my God, yes.

626
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,120
Yeah.

627
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,080
The accentuation.

628
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,640
So hard.

629
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,680
If she changes the angels.

630
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,600
We'd read passages out loud,

631
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
but don't say that too loud

632
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,080
because Terry Gross will hear and she'll come for your flavor.

633
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,040
Oh, you're reading passages from an angel book.

634
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
That sounds great.

635
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,080
Tonight on Fresh Air, angel books.

636
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,880
Let's blow it out.

637
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,040
Let's do this.

638
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,400
This week on Fresh Air,

639
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,840
angels in the sky with diamond

640
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,800
or something like that.

641
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,640
Griffin hasn't thought of the title of the thing yet,

642
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
but I've been Terry Gross.

643
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,040
And I just, I don't know what the fuck-

644
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,600
This has been the shortest Fresh Air episode ever.

645
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
What if, like, as we're recording this,

646
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
she's doing an episode like,

647
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
people have been chomping our flavor.

648
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,160
What's up with that?

649
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,160
Let's talk about that right now.

650
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
Hold on, let me listen into the bug

651
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,840
that I've got planted in Griffin's room.

652
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Something about Wendy's precogs.

653
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,960
Is there something with that?

654
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,840
Can we do something?

655
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,360
My producer's shaking his head no.

656
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
No, but I'm going to go for it anyway.

657
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
That's Fresh Air.

658
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
That's how we do.

659
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,160
Can we say fuckability on the public?

660
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Nope, we can't say fuckability.

661
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,960
Lenny Kravitz marinara breast milk.

662
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
Let's take a break.

663
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,240
This comedy has been too rip-roaring.

664
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,200
Yeah, it's just too funny.

665
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
Is this too funny?

666
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,680
If I had one note,

667
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,600
I guess it would be that it's too funny.

668
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,480
Yeah.

669
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Justin, let me ask you a question.

670
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,120
Hit me, bud.

671
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
Say I want to become a new dude.

672
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Maybe I've been a fan for a long time

673
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,120
and the past couple of Max Fun drives have passed me by

674
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,480
and I haven't had a job or maybe times have been tight.

675
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,560
Maybe I just feel a little stingy that day,

676
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,200
but this year, this year I'm ready.

677
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,400
Yeah.

678
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,240
But I got one question for you.

679
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
What is the one question that you have?

680
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,120
And it better be one.

681
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,880
No, don't do add-ons.

682
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,840
What's in it for me?

683
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,080
What's in it for big daddy?

684
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Well, big daddy.

685
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,200
I can't with that.

686
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,680
Well, big daddy donor.

687
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
Good news, big daddy.

688
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,200

I'm assuming you do, you're here.

700
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,680
You're going to get a live show that we recorded in San Francisco in February.

701
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,560
Awesome.

702
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,920
You're going to get a-

703
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,360
Go ahead and tell people what it is.

704
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,120
Yeah, just come on out and say it.

705
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:57,840
You're going to get the only extant non-Deep Web episode of Big Gulp

706
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,360
recorded live at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery,

707
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,120
which is apropos, because let's pray to God that it stays buried.

708
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,280
And the one and only episode of Big Gulp, you're going to get that.

709
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,720
You're also going to get the-

710
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Our friend Lin Manuel Miranda did a version-

711
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,120
He wrote the lyrics to Ghost Horse that we sang.

712
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,040
Well, it's actually a parody of a song from Guys and Girls,

713
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,520
but he wrote the song called Ghost Horse,

714
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,320
and he sent us, when he first pitched it to us, a demo MP3 of that song

715
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,160
with him singing all three parts.

716
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,720
So that is actually in there for donors.

717
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
He said it was cool if we include it.

718
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,720
So he's got a hot new show called Hamilton that Paul McCartney went to

719
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,280
and Bill Clinton went to, but before that,

720
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,560
he wrote the lyrics to a song called Ghost Horse for us to sing.

721
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,240
So you can hear his original demo.

722
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
That's just the My Brother, My Brother, and Me stuff.

723
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,280
That's just the My Brother, My Brother, and Me stuff.

724
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,800
There's a- If you like The Adventure Zone,

725
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,080
there's a prequel episode before the storyline that you can hear.

726
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm actually super high on prequel right now.

727
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,800
That's just $5 a month.

728
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,080
If you pledge $5 a month, you're going to get a boatload of stuff.

729
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,120
That's just our stuff.

730
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,880
There's more stuff from Sawbones and Bunker Buddies and so much more.

731
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,960
There's a ton of crap in there for $5 a month.

732
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,320
$10 a month, you're going to get a Drive exclusive tote bag.

733
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,360
How are you going to carry around all your bonus episodes?

734
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,720
Probably on an iPod or some kind of mechanical device, right?

735
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,520
I mean, that's funny.

736
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,040
But it's bits and bytes.

737
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,640
Yeah, it's all bits and bytes.

738
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
You can jam those into a bag, carry them around for it.

739
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,400
My tote bag is too full of bits and bytes.

740
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,520
It's hurting my shoulder.

741
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,120
For $20 a month, you're going to get an in-flight power pack.

742
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,760
This is awesome.

743
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,040
A mobile device charger, collapsible water bottle,

744
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,200
antibacterial wipes, and Pilotwings all or most.

745
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,240
Wait, what?

746
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,960
No, hold on.

747
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,760
Do you mean the plastic awesome Pilotwings or the classic...

748
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,800
I don't mean a copy of Pilotwings.

749
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,280
I mean, you're going to get plastic Max Fun branded Pilotwings.

750
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,000
Are you sure?

751
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,720
You can pin on your shirt.

752
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,960
Are we 100% sure?

753
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,040
Because I would love to, as an adult now,

754
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,440
I really think that I could be better at landing that goddamn hang glider.

755
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,080
Yes, I'm positive it's not a copy of the game Pilotwings,

756
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,360
but it's still excellent.

757
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,480
$35 a month, you get a pair of rocket engraved shot glasses.

758
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,560
Do you get all the previous levels?

759
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,600
That is correct, kid.

760
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,320
All stacks.

761
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,760
All stacks.

762
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,080
Wow.

763
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,280
Wow.

764
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,640
Yeah, so at 35, you're getting the rocket engraved shot glasses,

765
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
the in-flight power pack, the drive exclusive tote bag,

766
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
and the exclusive bonus content.

767
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
Like, that's an amazing deal.

768
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,920
And just think about it.

769
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Like, for $5 and $10, that's like one or two beers out of the bar a month.

770
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,760
Just like skip one or two beers, and that's going to cover it.

771
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,280
$20, that's like one meal out a month.

772
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,840
You know what I mean?

773
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,880
Like, $35, that's one meal out with someone else a month.

774
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,520
Like, the-

775
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,000
$18,000, that is one novelty fish tank,

776
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
large enough to store a small shark.

777
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:08,880
Exactly.

778
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,840
By a month.

779
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,600
One of those a month, you are hardly even going to miss that money.

780
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,120
$18,000, $18,000.

781
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,920
We don't charge.

782
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,760
We don't charge for the show.

783
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,480
We keep it free.

784
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,920
But if you feel like you've gotten something out of it,

785
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,840
and you'd like to support us and make more,

786
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,000
gosh, that would just mean the world to us.

787
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,280
If you would go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate,

788
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,440
you'll feel good.

789
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,520
You'll feel good when you listen.

790
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,080
You'll think, hey, I'm helping make this happen.

791
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
And if it's something that you want to do,

792
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,480
and it feels like the time to do it, do it right now.

793
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,840
Do it while you listen to the episode.

794
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,760
If you're driving, pull over to the side of the road.

795
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,280
Well, don't tell people to do that.

796
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,280
If you're driving, wait until you-

797
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,160
I'll give you permission to wait until you get where you're going before you-

798
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,040
But don't wait too long, because this kind of stuff will fly out of your head.

799
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,760
Take care of it as soon as you're ready to do it.

800
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,680
And people are going to be like, I'm in really-

801
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,120
you're going to start to hear people talking about specifically Big Gulp,

802
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
and you do not want to miss out on that.

803
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,040
So go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate and get a ton of great stuff.

804
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,200
And if you do, tweet at us so we can thank you.

805
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,680
Yeah.

806
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
How about a question, Justin?

807
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,840
Yes, a question is something I'd love to provide you with, Griffin.

808
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,520
I get asked to take people's picture a lot, but I always feel awkward doing so.

809
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,280
I don't do selfies or deal with phone cameras or any cameras at all.

810
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,880
I get worried that their picture will suck,

811
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,400
and they might ask me to take another one.

812
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,600
Or just look at the picture silently.

813
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,900
Huh.

814
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,020
Interesting.

815
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,880
See what you did here, the framing.

816
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,800
I see what an unconventional take on capturing the human form.

817
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,640
When I say I'm bad at taking pictures, no one believes me.

818
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,920
I try to avoid these awkward moments, but it seems to be unavoidable.

819
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,920
I tried to toss responsibility to someone else around me, but it rarely works.

820
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,800
What do I do to avoid these awkward situations?

821
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,200
You should stop hanging around the Statue of Liberty.

822
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,120
Just like with your hands in your pocket, like,

823
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,800
well, I wonder if anybody needs a little assistance.

824
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,840
I'm happy to help.

825
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,120
How often does this kind of thing come up?

826
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,200
Okay, so can I say something?

827
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,600
Yeah.

828
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,400
And you're gonna think I'm lying, but Rachel can attest to this.

829
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Anytime we are out at a place that is even a little bit touristy,

830
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,360
I always get asked to take people's pictures.

831
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,480
Now, not a problem for me, because I'm fucking tight at it, basically.

832
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,640
But then this would be my question, Griffin.

833
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,600
Should this person try to avoid these situations

834
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,480
or just get better at taking pictures?

835
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,320
It's literally a one-step process of getting better at taking pictures,

836
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,160
because cameras do fucking everything now.

837
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,880
They automatically do everything that you need them to do.

838
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,160
You just have to put the human beings that you are capturing in the box

839
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,360
so that they occupy two-thirds of the space of the box.

840
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,800
And now you're a master photographer.

841
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,920
Take the human beings, point the box at them,

842
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,600
get them in that box so that they occupy two-thirds of the box.

843
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
Sixty-six point six repeating percent of the space.

844
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,360
Now, I know you're wondering, which two-thirds of them should I do?

845
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,720
The part with the face on it, and then you want to get the head...

846
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,880
You want the extra third to be above them.

847
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,680
But what if they have good features they want to get?

848
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,200
What if they have a really juicy butt?

849
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
Well, then you gotta do a caricature.

850
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,040
Can you take a picture of me?

851
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,480
No, but what I can do is draw you a whimsical drawing

852
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
showing your giant bottom.

853
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,680
Do you want to be on a surfboard, maybe graduating?

854
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,200
I went to New Orleans with a group of my friends,

855
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,960
and we had somebody take a picture of all of us at a bar,

856
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,480
and they took a picture of my camera,

857
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,120
and handed me the camera pretty tight, right?

858
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,520
And literally, we were the bottom half,

859
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,600
and then the sky was the top half.

860
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,960
Hey, fucking...

861
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,320
Mark from Ork!

862
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
I don't have antennae!

863
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
You're not looking at the sky saying,

864
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
man, I wish we had this at home.

865
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,600
You know that part.

866
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,720
You know what that looks like.

867
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,040
Here's what you do to diffuse it next time somebody asks you

868
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
to take their picture, say,

869
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,040
I can't do that for you, but I would love to paint you.

870
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,720
I have a studio nearby.

871
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
Okay, Joseph, let me pitch this.

872
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,640
Ask me to take your picture.

873
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
Should I ask you to take my picture?

874
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,400
No, and then just walk away.

875
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,440
And then just escape into the world,

876
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
or just say, I wish I could, but I'm unstuck in time,

877
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,360
and then walk away.

878
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
Sorry, hologram.

879
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
I guess that'll work for a lot of shit, huh?

880
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,720
Sorry, guardian angel.

881
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,200
You could see me?

882
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,240
I bet the two thirds thing is the part that's messing him up.

883
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,640
He just keeps getting closer and closer

884
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,120
till he's basically pressing the lens against their face.

885
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
Like, is this right?

886
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,880
Am I, am I photographing?

887
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,000
Is this photo?

888
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,320
You could also say, I'm afraid that you might be a ghost,

889
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
and I would kill you if I took your picture.

890
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,920
Ooh, that's how it works?

891
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
That is how it happens.

892
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,960
Oh, just say something like,

893
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
oh, I've fallen for this before, and walk away.

894
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,400
It's just him going like, oh, he's probably got a good reason.

895
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,040
There are so many dumb things you could do,

896
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,240
as we've established,

897
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,280
or you could make it so their human frames

898
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,920
occupy 66% of the box on the camera,

899
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,440
and then press the button that activates the camera.

900
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,120
It's the easiest.

901
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,200
It's so, it's the easiest thing.

902
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,080
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

903
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,280
Please.

904
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,200
This Yahoo was actually sent in by a ton of people

905
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,360
over the course of the past couple weeks,

906
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,520
and I thought that we should talk about it now.

907
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,640
Thank you to everybody who sent it in.

908
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Max, who asks,

909
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,160
can you describe your face expression

910
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
while eating and drinking?

911
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,240
I am doing a research now.

912
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,280
Oh, is that it?

913
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,760
That was it?

914
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,400
One more time, please.

915
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
One more time, from the top.

916
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Can you describe your face expression

917
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,800
while eating and drinking?

918
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,120
I am doing a research now?

919
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,560
And there's a question mark.

920
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,280
I don't know if they're maybe kibitzing

921
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,720
on when they'll do the research,

922
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,440
if this could be considered research,

923
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
if they're the people doing the research.

924
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,840
Or if they're participating in the research.

925
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,200
There's a lot of variables.

926
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,760
Think about it, though, because when you eat,

927
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,560
everybody, think about your face when you eat,

928
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,520
because I think about it,

929
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,160
and I think that I make like a yummy face,

930
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,160
and I, it's a smile, because I'm happy to be eating.

931
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,320
But I don't know for sure, because I never-

932
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,760
I know that mine, because I've practiced

933
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
in front of a mirror and been told a couple of times,

934
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,600
brow furrowed, very focused, almost angry,

935
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,160
defensive, very focused, like in the middle distance,

936
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,120
stare, just trying to get it over with

937
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,320
as quickly as possible.

938
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
Do you hate eating food, Travis?

939
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,120
No, I love it so much that I'm afraid I'll be interrupted.

940
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,840
That's my biggest concern, is that someone

941
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,240
may try to talk to me or engage me

942
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,120
in some kind of interaction while I'm putting

943
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,040
the best stuff in my mouth.

944
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
If I'm eating a really good burger,

945
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
I wish everyone else was dead too.

946
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,560
I wish everyone else was dead for that minute.

947
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,240
A minute, that minute, Travis.

948
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,720
For that minute, I'm not asking for the world.

949
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,320
You are asking for the whole-

950
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,560
Consume my burger quickly, you just leave me alone

951
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,840
for the brief amount of time.

952
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,800
Don't sit there and say like,

953
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,640
oh, you look like someone's about to take your food away.

954
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,880
Yes, yes, I'm afraid of that.

955
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,240
Please just let me enjoy this.

956
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,400
Has anyone ever, has anyone,

957
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm gonna fucking diagnose you right now, Travis.

958
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,440
Because I feel like your relationship with food

959
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,000
has been a running goof on this show.

960
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,600
And I wanna get to the bottom of it.

961
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,560
Has anybody actually ever, while you were sucking down

962
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,760
some baby back ribs, ever walked up to you,

963
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,440
obtained the ribs, and removed them from your grasp?

964
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,120
No, I tell you, the real thing, Griffin,

965
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,480
the real truth is that I am very verbose.

966
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,640
I like to talk a lot, especially when I'm having

967
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,920
a meal with friends.

968
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,640
And what I end up doing is talking so much

969
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,280
that I fail to actually consume my food.

970
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,640
So I've gotten really good-

971
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,080
That's patently untrue.

972
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,960
I've never seen, I've eaten hundreds of meals with you

973
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,000
and I've never seen that happen.

974
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Well, not with you guys.

975
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,800
Oh, okay.

976
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm saying with like people I like

977
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,680
and don't talk to all the time.

978
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,200
Sure, right.

979
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,160
I'm saying you, as soon as food is presented to you,

980
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,040
you unhinge your jaw and place your head over the plate

981
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,960
like some sort of fucking moray eel.

982
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,000
But like, when you put gas in your car,

983
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
you're never thinking like, I wish I could savor this more.

984
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,000
You're trying to get the gas in your car quickly

985
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,280
so you can go on about your day.

986
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,360
I thought you loved eating so much.

987
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,640
I do, I want it to go quickly and beautifully

988
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,080
and wonderfully and done.

989
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,800
You're like an Olympic ice skater, right?

990
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,120
Yes.

991
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,760
You want it to be perfect.

992
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,360
In so many ways.

993
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,960
You're like, you want it to be perfect,

994
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,400
but you also need it to like,

995
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,480
you don't want to draw it out any longer than you have to

996
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,840
because your legs are going to give out.

997
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,680
Exactly, you've nailed it.

998
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,960
It's like the most beautiful symphony would really like

999
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,680
lose its luster on like the 16th hour, wouldn't it?

1000
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,760
But I think everybody has though,

1001
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,640
like gotten their food taken away at a restaurant

1002
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,440
when you weren't done.

1003
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,640
Maybe you go to the B room and you come back and you're like,

1004
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,080
oh, and there's nothing in that moment more delicious on earth

1005
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,120
than those like seven chips and half a pickle

1006
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,520
and like one bite of the calzone.

1007
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,240
Have you ever had the moment where they come for your food

1008
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
and then you're like, oh wait, I'm not done.

1009
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,400
And you speak before you think and realize

1010
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,200
that the only thing on the plate are like three chips

1011
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,640
and a half a pickle.

1012
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,800
And they're like trying to take you like, I don't know what.

1013
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,680
And then they kind of look at you and you're like, no, it's fine.

1014
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,280
What's worse that or just like, hold on one second.

1015
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,600
Yeah, we're done now.

1016
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,800
What if they could put that,

1017
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,560
they could fucking time lock that and put it on the menu.

1018
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,280
Like for $35, we will give you the last seven chips

1019
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,840
and a pickle that we took from somebody

1020
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,120
that they didn't get to eat.

1021
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
And it will be so much more delicious.

1022
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,680
But you secretly order it from someone else at the table.

1023
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,160
So they like look away for a second

1024
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,200
and then they look back at you and you're eating six chips

1025
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,320
and there's nothing in front of them.

1026
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,760
And they're like, oh, Jeremy, no.

1027
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
Jeremy, tell me you didn't do this to me.

1028
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,240
You did this to me again.

1029
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,640
Why do we keep coming here?

1030
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,360
That's my ketchup mess I made on the plate.

1031
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,920
Jeremy, no.

1032
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Can we, I'm into this idea now.

1033
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,360
I'm getting super deep into this idea of like,

1034
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,320
going to fucking the most notoriously slow TGI Fridays in town.

1035
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,480
They take a while to get your food out to you.

1036
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,680
Going there, ordering a big plate of baby back ribs,

1037
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,640
some fries and a dish, a side dish.

1038
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,680
I don't know what they have there.

1039
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,520
Never been.

1040
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,600
And waiting for 40 minutes for my food to get there

1041
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,080
and then they bring it to the table, put it down.

1042
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,920
I stand up, put $40 on the table,

1043
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,520
walk out and leave and drive home and I guess jerk off

1044
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,480
because it would be the most incredible tantric experience

1045
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,440
of my entire life.

1046
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,920
You're laughing, Travis, because you could never do that.

1047
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,920
I will give you $10,000 if you can ever go to TGI Fridays,

1048
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,200
order a plate of delicious, sweaty baby back ribs

1049
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,120
and then stand up as soon as they get there and walk out.

1050
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,480
Griffin, you are so correct because sometimes

1051
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,160
just the very thought of maybe I might go out to eat later

1052
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,520
makes me so happy in a way that most normal people

1053
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,720
will never experience.

1054
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,080
The idea of having someone bring food to me

1055
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,520
that I did nothing to earn is very exciting.

1056
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,000
Is it kind of wonderful being like a food goblin?

1057
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,880
It is.

1058
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,080
It's so freeing.

1059
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
If you can let go of all the mores

1060
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,920
and everything holding you back about what you think

1061
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
is appropriate about how to eat,

1062
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,360
your life becomes so much better.

1063
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,800
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,

1064
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
but I guess there is some satisfaction

1065
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,360
to be derived from it.

1066
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,680
I just feel like you're a prisoner of your own creation.

1067
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,800
No, I'm free.

1068
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,720
You're the one trapped in a food prison.

1069
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,840
Look in your own life.

1070
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,320
Don't just sit there and judge my way of life.

1071
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,120
Walk a mile in my food filled shoes.

1072
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,880
Why is there food in there?

1073
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,360
I eat so quickly it falls down.

1074
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,120
Sometimes I eat so quickly it falls down into my shoes.

1075
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,760
Why are there Twizzlers in your Pumas, heavyweights?

1076
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,680
If someone told you you had to make shoes out of food,

1077
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,960
what food would it be, girl?

1078
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,840
God damn it.

1079
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,360
I would say probably ciabatta.

1080
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,280
A firm bread or a jerky.

1081
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,160
Some kind of firm bread with jerky laces.

1082
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,560
I get one of those big bolognese

1083
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,680
that they haven't cut up yet.

1084
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,360
I see in meat stores, but you never buy them

1085
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,480
because like what am I going to do with that?

1086
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,560
But Justin, what about the coyotes?

1087
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm a bartender slash server

1088
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,080
and I work with a lot of awesome people.

1089
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,400
If I happen to bring friends or family

1090
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,000
and eat my bar when I'm not working,

1091
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,760
I of course want to generously tip my friends

1092
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,600
slash coworker that waited on us,

1093
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,360
but it always feels awkward.

1094
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,600
Similarly, if I have a drink after my shift

1095
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,280
and want to tip the bartender,

1096
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,160
he or she is uncomfortable about me tipping them as well.

1097
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,760
I've even fallen in the trap of being weird

1098
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,960
about my friends tipping me.

1099
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,280
How do I navigate this situation?

1100
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,120
Do I only tip them a customary 20%?

1101
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,720
Am I required to tip them more because we're friends?

1102
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,760
What do I say when they say,

1103
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,040
oh, you don't have to tip me.

1104
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,720
Help, that's from tiptoeing in Ann Arbor.

1105
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,600
God, if only the Japanese style.

1106
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,600
This is probably why Japan was like,

1107
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,040
let's flip it.

1108
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,760
Why don't we flip that switch?

1109
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,560
Because we work together and this is crazy.

1110
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,320
Flip the switch, guys.

1111
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,040
No more tips.

1112
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,880
This is one of the rare times when I'm forced to,

1113
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,160
I have no idea.

1114
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,400
Yeah, I don't even know where to start.

1115
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
Wait, you're saying that literally everything

1116
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,640
we've ever advised people on-

1117
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,600
You had some ideas.

1118
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,960
You had a lot of ideas.

1119
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,880
I at least, in those scenarios,

1120
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,440
had some kind of gut reaction that I followed

1121
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,600
and I was like, yeah, this is what I would do.

1122
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,360
I listened to you read the question

1123
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,400
and in my brain was going,

1124
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,080
because just the idea of handing someone,

1125
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,040
because my immediate reaction is just this idea of,

1126
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,040
well, you know what goes into it.

1127
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,200
You know what the process is.

1128
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,120
You know what deserves a tip, what doesn't.

1129
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,280
You know what they're actually doing

1130
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,480
that would earn them money.

1131
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,200
And so you should be the best judge of it.

1132
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,000
So then if you're left going, I still don't know.

1133
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,920
Well, then where, I don't know.

1134
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,960
Yes, if they say not to tip them, don't tip them.

1135
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,800
Yes.

1136
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,120
What if when you start a job at a new restaurant,

1137
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,880
you have to give every other person

1138
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,200
working in that restaurant $10.

1139
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,680
It'll be a pretty big lump sum right up front.

1140
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,440
And then when you wait on each other,

1141
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
you just hand that $10 back and forth.

1142
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,720
And it's like a friendship 10 spot.

1143
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,400
And you just pass that back and forth.

1144
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,080
And then when you quit the job,

1145
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,280
because you tooted in the kitchen,

1146
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,400
I've never worked in a restaurant in my life.

1147
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,920
You can never return.

1148
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,840
I don't know how anything works in my office.

1149
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,000
Then you cash out.

1150
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,040
No, that doesn't make sense.

1151
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,120
I was close to something though, wasn't I?

1152
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,920
I was really close to something.

1153
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,360
You were teetering on the edge.

1154
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,480
When I was a young man back in high school,

1155
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,880
I worked at the Blockbuster Video, rest in peace.

1156
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,880
I thought that what everybody should do,

1157
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,200
I thought people would come in

1158
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,520
and I would get rid of their late fees or something.

1159
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
And I thought, what we should do

1160
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,360
is just have a system of hookups.

1161
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,960
It's like, you come to Blockbuster and I'll hook you up.

1162
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,800
And then when I come to TGI Fridays,

1163
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,960
you hook me up, maybe some free mod sticks

1164
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
or I don't have to tip you.

1165
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,120
And I thought that I basically invented bartering

1166
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,360
is what I had done, but I hadn't really realized that.

1167
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,200
I thought this was a great system.

1168
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,800
And somehow my stupid teenager brain,

1169
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,720
the system had been put into place.

1170
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,920
So I just started giving everybody who I knew the hookup

1171
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,320
and just kind of assuming it would karmically come back

1172
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,760
to me, pay it forward.

1173
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,280
That kind of thing would be revisited

1174
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,120
the next time I went to their place of business

1175
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,960
and never ever happened.

1176
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,920
And I got fired.

1177
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,840
Isn't that such an awkward moment

1178
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,360
when either someone comes to visit you

1179
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,600
at your place of work or you go to visit someone

1180
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,880
and it's unclear as if there's an expected,

1181
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,960
like if someone's like, oh yeah, come eat at my restaurant.

1182
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,560
And then you get there and you're like, wait, is this?

1183
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,640
Are they gonna hook, is this a deal?

1184
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,600
Are they inviting me here?

1185
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,760
And then I'm gonna get a discount, should I ask?

1186
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,240
I just wanna point out karmically speaking,

1187
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,200
God killed the Blockbuster Video.

1188
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,760
Wasn't God that killed the Blockbuster Video,

1189
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,480
it was man killed the Blockbuster Video.

1190
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,320
No, man couldn't kill Blockbuster Video.

1191
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,160
Their fucking business was perfect.

1192
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,360
God looked at that and saw pride and said,

1193
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,200
you hurt my baby boy, Justin,

1194
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,160
and just sort of destroyed the whole thing.

1195
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,720
Oh, I thought you were saying God saw the pride in Justin

1196
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,880
trying to rework the structure of humanity.

1197
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,160
No, he saw Justin fucking giving freely to his fellow man

1198
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,560
and Blockbuster Video saying, no, this will not do.

1199
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,760
You are fired.

1200
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,000
Or Uncle Sam heard that I had figured out the solution

1201
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,560
to like ending capitalism.

1202
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,720
And they're like, no, this is terrible.

1203
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,880
Everybody close down Blockbuster and fit Netflix.

1204
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,520
It's time to release Netflix.

1205
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,080
But sir, we agreed that would be 2021.

1206
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,040
Nah, this kid in West Virginia has cracked the code.

1207
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,240
And they were tripped out because then I went to Best Buy

1208
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,640
and I started selling people Netflix subscriptions.

1209
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,480
Like, wait a minute, he's onto us again.

1210
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,520
Justin, you should really go to Burning Man sometime.

1211
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,360
I think you'd really get a kick out of it.

1212
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,640
Yeah, you think?

1213
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,280
What do you make?

1214
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,840
Do you make something that you can barter with at Burning Man?

1215
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,880
Kelty Grammers?

1216
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,520
Yeah.

1217
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,280
Well, those probably wouldn't hold up so much

1218
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,360
in the 115 degree sun.

1219
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,640
Dick jokes?

1220
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,240
I don't think those are gonna satisfy.

1221
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,960
I wish I could go to Burning Man, but just bring money

1222
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,520
and just be the only person there that's allowed to use it.

1223
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,960
Because I think that would be,

1224
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,280
I think secretly people would really get a kick out of it

1225
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,360
because they can like leave Burning Man

1226
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,960
and be able to spend it on shit.

1227
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,880
And also like, I wouldn't have to worry

1228
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,160
about how bad my fish hook earrings are.

1229
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,680
Oh God, I just did the potluck thing, didn't I?

1230
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,800
I just did the $15 potluck thing.

1231
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,640
And I swear I would never become that type of man.

1232
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,040
Just like that, Griffin ruined Burning Man.

1233
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,480
One episode to kill Burning Man, to unseat Burning Man.

1234
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,480
Like 45 seconds of one episode.

1235
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,320
Five seconds of one episode to unseat Burning Man.

1236
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,800
Well, you know what?

1237
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,280
If it's that easy to kill, then it didn't deserve to live.

1238
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,600
What if Burning Man like went on long enough

1239
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,360
that at first I was like, well,

1240
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
I could just trade you these three hacky sacks

1241
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
for like one of those Afghans.

1242
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,080
And you're like, that's, I don't know why I need the Afghan

1243
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,680
at Burning Man, but okay, let's go for it.

1244
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,200
It gets cold in the desert at night.

1245
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,560
And then, and then like, it went on.

1246
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,280
You're like, you know what?

1247
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,880
These hacky sacks are really easy to carry around.

1248
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,840
Um, maybe I should just say like, we could use these

1249
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,400
to represent like, if I have five hacky sacks,

1250
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,520
then that means that like, it's worth one blanket.

1251
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,640
It's easier just to keep track of how many things

1252
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,080
that we've made or sold.

1253
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,280
And then, oh fuck, 48 hours later,

1254
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,560
the whole thing has collapsed.

1255
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,920
There's a McDonald's there.

1256
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,000
They've got the whole, there's, there's-

1257
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,760
I'd like a sausage biscuit.

1258
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,000
Okay, that's gotta be two and a half hacky sacks.

1259
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,040
I gotta cut another hacky sack open.

1260
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,680
What are you people even doing with these half hacky sacks?

1261
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,600
Minimum hacky sack wage isn't even enough

1262
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,760
to buy our own McDonald's hacky sack food.

1263
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,200
This is, this is bullshit.

1264
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,440
Can I go to Burning Man?

1265
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,560
As long as we're talking about Burning Man

1266
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,680
for some goddamn reason, can I go to Burning Man

1267
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,600
with like, a fucking Yu-Gi-Oh sticker,

1268
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,040
one Yu-Gi-Oh sticker, and challenge myself

1269
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,400
to trade up to a goddamn Toyota Tundra?

1270
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,320
Drive somebody else's Toyota Tundra

1271
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,840
away from Burning Man

1272
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,760
through a system of Yankee swaps.

1273
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,240
That should be like in the least amount of moves,

1274
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,920
like kind of like game show.

1275
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,720
I would watch that.

1276
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,040
It's like, I can get from Yu-Gi-Oh sticker

1277
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,520
to Toyota Tundra in five moves.

1278
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,120
Guys, I got big news for you.

1279
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,600
What's that?

1280
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:32,140
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom, grow some peas with Warren G, farm wisdom.

1281
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,140
With what?

1282
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,140
With Warren G?

1283
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,020
Grow some peas with Warren G, farm wisdom.

1284
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,020
That's what I thought, you said okay.

1285
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,660
Have you been to Warren G's farm?

1286
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,020
The G Ranch?

1287
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,860
The G Ranch?

1288
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,460
The Circle G?

1289
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,260
His potato harvest came in really well this year because I think he's really been...

1290
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:58,620
Regulating the fertilizer, fuck me.

1291
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,140
Farm wisdom, here it goes.

1292
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,460
If you add a new chicken to a brood of chickens, they'll turn on it as an outsider and peck

1293
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,020
it to injury or death.

1294
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:15,180
To avoid this, simply wait until all the chickens are asleep and put the new chicken in the

1295
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,380
coop alongside them.

1296
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,220
When they wake up, they'll assume that everyone around them are their friends and get on fine

1297
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,220
line.

1298
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,380
Even the new chicken is fooled by this.

1299
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,140
I was with this until that last part.

1300
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,780
The new chicken's like, yeah this seems right, nothing weird about this.

1301
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,540
There's like 18 of me here and I don't know what that means, but are we cool?

1302
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,540
We're cool.

1303
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,300
Hey Steve, Fred, Ginger, you, Andy, how long have you been here?

1304
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,060
I don't know, I feel like forever?

1305
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,060
Yeah that seems right.

1306
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,060
Let's be friends.

1307
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,380
I also feel like I've been here forever.

1308
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,380
That's weird.

1309
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,380
Yeah?

1310
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,380
That sounds about good.

1311
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,860
You guys aren't going to like peck me to death, are you?

1312
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,700
Like no, as far as we know, we've known you for years.

1313
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,700
I understand you guys are joking right now.

1314
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,260
What is the value of chickens having a sense of time?

1315
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,900
Like that seems like the last thing you want those poor bees to have, right?

1316
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,780
I've been sitting here for what feels like a very great amount, like a great, a great

1317
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,780
span.

1318
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Why can't they just sit and chill?

1319
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,780
Oh hello.

1320
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Oh hello.

1321
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,020
Have you been here the whole time?

1322
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,720
For me Justin, it's not a sense of time, it's just more I'm disturbed by the lack

1323
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,100
of memory.

1324
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:26,820
Just the idea of like, a chicken goes to sleep, it wakes up somewhere else and it's like yeah,

1325
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,820
yeah this is it.

1326
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,820
This is right.

1327
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,820
Yeah that sounds about right.

1328
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,820
I wish that human beings had this.

1329
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,660
I feel like it would help out with mine and a lot of other people's social anxieties if

1330
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,740
I went to sleep next to my beautiful wife and I woke up.

1331
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,740
Who's that sitting in the chair?

1332
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,740
What's up?

1333
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,740
I'm Mark.

1334
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,740
Hi Mark.

1335
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,640
I guess.

1336
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
Are we like buds?

1337
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,640
Like yeah, I guess so.

1338
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,640
I just woke up here too.

1339
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,640
All right, cool.

1340
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Do you want to go get-

1341
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,640
We've been friends forever?

1342
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,640
Is that what you're saying?

1343
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,640
Do you want some brunch?

1344
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,640
Is this a Saw movie?

1345
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Are we on Saw now?

1346
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,640
Is this Saw?

1347
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,640
No.

1348
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,640
That thought wouldn't even like enter my mind.

1349
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,780
I woke up next to Mark.

1350
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,500
He must be pretty tight.

1351
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,980
You must have gone to sleep next to Mark.

1352
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,140
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1353
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,740
They say farm chickens have no memory.

1354
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,180
I guess their lives are much like mine, you know?

1355
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,620
In the little classic castle.

1356
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,780
Is a surprise every time.

1357
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,460
Wait, no Andy DeFranco fans here?

1358
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,820
No Andy DeFranco fans?

1359
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,100
Just a couple Warren G. heads.

1360
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,300
Hey Justin, I have another question for you.

1361
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,300
Hit me.

1362
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:32,380
Say I've been a Max Fund donor before.

1363
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:39,260
Say in the past I've been maybe a five or a 10 or a $20 a month or $35 a month donor.

1364
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,500
And every year it just seems like the Max Fund content is getting better and better

1365
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
and better.

1366
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Maybe I've had a raise.

1367
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,300
Maybe it's just been a really good year for me.

1368
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,620
And I just wish I could give more.

1369
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,340
Is there a solution?

1370
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,340
Yeah there is.

1371
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,540
You just do it.

1372
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,540
You go up in there and you pledge that you're going to increase your gift.

1373
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:02,420
And if you increase your gift, let's say right now you're doing $5 a month and you're like,

1374
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,420
you know what?

1375
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,580
I'm going to get in there with $10 a month.

1376
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,020
You do that, you're going to get the gift associated with that higher level.

1377
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
Really?

1378
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,620
You're going to go in at 10, you're going to get your tote bag.

1379
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,200
You decide I'm going to up it to 20, you will get that in-flight power pack with the mobile

1380
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,580
device charger, collapsible water bottle, antibacterial wipes and pilot wings with Max

1381
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,260
Fund logos on them.

1382
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,580
Now say it's been a really good year.

1383
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,820
Like I just made partner at the firm.

1384
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,860
Are there higher level?

1385
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:35,540
If I really want to throw my money around like a big shot, are there higher levels?

1386
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,620
If you pledge $100 a month, you're going to get membership in the inner circle.

1387
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,740
That's a monthly culture club where Max Fund hosts pick something that they love and is

1388
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,220
really like something very special to them that they want to share with people and you

1389
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,860
get it in the mail like every month.

1390
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,140
You get it delivered to you because you're part of the inner circle.

1391
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,140
That's really cool.

1392
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,060
That's at $100 a month.

1393
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:06,180
For $200 a month, you get free registration to Max Fund Con 2016.

1394
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,180
Who's going to be there?

1395
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,180
It doesn't matter.

1396
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,300
You're going for free.

1397
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,300
And that's $200.

1398
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:16,020
You get the registration, the inner circle, the rocket engraved shot glasses, the in-flight

1399
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:20,980
power pack and the drive exclusive towback and all of the exclusive content.

1400
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,980
That's huge.

1401
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,420
So I think that's pretty huge.

1402
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:28,200
Also Justin, at $200 a month, Justin will come to your house and dance for you.

1403
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,280
Every day.

1404
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,600
Not every day.

1405
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,720
Just once.

1406
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,680
He'll pay for his own travel.

1407
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,060
He will get there and he will perform a dance, any style.

1408
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,320
It doesn't have to be seductive, but you'll probably want it to be.

1409
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,560
I can guarantee you he'll commit to it.

1410
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,740
This won't be like a half ass like, oh, let me do your dance.

1411
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,740
He's going to be up there.

1412
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:49,260
He's going to be moving and you're going to say, oh my God, I finally see what it means

1413
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,260
to dance.

1414
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,260
This is poetry.

1415
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
He's not going to be crying while he does the Macarena.

1416
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,260
No.

1417
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,260
Because that would ruin it.

1418
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,260
No.

1419
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,260
That would ruin the Macarena.

1420
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,260
I'm just reading this small print here and everything I just said was a lie.

1421
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,580
Justin will come dance for you.

1422
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,860
If you want to donate some cash, you can go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

1423
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,860
Maybe you started listening to some more shows.

1424
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,580
I know we added a ton of new shows.

1425
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:10,580
You know what we added this year?

1426
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,460
Let's say you're already a Brother My Brother fan, you know what we added this year?

1427
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,360
We added a show called Bunker Buddies that Travis does with his friend Andy.

1428
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,460
And we added a show called The Adventure Zone that we do with our dad.

1429
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:24,340
And we've continued to do amazing shows like Sawbones with Justin and Sidney.

1430
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
Thanks.

1431
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,720
But I'm saying like we've got new shows.

1432
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,900
There's maybe more things that you're listening to now.

1433
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,860
So maybe you want to kick in a few bucks to make that like, hey, I'll tell you what else.

1434
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,860
I'll tell you what else.

1435
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,860
What's that?

1436
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,700
You're gonna get more money than our dad doesn't get any of your money.

1437
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,700
That's true.

1438
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,420
We will leave him on the streets where we found him.

1439
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,980
Don't you want our daddy to have some money?

1440
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,780
And here's the thing that a lot of people miss about this.

1441
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,900
You are giving money to help maximumfund.org.

1442
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,220
You're supporting an amazing network of shows.

1443
00:58:54,220 --> 00:59:00,120
But when you make your donation, you say what shows you love on the network.

1444
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,000
You say the shows that you listen to.

1445
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,780
Your money is going to those shows.

1446
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:08,420
You're directly supporting the people that create these programs.

1447
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,100
You're not only supporting a great network.

1448
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,500
Part of your money goes to all the great work Max Fund does and looking for new hosts and

1449
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,780
making the shows and doing all the great Max Fund stuff.

1450
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,220
But you're literally supporting the shows that you love so much.

1451
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,660
And it seriously means the world to us.

1452
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:29,880
And also, Adventure Zone would not exist without these donations because it has allowed us

1453
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,020
to spend more time working on podcasts.

1454
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,060
The money has allowed us to spend more time working on podcasts.

1455
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,660
The Adventure Zone wouldn't exist.

1456
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,140
Bunker Buddies wouldn't exist.

1457
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,940
We've been able to do live shows.

1458
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,700
We've been able to front the money for live shows, travel and stuff.

1459
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:47,940
I was able to move to Los Angeles specifically to try to develop more and more stuff for

1460
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,140
my brother, my brother, me and our other amazing shows.

1461
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,980
And not only that, let me also say this because we've been talking about money a lot.

1462
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:59,380
It means a lot to us to work for a listener-supported network.

1463
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,380
It's really great.

1464
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,380
I talk to a lot of people who create a lot of content for a lot of different things.

1465
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:09,980
And knowing that our listeners are also supporting our network and knowing that what we do means

1466
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,780
something to you guys means a lot to us.

1467
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,420
And it's really amazing to be a part of this organization and be a part of you guys because

1468
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,420
that's the thing.

1469
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,580
When you become a donor, you become a part of Max Fund.

1470
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,220
And we're all in this together.

1471
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,280
We also have challenge donors who are current members who will pledge a small amount of

1472
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,680
money for each new and upgrading member.

1473
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,420
So even if you're coming in at the bottom level, you're coming in at $5 a month, first

1474
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,780
of all, there's nothing insignificant about that that's huge and awesome and we appreciate

1475
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,780
it.

1476
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,960
But it's also going to kick in a lot of money because there's a bunch of challenge donors

1477
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:48,200
who are going to kick in a lot of money for every single new and upgrading member we have.

1478
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:54,420
So really think about it because your donation is essentially doubled, if not tripled or

1479
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,420
quintupled.

1480
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,420
I don't know the math.

1481
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,420
I'm bad at it.

1482
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,220
I understand that financially it may not be possible for you to donate.

1483
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,680
That's totally fine.

1484
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,420
What we would ask though is if you can't donate, share that link around.

1485
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,820
Tell other people to donate.

1486
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:15,860
Maximumfund.org slash donate and say, hey, I can't do this well-heeled buddies, but maybe

1487
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,780
you could throw these cats a few bucks.

1488
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,140
Maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

1489
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,260
We love you just the same no matter what.

1490
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,260
You're still our buds.

1491
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,020
Do you guys want to know Yahoo?

1492
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:32,460
This Yahoo was sent in by Level9000, YaDruDruid, Drew Davenport.

1493
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Thank you, Drew.

1494
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,740
I feel like maybe Shaman, we should go back to Shaman because it's a lot of Drew.

1495
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:42,140
I think YaDruDruidDrew, it's too much.

1496
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,700
Should we call it just Yahoo?

1497
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,700
We'll figure it out.

1498
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,700
Yeah.

1499
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,700
It's by YaDruAnswersUser.

1500
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:51,980
We'll run it through the boys in R and D. Blondies who ask, am I the only one annoyed

1501
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,180
about this at the fabric store?

1502
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,220
It's not that I'm really annoyed by it, but it happens every time.

1503
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,220
I'm already a little mea culpa.

1504
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,220
Don't back off.

1505
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,220
Stick with this.

1506
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:08,180
I'm not really annoyed by it, or that it happens at a fabric store.

1507
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,780
It's not that I'm annoyed by it, but it happens every time, and I'm curious to see if others

1508
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:11,940
have the same experience.

1509
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,260
I go to the fabric store.

1510
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,260
Been going my whole life.

1511
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,260
Yep.

1512
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,300
I'm a lifer.

1513
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:23,300
I pick up my material, and once I go to have the gal cut my yardage, they ask me every

1514
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,640
time at every store, so whatcha makin'?

1515
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,640
I kid you not.

1516
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,300
This has happened each and every time I've visited the fabric shop.

1517
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:38,140
Now I'm not a snoot and kindly say I'm making my Halloween costume, or I'm sewing doll clothes.

1518
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,540
Or I'm dressing as a doll for Halloween.

1519
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,180
Or I'm making curtains for my new place.

1520
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,180
But in all honesty-

1521
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,260
So people can't see me playing with my dolls.

1522
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:52,660
But in all honesty, is it any of their goddamn fucking business what I'm using the fabric

1523
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,660
for?

1524
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,420
How much editorializing was there there, Griffin?

1525
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:01,660
They said damn business, but put that Griffin McElroy filthy mouth twist on it.

1526
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,660
Think about it.

1527
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:07,480
Again, I've never not told them why I'm buying the material, but why is it every single time?

1528
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:15,660
If I was sewing a quilt to wrap my dead cat up in, you know?

1529
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,660
Why should they care?

1530
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,300
Then you just say, I'm making a quilt.

1531
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Just leave it at that.

1532
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,780
Why are you making a quilt though?

1533
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,780
For what specific purpose?

1534
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,200
For my dead cat, you insensitive bastards.

1535
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,220
Even my newlywed husband, his first time at a fabric shop, walked out saying, why is it

1536
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,900
their business what you're making?

1537
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,700
I laughed and said, sweetie, this happens every fucking time.

1538
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,700
Welcome to the club.

1539
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,260
Anyways, am I the only one that experiences this?

1540
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,080
I love fabric stores, love the employees.

1541
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:49,980
But why is it their fucking business to ask what you're making?

1542
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:55,820
Let me say, from working at CSE, I did buy a lot of fabric for like sets and stuff.

1543
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:56,820
This is true.

1544
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,700
You get asked a lot.

1545
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:04,100
And for me, it was always a little bit awkward because I would get to say things like, I'm

1546
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:09,280
going to make a blood splattered sheet, or like I'm making a fake wall.

1547
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,460
And they'd always look at me like, oh, okay.

1548
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,140
But it's just doll clothes.

1549
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,800
Doll clothes and quilts for dead cats.

1550
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,780
Next time you come in, can you just say doll clothes?

1551
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,100
It's a lot less psychically upsetting for us.

1552
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,540
We like routine here at the Michaels.

1553
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,140
Our hobby, our number one hobby here at the Hobby Lobby is just hearing you talk about

1554
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,300
the beautiful clothes you're making for your beautiful doll.

1555
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:36,940
In defense of the employees of these fabric stores, it's not like there's like a, it's

1556
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,900
not a fast paced, high energy kind of store.

1557
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:41,900
You know what I mean?

1558
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,700
Their, their excitement comes from hearing the projects that you will be working.

1559
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,540
How much time is it taking out of your day?

1560
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,700
What kind of inconvenience is it to say like, I'm making doll clothes.

1561
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,700
Okay.

1562
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,700
Great.

1563
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Thank you for sharing with me.

1564
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,700
Just making conversation.

1565
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,700
You know what they can make in there?

1566
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,700
Nothing.

1567
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,780
They can make conversation.

1568
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:01,620
Please let them live vicariously through your creation.

1569
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:05,780
How come every time I go to the barber, they ask me how I want my hair cut?

1570
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,800
Is it any of their damn business?

1571
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:14,300
We need to revisit this idea of the people who work at the Hobby Lobby, not being allowed

1572
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:19,300
to make things in the Hobby Lobby, but just because I think about that, that would pass

1573
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,300
without inspection.

1574
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,820
But the opposite of an employee discount is the employee ban.

1575
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:29,420
I grabbed that in my dragnet, Justin, because I'm imagining now all I can think about is

1576
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:34,380
the back room, the employee lounge at the Hobby Lobby, just people taking those like

1577
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:40,420
styrofoam balls and just seeing what kind of crazy shit they can get up to back there.

1578
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:42,820
We're doing a random locker check.

1579
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,620
Turn out any needles, pens, styrofoam balls.

1580
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,100
It's like a dystopian future back there.

1581
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:54,920
They can't, what you're missing, they can't create anything with their hands because they

1582
01:05:54,920 --> 01:06:00,660
assume that they got, no matter what you have, like, okay, no matter what the physical object

1583
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:07,500
is that you are creating, right, anything, they probably have the stuff for it at Michael's.

1584
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,580
So any object, if someone sees you creating things, they have to check you when you go

1585
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,340
in and when you go out to make sure you don't have any other physical objects.

1586
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,500
Because if you did, if they're like, well, what's this wallet?

1587
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,500
This is really nice.

1588
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,020
Like, yeah, I bet you made it while you were here at Michael's.

1589
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,020
We have everything.

1590
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,620
Is that why all the employees at Michael's work in their underwear?

1591
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,620
Right.

1592
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:33,900
If you've ever wondered why they are naked with an apron, that is why.

1593
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:39,060
And have wires coming out of their head connected to the central processing unit to prevent

1594
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,060
thought crime.

1595
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,820
That's the thing.

1596
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:47,700
You can't even create things with thoughts because they were inspired by like the macrame.

1597
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,700
What are you making?

1598
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,700
Doll clothes.

1599
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,700
Oh, that gives me an idea.

1600
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,700
No, no, no.

1601
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,820
I mean, I mean, thank you very much.

1602
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,820
Have a great day.

1603
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,920
Thank you for shopping at Michael's.

1604
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,980
The only thing you're allowed to make at Hobby Lobby is babies because you don't have a

1605
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:03,980
choice.

1606
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,980
Because I got to have new employees.

1607
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,940
Now, Justin, are you okay?

1608
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:14,260
Are you theorizing that they like sign an agreement to very like gulag totalitarian

1609
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,260
thing?

1610
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,260
Or?

1611
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,260
Not like goulash.

1612
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,260
Sorry.

1613
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,260
Is it a psychological torture?

1614
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,740
Wait, I just want to say, Griffin, that was a really, really funny joke.

1615
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,260
I'm glad you stopped Travis for it.

1616
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,900
That's what he deserved, and that joke deserved, and I love you for that.

1617
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,900
Thank you.

1618
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,020
I love you, too.

1619
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,560
Or is it a psychological thing where they've just been told so many times that they cannot

1620
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:40,020
create that they just believe it so intrinsically at this point.

1621
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,020
There's someone who's like, why don't you sew something?

1622
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,260
And they're like, I couldn't.

1623
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,260
I couldn't.

1624
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,260
I can't.

1625
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,260
Please leave.

1626
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,940
Just take your fabric and get out.

1627
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,500
Don't stir the pot.

1628
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,960
Travis, most gorillas have been in captivity for so long.

1629
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,020
They think that freedom is something they dreamed.

1630
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:02,580
That's a line from one of my favorite movies, Instinct, with Cuba Gooding Jr.

1631
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,900
And it's something that I think applies really well to this situation.

1632
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:14,020
Is it possibly a security protocol for in case they are using the fabric to make a dirty

1633
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,020
bomb?

1634
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,120
You're making a felty bomb.

1635
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,120
We can tell.

1636
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,980
It's a felty bomb.

1637
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,380
Or like, I don't know, a murder robe, a ceremonial murder robe.

1638
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,660
And you have to tell them, or else it's entrapment, what you're making.

1639
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:31,660
Sorry, what?

1640
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,780
You think entrapment works?

1641
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:37,740
If Michael's employee asks you what you're using the fabric for, and you are intending

1642
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:42,680
to make a dirty, felty bomb, you have to tell them, or else it's entrapment.

1643
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,680
Know your rights, people.

1644
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,500
If you don't know your rights, you're not going to be able to protect yourself out there.

1645
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,500
What's that?

1646
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,500
I'm playing Taps.

1647
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,500
Oh, is it for the podcast?

1648
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,700
No, not for the podcast.

1649
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,660
For a funeral for a friend.

1650
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:58,660
One last bit.

1651
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,780
One last time around the old corral, because everybody has fucking chompous flavor.

1652
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,900
We're going to try it out one last time, then it's fucking done.

1653
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,500
And don't ever ask about it again, because everybody ruined it.

1654
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:14,740
And when you told people about it, when you told your Terry Gross about this great bit

1655
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:20,860
you heard on a podcast, Jerry Gross, I'm speaking to you, nephew of Terry Gross, when you told

1656
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:21,860
Terry about-

1657
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:22,860
I'm Scary Gross!

1658
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:32,340
Scary Gross is actually a really tight name for whoever takes Elvira's place.

1659
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,060
Just kidding, Elvira will live forever.

1660
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:38,740
This doll, it's Haunted Doll Watch, by the way.

1661
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:42,880
If you are so saddened by the death of Haunted Doll Watch, first of all, Haunted Dolls can't

1662
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
really die.

1663
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,340
Second of all, there's a Haunted Doll Watch bit in the Movin' Bam Bonus episode, so get

1664
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,340
at it.

1665
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,340
Classic Haunted Doll Katie Frieda.

1666
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,060
Extremely active, very rare spirit.

1667
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:02,220
Very rare spirit's weird to me, it seems like those are just one apiece, I believe.

1668
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,220
But anyway.

1669
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:06,180
Are you talking about like if you find them in the pack of Pokemon cards?

1670
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,860
No, I think you're saying like Travis McElroy is of course a very rare Travis McElroy.

1671
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,740
Oh, like you're only going to find one Travis McElroy.

1672
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,180
Like why are there multi-pack spirits?

1673
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,180
Anyway.

1674
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,460
I got a hollow foil spirit.

1675
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,260
This doll has been a part of my spirit family for nearly a decade.

1676
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,420
Can I say something about Haunted Doll Watch?

1677
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,420
Okay.

1678
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,420
What I'm going to miss the most.

1679
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:33,300
What I'm going to miss the most about Haunted Doll Watch is a lot of people ask me like

1680
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,140
where do you find this stuff, Justin?

1681
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,140
Like where are you getting this material from?

1682
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,980
Literally, I've never prepared for Haunted Doll Watch.

1683
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:47,400
As I've been sitting here, I type eBay.com and then I type Haunted Doll and I literally

1684
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,860
read the first one and it's always the best.

1685
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:55,100
You type H-A-U into Google and it auto fills.

1686
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:00,800
It's such a rich vein, it was so easy, but now it's too, but it was too easy, you know?

1687
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,160
You know how James Dean was too good at acting so God killed him?

1688
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,160
It's like that.

1689
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,160
That's exactly what happened.

1690
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,500
So anyway, this doll is a needy and demanding spirit.

1691
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,500
What's the doll's name?

1692
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,860
Uh, this is Frida slash Katie and I'll explain that in a second.

1693
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,860
And now I feel there are a few that can deal with this special girl.

1694
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:24,020
By the way, I'm looking at the reader on her haunted energy and it's up to danger, so yeah.

1695
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,020
Uh oh.

1696
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,340
Justin, I hate to ask, I'm afraid to ask, could you share the link?

1697
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:37,820
Uh, yes, I can set you all up with the link to see Katie Frida or you could just Google

1698
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:42,740
and the first fucking thing you see when you search haunted doll, that's the one that you

1699
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,740
get.

1700
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:48,980
So anyway, uh, Katie and Frida, people sell haunted dolls on eBay, I'm sure you know that

1701
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:55,140
if you fucking read Vice or listen to Fresh Air or whatever, but uh, we profile some of

1702
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,140
those dolls.

1703
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,820
We're talking about Katie and Frida.

1704
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,900
Katie had a difficult and short life.

1705
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,460
She was born and unloved.

1706
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,900
This abuse created a split in Katie's mind.

1707
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,700
She created another self to withstand the torture and abuse.

1708
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:11,580
This girl's name is Frida and is Katie's other self personality.

1709
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:18,060
Now I hear all you reaching for your fucking buy it now buttons after reading that shit,

1710
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,580
but I do have to warn you, this costs $150 to bring this into your life.

1711
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,780
Katie Frida passed away at six years old from neglect, abuse, and malnutrition.

1712
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:31,100
She died in the darkness at night and was very cold.

1713
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,480
Uh, excuse me?

1714
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,460
Are you selling this?

1715
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,460
This is for sale?

1716
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:41,860
Are you, what kind of advertising are you doing with me right now?

1717
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,860
Frida has turned doorknobs on both bedroom doors.

1718
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,540
Katie has shown me events through dream state that left me in tears.

1719
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,940
Okay, so it's sort of a double whammy, sort of all the shit that dolls can do, which is

1720
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:56,180
turning doorknobs spookily and also going on dream adventure.

1721
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:59,660
What if you're on a fucking dream adventure with your goddamn guardian angel and Katie

1722
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,660
rolls up?

1723
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,660
Hey, get out of here, Katie.

1724
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,380
This is my spooning.

1725
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:09,320
Here is my favorite line, it goes through like all this stuff and it's honestly too

1726
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:16,180
brutal to read on a quote unquote comedy show, but the last line is, I want to ensure Katie

1727
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,880
is in the best home possible.

1728
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,500
Just like, fuck you, Frida, I don't care where Frida ends up.

1729
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:27,300
Frida can fuck off, but no, Katie is cool, $150 if you don't mind.

1730
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,460
Please be at least $25 to purchase.

1731
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,460
And rent a car.

1732
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,420
That's not the first time we've seen that warning.

1733
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,460
Some people aren't like-

1734
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,860
A 22 year old doesn't have the emotional maturity to deal with a Katie and or Frida.

1735
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:43,700
Guys, can I like, this listing is fucking great if you're not looking at it already.

1736
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:48,100
There are two pictures from the six or seven that are available here that look like they

1737
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,580
are snaps of Bigfoot.

1738
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:54,400
Like Katie or Frida was just like running across the room and they just like managed

1739
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,820
to snap a pic of her.

1740
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:57,580
They're absolutely miserable pictures.

1741
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:02,060
I love the one with the scanner because it looks like Katie is saying, you ain't scanning

1742
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,980
me, are you?

1743
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:09,580
Let's talk about this ghost dollometer because I think it's some racist bullshit.

1744
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:15,540
Because this is the scanner, this is the metric that the ghost doll scanner, the ghost dollometer

1745
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,540
uses.

1746
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:21,420
There's safe, caution, and danger.

1747
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:26,140
So if there's a ghost in the doll, there's gonna be a ghost in the doll, there's a ghost

1748
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:29,300
in like half of the dolls that there are in the world.

1749
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,460
There's no setting on there to be like-

1750
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,460
But it's cool.

1751
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:35,580
There is a ghost in this, but they're totally cool.

1752
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,260
They also don't mention their return policy.

1753
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,980
No, no return policy.

1754
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,460
Hey listen, I bought that Katie Frida doll.

1755
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:48,300
It's like 75% Frida and I was expecting a 50-50 split.

1756
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:54,940
If you go to this listing for no other reason, make sure to stop by and see the picture of

1757
01:14:54,940 --> 01:15:00,340
what appears to be Frida slash Katie, I'm assuming Frida, staring into a mirror while

1758
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,660
standing over a painting of the Virgin Mary.

1759
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,260
What is that look?

1760
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,260
What is happening?

1761
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:08,140
I don't see the Virgin Mary in this picture.

1762
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,140
Oh no.

1763
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,140
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1764
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,140
The Haunted Dolls.

1765
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,860
Griffin was a haunted doll the whole time.

1766
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:20,940
Is it possible that the resurgence in Haunted Doll, and by resurgence I mean-

1767
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:21,940
Surgence.

1768
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:22,940
Pre-surgence.

1769
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,940
Pre-most surgence.

1770
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:34,220
Of Haunted Dolls in the media's eye, ever watchful eye, is going to lead to one person

1771
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:39,340
who buys these dolls up for the sole purpose of destroying them and making our world a

1772
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,220
safer and better place.

1773
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:42,220
Possible.

1774
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,540
I hope that that's what happens.

1775
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:50,860
I mean more likely though is we are fucking kicked right back to Beanie Baby fever mid-90s.

1776
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,900
People are gobbling these things up like crazy.

1777
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:59,220
They're spending way too much just assuming that they're going to get the investment back

1778
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,220
at some point.

1779
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,220
Not even thinking about-

1780
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,100
They even got the Haunted Dolls that come in the McDonald's Kids Meals.

1781
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,100
You know what I mean?

1782
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,100
Right.

1783
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,100
They're collecting all the Haunted Dolls.

1784
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,900
Clearing out the college funds just to buy Stephanie slash Gordo or whatever the Haunted

1785
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,100
Doll is.

1786
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,180
That's what I think.

1787
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:19,380
My hope is that once the smoke clears on Haunted Dolls, we can swoop back in there.

1788
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,980
It'll be retro at that point or something.

1789
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,140
We'll be doing it ironically, I think.

1790
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:26,660
That's the only hope for more Haunted Dolls.

1791
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,660
That's what I think is the future.

1792
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,540
At that point, Katie slash Frito will be 36 years old and she'll be like, I just would

1793
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,540
like to get a job.

1794
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:37,140
She's like the mayor of Portland or something.

1795
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,140
You guys want a yahoo?

1796
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,140
Yes.

1797
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,140
Yes.

1798
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:44,420
This yahoo was sent in by Dan Green who asks, nope, he didn't ask it, fucked that right

1799
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,420
up, didn't I?

1800
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:51,120
It's by yahoo answers user Rishi who asks, how can I fight well against a guy I took

1801
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,140
under my wing?

1802
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,740
To put it simply, I need help badly.

1803
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:59,540
I practice Jeet Kune Do, a self-defense martial art.

1804
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:04,160
I've been going for nearly seven years and I've come a long way since then.

1805
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,940
I'm now the best teen in my class.

1806
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:07,580
I'm 15 by the way.

1807
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:11,580
Who at eight is like, I'm gonna get into Jeet Kune Do.

1808
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:15,420
However, a year ago, another guy the same age as me started learning and I basically

1809
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:18,980
taught him and he was learning the ropes, nothing bad about that.

1810
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:23,460
But when it came to sparring, I gave him all my killer secrets to fighting well.

1811
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,840
As we became good friends, we sparred more together, now he uses all my tactics that

1812
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,620
I taught and develops it and now he's better than me by far.

1813
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:37,060
I get completely whitewashed and he masters all the special traps I learn in an instant

1814
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:40,660
whilst I can barely do them with three weeks of solid practice.

1815
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:44,020
It's also frustrating as now my confidence has dropped because of this and my mind goes

1816
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:45,260
blank whenever I spar.

1817
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:49,340
I can't think of any tactics to use and he just keeps getting better and better by the

1818
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,340
day.

1819
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,980
Can you guys give any advice to me on how I can get my ferocity back?

1820
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,540
All help is useful, thank you.

1821
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,940
This is so classic.

1822
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,220
It's a person of his own creation.

1823
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,100
It's so obvious what's going on.

1824
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,760
He is the chosen one, right?

1825
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,740
It's a classic storyline, the person who's worked really hard like trying to become the

1826
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:13,640
chosen one and then somebody just like ghosts in and it's like, but he gets everything instantly.

1827
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,420
He's not working for it, right?

1828
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,140
And I'm supposed to train him?

1829
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:19,420
I should have been the chosen one.

1830
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,100
He's the last, last dragon.

1831
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,100
Yes.

1832
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,740
And he took the globe from you.

1833
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,740
Yes.

1834
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,580
So I think you should kill him.

1835
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:27,580
Whoa.

1836
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:28,580
Whoa.

1837
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:30,100
Now I know it seems extreme.

1838
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,140
Yeah, like the most extreme thing you can do in any given situation.

1839
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:36,500
But that's the only way that she's going to be able to become the chosen one.

1840
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,620
Or he.

1841
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,440
It's definitely a guy just based on their avatar.

1842
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,020
How can you tell from the avatar?

1843
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,300
Are they like spraying on some acts or something?

1844
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:51,700
I think we have like a, um, how can you give me, do me a favor, you two go try to get in

1845
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:56,340
a fight with a mirror and when you can't do it because they block your blows with their

1846
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,340
own blows.

1847
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,340
Yes.

1848
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,300
But Griffin in this scenario, the mirror is kicking his ass.

1849
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,300
Well yeah.

1850
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,300
Cause it's a bet.

1851
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,300
It's a haunted mirror.

1852
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:05,300
Oh.

1853
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:12,180
The, what they did, uh, taskmaster, you know, on Spider-Man unlimited that cartoon taskmaster

1854
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:17,100
is a character that like learns your fighting style immediately as he watches you fight

1855
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:21,460
and you like, nobody can beat him in a fight cause they like, he knows all your moves.

1856
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,460
He, he watches you fight, right?

1857
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:28,600
And then as he's watching you do the moves, he flips it on you and does the moves back

1858
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,260
on you and better.

1859
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,940
So what I'm saying is he's basically the, the Terry Gross of fighting guys.

1860
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,940
Okay.

1861
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,900
But listen, here's how they beat him, right?

1862
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,380
Spider-Man switched costumes with somebody else.

1863
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:48,860
Spider-Man dressed up like, uh, Iron Fist and then they did each other's combat moves.

1864
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,460
So he didn't know where it was coming from.

1865
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,780
So wait, was there a moment when Iron Fist saw like Peter Parker like straight up and

1866
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:55,780
was like, oh great.

1867
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:56,780
Saw his dick and everything.

1868
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,780
He took his pants off.

1869
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,320
No, they all, they all know.

1870
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,700
They live with Aunt Meg so they all like know the story.

1871
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,700
Oh, I gotcha.

1872
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,700
Yeah.

1873
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,700
I haven't.

1874
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,220
So what you're saying, Justin, is the classic, like if, if he knows what you're going to

1875
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,420
do next, do the last thing he would expect.

1876
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:16,220
And if, and if like, if your normal move is that you go like high, high, low chop, right?

1877
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:21,980
Just like stroke his shoulder, quarter circle punch, then maybe like, you know, like this

1878
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:25,460
time like go and he won't know what to make of it.

1879
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:28,540
And then you punch him in the gut, but he is going to know what to make of that.

1880
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:32,540
You in the middle, you will go and he's already going to know what the fuck you're doing.

1881
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,500
You have to get outside of your own head.

1882
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,300
How's this for a suggestion?

1883
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,260
Get out there to spar and he's like, let's go.

1884
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,260
Let's go, Sensei.

1885
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,780
And he's saying that tauntingly.

1886
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:42,780
Ooh, what a jerk.

1887
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,780
I hate that.

1888
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,980
And then he, but then you're like, oh, hold on.

1889
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:45,980
I got to piss.

1890
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,300
And you go to the bathroom and then while you're in the bathroom, do a whip it and then

1891
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,260
go back out there and you're real fucked up.

1892
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,580
You're going to be real fucked up and he's, you're not going to be inside your own head.

1893
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,500
So he's not going to be allowed in there.

1894
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,380
He's going to be like, all right, time to do the thing that I did that you taught me.

1895
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,180
And you're like, how about this new thing?

1896
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,180
And you hit him.

1897
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:06,020
And you sit down and take him out.

1898
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,660
And you hit him with the backside of your bicep and he's like, that wasn't effective,

1899
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:13,860
but I didn't see it coming.

1900
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,100
Are you okay?

1901
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,100
You're like really wavering.

1902
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,500
You're kind of wobbling on your feet.

1903
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:22,580
It's like drunken master shit, but whip it.

1904
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,580
Whip it, Master.

1905
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,580
You're 15.

1906
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:28,460
You can't buy alcohol, but you can probably get some whip it somewhere.

1907
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,820
Somebody you know has whip it.

1908
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:33,120

1917
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:59,420
cost of equipment, cost of hosting, all that stuff.

1918
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,460

If you want to listen to all the other shows on MaxFun, because everybody's bringing out

1930
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,060
super long episodes, bringing out some of their best material, this is a really good

1931

time to go listen to the other shows.

1932
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,300
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1933
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,100
a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1934
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:49,180
I feel like we don't thank them enough, even though we do every episode.

1935
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,180
Every single.

1936
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,880
We should be thanking them three to four times an episode.

1937
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,880
You're right, Travis.

1938
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,880

Y'all want a Final Yahoo?

1945
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,260
Yes, we do.

1946
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,260

Thank you, Dave.

It's been my brother, my brother.

1955
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:53,860
May you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1956
01:23:53,860 --> 01:24:05,780
Did you guys like that?

1957
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,860
Did you, the listener, like that?

1958
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,860
You were just swept up in a world of high fantasy and magic where anything can happen

1959
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,020
and anything is possible.

1960
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,500
Hi, I'm Griffin McElroy, Dungeon Master for The Adventure Zone, a new podcast on maximum

1962
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,780
experience.
