1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Hey folks, it's Jesse, the founder of MaxFun.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,120
Since we postponed our annual MaxFun drive in mid-March,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,520
we have gotten a lot of questions about if and when

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,240
we'd be rescheduling it.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,440
And honestly, we've been asking ourselves the same thing.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,040
Well, now we have an answer for you.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,480
The 2020 MaxFun drive will start on July 13th.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,840
That's coming up soon.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
We decided to have the drive now

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,040
because it's always brought a lot of joy and excitement

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,400
to our community and certainly to us.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,560
And to be totally honest,

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
it's also the main source of income for some of our hosts.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
Like pretty much everything right now,

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,880
this year's drive is gonna be a little different.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,360
We'll still be bringing you very special episodes,

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,720
fun community activities, premium thank you gifts,

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,560
but we also know it's a weird time

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,040
and for some folks, a really difficult one.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,800
Some people are in a position to become new

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
or upgrading members, others can't right now.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
And that is okay.

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,920
We'll have ways for you to support MaxFun at every level,

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,960
including some ways that won't cost you anything.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,280
We're also gonna run the drive for four weeks

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,600
instead of two.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
We didn't think it was a good time to be rushing anybody

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,440
and having a longer drive lets us be a little more low key

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,040
in our drive pitch.

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,600
It also gives us more time to do fun stuff,

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,760
like the weekly live streams we'll be putting on

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,880
for charity throughout the drive.

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,520
Most importantly, we want the 2020 MaxFun drive

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,840
to highlight all the ways we support each other

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,200
and our communities.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,520
We also wanna show how grateful we are to you

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
for making all the work that we do possible.

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Stay safe, we'll see you July 13th for the MaxFun drive.

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
The McElroy brothers are not experts

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,080
and their advice should never be followed.

41
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,440
Travis insists he's a sexpert,

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,840
but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,160
Also, this show isn't for kids,

44
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,560
which I mentioned only so the babies out there

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
will know how cool they are for listening.

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
What's up, you cool baby?

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,360
It's familiar, but not too familiar,

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
but not too not familiar.

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
It's a new craze.

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
And good girls, do you want it?

51
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Just say, hey, I want it.

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Just say, hey, I want it.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Me, an advice show for the modern era.

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

56
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy,

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
and you can bite my butt.

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Whoa, hachi-machi.

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I don't even wanna say my name

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
because I don't want people to get me confused

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
with the attitude that Travis just brought to the table.

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,360
That one was Travis, it's not me, I'm Griffin.

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Guys, I'm sorry, real quick.

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I should have talked with you guys about this off mic

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
before I started, but the director called me,

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
the My Brother, My Brother, Me director

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
and the executive producers and stuff.

68
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Sure.

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
And they said that I need to make a heel turn.

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay.

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,360
That we've been without kind of conflict for too long,

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
and I've been playing the nice guy for a while now,

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
and so I have to do like a heel turn.

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
So just kind of, if you can-

75
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
So this has been you as the nice guy the whole time?

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Yeah, this has been me being nice,

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
and now I have to do a heel turn.

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,360
So if you guys could just like play off it

79
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
and kind of let me be the villain.

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I need to talk to Cameron Crowe, the director of our podcast,

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
because I don't know,

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I've never had to deal with that energy in the show,

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
so I'm not sure how to do that.

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Feels hostile.

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
We're a little, we're all flying.

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
That's the idea, right?

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah, that's the point.

88
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Justin and I don't know how to play with that in the space.

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
I love playing in the space,

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
but that doesn't seem like a fun game.

91
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Well, maybe we can find it,

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
and I don't know that I, do I have to be mean to you?

93
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Or just like mean?

94
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I mean, people like the general anger sometimes.

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Okay, well let's just start, we'll just start.

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Justin, you do like an intro.

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Just something, draw anything.

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
I already did that, I already did that.

99
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
No, no, no, I mean like pick a topic or something.

100
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Like, hey, have you ever noticed?

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Let's do just a general sort of,

102
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
well, we did a watch last week.

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Justin, maybe you can tell us a funny story about kids.

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Yeah, go for it.

105
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Um, okay.

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Kids do silly, say like kids,

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
hey, kids did a silly thing today.

108
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, this is great, actually.

109
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I went to, I was driving with Charlie.

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't care.

111
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Wow.

112
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Wow.

113
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I don't know how conducive this is gonna be to call the guys.

114
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

115
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
You know what?

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
That was bad.

117
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
That was, I'm gonna take that note.

118
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm gonna take that note, let me try again, okay?

119
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Give it to me again.

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Okay.

121
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
I was driving with Charlie,

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,360
and we were going to pick up some,

123
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
we had ordered some baked goods from like a local,

124
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
from a local bakery called,

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
that's not, that's super not nice.

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,360
That's actually funny about it, damn it.

127
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
From a local bakery called the,

128
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
That's fucking good.

129
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,360
A local bakery called the,

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Okay, I hate it now.

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I've turned around on it.

132
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
That's still pretty good for me.

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
She said the funniest thing.

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Awuga.

135
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Yeah.

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
I left my airborne, yeah, sorry.

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,360
I feel like I don't appreciate the fact

138
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
that Travis sort of nominated himself to be the heel turn.

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,360
It wasn't me, but listen, I will say,

140
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,360
I think this is a very collaborative effort.

141
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
If one of you wants to make a heel turn,

142
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,360
and I can stick with being nice, we could try that.

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
All right, Travis, you do a nice thing,

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
and then Griff, do you want to be like the bad boy?

145
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
I can try.

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Do you guys think you could call me donkey dick?

147
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah.

148
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Yeah, like I was thinking that could be his name.

149
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
What about donkey dick Dave?

150
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
No, just, that's because I'm Griffin.

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Oh, okay, got it.

152
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Okay, got it, okay.

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I just want to say thank you to everybody

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
for listening, your support during this time

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
has just meant so much to us,

156
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
and like people telling their friends about the show.

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Donkey dick likes it too.

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Okay, well that's nice.

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,360
That's more supportive than I expected.

160
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Pretty good.

161
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
From donkey dick.

162
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Yeah, okay, and so I guess from donkey dick and all of us,

163
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,360
thank you for supporting my brother and my brother.

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Love to your family from donkey dick.

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Okay, sorry, donkey dick, is this sincere or?

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Yeah, it's fucking, yeah,

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
but it's the way he's saying it,

168
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
and the fact that his name is donkey dick is mean.

169
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Oh, okay, cool, cool, cool.

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Justin, do you want to try saying something nice

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,360
to let donkey dick play off of that energy?

172
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Well, there can't be, hold up, hold up, hold up.

173
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
There can't be two of us bad and mean at the same time,

174
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
so let me, hold on, give me a second.

175
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Okay, I just put donkey dick in the drawer, Justin.

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Wait, I've lost the plot now.

177
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Am I nice or mean?

178
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Wait, Griffin, you say something

179
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
and let Justin, you be the heel, Justin,

180
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
and you react to it.

181
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Okay, yeah, so I got stung by a big bee yesterday.

182
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Shut up and tell jokes.

183
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Well, that's too real.

184
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
This is the start of the joke,

185
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
so if you would be chill for a fucking joke.

186
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Sorry, my bad.

187
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
No, it's okay, you didn't know.

188
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
The construction of the sentence was such that

189
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
it could have just been an anecdote.

190
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
No, go ahead, it's fine.

191
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Okay, so I got stung by a big bee yesterday

192
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
right on my face.

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Is this still the beginning?

194
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah.

195
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Go for it.

196
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
So I was playing around in the backyard yesterday

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
playing some baseball with my friends,

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
and then a big bee came around and stung me.

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm getting pretty worked up for the joke.

200
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Stung me right on my fanny.

201
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Was that the joke?

202
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
No, it's still the setup.

203
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I've said that part already.

204
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm getting amped.

205
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm getting amped for it over here.

206
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
So I was looking for the EpiPen that I need

207
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
to keep myself alive.

208
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Oh, fuck.

209
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
And I came inside and I found it.

210
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Throw it down.

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Go for it, this is the moment right now.

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
I found it in the kitchen drawer.

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
We're ready, drop it.

214
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I jabbed it into my butt

215
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,360
and I realized it was a regular Bic pen.

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Just a regular Bic pen.

217
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
And I put a bunch of ink in my butt.

218
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
So did you die?

219
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
No, I didn't die.

220
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
I'm here recording the show with you now.

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Do the joke.

222
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm sorry, that was the joke.

223
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Say it funnier.

224
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I stabbed a fucking Bic pen in my ass cheeks

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,360
and poop happened.

226
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Do four more jokes.

227
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Yeah, okay.

228
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
We have to get some alts on that.

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Could you give us another read?

230
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I would love to hear another read on the punchline

231
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
just for safety.

232
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Okay.

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
But then I looked down and it turned out

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
it wasn't my EpiPen.

235
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,360
It was a Charms Blow Pop.

236
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
And it went in.

237
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Can you do it again but without the brand name?

238
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Yeah.

239
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,360
When I pulled it out, I realized it wasn't my EpiPen.

240
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
It was a lollipop with bubble gum.

241
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
EpiPen's a brand name.

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
It wasn't my allergies.

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
It wasn't my energy life-saving allergies pen.

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
It was a lollipop with bubble gum inside.

245
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
A little faster.

246
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Fuck.

247
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm just going to comment.

248
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Sorry.

249
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm just a producer.

250
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
But a real quick note.

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
What if it was an EpiPen?

252
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Can you try that?

253
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Wait, but he just said I shouldn't do it.

254
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
No, but don't say the brand name.

255
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
But you did find it.

256
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Okay, so I stabbed it.

258
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Can I get some clicks for the edit?

259
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Yeah, here.

260
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
So I poked it into my butt.

261
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,360
And when I looked down, it was my life-saving allergy dispenser.

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
And I felt better.

263
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
And my butt didn't hurt anymore.

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
And I went back outside and finished the baseball game

265
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
with my friends.

266
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,360
You are on some next level shit right now.

267
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm loving this.

268
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
See, Travis, I'll be honest.

269
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
I was nervous about this energy.

270
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
But I think it's really amped up the show.

271
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
I think so, too.

272
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
This is a show now.

273
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
I'm psyched out of my mind.

274
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Yeah, I'm psyched out of my mind.

275
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Let's fucking tear into it.

276
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Let's ride this wave.

277
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I had a kitchen-sized trash can with a latch-closed lid

278
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
that broke a few years ago.

279
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Can you imagine if a friend of yours came up to you

280
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
and started a story that way?

281
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
And it's like, this is going to be a boring story.

282
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
No friend of mine would tell me a story like this.

283
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Okay, but to be fair, Justin,

284
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,360
our show conceit is not impress us.

285
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
I'm still in the heel-turn phase.

286
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I want people to juice it.

287
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
You know what I mean?

288
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Yeah, sure.

289
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Hook me.

290
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I finally replaced it and left the trash can

291
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
and its broken lid out with my garbage.

292
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
When the trash people came,

293
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
they left the empty trash bin

294
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
with my other larger empty trash bins.

295
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,360
How do I signal to the trash service people,

296
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
this is part of my trash?

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Do you know how long this person

298
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,360
probably agonized over trash service people?

299
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
What's the best way of saying this?

300
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Trash collector.

301
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Trash collectors makes it sound like it's not a job.

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Sanitation workers are dumb.

303
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Trash man is bad.

304
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,360
How do I throw away this trash can?

305
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Am I doomed to have it sitting next to my big bins forever?

306
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,360
That's from Scrap Stooge in Somerville.

307
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I have had this exact problem.

308
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
I think we all have.

309
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Trash cans aren't immortal.

310
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,360
We have one legal, ethical way of getting rid of them.

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
In that one way, there is a loophole

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
that renders the whole thing kind of inert.

313
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,360
What I did once when I was moving away

314
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,360
from an apartment in Chicago

315
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
is I picked up a big cinder block

316
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
and dropped it on the big plastic trash can

317
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
that became smaller pieces that would then fit

318
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
inside of the second trash can.

319
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I see.

320
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Let me tell you what.

321
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
That's just recycling 101.

322
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I'll tell you what you don't do,

323
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
because I've run into this before.

324
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
You don't put the bigger can

325
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
or the smaller can inside the bigger can,

326
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
because then you run into the chance

327
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
that someone opens it and goes,

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
oh, this can is pregnant.

329
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
I can't throw anything away in here.

330
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
And they don't want to, yeah.

331
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Yeah, because this trash can is going to have a baby soon,

332
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
and that's a problem.

333
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
I solved it by moving,

334
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
and I just left the old trash cans,

335
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
and that's their problem now.

336
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
And the other lesson I learned

337
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
is that there's a few things in life

338
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
that you should spend a little bit more money on,

339
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
and number one on that list for me is,

340
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,360
some things are disposable, and it doesn't matter.

341
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Get a wonderful trash can

342
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
if you want to live with you forever.

343
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I cheaped out when I first moved into our first house,

344
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
and I hated that trash can forever.

345
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I could never get rid of it.

346
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
So next time, get yourself a great trash can,

347
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
a trash can that does everything.

348
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Your family, your lover, your security blanket,

349
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
whatever you need.

350
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Probably not your lover.

351
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Not your lover.

352
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Not your lover.

353
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
But I guess that is how trash cans get pregnant.

354
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
That is true.

355
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I have another solution you could try, though,

356
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
that I didn't have the guts.

357
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Can I just say, to your point,

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
can I just say real quick before you say the solution?

359
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Say anything.

360
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Get a trash can with good wheels.

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
You need good wheel action.

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Invest in the wheels.

363
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Maybe get your own trucks for it.

364
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
You know what I mean?

365
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Really get down there and lube them up if you need to.

366
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,360
When we're born, we should all be assigned a thick,

367
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,360
granite, unbreakable, sturdy trash can

368
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,360
that is our trash can that we use for our life,

369
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
and then when we die, we get ashtub into it,

370
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,360
and then it is our literal constant companion into eternity.

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
That's what happens in the giver.

372
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Yes, that's basically what the giver's about.

373
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Here's one that I think you should try.

374
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Get a can of spray paint,

375
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,360
and spray paint this is trash on yourself,

376
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,360
and that'll remind you to spray paint this is trash on the can,

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
so it's kind of a reminder.

378
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
You know that doesn't help, though, right, Juice?

379
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Right.

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
If I see a trash can that says this is trash on it,

381
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I will think, yep, that is where the trash goes.

382
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Fuck.

383
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Fuck, you're right.

384
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I think it would be way more confusing

385
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
if you had to write on trash cans you didn't want to throw away.

386
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,360
This isn't trash, because then if I,

387
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
the sanitation worker, come along and see it,

388
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
I think, well, I guess I leave that one alone?

389
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I think every town should have a volcano in it.

390
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Okay.

391
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Because I think that there's a,

392
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I think there's a, we have a few cans here in Austin.

393
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I got a compost bin, got a recycling,

394
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,360
and I got a little garbage can, and that's all great,

395
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
but then there's stuff like other trash cans.

396
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,360
There's stuff like, you know, electronics.

397
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't know if that's great to put in there,

398
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
something with like a big battery in it, no thanks.

399
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Fucking oil, when you get oil out of the pan,

400
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm still not quite sure what people are supposed to do with that.

401
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
We should have volcano.

402
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
And you can't use it all the time.

403
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
You obviously have to drive to volcano,

404
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
but like, that's where you throw trash can into.

405
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
That's where you throw your old oil into.

406
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
That's where you throw your-

407
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Batteries.

408
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Batteries go right into volcano.

409
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Obviously.

410
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Yeah.

411
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
And it's perfect, because all it does,

412
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
I guess it just goes down in the earth.

413
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Like, volcano's not going to overflow

414
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
because of something you did.

415
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
That's the trash truck.

416
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
The trash truck is outside right now as we're talking.

417
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Oh, boy.

418
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm going to go yell at Dan.

419
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Hold up.

420
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Hey, you guys should do a volcano.

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,360
For garbage cans to go in.

422
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
And electronics and oil.

423
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
They're laughing, guys.

424
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
They're busting the fuck up.

425
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Are they laughing at it?

426
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
They thought that was fucking hilarious.

427
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Do you guys want to hear Yahoo?

428
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
But they're not going to take it seriously?

429
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,360
No, they laughed in a serious way.

430
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

431
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Thank you, Adrian.

432
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,360
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

433
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm going to call Travis.

434
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
No, what?

435
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Travis asked this.

436
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Travis McRoy asked,

437
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,360
okay to take all the pepperoni from the pizza?

438
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
I love pepperoni on my pizza.

439
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
So while at my neighbor's house,

440
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
I picked all the pepperonis off,

441
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,360
and I put it on my slices.

442
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
I figured, I like it, so why not?

443
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Well, my rude neighbor said,

444
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
I guess I'll have cheese pizza.

445
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
What's this guy's problem?

446
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
You're supposed to please your guest, right?

447
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Some people really shouldn't entertain.

448
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Whoa.

449
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Whoa, that went places.

450
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
So what's the question?

451
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Is it okay to take the pepperonis off the pizza

452
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
and put it on my slices?

453
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
All of it?

454
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,360
It says all of it, yeah.

455
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I picked all the pepperonis.

456
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Okay, at a certain point.

457
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Yeah.

458
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,360
And even getting out of the realm of manners,

459
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
or etiquette, or whatever,

460
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:43,360
to overload one slice with all of the pepperonis is obscene.

461
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
There's no obscene amount of pepperonis.

462
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Yeah.

463
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
You go to eat it, and it'd be like,

464
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,360
it's piled with them discs.

465
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
That's too much, yeah.

466
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
And you're going to get upset.

467
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Tommy, I do love pepperoni though, damn.

468
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I think the problem is putting all the pepperonis

469
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,360
on either one slice that you're going to eat

470
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
or your half of the pizza.

471
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
I think if you are going to rearrange them,

472
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
you slide the pepperonis around

473
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,360
so that it's every other slice has double the pepperonis

474
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
from its adjacent, let's say, one to the left slice

475
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
gets moved all over to it.

476
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
And then whenever you're eating the pizza,

477
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,360
you just prioritize those pieces.

478
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Do you know what I mean?

479
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
And so maybe you'll get away with it that way.

480
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
They'll almost certainly eat

481
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
one of the heavy pepperoni slices,

482
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
but you're going to be ahead of the game.

483
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Can I just say how much I enjoy Neighbor,

484
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,360
who, if I understood the question correctly,

485
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
it was their party?

486
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,360
And says, I guess I'll have cheese pizza?

487
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Mm-hmm.

488
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
And the other person's like, how rude.

489
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
It's like, well, hold on.

490
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
It's like you stabbed him, and he said,

491
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
well, I guess I'll just bleed to death.

492
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
And you're like, jerk.

493
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
I love that those two things

494
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
are equivalent in Travis's mind.

495
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Not exactly the same, but they're close.

496
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Is it, do you, if you are a guest at someone's home

497
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
and they serve you pizza

498
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,360
that they have either purchased or prepared,

499
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
and you do the thing with the napkin

500
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
where you blot up all the grease off the pizza.

501
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
So rude.

502
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
That's rude, right?

503
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I remember the first time I saw someone do this

504
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
and I loudly announced that they had ruined pizza forever

505
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
for everyone.

506
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Yeah.

507
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
But eventually, every once in a while, you got to.

508
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
It's not dirt.

509
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
It's not dirt.

510
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
It's oil that the pizza sweated out

511
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360
when it got cooked like that.

512
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Do you think it's rude if I went to a party

513
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
and someone's serving pizza,

514
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
and I folded it in half,

515
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
and then folded it in half again.

516
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
So I had like one big triangle.

517
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
And you kept doing that until it disappeared?

518
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Yeah.

519
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Is that rude?

520
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Yeah.

521
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Is that rude?

522
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Yeah, cause some people would, I get it.

523
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
It was an amazing trick.

524
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I've never seen anything like it in my life,

525
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
but there are people who want to eat it.

526
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
But see, but then here's the thing.

527
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,360
The prestige is later they drive home

528
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,360
and they go to get their nightgown out of their drawers.

529
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
They open their drawer.

530
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,360
There's the whole pizza sitting there with nary a crease.

531
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
That's good.

532
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
That's the, now is it still rude?

533
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
No, now it's cool.

534
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
There you go.

535
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,360
This is obviously a profoundly bad thing to do.

536
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I think that you have maybe a misunderstanding

537
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,360
of the sort of host-guest relationship.

538
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Yes.

539
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,360
If I prepare dinner for you when you come to my house,

540
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,360
you need to eat it even if it is nasty, muddy, shitty garbage.

541
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Do you know what I mean?

542
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Yeah.

543
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
And you don't get to complain about it.

544
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
You're supposed to, you do eat it.

545
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I want to make you feel comfortable in my home,

546
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
but I will not accept any notes or criticism

547
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
about how I decide to go about doing that.

548
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Now, hold on, now I am confused

549
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
because I thought the question asker went to someone else's home.

550
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Yes.

551
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Took all the pepperoni off of the pizza

552
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
and applied it to one slice.

553
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,360
And then the homeowner, the host, said,

554
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
I guess I'll just eat cheese pizza.

555
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,360
So, but that is the thing of like,

556
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
how far does the host need to go to please the guest?

557
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,360
If I'm the guest and I'm like, your TV's nicer than mine,

558
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,360
I'm going to take it.

559
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Fair.

560
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Because I want you to be a good host and I'm the guest.

561
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
And this is my plasma now.

562
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
You can't take your host's plasma though.

563
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
No, they need that.

564
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
They need that to live.

565
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Well, no, you put that in a centrifuge

566
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,360
and you can just fill it with saline and put that back in.

567
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah.

568
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Travis is a doctor, so.

569
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Yep.

570
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
I think for me-

571
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,360
I needed beer money a couple of times at college

572
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
and here we are.

573
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
But okay, what if I, as the guest, say,

574
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
I'm not that hungry, I'm just going to have one slice,

575
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,360
but also, and then I throw the rest of the pizza

576
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
in the garbage because I'm like,

577
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
but I don't want you to have any either.

578
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,360
And as the guest, what I say goes.

579
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
That's gonna be cool.

580
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,360
You could pull out a big, stinky, dirty, old bag

581
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
of your own pepperoni from like your jacket pocket

582
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,360
and like open it up and be like,

583
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,360
oh, I was gonna load up my slices with this sweet red meat.

584
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
God, I love this stuff so much,

585
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,360
but oh, smell this bag of pepperoni I brought.

586
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
That's not good anymore.

587
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,360
But fuck, I do need to eat a lot of pepperoni today.

588
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,360
My doctor said, oh well, I guess I'll start shuffle,

589
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
shuffle up and deal.

590
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Oh, smell this meat.

591
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Oh my God, no.

592
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
If only there was some other way.

593
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Do you want to just take the rest of the pepperoni

594
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
off the pizza?

595
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
I mean, it is for medicine, so.

596
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I mean, I would hate for you to die.

597
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Yeah, I will, and I will.

598
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,360
I guess I'll just have cheese pizza.

599
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Let me go rinse off my stinky bag of pepperoni in the sink

600
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,360
and see if that, nope, it's not helping.

601
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,360
It still smells bad.

602
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Announcement, I have a new segment for the show.

603
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Oh.

604
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no.

605
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:03,360
This is the tick tock, tick tock, the don't, tick tock,

606
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
come on, there's something there, come on.

607
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Tick tock o'clock, tick tock o'clock.

608
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Okay, there we go.

609
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
Sucks.

610
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
I know it's there.

611
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Tick tock o'clock.

612
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,360
Weirdly, for no reason that I can discern,

613
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,360
clips of our show have become popular on the social video

614
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,360
sharing app, Tick tock, which I describe like that

615
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,360
because I am 39 years old.

616
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I don't know how to find these videos.

617
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
I have to be shown them.

618
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
This is a way that other grownups can see these,

619
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,360
is have your sister-in-law Riley show you.

620
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Yep.

621
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,360
And she will show you the tick tocks if you want to see them,

622
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,360
but these clips of our show, illegally, but that's fine.

623
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,360
And I want to, here's what I wanted to do.

624
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,360
They take our sound and then they put new video to them

625
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,360
and help craft a tapestry.

626
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,360
And they have had to make do with what we've already done.

627
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Yeah.

628
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Unintentionally, for not that.

629
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
For not that.

630
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,360
So what Tick tock o'clock is about

631
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
is we are going to be creating some sounds

632
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,360
that they can then repurpose into like a cogent narrative.

633
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Some bespoke tick tock content.

634
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
The rules are this.

635
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,360
One of us will begin, the other two must answer.

636
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
It can either relate or not relate,

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
but it's just three lines

638
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
because we got to keep the tick tock snappy.

639
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
I think they can only be like eight or nine seconds.

640
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Like, I think they can be like a minute.

641
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I've seen some pretty long ones.

642
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,360
Are we trying to create a narrative?

643
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
It's not incumbent on us to create a narrative.

644
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Okay, great, great, great.

645
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
Okay.

646
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Justin, you begin and I'll respond

647
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
and then Griffin can finish up.

648
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Okay.

649
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Hey guys, I got a brand new Wendy's life hack for you.

650
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Wait till you see this, you're going to lose your mind.

651
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
I'm sorry, I can't.

652
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Has anyone seen my pants?

653
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,360
A spaghetti for sale?

654
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
See, that's a good tick tock.

655
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Yeah?

656
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
That's funny to me.

657
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
That's a good tick tock.

658
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Okay, Griffin, you start one.

659
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Okay.

660
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,360
It can be like, hey everybody,

661
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
I have a hot new makeup tutorial for you.

662
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
It goes something like this.

663
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
Oh, Travis and I should have discussed.

664
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Oh yeah, I just assumed you'd go next.

665
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Okay, okay.

666
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Give it to me again, give it to me again.

667
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Hey everybody, I have a hot new makeup tutorial.

668
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
I think you're just going to love it.

669
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
First you eat the sponge and then...

670
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
No, hold on, because teens are going to eat the sponges, Justin.

671
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Don't eat the...

672
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
And I need a little bit more than that, Justin.

673
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Yeah, you're right, Travis.

674
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
You're right, Travis.

675
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I'm so sorry, Griffin, give it to me one more time.

676
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Hey everybody, here comes a hot new makeup tutorial for you.

677
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
First you don't eat the sponge and then you wait.

678
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Anyways, here's some Walking Dead spoilers.

679
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,360
I think we could do one more.

680
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Yeah?

681
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Trav, you can kind of start at tapestry.

682
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Okay.

683
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
And then we'll weave it,

684
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
so it'll be more TikTok appropriate.

685
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Oh, okay.

686
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,360
Hey, you guys need to get ready or we're going to be late

687
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,360
for Derek's birthday party at Mickey D's.

688
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,360
I don't have a strapless dress, so I'm going to cut up my socks.

689
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Spaghetti for sale.

690
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Spaghetti strapless dress, you mean?

691
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
These dogs are barking.

692
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Shit, fuck, we talked all over each other.

693
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
We really fucked that one up, guys.

694
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
That's going to be a good one though.

695
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
So any one of those you want to use TikTokers,

696
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
God, I hope you call yourselves that.

697
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
No.

698
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
Fuck.

699
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
I think it's TikTokists.

700
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
TikTok.

701
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,360
That's been TikTok o'clock.

702
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,360
How about another question?

703
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Yes.

704
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Is that the way to go?

705
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Yes.

706
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,360
I opened my mail to find a birthday card from my Grammy Kern.

707
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
It was very sweet.

708
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,360
She included a check written out to me for $100.

709
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Holy shit.

710
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
There is one problem though.

711
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
I have no idea who Grammy Kern is,

712
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
and my birthday is not in April.

713
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Huh.

714
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Both?

715
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
What?

716
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Whoa.

717
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Both the card and the check have my correct name

718
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
and address on it.

719
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,360
I've tried to find Grammy Kern on Facebook,

720
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
but had no such luck.

721
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
What should I do here?

722
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Would it be wrong to attempt to cash the check,

723
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
or do I throw it away?

724
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,360
$100 would be really nice in these trying times,

725
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
but is it the right thing to do?

726
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Please help vexed in Virginia.

727
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
Fuck.

728
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
It is made out to you.

729
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
That's a doozy though.

730
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
It's got your correct name and address on it.

731
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,360
So the only logical thing, this person knows who you are,

732
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
even if you don't know who they are.

733
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
So they have decided to give you $100

734
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,360
knowing who you are and where you live.

735
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
I think you're good.

736
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Oh, but there's a risk here

737
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,360
that this is some kind of strange social contract kind of catfish

738
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
where you accept the $100,

739
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
and then they roll up and like,

740
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,360
hey, I need to stay with you for like a week

741
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
while my place gets renovated.

742
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
And you're like, well, you can't.

743
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Whoa, you didn't seem to think you didn't know me

744
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
when you cashed my $100 check.

745
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Ooh, that's a legitimate concern.

746
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,360
See, I was going to say there was a worry

747
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,360
that maybe your name is like Dylan Smith or something,

748
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
and she just like Googled Dylan Smith

749
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
and somebody had fully, fully doxxed you,

750
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,360
and she just wrote a check to the first Dylan Smith

751
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
she found at Google.

752
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
I mean, I guess that's possible,

753
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,360
but I'm going to go more with the weird catfishing thing

754
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
of just needing a place to stay for a week.

755
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
It does feel that way, right?

756
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Like if you cash it, then they get your like,

757
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
I don't know what information,

758
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
like how eager you were to cash it,

759
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
and they can use that to start to build a profile.

760
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Well, this feels a little bit like, you know,

761
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,360
if you push this button, I'll give you a million dollars,

762
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
but someone somewhere will die.

763
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Someone on ours will die, and it will be Grammy Kern.

764
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
And it'll be Grammy Kern.

765
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Cash this check, that's $103,

766
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,360
but just you will have to pay for it in some form

767
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,360
or function down the line, and the juice is running.

768
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
I do need to know more about what the birthday card said,

769
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
because if they were more pertinent,

770
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,360
and it could be something like Dear Vex in Virginia

771
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,360
with red hair and the shirt that has an elephant on it,

772
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
and they are describing the shirt you wear every day

773
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
that has an elephant on it, I guess,

774
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
because this is like Doug, and you wear the same outfit

775
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,360
every day.

776
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
But you have Auburn hair, and you're like, hmm.

777
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Ah, fuck.

778
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Could this be me?

779
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Or what if it said inside, like, from Grammy Kern,

780
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I wish you were my grandkid, because my real grandkid sucks.

781
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Every year, I choose someone at random to send $100 to

782
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,360
instead of my grandkid who I do not like.

783
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Who sucks this year to see you.

784
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Congratulations.

785
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
You send a card to the grandkid, and it's like,

786
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
I did it again. Sorry.

787
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Ah!

788
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,360
I need you to spend this on Beyblades

789
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
and send pictures of yourself with your Beyblades

790
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
to my dipshit grandson Dylan.

791
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Here's his Instagram handle.

792
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Really tear him the fuck up.

793
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Throw the Beyblades in the garbage can

794
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
and make him watch.

795
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Love, Grammy Kern.

796
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Let's take a break and head on into the Money Zone

797
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
so we can buy Beyblades.

798
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Hey, Justin and Griffin.

799
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Yep.

800
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
Do you like to be entertained?

801
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Yeah, bud.

802
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Yeah, you do.

803
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
Then I bet you like Audible.

804
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Audible has so much to offer you.

805
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
You gotta stop gyrating your hips

806
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
while you're talking about this, Travis.

807
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
I can't, buddy.

808
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
The way you're doing it.

809
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
We got some free time nowadays

810
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,360
as we're spending a lot more time safely indoors,

811
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,360
and it's time that you were entertained.

812
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
The hip gyration, Travis.

813
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
I'm begging you, bud.

814
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
I'm begging you, bud.

815
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,360
Please sit down in a chair if you have to.

816
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Oh, I'm doing it in a chair over.

817
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Not backwards.

818
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Audible is the leading provider

819
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,360
of spoken word entertainment and audio books,

820
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Audible Originals, Daily News Digest,

821
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,360
and soothing audio experiences.

822
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
You're sweating so much.

823
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Like, how are you doing that?

824
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Like, you're making the sweat come out fast.

825
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
Oh, yeah.

826
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Audible is entertaining.

827
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Can I tell you?

828
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Okay, listen.

829
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,360
All gyrating aside, there is a really, really wonderful-

830
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,360
It's my favorite NPR show every Sunday morning.

831
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
All gyrations considered.

832
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
I put my feet up.

833
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,360
There is a wonderful kind of, I guess, series.

834
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,360
It's like a podcast series on Audible

835
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
that is narrated by Stephen Fry,

836
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
and it's called Victorian Secrets,

837
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,360
and it's all about the seedy underbelly

838
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,360
of the Victorian era, and it is so good,

839
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
and it's got this amazing sound design,

840
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,360
and there's actors playing Victorian-era people.

841
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,360
It is wonderful.

842
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
Badass.

843
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Yeah, Teresa and I could not stop listening to it,

844
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,360
and listen, I've been a big fan of audio books forever,

845
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,360
and so I've been an Audible subscriber for as long as I can remember,

846
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
but there's so much more than audio books, you know?

847
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
They've got podcasts, news, all kinds of things there,

848
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
so if you haven't checked out Audible in a while,

849
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
you have to go.

850
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Go to audible.com slash brother,

851
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,360
or text brother to 500500.

852
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,360
That's audible.com slash brother.

853
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Me and Andy's back again,

854
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
and they have the softest dang underwear and other stuff

855
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
in the whole wide world.

856
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
They are softer than soft.

857
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
They are sustainable, these underpants,

858
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,360
and they do have fun prints with unicorns, mermaids,

859
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,360
cool colors, dots and stripes, all kinds of great stuff.

860
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm wearing some right now.

861
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
These ones have little peace signs on them,

862
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
but they're a bunch of different colors, and I love that.

863
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,360
They also got a monthly subscription membership service

864
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
that will send you new pairs right to your house

865
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,360
or apartment or whatever,

866
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,360
and you can have just a whole underwear drawer full of fun,

867
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,360
and you also get some site-wide savings

868
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
and exclusive sales with this here membership.

869
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,360
They also have matching pairs if you have a love or a friend

870
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,360
who you want to maybe step over some boundaries with,

871
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,360
and you can share the same underwear designs with them.

872
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,360
You can get a range of sizes from extra small to 4XL,

873
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,360
and I cannot vouch for these underwear and other things enough.

874
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
You can get 15% off your first order, free shipping,

875
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

876
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,360
by going to meundies.com slash my brother, all one word.

877
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

878
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Hey, I'm Mallory O'Mara, a weird fiction reader

879
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,360
who enjoys whiskey and owns a book weight.

880
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
And I'm Bria Grant, a science fiction reader

881
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,360
who likes iced tea and reads to escape the world.

882
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
And we host Reading Glasses, a weekly show

883
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,360
that dives into reading suggestions, goals, complaints,

884
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
and the really important questions,

885
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
like what are the best reading snacks?

886
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
And seriously, Mallory, what is a book weight for?

887
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Every week, we talk about reading.

888
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
It's not a book club.

889
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,360
You're not going to have to listen to us review a book you haven't read.

890
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
You just have to be excited about books, authors,

891
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
the bookish community, writing, and talking about reading.

892
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
We can literally talk about reading, like, all day long.

893
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Reading Glasses.

894
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Every Thursday on MaximumFun.org.

895
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Glasses.

896
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,360
I thought about doing that.

897
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Let's see here.

898
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
I got another question.

899
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
I recently decided to get good at roller skating

900
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,360
after 19 years of clinging to the walls at the rink.

901
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
One of the things that has helped me so much

902
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
has been instructional videos online.

903
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
A lot of these videos take place in the skate park

904
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,360
and show really cool tricks on ramps and bowls and stuff.

905
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,360
It has inspired me to eventually try and skate at the park.

906
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,360
However, when I've gone to check out the skate parks in my area,

907
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,360
there are usually a few or many skateboarders there.

908
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm scared I'll be made fun of for roller skating there

909
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
instead of skateboarding.

910
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
How do I intimidate the skateboarders

911
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,360
and take my rightful place as alpha of the park

912
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
so I don't get made fun of?

913
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,360
That's from Scared of Skaters in Tennessee.

914
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
You know, can I be honest with you guys?

915
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I don't know that we're equipped to answer this question,

916
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,360
but when I think of skateboarders and skate parks,

917
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
you know who I think of?

918
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Who, Travis?

919
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Hank Green.

920
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Yeah.

921
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Oh, he's a lifelong grinder.

922
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Yeah, they call him Hank Shredder Green.

923
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Hank Shredder Green.

924
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
I bet if you think on that for 30 seconds

925
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
while I'm talking about other things,

926
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
you'll come up with something better.

927
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
I'll give you a little breathing room,

928
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
and I'll give Hank on-

929
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Grindr Green?

930
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
That's nothing.

931
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
I'm gonna give him a-

932
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
That's not it.

933
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Green-der.

934
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Tony Hank.

935
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:03,360
That was it, we found it, it was Tony Hank.

936
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
It's ringing.

937
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Hello!

938
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
Shit, it went to voicemail.

939
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Hello, no, it's me.

940
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,360
No, it's still part of the voicemail.

941
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
This is still part of the trick.

942
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
Let me call him again.

943
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Oh, I fooled you, it was just voicemail the whole time.

944
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
I knew it.

945
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Okay, I'm hanging up, I'm trying again.

946
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
I'll do a speed redial.

947
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Hi there, brothers.

948
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
It's me, Hank Green.

949
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
It's me, Hank Green.

950
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Hank, were you screaming your calls?

951
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
You didn't take-

952
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Well, you're not in my phone bank,

953
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
whatever they call that.

954
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Oh.

955
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,360
I think they called the Hank Bank.

956
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Yep.

957
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
That's right.

958
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Hey, I don't wanna distract you

959
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,360
because I know that a beautifully foolish endeavor,

960
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
your new book comes out July 7th,

961
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,360
and I'm sure you're geared up to make the rounds

962
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,360
on Maury and all the other talk shows,

963
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
but if I could, can I bother you for a second?

964
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Yeah, sure, hit me.

965
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,360
We have a listener who is into skating,

966
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,360
like roller skating, and they wanna go to a skate park,

967
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,360
but they're afraid of getting sort of intimidated

968
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
by skateboarders.

969
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
By the skateboarders.

970
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
And we know that you're a pretty,

971
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
you're like a grindy crust punk.

972
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Yeah.

973
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
And we were hoping that you could-

974
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Hank Grinder Green.

975
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Me?

976
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Tony Hank.

977
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
See, okay.

978
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
I think it's better.

979
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Yeah.

980
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Still.

981
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Yeah, and obviously my new book,

982
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor,

983
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,360
is about skating of various kinds.

984
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Oh, yeah.

985
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Having wheels under your feet of all sorts.

986
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,360
It's kind of a spiritual successor to Gleaming the Cube

987
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
from what I understand.

988
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
I don't know what that is.

989
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
It's a skate movie, okay.

990
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Now, Hank, can I ask, within your book,

991
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,360
is the foolish endeavor deciding to get good at skating

992
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,360
after 19 years of not being good at skating?

993
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
Yeah.

994
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Because that, for me-

995
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
It does generally end in broken elbows.

996
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm not sure-

997
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Yes.

998
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Why this is the thing.

999
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
It's back, though.

1000
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
It's definitely back.

1001
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
I've seen it.

1002
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,360
I've seen the youth are roller skating again,

1003
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
and they look very cool.

1004
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
I will say that.

1005
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Oh, sure.

1006
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Yeah.

1007
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Of course the youth are.

1008
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,360
I have become only more brittle and awkward as I have aged.

1009
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,360
I don't look at my adult body now and think,

1010
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,360
this could take falling down a bunch.

1011
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
You guys know that I'm actually a pretty good,

1012
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
I actually am a fairly good roller blader,

1013
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,360
but I feel like it's deeply uncool to be a roller blader right now.

1014
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
I used to play roller hockey in Florida,

1015
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
so I would put wheels on my feet,

1016
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
and I would run fast into other boys,

1017
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,360
and that was my recreation.

1018
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
I feel like there's,

1019
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
and maybe Hank, you can inform us of this,

1020
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
but I feel like there's an amount of time

1021
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
where if you don't put wheels on your feet,

1022
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
you should never do it again.

1023
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,360
I don't know if it's days, weeks, months, years,

1024
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
but I definitely feel like there is a window

1025
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
where one morning you wake up and you think,

1026
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,360
if I put wheels on my feet today, I will die.

1027
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,360
It's like the opposite of the saying about riding a bike.

1028
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,360
It's like once you learn to ride a bike, you never forget.

1029
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,360
But if you go more than 36 hours without wheels on your feet,

1030
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
give it up.

1031
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
It's short.

1032
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
It ain't long.

1033
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,360
You're sitting here thinking like, oh, what is it,

1034
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
like 10 years without wheels on your feet?

1035
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
No, bud.

1036
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,360
I'm thinking it's probably about, I would say two months.

1037
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
It's two months.

1038
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
That's so gracious.

1039
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
More than that for me.

1040
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
We're getting really close to one of my chief shames here,

1041
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
and I didn't expect this to happen,

1042
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,360
but it is that I bought a pair of Heelys as an adult man.

1043
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
I think I was probably in my 30s.

1044
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
Hank?

1045
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Hank?

1046
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Hank?

1047
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
Hank?

1048
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Hank?

1049
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Hank?

1050
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Hank?

1051
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Hank?

1052
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
Hank?

1053
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Hank?

1054
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,360
Hank?

1055
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Hank?

1056
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Hank?

1057
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Hank?

1058
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Hank?

1059
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
Hank?

1060
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Hank?

1061
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
Hank?

1062
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Hank?

1063
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Hank?

1064
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I wager that I was early 30s.

1065
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Even that, though, Hank, are we talking 33?

1066
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
Because that's Jesus' age, Hank.

1067
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Could have been 33.

1068
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
OK.

1069
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Oh, boy.

1070
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Probably it may have been 34.

1071
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,360
This is the rest of this, I'm sorry, Hank.

1072
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
I'm sure you wanted to talk about your book and everything,

1073
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
but the rest of this segment is about the thing you just said.

1074
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Well, no, unfortunately I need to know why you decided

1075
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
buying Heelys was cool.

1076
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Oh my god, I actually have the solution that,

1077
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
thank you to Hank Green.

1078
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,200
a Hank Green, this is the play, right?

1079
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,200
You show up in your roller skates ready to shred.

1080
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,560
You have a friend, let's say a Hank Green type,

1081
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,600
show up on the same day wearing Heelys.

1082
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,280
And then you start bullying it as soon as they show up,

1083
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,240
you're like, hey, get a load of this guy.

1084
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,640
Yeah.

1085
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,800
Hey, fellow skaters, get a load of this guy in the Heelys.

1086
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,160
Can you believe this?

1087
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,720
Now, I will say, you run the risk with that plan, Justin.

1088
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,000
Then you start doing that and all the skateboarders

1089
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,200
are like, hey, bullying's not cool.

1090
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
I think everyone should be allowed

1091
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,360
to wheel however they want.

1092
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,820
And then the Hank Green type is welcomed

1093
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,400
into the skateboarder circle

1094
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,700
and you're kind of shunned for being a bully.

1095
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,040
You do it opposite where I show up in my Heelys

1096
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,280
and then I start bullying you, like lastly,

1097
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,760
when you show up in your roller skates

1098
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,420
and then all the people at the skate park are like,

1099
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,440
that's not cool, man.

1100
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,440
And then I have to like slunk off into the darkness.

1101
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,800
Well, roll off.

1102
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,520
Well, I never got that good at it.

1103
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,160
So I probably would just walk into the darkness

1104
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,640
and then you are forever in the good graces

1105
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,900
of the skateboarders.

1106
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,280
Yeah.

1107
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,600
Hank and John have built a business around DFTBA,

1108
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,420
don't forget to bully always.

1109
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,420
And then he's just riding the company line right now.

1110
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,040
Another great option, Hank,

1111
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,320
I know you have some clout in Hollywood.

1112
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,320
You could just make sure that,

1113
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,840
and you're doing this as a favor to this question asker,

1114
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,600
you could get Greenlit a revival.

1115
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,280
That's what they call it when one of Hank's projects

1116
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
is approved.

1117
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,240
Sorry, industry slang.

1118
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,440
Get Greenlit a revival of Disney's Brink

1119
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,580
starring Eric Von Detten.

1120
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,520
And you gotta get Eric Von Detten who I just Googled.

1121
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
He is currently working

1122
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,980
at a precious metals asset management firm.

1123
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,880
So he is out of the business of movie making

1124
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,720
and has been for a bit,

1125
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,400
but I bet, I mean, it's just like falling off a log.

1126
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,720
No, wait, hold on, I'm thinking about it.

1127
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,000
If he's been working in precious metals for this long,

1128
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,980
he probably hasn't had wheels on his feet for-

1129
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,160
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't know that.

1130
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,160
I bet he straps wheels on his feet every day.

1131
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,080
Hank just stays fresh for a Brink, too.

1132
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,040
Can I say something to you, Hank?

1133
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,800
And this is a little too judgy

1134
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,040
and I wanna get your thoughts on it

1135
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,460
because I feel like we talk too much.

1136
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,520
But like, we've been in kind of a weird,

1137
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,760
I don't know if you heard about the virus and stuff,

1138
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,120
but it's been like,

1139
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,280
everybody's been kind of quarantined for a while.

1140
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,800
Can I say, I'm worried that if you have not

1141
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,720
taken this opportunity to get good at the Heelys,

1142
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,560
it probably is not gonna happen.

1143
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,140
Well, here's what happened. Does that feel like fair?

1144
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,800
Here's what happened is at one day I thought,

1145
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
where are my Heelys?

1146
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,320
And they weren't in my house anymore.

1147
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,720
And so this is why you get married.

1148
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,760
This is the whole reason.

1149
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,760
This is the purpose is so that your,

1150
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,640
so the person you love can think,

1151
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,480
this is something that they are not proud of

1152
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,120
and I can just make it go away.

1153
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,480
And I don't know where those Heelys went,

1154
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,960
but I do no longer own them.

1155
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,920
They're on me.

1156
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,120
I'm wearing them right now.

1157
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm going all around the office.

1158
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,040
I look cool as heck.

1159
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,920
I bet you do.

1160
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,720
I feel like we fixed this.

1161
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,660
Hank, tell us about your book.

1162
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,360
And then like in a sexy way,

1163
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,840
like that lets people know why they should

1164
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,960
absolutely get it.

1165
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,800
Adventure.

1166
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,460
It's about adventure.

1167
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,360
It's about the things that happen

1168
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,720
when you get famous on the internet.

1169
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,040
It's also about the platforms that control us

1170
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,680
and how ridiculously powerful they are

1171
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,700
and how much of our brains they take up

1172
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,480
and what they might look like in the future.

1173
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,840
It's a science fiction adventure story

1174
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,640
about young people trying to make their way in the world.

1175
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,560
Wow.

1176
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,960
Does it have cool fights?

1177
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,880
It does have cool fights.

1178
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,820
The second one has a lot of cool fights, actually.

1179
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,660
It was really fun.

1180
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,500
Fuck yeah.

1181
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,760
What's the first one called

1182
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,360
in case we only want to catch up?

1183
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,200
Yeah.

1184
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,020
The first cool fight.

1185
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,860
What did you call the first cool fight?

1186
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,680
Is it like swords?

1187
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,520
Swords versus knives.

1188
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,640
The battle of lower sword Phil.

1189
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,860
There are giant robots.

1190
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,960
I think people might be into that.

1191
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,300
And there's mostly punching.

1192
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,640
And the first one's called

1193
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,860
An Absolutely Remarkable Thing.

1194
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,200
And it's available cheap on audio

1195
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,160
if you want to go that route and catch up real quick.

1196
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,600
Did you read it?

1197
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,440
I did not.

1198
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,520
It's from the perspective of,

1199
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,440
the story is like a memoir of a 23 year old woman.

1200
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,520
So it would be weird if I read it.

1201
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,760
Hank, one last question about your book.

1202
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,300
Did you come up with some kind of cool futuristic

1203
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,140
like substitute for money?

1204
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,980
Yeah.

1205
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,800
What are they called?

1206
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,640
Creds?

1207
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,460
Zerks?

1208
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,300
Cyberchips?

1209
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,140
Zinni?

1210
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,160
The problem is that yes.

1211
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,320
Yeah.

1212
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,160
God dang it.

1213
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,500
That makes it sound bad.

1214
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,460
Well, no, not bad.

1215
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,760
It's just my favorite thing

1216
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,080
about writing any kind of sci-fi or fantasy

1217
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,840
is having to at some point sit down

1218
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,200
and think, what am I going to call money?

1219
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,520
Because I can't just call it money.

1220
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,560
Well, there's money.

1221
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,240
There's still regular money,

1222
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,660
but then there is in the second book,

1223
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,760
it's kind of an important plot point

1224
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,040
that a new currency does get developed

1225
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,880
and starts to take on some credibility.

1226
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,840
Is it Bitcoin?

1227
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,720
So you didn't just make up a future currency.

1228
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,160
You wrote, Travis got it like right to the quick.

1229
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,960
You wrote the whole book about new cyber money.

1230
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,800
Right.

1231
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,600
And I've also, I'm launching the cyber money

1232
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,240
on Tuesday, and you can get in on the ground floor.

1233
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Get yourself some Hank Green.

1234
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,080
Wuffa doofa.

1235
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,020
I'm leaving.

1236
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,320
Yes, thank you, Hank.

1237
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,160
Thanks, Hank.

1238
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,980
Bye.

1239
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,820
Thanks for the help.

1240
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,640
I can't stay any longer.

1241
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,100
Grind off, grind off into the sunset.

1242
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,940
Reee!

1243
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,200
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

1244
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,740
Choo-loo-lee-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo-loo.

1245
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,900
I want a munch.

1246
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,740
Squat!

1247
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,560
Squat.

1248
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,680
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

1249
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,540
I want too much.

1250
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,840
Squat.

1251
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,340
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

1252
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,220
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1253
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,240
It's a podcast within a podcast

1254
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,940
about the latest and greatest brand eating.

1255
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,280
I have some current Munch,

1256
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,600
don't have to dig back into the nooks

1257
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,160
and crannies of history courtesy of Mark.

1258
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,280
And here's the headline, folks.

1259
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,880
The rumors are true.

1260
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,440
Baskin Robbins and Bud Light Seltzer pairings

1261
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,680
are the summer drinks you never knew you needed.

1262
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,520
Ew!

1263
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,080
There was so much information in that sentence

1264
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,880
that I did not know and it all sucked.

1265
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,840
31 flavors and Bud Light Seltzer pairings

1266
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,520
are the summer drinks you never knew you needed.

1267
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,280
Whether your idea of the perfect summer refreshment

1268
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,360
comes in a scoop or a skinny can,

1269
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,880
no matter which flavor of pervert you are,

1270
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,360
we've got you covered.

1271
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,500
We got an idea that'll take your summer plans up a notch.

1272
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,520
We've partnered with Bud Light

1273
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,680
to dream up delectable hard seltzer

1274
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,200
and Baskin Robbins pairings for you to sip on

1275
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,140
all summer long.

1276
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,400
And then this is where it goes next.

1277
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,220
Hard seltzers are crisp, refreshingly bubbly beverages

1278
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,600
that have gained immense popularity,

1279
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,700
especially since big name brewer Bud Light

1280
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,800
entered the game earlier this year.

1281
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,560
They're so incredibly popular

1282
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,100
that we're using the second paragraph

1283
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,760
to tell you what they are.

1284
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,800
And more than that,

1285
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,280
really kind of seems like a flagrant lie

1286
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,000
to say that they became popular once Bud entered the game.

1287
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Especially since big name brewer Bud Light

1288
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,840
entered the game earlier this year with four flavors,

1289
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,320
including lemon lime, strawberry, black cherry, and mango.

1290
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,760
If you've tried all the flavors

1291
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,840
and are looking for a new way to liven up your seltzer,

1292
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,280
because who isn't,

1293
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,280
we've got four tasty ways to do just that.

1294
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,200
Bud Light seltzer features natural carbonation

1295
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,180
and quality ingredients like sparkling water,

1296
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,120
real cane sugar, and natural fruit flavors.

1297
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,400
That's right, Bud Light seltzer is the perfect drink

1298
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,400
for you health nuts out there looking to eat clean.

1299
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,440
Bud Light seltzer.

1300
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,480
It's the perfect canvas for an adult ice cream float.

1301
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,800
Okay, so they've been kind of dancing around.

1302
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,080
They've been hinting at like the thesis statement

1303
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,040
of this press release, and there you have it.

1304
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,460
Put some ice cream in your seltzer.

1305
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,320
Hey, we're Baskin Robbins, and we wanna get you fucked up.

1306
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,560
It says, scoop a healthy spoonful

1307
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,520
of the Baskin Robbins flavor and drop it into your glass

1308
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,600
or blend the two together for a fruity, freezing cocktail.

1309
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,600
Folks, before you heard this press release,

1310
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,840
if you went to a friend's house and you said,

1311
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,040
what are you drinking?

1312
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,920
And they said, I dumped some Baskin Robbins

1313
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,720
into a Bud Light seltzer,

1314
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,800
you would call the police.

1315
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,320
You would have them put on some sort of watch

1316
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,200
to make sure that they did not destroy themselves

1317
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,280
because this is a desperate person.

1318
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,960
But now that you've seen this press release,

1319
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,760
it's a fun summer trend, I guess.

1320
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,240
Can I say that the most troubling thing about that,

1321
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,040
if a friend or former friend of mine had done this,

1322
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,240
is the forethought that it would take

1323
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,120
to be able to engage in this beverage?

1324
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,320
Because I don't know that you can buy pints

1325
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,480
of Baskin Robbins.

1326
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,000
I think you have to go to the store to get it,

1327
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,680
at which point you would sit there and think,

1328
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,960
well, I've got the Bud Seltzer mango in the fridge,

1329
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,180
so I'm gonna go on a 40-minute round trip

1330
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,640
to go grab some BR to really complete the picture.

1331
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,600
Clarify for me, Justin.

1332
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,200
Are they making these in-house at Baskin Robbins?

1333
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,480
Is this a press release saying, hey, we thought, hey.

1334
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,240
One thing you could do when you go home

1335
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,760
is get some Bud Light Seltzer and dump this ice cream into it.

1336
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,860
That's fucking wild.

1337
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,040
Do you think?

1338
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,880
That's wild, no, it's absolute madness,

1339
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,720
especially considering I wanna get fucked up,

1340
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,760
but I wanna do it really slowly

1341
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,280
because I melted a slurry of ice cream into it

1342
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,000
and I want it to be like half butter.

1343
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,440
It's the ideal drink, delicious, thank you.

1344
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
But this isn't, maybe the Seltzer is good,

1345
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,200
but you know what would bring it home?

1346
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,560
Some melty milk in it.

1347
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,360
They don't do this with other shit.

1348
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,320
Baskin Robbins has never put out a press release before

1349
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,900
that's like, do you like our Rocky Road ice cream?

1350
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,600
You should take it home and put Nutella on it.

1351
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,040
You're welcome, we love you.

1352
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,080
Baskin Robbins, don't forget.

1353
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,560
From three days before this press release came out,

1354
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,980
June 26th, stay cool this summer

1355
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,640
with cotton candy crackle drink recipes from Baskin Robbins.

1356
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,840
First up, the cotton candy crackle pina colada.

1357
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,000
It's gonna start with two and a half ounces of white rum,

1358
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,620
two ounces of pina colada mix,

1359
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,760
one four ounce scoop of cotton candy crackle ice cream,

1360
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,960
a cup of ice, and then you make it in a blender

1361
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,080
and then you drink it

1362
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,440
because Baskin Robbins is done fucking around.

1363
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,640
We're done.

1364
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,900
They know you wanna get fucked up.

1365
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,360
This situation that we're all in

1366
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,640
will not be fixed by ice cream,

1367
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,400
but maybe if you put some rum in it,

1368
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,840
maybe that would be enough to create a bomb.

1369
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,720
We know your kid just had a big softball game,

1370
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,440
so you're looking to get him a treat,

1371
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,520
but also your boss has really been riding you at the office.

1372
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,240
Don't you worry, Baskin Robbins has you covered on

1373
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,160
both fronts, friends.

1374
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,080
TCBY already beat us, we're fucking done.

1375
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,240
Take a fucking sit, babes.

1376
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,400
It's over.

1377
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,280
Try Baskin Robbins toffee crunch

1378
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,480
with a big heap and a spoonful of cocaine.

1379
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,880
I think that the last step of this

1380
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,720
pina colada, cotton candy crackle pina colada recipe

1381
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,280
is pour into a hurricane glass

1382
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,120
and garnish with a colorful straw.

1383
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,880
Hey, newsflash, if you're the sort of person

1384
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,040
that's gonna mix up a fucking cotton candy cocktail,

1385
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,360
you are not taking the time

1386
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,740
to select appropriate glassware.

1387
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,880
Yeah, it's whatever fucking container that will hold it,

1388
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,480
including my mouth and body.

1389
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,860
I gotta gram this.

1390
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,580
Yeah, I gotta gram my defeat.

1391
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,320
Hey, everybody, the influencer Travis here, I've given up.

1392
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,720
Everybody, I'm chronicling my descent.

1393
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,360
Here's the first of you guys in November.

1394
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,280
Hey, it's Baskin Robbins, we've got a great recipe

1395
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,680
for you, pick up our new cotton candy flavored ice cream,

1396
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,760
go grab yourself a King Cobra malt liquor

1397
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,440
from the gas station nearby, and oh, what's that?

1398
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,960
You don't have the ice cream?

1399
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,960
That's fine still.

1400
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,880
No bowl, just swish them around in your mouth.

1401
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,920
It'll be great, it'll be so great.

1402
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,800
This one, this one, okay.

1403
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,720
This one is a cotton candy crackle mermaid float, okay?

1404
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,720
So this is eight ounces of lemon lime soda chilled.

1405
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,760
Okay, so eight ounces of Sprite,

1406
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,680
one ounce of whipped cream vodka.

1407
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,520
Oh, boy.

1408
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,520
And a half ounce of blue curacao,

1409
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,920
and 2.5 ounce scoop of cotton candy crackle ice cream.

1410
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,040
I did not need a measurement on that, thank you.

1411
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
Just a scoop, I have a question.

1412
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,400
Eight ounces of Sprite and one ounce of vodka?

1413
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,880
What is that supposed to do for me, a man?

1414
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,720
I'm a 39-year-old man, what do you want me to do

1415
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,120
with eight ounces of Sprite mixed with an ounce of vodka?

1416
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,320
It does kind of make it seem like

1417
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,560
whoever the watchdogs were who got upset

1418
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,760
about Joe Camel seemingly appealing to children

1419
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,520
are probably like, hey, red flag on this one, too?

1420
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,160
You're making cocktails for kids.

1421
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,520
This is a cocktail for teens, sorry, pal.

1422
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,240
Hey, is your dad out of town this weekend?

1423
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,080
Yeah, right, this is the perfect thing.

1424
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,800
It's blue and has ice cream floating in it.

1425
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,800
But thank you, Baskin Robbins,

1426
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,720
for giving us what we need as a nation.

1427
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,800
There is a Baskin Robbins near me, so, oh, by the way,

1428
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,600
oh, I did want to mention one thing,

1429
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,600
one of the last things on here.

1430
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,600
It talks about how you can go to order.baskinrobbins.com

1431
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,280
to figure out how to get Baskin Robbins delivered to you.

1432
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,940
And then the next paragraph is,

1433
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,320
if you want Bud Light seltzers delivered directly

1434
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,680
to your doorstep, visit, and they give the link.

1435
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,160
So this is quite the little one-act play

1436
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,460
they've written here for us.

1437
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,960
This is a person that doesn't need

1438
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,280
to leave the house anymore because both Bud Light seltzer

1439
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,440
and Baskin Robbins is delivered to their doorstep.

1440
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,880
They know exactly who they're targeting.

1441
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,960
Justin, I would posit that what this is

1442
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,020
is them acknowledging that if you have reached the point

1443
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,120
where you are ready to mix Bud Light seltzer

1444
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,840
and Baskin Robbins, you are not safe to drive anymore.

1445
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,040
You have reached the point

1446
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,560
where you have already been drinking

1447
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,860
and you thought, oh, you know what I want.

1448
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,720
You know, it sounds good to me.

1449
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,760
You've crossed the Bud Light event horizon at that point.

1450
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,520
No light can escape.

1451
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,320
Hey, can I do a quick Yahoo?

1452
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,160
Sure.

1453
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,980
This one's sent in by Graham Roebuck, thank you.

1454
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,720
It's from Yahoo Answers user Josh,

1455
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,060
slightly pertinent to the preceding bit,

1456
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,040
the little skit we just did.

1457
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,680
Josh asks, what can I say to sound

1458
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,760
like I've had beer before?

1459
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,680
Are there any words or phrases that could make it sound

1460
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,300
like I have drank beer before?

1461
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,340
Thanks.

1462
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,400
Brewski, for sure.

1463
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,960
Slide me a brewski is good.

1464
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,480
Beer me, if you say like beer me.

1465
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,320
That's not anything,

1466
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,360
because that's like people say that already

1467
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,380
about other stuff.

1468
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,940
I think you've got to say something.

1469
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,040
There are terms, okay, things like hops.

1470
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,520
Ooh, you can really taste the hops.

1471
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,360
Oh, I see.

1472
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,520
Have you ever had Keystone Light?

1473
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,760
I can't, the hops are a little assertive for me.

1474
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,600
I'm not really sure.

1475
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,920
Yeah, but it's like, oh, assertive hops is good,

1476
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,880
but if you want to be someone who's like into beer,

1477
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,020
you can be like, hmm, hoppy birthday to me.

1478
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:20,800
This one is really hoppy.

1479
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,120
This is a very hoppy one you've given me.

1480
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,680
That's a Bud Light seltzer.

1481
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah, you can't, it can't be anything,

1482
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,240
you've raised a good point, Travis.

1483
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,400
It can't be anything where you get caught

1484
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,680
with it not being that, right?

1485
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,200
Yeah, I mean, you've got to look at the ingredient list

1486
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,760
of whatever you're drinking to make sure hops is in them,

1487
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,580
is in there.

1488
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,720
Is hops in here?

1489
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,480
That's not good.

1490
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,120
That's not good either.

1491
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,760
You can really taste the Rocky Mountain water there.

1492
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,360
You get, that's what you just announce, like loudly,

1493
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,720
like, hmm, malt water and hops, can't believe it.

1494
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,680
Can't beat it.

1495
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh, you know what's it?

1496
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,520
Malt water, yeast and hops, that's it.

1497
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,360
That's the stuff.

1498
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,320
Here's a power term.

1499
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,520
Here's a power word that you can use.

1500
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh, it's skunked.

1501
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,840
Oh, this is skunked.

1502
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,480
Oh, this is, oh, this is skunked.

1503
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,840
Oh, man, ah, oh, this is skunked.

1504
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,280
This fricking, this fricking Smirnoff Ice is skunked, baby.

1505
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,720
Oh, the hops have gone so bad in this one.

1506
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,280
Oh, the hops are really skunked in this one.

1507
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,060
Oh, oh, oh, you skunked out the hops.

1508
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,160
Oh, the brewer skunked the hops for sure on this one, guys.

1509
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,760
The brewer skunked the Anthony Hopkins in this one,

1510
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,600
huh, gang?

1511
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,920
The Jim Brewer skunked Anthony Hopkins.

1512
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,760
Ah.

1513
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,860
You can talk about how much you hate wine.

1514
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,700
Yeah.

1515
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,940
Oh, that's actually, yeah, absolutely.

1516
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,700
This is, we may want to come at this

1517
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,240
with a little bit more lateral thinking

1518
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,000
because I feel like there's lots of ways to say things.

1519
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,260
Like if I heard someone say things like,

1520
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,640
oh, yeah, Richardson's got a good arm this year,

1521
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,000
I'd be like, that person has had beer before.

1522
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,360
Do you know what I mean?

1523
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1524
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,040
Oh, absolutely.

1525
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,860
Yeah, I just don't,

1526
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,200
I don't think Jeff Gordon's ever gonna reach this plate.

1527
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,320
You have had, that is someone who has had beer before.

1528
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,240
But may I pitch this?

1529
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,760
You take a sip of the beer and you say,

1530
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,520
you know what this reminds me of?

1531
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,400
Out on the lake with the boys, right?

1532
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,180
That's not bad, that's not bad.

1533
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,680
Because then it directly says,

1534
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,400
I've had an experience with this beer before.

1535
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,000
If someone said, have you ever had beer before?

1536
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,040
You're gonna say, mm, yeah,

1537
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,960
the taste reminds me of darts with pawpaw.

1538
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,400
Right, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1539
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,560
I remember he snuck me a little sip

1540
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,480
when I was just eight years old.

1541
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,120
Get the beer, crack it open, have a huge guzzle,

1542
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,520
don't cough or throw up.

1543
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,640
Because it's not gonna taste good to you the first time.

1544
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,520
You take a huge drink and then you just loudly announce,

1545
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,560
mm, not a single chunk.

1546
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,920
Yeah, I like that.

1547
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,560
Because that's, mm, not a single chunk in this one.

1548
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,120
Usually pawpaws brews, I have to ring out of a cheesecloth.

1549
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,360
Not this one, chunk free.

1550
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,320
What is this, Keystone Light?

1551
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,020
Wow, so smooth. Yeah, when you finish it,

1552
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,600
look down in the bottom, look straight through the hole

1553
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,640
and say, mm, not a winner.

1554
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,720
And when they're like, what do you mean?

1555
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,280
Like, oh, you don't know?

1556
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,120
And laugh it off and walk away.

1557
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,200
Leave them wondering. Leave them wondering.

1558
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,440
You also don't have to drink the beer.

1559
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,560
I'm assuming you don't want to drink the beer,

1560
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,320
which is noble.

1561
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,800
You could just crack one open and be like,

1562
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,400
mm, I can't wait to drink my 10th beer

1563
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,000
and then spill it all over the ground.

1564
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,840
No!

1565
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,480
Before you drink it, just be like, mm, my 10th of the day.

1566
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,600
Can't believe it. 10th beer today.

1567
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,720
I promised myself after I finished my novel,

1568
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,120
I would have my 10th beer of the day.

1569
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,920
Just get 12 cans of beer, pour them all down the toilet

1570
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,360
and then scatter them around your yard.

1571
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,440
And when your friends show up, be like,

1572
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,560
can someone help me pick up the 12 empty beer cans

1573
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,400
I drank today?

1574
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,120
I shouldn't drink any more.

1575
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,640
Any more of this.

1576
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,760
Hey, yeah, you guys should have partied with me earlier.

1577
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,200
Everybody was over here.

1578
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,320
Squiggo, dumb Phil, everybody.

1579
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,560
Smart Larry.

1580
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,240
Smart Larry, we were all getting absolutely snackered on.

1581
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,920
You guys can drink now if you want.

1582
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,440
I'll just watch.

1583
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,520
Yeah, you guys watch,

1584
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,880
because I'm already pretty snackered

1585
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,480
on these beautiful tall boys that I call beer.

1586
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,360
They were hoppy as hell.

1587
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,960
They were so fucking hoppy.

1588
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,900
You should have been here.

1589
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,240
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1590
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,240
my brother, my brother, and me.

1591
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,780
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1592
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,040
We hope that you're hanging in there and doing well.

1593
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,920
And that's the main thing we wanted to get across

1594
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,080
is just how much we love you.

1595
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,920
Yeah.

1596
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,520
That's the big thing.

1597
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,980
Hey, we got a new graphic novel book coming out.

1598
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,820
What?

1599
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,280
Next week?

1600
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,440
Holy shit, yeah.

1601
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,720
It's the Adventure Zone Pedals to the Metal,

1602
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,060
third installment in our adaptation

1603
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,800
of the Adventure Zone Balance arc.

1604
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,920
And you have just a little bit more time to pre-order that

1605
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,200
if you want to get it on release day.

1606
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,600
I just got two big fucking boxes

1607
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,440
chock full of these beauties.

1608
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,920
Lovely book, lovely book.

1609
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,080
Very excited for it to be out there.

1610
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,400
And not only is the book coming out,

1611
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,680
which you can pre-order at The Adventure Zone,

1612
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,160
theadventurezonecomic.com,

1613
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,800
we also have a live event,

1614
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,360
a virtual live event happening on July 17th

1615
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,680
at 8 p.m. Eastern time.

1616
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,200
It's gonna be streaming and free to watch.

1617
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
It's gonna be featuring us, Kerry,

1618
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,320
and some very special guests.

1619
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,680
And you can get more info on where to watch

1620
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,240
and buy exclusive signed copies of the books

1621
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:45,240
from The Strand at bit.ly slash TazGNLive.

1622
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,720
I don't know if capitalization matters.

1623
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,140
If it does, TazGN and the L are all capitalized.

1624
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,740
So bit.ly slash TazGNLive.

1625
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,880
And you can watch us do some readings.

1626
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,240
We're gonna do a Q&A about the book

1627
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,400
and you can order signed copies.

1628
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,920
It's gonna be fun as hell.

1629
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,840
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,800

01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,880

01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,760
And you should listen to it.

1635
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,480
I got two more quick announcements.

1636
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,480
