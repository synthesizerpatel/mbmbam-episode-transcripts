1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Hail to the chief, he's the chief and he needs hailing.

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
That's of course a classic scene from the hit film My Fellow Americans,

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,800
starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, both as President John F. Kennedy.

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
Two angry presidents.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
Two angry presidents.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
Grumpy old presidents.

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,960
Grumpy old statesmen. One of the classics of their later years, My Fellow Americans.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
But today we're celebrating Presidents Day, of course, here at My Brother and Me,

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest president, Justin McElroy.

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm your middle-est president, Travis McElroy.

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,280
Guys, President Obama is a space monster from the Planet Muslim,

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
and I don't understand why he gets his own holiday and he's trying to kill my freedom.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Before we get emails on this, I just remembered Walter

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Matthau was not in My Fellow Americans, it was James Garner.

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,760
And before we get other emails about this, Griffin is Griffin McElroy.

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,120
But my position on President Obama's space monstership stands.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,480
I know, but you definitely want to put a signature at the end of that bomb vault

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,360
so people know who that voice is attached to.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
How come no matter how many times we ask him,

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
he can't produce a birth certificate showing that he's not from outer space?

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
Have you guys ever noticed that?

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
Let us see your earth, bud.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,800
So I have a question for you guys.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
My dear friend Jeremy Dubin asked me this, and it kind of started.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
So here's the situation.

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
You're about to get into a bar fight, right?

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
Just a big old brawl.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,240
You can have three presidents backing you up.

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
Which three do you choose?

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Oh, well, I think we can all agree that James Buchanan's right out.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
He died of the flu, right?

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,300
Yep.

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,800
Yeah.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,300
Agreed.

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,800
No Buchanan.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
Is that the one that gave the too long speech and he died from it?

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:33,940
Yep.

42
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,480
I think.

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,200
I mean, yeah, if you punch that guy outside, he's done for.

44
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,700
He's dead.

45
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,760
I think we can all agree that first and foremost, he's Andrew Jackson.

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
No, that's ridiculous.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
Andrew Jackson has killed a man.

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,960
Andrew Jackson is a crazy person.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,720
Yeah, you gotta have Andy J backing you up.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
Backing you up.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Can I drop Polk on you guys?

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
See, I said Polk.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
He's so thick, so hardy.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
I said Polk, too.

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
Can't knock him over.

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah, I mean, another, I think, solid choice would be Taft,

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,640
because you just keep pounding it, and where are his vital organs?

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,600
I don't know.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,960
And he can do that big belly bounce thing where he knocks someone across the room?

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,880
He does, and he does a thousand hand slap.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
I think you're thinking of Zangief.

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,600
I am thinking of E. Honda, of course.

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,760
James K. Polk can do Yoga Fire, though.

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,480
Yoga Fire.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Obviously, there's Teddy Roosevelt.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,800
Teddy Roosevelt, though, that's so odd.

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,640
He's probably busy in somebody else's fantasy ballroom fight.

68
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
You're not going to be able to get Teddy.

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
He's going to be busy.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
And what about Franklin?

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,640
Franklin is good.

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
Get him off the yard.

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
Who's going to go after him?

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,840
If it's Last Man Standing, he has got a distinct advantage, or disadvantage,

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,720
depending on how strict the rules are.

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Can I say Jeb Bartlett?

77
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,880
OK.

78
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah, why not?

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
His illness, I don't know, may not make him the fiercest competitor.

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,720
He's never been a military man, as folks on that show want to point out.

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,960
Sheriff Ford turned down offers to play in the NFL.

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,600
Maybe then he would be a good quarterback for your punch team.

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,680
What about Bill Clinton?

84
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
Fucker's charming.

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,080
He's so charming.

86
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,360
Hey, we don't need to do this.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,320
Hey, let's all relax over a nice Zima.

88
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,000
That's my impression of Bill Clinton.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm actually actually, statistically speaking, a lot of people don't know this,

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm actually the only person on Earth who impersonates Bill Clinton.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,640
So that is the actually first Bill Clinton impression that a lot of people hear.

92
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,400
He really captured his Zima presidency so well.

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,880
Here's the thing.

94
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,320
The thing is, you got to talk like this.

95
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah, and that's it.

96
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Talk like Bill Clinton.

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
Maybe a fellatio goof.

98
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
My fellow Americans, blow your jobs.

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,480
Is that good?

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
Is that a good impression?

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm capturing his irreverence, certainly.

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,640
Hey, let's, as much as I love talking about which presidents could take a punch,

103
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,360
we should probably help some people out with advice.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,040
This first question comes to us from FormSpring.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
I got a girl's number from a night out a few weeks ago,

106
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
but after a few texts, nothing came from it.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
What's the protocol for the number?

108
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Do I delete it, forget it ever happened,

109
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,120
or do I leave it and live in constant fear of accidentally dialing it?

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
Oh, man.

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
Guys, is FormSpring like Pinterest?

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
I do not know Pinterest.

113
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Is that a social networking thing?

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,840
It's like Skype, but with push pins, from what I understand.

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,360
I actually have reached my limit on any joining any sort of social networks,

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
and I think this is how you become an old person,

117
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,800
in that I used to think it was so dismissive, you know?

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
You would try to teach an old person something new,

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,760
and they say, ugh, I'm not gonna learn that.

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,520
And then I'm just like, hey, you're being cranky.

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
What you discover as you get a little older,

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,160
there's a great sense of power to say like,

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
hey, I'm not putting that in my life.

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Get out of here.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
Google Buzz, buzz off.

126
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
Buzz off, keep it.

127
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,960
Tweeter, tweet-toe, tweet off, tweet out of here.

128
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,040
Pinterest.

129
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
You are gonna call that number.

130
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
You will call the number, and it will not be accidental, it will be drunk.

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,800
it'll maybe be a year from now,

133
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
when you're real sad and lonely on Valentine's Day,

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,040
and you just call her at night and you go,

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,160
hey, hey, Debra, Debra was soaking in about a year.

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,040
I thought we had something special together.

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,400
Man, the whole episode, huh?

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
This is former president Bill Clinton.

139
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm a ghost now.

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,800
Now I'm a ghost who loves blowjobs.

141
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I love blowjobs, balanced budgets, and hauntings.

142
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,800
Griffin, yours sounds more like Don Don's.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,360
You got it.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,840
The secret to Bill Clinton is you gotta sound like a ghost

145
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,200
underneath a bunch of blankets.

146
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,120
That's the secret.

147
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I love Bill Clinton.

148
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
And if you felt a little undertaker in there,

149
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
oh yes, it's me, former president Bill Clinton.

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Blowjobs.

151
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,560
I don't understand why you need this number.

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,200
You know what I mean?

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,160
I like to keep my contact list real tight.

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I very recently deleted the Gino's Pizza phone number

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
from Huntington, where I don't live anymore.

156
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,880
But I needed that quick access so I could call him up,

157
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,160
get a pizza ready in 10 minutes, grab it, and chomp.

158
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,920
But now I don't need that number anymore.

159
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,400
You have even less utility for the number you have.

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,480
Yeah, what if he does need it someday?

161
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,000
It's good to let go.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
You know what, she rejected you.

163
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,880
This is your chance, this is your only chance, to reject her.

164
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
Say, okay, I don't need you in my life either.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
Close the door on her.

166
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,600
Who cares if they're already closed?

167
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,160
But you can close it on your side, like a hotel room.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,960
Two doors.

169
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
You closed your door.

170
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
Doesn't matter if the other one's closed.

171
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,880
You'll never think about it again,

172
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,240
because as far as you can remember, you deleted her number.

173
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
And that's what you'll tell your grandkids.

174
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,720
Or you taught me to tone her,

175
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
and you write it on a bathroom wall.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,040
Don't do that.

177
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,160
Again, you will be tempted.

178
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
Put it on Pinterest.

179
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,000
Put it on Pinterest.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,040
No one knows what that is.

181
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
It should be safe there.

182
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
They'll want to find it and delete it.

183
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,440
But yeah, you don't want to hold on to that.

184
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,160
Yeah, delete it.

185
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,720
Get rid of it.

186
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,360
While working at Subway one day with my boyfriend,

187
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,080
a customer came up and their fly was down.

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,360
We were both wondering,

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,880
what is the proper etiquette of notifying someone of this?

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
Since they are a paying customer,

191
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,680
we don't want to embarrass them and lose their business.

192
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,160
But we also don't want them walking around being embarrassed

193
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,200
that their zipper is down.

194
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
What do we do?

195
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,720
That's from a sweet sandwich artist.

196
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,960
Oh man.

197
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,020
Okay.

198
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
My feeling on this has always gone,

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,600
like the same thing with food and the teeth, right?

200
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,640
If I, my rationale is, if I don't tell them,

201
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,520
then they're just going to walk around like a goof all day.

202
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,960
They'll want to know it's there.

203
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
But then as I got older, it dawned on me,

204
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,520
if no one tells them, they'll just think no one noticed.

205
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,320
Here's the thing though, because here's what I do.

206
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
If I like, if I've been walking all day with my zipper down,

207
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
I get home and realize it,

208
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
I do a mental checklist back through the day

209
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
of all the people I had contacted.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Of all the people I had contact with and think,

211
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,600
why didn't they tell me?

212
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,040
Why didn't they tell me?

213
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
Why didn't any of these people tell me?

214
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,960
It's like drawing up a containment net

215
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,400
and like a viral outbreak.

216
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,560
You're like, oh man, I was at the grocery store,

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
so they all saw it, told all their friends.

218
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Yeah.

219
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
And then incredible arousal is the only thing,

220
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
like a blinding arousal.

221
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
Diving into a sun of arousal.

222
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Just burning your skin off with the heat

223
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,320
of the passion of your self-exposure

224
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
to the neighborhood living.

225
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,160
I think my favorite thing about the fear

226
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
of being embarrassed about having your zipper down

227
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,320
is unless your junk is actually like hanging out,

228
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,840
nothing happened.

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,960
Like the only thing you're embarrassed about

230
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,360
is that a zipper was undone on your pants.

231
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
Like there was no other consequence to it.

232
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Are you saying, but Charles, that doesn't make sense

233
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,440
because then we could just walk around zipper free.

234
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
If that was the case, we'd just all have big gaps down there.

235
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Big, big shitty pockets.

236
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
No, I'm not saying you shouldn't do the zipper,

237
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,640
but I'm just saying like that horrified feeling you get

238
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
when you realize that your zipper's been down

239
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
for like four hours.

240
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,680
Isn't as bad as the feeling is realizing

241
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
that you've been hanging some-

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
Hanging brain.

243
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,320
Hanging brain.

244
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,640
Well, yeah, I would say that having your junk

245
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
actually hanging out of your pants

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,880
is a lot worse than just having your zipper down.

247
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
You're suggesting that telling somebody

248
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,080
to examine their zipper is like a warning

249
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,480
that they are just a step away from-

250
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,520
You are walking a razor's edge, my friend.

251
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Yeah.

252
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,840
But is it, I mean, but, oh man.

253
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
Sometimes you say things I don't know

254
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
if they make sense or not,

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
and it's hard trying to decode it.

256
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,400
Like what-

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm just saying it could totally be casual.

258
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Just like, hey, your zipper's down.

259
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,160
They'd be like, oh, thanks, cool.

260
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
But you can't be casual, Travis,

261
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,640
because in that sentence,

262
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
what you aren't saying at the beginning is,

263
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,480
hey, I was just looking at your dick and I noticed-

264
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,280
Now that's true.

265
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
I was giving you, how about I was giving you

266
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
a head to toe check.

267
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,280
Yeah.

268
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,600
To see what various articles of clothing

269
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,480
you'd forgotten to finish.

270
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,920
Maybe you can, wait a minute.

271
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,880
Maybe you can trigger some synapse in their brain

272
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,040
that makes them check their crotch while-

273
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh, like that's a great belt.

274
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Like in the transaction, right?

275
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:15,440
Like say, did you want some extra salami on your sandwich?

276
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,480
Did you want that foot long or six inches?

277
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
Did you want a sandwich?

278
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
Because I can already see you've got a hot dog.

279
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
That's the worst thing.

280
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
That's the worst.

281
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,080
That was just-

282
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,360
Because of his wiener.

283
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,600
Right.

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
Oh, right.

285
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,520
Okay, great.

286
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:35,920
Did you-

287
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,320
Is it just as embarrassing if a woman has her zipper down?

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
No, I don't think it's just, I don't-

289
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,520
Is it?

290
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,040
Is it? You know the difference?

291
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
Women would check.

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,760
Because women are like men that just stumble out of the bathroom

294
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,280
and hope everything's okay in there.

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,560
Just blindly clawing their way out of the room.

296
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
That's how we get through life.

297
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,360
I barely made it.

298
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,000
Anytime a man, Lee, is in a bathroom,

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
it looks like a Jekyll turning in behind.

300
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,760
Scraping at the walls and just looking for a way out.

301
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I am, every time I go to the bathroom,

302
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm basically just racing, right?

303
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
Like I'm racing against my ghost from the last lap.

304
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm trying to beat my time.

305
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,160
And to that effect, I will just walk out of the bathroom

306
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
with my pants around my ankles.

307
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,160
And then hit the stopwatch.

308
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,280
Hit it and go, yes.

309
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,760
Did it.

310
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
Shaved off a few precious hundreds.

311
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,800
Do you, this is, I guarantee you that every man has done this.

312
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,640
And I doubt, I hope and pray that no woman has.

313
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Do you guys ever, in the middle of your bathroom ritual,

314
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,920
you know there's something else you need to do,

315
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,760
but God damn it, you're done in there?

316
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
You're just done with it.

317
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
And that, whatever that thing is,

318
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,200
it's just gonna have to, it's just gonna have to wait.

319
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
Whatever thing, whatever part of your ritual

320
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
you did not do that morning,

321
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
it's just gonna be because you don't want to spend any more time in there.

322
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,720
Usually for me, it's that someone else has just like walked into the bathroom.

323
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
Usually someone I don't trust.

324
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,400
What are you, what bathrooms are you in?

325
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,800
You know, just competitive bathrooms.

326
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,280
Is this a player versus player bathroom or?

327
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,480
Are you trying to take my secrets or?

328
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,520
Cooperative bathroom or do we get cubbies?

329
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

330
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,520
Sure.

331
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,960
This one was sent in by TheRealNeilOrr.

332
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,040
Thank you, TheRealNeilOrr.

333
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user lol, who asks,

334
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
do I have a right to do this?

335
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm paranoid and I needed to ask this.

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
If someone is trying to see my imagination

337
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
or hear my thoughts or sense my emotions,

338
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
do I have a right to make a back off face to them

339
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,080
to make them get out of my head?

340
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,040
I know some people who try to read me and I want to stop it.

341
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh my God.

342
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,800
Oh Jesus.

343
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
They're afraid they're getting mentalist-ed.

344
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
They're getting, they're getting enceived.

345
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
They're getting, what, lie to me-ed.

346
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
Oh God.

347
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,920
They're looking for micro gestures.

348
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,520
They're getting horse whispered.

349
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
Are you trying to horse whisper me?

350
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,400
Are you seeing through my, are you trying to see context in my words?

351
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,680
These thoughts are my own and they usually have to do with apples and sugar

352
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
because I'm a pony.

353
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,160
I'm a pony.

354
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,840
That's why it's so easy to be a horse whisperer.

355
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,000
They're only talking about one or two things.

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,400
Hey, get off or give me an apple.

357
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,720
I don't even know what to say.

358
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,120
All I can hope is that this person that is feeling this way

359
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
is just completely misreading someone like walking up like,

360
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,280
hey, how's it going?

361
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,480
Get out of my head.

362
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
These are my emotions.

363
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,640
Whoa.

364
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Hey, whoa.

365
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,120
I just asked you if you wanted extra salami.

366
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,320
I didn't mean anything else.

367
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,760
There's no subtext there.

368
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,720
Is the world we live quietly a psychic battlefield?

369
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,520
People trying to get into your head?

370
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,240
People trying to scope my business, my cranium business

371
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
that they don't need to know about, but they're trying to scope it out

372
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,720
and like I'm trying to throw up defensive barriers with my own prowess.

373
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,400
Griffin, it's 2012.

374
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,280
Every minute there are 60 hours of footage uploaded to YouTube.

375
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,800
All we want is for that to be true.

376
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,960
All we want is to pray that someone wants to know what our dreams are.

377
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,480
Please someone be trying to get into my head

378
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,400
because I'm just laying out the welcome mat for you every day

379
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,120
on my channel, Glasses Girl for 2020.

380
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,560
Isn't this what LiveJournal is for?

381
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,280
LiveJournal, Pinterest, any number of social networking sites.

382
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,920
Yeah, my brain is constantly just outputting like a really foul-mouth 12-year-old girl

383
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
who's just talking shit about her classmates.

384
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Is that what your internal critic sounds like?

385
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,280
That is.

386
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,840
I call her a little shoddy.

387
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:43,200
When Griffin makes it huge, when you get big, you gotta have a vanity cartoon.

388
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,400
Wayne Head, Hammer Man, Wish Kid.

389
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
You make it big, you get a vanity cartoon.

390
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,480
Griffin's vanity cartoon is gonna be Little Shoddy

391
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,440
featuring Wanda Sykes as the voice of Little Shoddy

392
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,720
and Griffin will write all the scripts himself in the last three episodes, short lived.

393
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,760
Doesn't need to be long to be a good vanity cartoon.

394
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,040
Everybody gets one, not only Griffin's.

395
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,720
My internal critic is Rupert Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

396
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,200
and whenever I have, no matter what entertainment or media I'm taking in,

397
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,160
he's always disappointed in me.

398
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
That's not a goof.

399
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
I just, I feel guilty all the time that I'm not reading books.

400
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,640
Sometimes for me it's Wanda Sykes, sometimes it's Maggie Sykes,

401
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
sometimes they're together and they're just not.

402
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,760
I would watch that buddy comedy all day long.

403
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh man.

404
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
They made it, it's called Taxi.

405
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't have an internal critic.

406
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,560
Okay.

407
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,360
Is that normal?

408
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
You have a lot of external ones.

409
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,560
That's a good balance, right?

410
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,400
Everybody get out of everybody's heads.

411
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
We're just trying to live day to day.

412
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,440
Get out of there.

413
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
Hey, I have been with my official, there it is.

414
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,240
I just podcasted so hard that I got winded.

415
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,200
Wrapping it up anytime now.

416
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,400
I mean my life.

417
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
I have been official with my boyfriend for almost two months and things are great.

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
However, there's one problem.

419
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
My best friend, who is a girl,

420
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,320
His best friend.

421
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
His best friend, who is a girl,

422
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,680
who has been desperately in love with him for the past two and a half years.

423
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,760
Although they go to school together and my college is three hours away,

424
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,120
I do not feel threatened by her.

425
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
My issue comes from her refusal to recognize and respect my role in his life.

426
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,040
When I go to visit him at school, she will drop by.

427
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,320
I refuse to leave and throw little jabs and backhanded comments my way.

428
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,120
I've told my boyfriend that these things make me uncomfortable,

429
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
but he sees nothing wrong with it.

430
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,120
Although he never reciprocates her affections,

431
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,640
he won't tell her that her behavior is both intrusive and appropriate.

432
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
Perhaps I'm overreacting, but it's really getting on my nerves

433
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold my tongue and play nice.

434
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,960
What do I do?

435
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,600
Olivia.

436
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,880
Olivia, you need someone in your life who is going to give you the straight dope

437
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,440
and you're lucky because we are here for you.

438
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,960
You need to bounce the ripcord and bounce.

439
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,520
Yeah, because I'll tell you what, here's my take on it.

440
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
Your boyfriend is addicted to this girl's attention.

441
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800
Oh yeah, he loves it.

442
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
Because she's so nice to him and says all these nice things

443
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,120
and is just so in love with him for the last two and a half years.

444
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,440
Anybody that realizes their best friend is like desperately in love with him

445
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,800
for that amount of time and doesn't back away from the situation

446
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,240
or putting into it is just loving the attention.

447
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,740
Yeah.

448
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,600
The extent to which you need to bounce is incalculable.

449
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
Like, you need to trust us on this one.

450
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,080
We can tell you why you need to bounce, but you have got to bounce.

451
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,760
Yeah, you gotta go.

452
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,040
I mean, this is so obvious.

453
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
I don't mean to- you gotta go.

454
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,400
This thing's done- I was- I was rereading the email

455
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
because if you've been dating for like, you know, 20 years,

456
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
then maybe you should reconcile.

457
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,160
But two months and this- no.

458
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,120
No, no, no, no.

459
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,640
This is my main issue with it.

460
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,040
That she like talked to her boyfriend and said like,

461
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,080
hey, this isn't cool.

462
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,680
And he was like, ah, it's fine.

463
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
I think it's cool.

464
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,760
Time to get out.

465
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,960
Go, go, go.

466
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
Men and women can be friends.

467
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,200
Didn't you see Will and Grace?

468
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,360
That's a bad example.

469
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,080
My best friend's wedding.

470
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,960
Oh wait.

471
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,760
You, me, and Dupree.

472
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
You got a lady dupe.

473
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
And you have to- you have to get out of this situation.

474
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,400
You have to.

475
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,600
Olivia, you are in the story of their relationship.

476
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,360
She is the Kate Hudson and you are the-

477
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,560
Baxter.

478
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,800
You are about to get Baxtered so hard.

479
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,760
You're Baxtered.

480
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,120
You need to- yeah.

481
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,920
It's brutal.

482
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,960
You need to get out because you- this is not going to end well.

483
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,920
This is bad.

484
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,800
This is really bad.

485
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,280
And the fact that she's even around right now is wholly unacceptable.

486
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,960
Because one of two things is going to happen.

487
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,720
Like, she's going to win him or you're going to find your tires slashed or something.

488
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,280
Yeah, she's going to go full-blown swim fan and burn your apartment down.

489
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,880
If you had told us before you got into this relationship that you were going to date

490
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,280
someone that lives three hours away, we would have very sternly warded you off from it.

491
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
We would have said, no, that's a bad idea.

492
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,680
Now, we honestly have to put our foots- feet down.

493
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,720
Collective feet.

494
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,680
And our foots.

495
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,160
And our foots.

496
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,840
Yes, all three foots on the ground say that you can't do this, Olivia.

497
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,720
You're too good for him.

498
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
Too good for this situation.

499
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
It's not him, even.

500
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,080
It's not- it's- I mean, it is him because he obviously needs to grow up and have some

501
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,040
emotional maturity and make some boundaries with this girl.

502
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,280
Yeah.

503
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,040
What is she even doing around?

504
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,680
If you see each other- if you live three hours away, it can't be rare.

505
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,360
You know, it's gotta be a rare thing that you guys get to spend time together.

506
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,560
What is she even doing there?

507
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,360
That's what I'm saying.

508
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,800
And the fact that your boyfriend doesn't see any problem with that, and when you confront

509
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,440
him about it, he's like, nah, it's fine.

510
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,600
Like, that's such an issue for me.

511
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,160
We cool.

512
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,960
We cool.

513
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,320
You're not.

514
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,880
You're not cool.

515
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,880
Bounce.

516
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,800
This is- because if you put it in any other context, like, I never get to see my boyfriend,

517
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,160
but then when I do, all he does is sit there and read a book.

518
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
All he does is sit there and play video games.

519
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,080
Like, if he can't divide himself from this girl long enough to just hang out with you

520
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
when you actually get to visit, like, that's an issue.

521
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,920
Absolutely.

522
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,400
And you know what else is an issue?

523
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,740
Money.

524
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
I mean, I guess.

525
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,480
People need it.

526
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,280
People need it?

527
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,480
I guess.

528
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,000
And people want it.

529
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,800
Money's out.

530
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,640
This message is for who, Travis?

531
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,600
Well, this first message is for Ashley Metcalf.

532
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,360
Oh.

533
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
And it's from Mom, Buddy, Brandy, and Kristen.

534
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,440
And they say, happy 28th birthday.

535
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,960
They're going to have a listening party tonight, which is awesome.

536
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
So happy birthday.

537
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,120
You're listening right now.

538
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,120
And yeah, so Ashley, it's her birthday.

539
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
She's the youngest of three girls.

540
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,120
She has a dog named Butters, and she loves MBMBAM and unicorns.

541
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,040
Two great tastes that taste great together.

542
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,840
We are the unicorn of podcasts.

543
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,400
So happy birthday to you, Ashley.

544
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,320
She asked for a jingle, but we took this pretty firm position on only giving jingles to businesses

545
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
and not people because that's weird.

546
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,160
So instead, because it's your birthday, I'll give you the title of a jingle,

547
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,680
and it would have been birthday boo.

548
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,120
But now that's over, but you have to make up the song yourself.

549
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,440
That's just a leaping off point.

550
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,920
So once you start Ashley Metcalf Incorporated, Griffin will do a jingle for you.

551
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,480
Yes.

552
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,280
Who else we got on the old birthday calendar, Trav?

553
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,040
We've also got Sarah of Melbourne, Australia.

554
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,640
And that comes from Tom, also of Melbourne, Australia.

555
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,240
And Tom wishes Sarah a happy Valentine's Day and birthday and three-year anniversary combo.

556
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
So he's getting three wishes for the price of one.

557
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,480
It's a great deal.

558
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
We should have charged him triple.

559
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
In fact, we now will retroactively charge him triple.

560
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,400
He says that she's secretly in love with me, which I'm not.

561
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
I don't really want to do any internet cuckolding today.

562
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
Thank you.

563
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,720
I will just...

564
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,880
I will just hang out and not do that.

565
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,520
But thank you.

566
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
But no, but I appreciate the offer.

567
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
And we would be remiss.

568
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,800
So happy birthday, Valentine's Day anniversary to Sarah of Melbourne.

569
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,080
You know what makes a great gift for anybody, any occasion?

570
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,880
Eternal love.

571
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,760
Eternal love.

572
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,920
And barring that is the gift of time.

573
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,240
And barring that is the gift of economy.

574
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
And barring that is the gift of environmental awareness.

575
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,120
And you can give all three to people with a brand new project called Stack.

576
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:25,040
Stack is a revolutionary concept in the world of soap stuff.

577
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,880
You know, like soap, soapery.

578
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
It's a revolutionary soapery concept.

579
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,360
Soapistry.

580
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Soapistry.

581
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,400
So basically what Stack soap is, it's a bar of soap that has a divot on the top.

582
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,320
And as you wear it down, what we've trademarked is called the stupid sliver.

583
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,680
You end up with a stupid sliver.

584
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,560
And usually you throw that away or you slip on it and die.

585
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,600
With Stack soap, sorry.

586
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,160
No death.

587
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,200
It's a murder sliver.

588
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,040
You're washing your body with it.

589
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
You're washing your butt.

590
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,200
And your butt swallows the sliver of soap because it's so tiny.

591
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,080
Then you get sick.

592
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,280
So Stack soap is built with a divot.

593
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,360
And when you use a bar of Stack soap, it wears down so it fits exactly in that divot.

594
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,280
So when you just have a murder sliver, you slap it into a new bar.

595
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,560
You don't waste any soap.

596
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
And you're back off to the races.

597
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
And when you get another sliver, you slap it into the next bar.

598
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,320
I have had a bar.

599
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,320
Founder Eric sent me a few bars and I've been using it.

600
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,960
I feel like I've never been clean before, which is unsettling.

601
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,880
But also, you know, I'm glad to discover it now before I'm in my 40s.

602
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
Can you describe the scent to me?

603
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
Yes, the bars he sent me were prototypes and unscented.

604
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
So it smells like clean.

605
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,720
So it smells clean.

606
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,520
It's a very clean scent.

607
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,800
Anyway, he was looking for money to get a copper dye to make these bars.

608
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
You need nine grand.

609
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
You guys are insane people.

610
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,360
And you have fully funded his project.

611
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
The Kickstarter is fully funded.

612
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,480
And because you guys were tweeting and talking about it, the story was picked up by like

613
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,760
Boing Boing and Gizmodo and a few other sites.

614
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,920
So you guys are, as always, the best.

615
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,200
Thank you for proving that we are an economical juggernaut.

616
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
We are a huge powerhouse in the world of internet soapistry.

617
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,800
Now, Griffin, you've been working on a jingle for Stack Soap.

618
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,560
Can you give us an update on that?

619
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,960
Yeah, you know, I'm all about, right now, I'm just sort of oscillating between themes,

620
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,600
um, between genres, you know, between, like, there's a lot of cleanness, I think, has a

621
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,400
lot of implications in the poetical sense.

622
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,360
Do you know what I mean?

623
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,040
Yeah, there was a few words that weren't words in there, but please go on.

624
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,840
So I'm trying to find, I'm trying to, like, find the sign.

625
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,040
There's like a lot of ether.

626
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,280
I'm not used to this much ether when I create.

627
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,480
Sure, yeah, yeah.

628
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,080
And so, like, my net, I have to refine my net so that the ether.

629
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
So where's your net at right now?

630
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,760
Like, right now, I'm thinking, like, a southern, southern rock, southern rock, and, like, the,

631
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,000
it's all about getting clean, you know, but, like, the cleanness is also a metaphor for

632
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,960
love, human, human love between people.

633
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,240
So what's that sound like?

634
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,880
So, like,

635
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:28,480
Put your soap in my soap.

636
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,440
That's all I have so far.

637
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
Okay.

638
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,440
Put your soap in my soap.

639
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,920
I like it.

640
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,480
You know, I think you just repeat that for, like,

641
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,560
Put your soap in my soap.

642
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:47,360
And we'll both get clean together, Stack Soap.

643
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,320
I think we could work out a pretty tight harmony for that, too.

644
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,800
Yeah, I think we're really close on that.

645
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,200
So stacksoap.com again is the address.

646
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,080
And right now we got a word from another Max Fun show that may or may not be trying to sell you soap.

647
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,040
I'm Jesse Thorne.

Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture that will do

649
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,440
nothing less than change your life.

650
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,040
You know, I've never heard anything like it before.

651
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,680
It'd be like seeing a new color, which I guess is music's, like, biggest asset,

652
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,880
is that you can hear new sounds.

653
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,240
I'll probably never see a new color.

654
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,680
I'll probably never experience, like, a new crazy taste, but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

655
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,800
Culture picks, comedy, and in-depth interviews.

656
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:38,480

658
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
Do you want to come back with a Yahoo?

659
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,680
Yeah, I want to come back to the comedy with Yahoo.

660
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,720
This one was sent in by Kit Recca, which is a pretty good name.

661
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,640
It was asked by Avatartar Sauce.

662
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,200
It's pretty good.

663
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,800
Who asked?

664
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,760
Clever.

665
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,800
Sure, I like it.

666
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,720
How big is love?

667
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,000
How do you condense love into measurable units?

668
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,560
My girlfriend asked me how much I love her.

669
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,680
I don't know how to tell her because I don't know the formula of love,

670
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,840
and I don't know a lot about how to measure love.

671
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,720
The correct answer is this much, and then put your hands an appropriate distance apart.

672
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
It sounds like the lyrics to the worst Coasters song ever.

673
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,600
It sounds like a really shitty Doo-Wop tune, like B-side maybe to Who Wrote the Book of Love.

674
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,520
How do you quantify the relative side?

675
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,880
Who made the ruler of love?

676
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,480
I have found-

677
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,400
Who made the graduated cylinder of love?

678
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,920
The closest approximate metric from what I found is Scoville units.

679
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,640
Okay.

680
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:44,960
Okay.

681
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,440
Now, is that a word you've heard or do you actually know what that concept represents?

682
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,200
A Scoville unit is the measurement of heat in peppers.

683
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,080
Okay, right.

684
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,720
Do you know what I mean?

685
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,720
Measure the capsaicin?

686
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,840
It may not work for everyone, but my love has a sort of,

687
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,920
I wouldn't say Latino fire, but I would say it.

688
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,360
I did, so it's out there.

689
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,560
You did say it, right.

690
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,760
So that's how I like to think.

691
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,160
And also Scoville units, the measurements are really high.

692
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,680
A Habanero I think has like two million Scovles.

693
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
That's shorthand for Scoville units.

694
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,160
So that's sort of what I'm working with for my particular brand of love.

695
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,840
I would have said stone.

696
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,280
Okay, I like that.

697
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,720
Because nobody knows how much it really is and it's so mysterious.

698
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,600
I like that, the thing that works for me about the Scoville units

699
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,960
is that there are some real relatable peppers

700
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,080
that you can just directly connect that to.

701
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
Like girl, my love is like the ghost chili.

702
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Oh, that's, yeah.

703
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,840
Oh, and then you could say like we've calmed down to like a green pepper.

704
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,120
Right now I feel like this is more like a green pepper or a cayenne.

705
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,760
Oh, and that's how you know it's like,

706
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,600
okay, well we've calmed down to like friend Scoville units.

707
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,760
And then you'd be like, baby, we are banana peppers.

708
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,520
And then that's how you break up.

709
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,400
We're like milk.

710
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
We're zero scoves.

711
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,560
We actually cool other people's love when they drink us.

712
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,760
Just to be in our presence kills other people's love.

713
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,600
Yeah, we're the opposite of love, whatever that is.

714
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
They need to come up with an opposite of love.

715
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,400
How about it, wordsmiths?

716
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,760
Not the love.

717
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
Even with all your science,

718
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,760
you still haven't been able to come up with a word that's the opposite of love.

719
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,280
Yeah, it's pretty despicable.

720
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,040
You know, you think about Shakespeare.

721
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,000
Shakespeare created eyeball.

722
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,280
He created the word puking.

723
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,960
Green-eyed monster.

724
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,760
Skim milk.

725
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,280
Obscene.

726
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,760
That's all-

727
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,400
Luggage.

728
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,160
That's all created by Shakespeare.

729
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,560
Couldn't come up with the opposite of love.

730
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,280
Pinterest.

731
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,160
He did not.

732
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,120
He did.

733
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,800
He was talking about someone, I think it was in Two Gentlemen of Verona,

734
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,400
where he says her practicing her sartorial craft,

735
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,920
she had a lot of Pinterest because she had a lot of interest in pins.

736
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,840
The other gentleman of Verona responds,

737
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,680
it's not that she loved her, he opposite of loved her.

738
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,960
He didn't.

739
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,720
He did opposite, then he vomits and blacks out for six hours.

740
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,640
It's his longest play as a result.

741
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,040
In lots of theaters, they cut that.

742
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,920
They trim it down to three hours of vomiting and blacking out.

743
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,720
Well, you can usually just turn it into like a dream ballet

744
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,200
that kind of conveys the time.

745
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Or you do like a War of the Roses kind of thing.

746
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
You're like, hey, buckle in, audience.

747
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,880
Yeah, purists do the whole thing.

748
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,160
This is a three-hour song about social networking platforms.

749
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,080
I am Barbeque in the Tumblr.

750
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,080
I am Sarah.

751
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,160
Lord Steven of LiveJournal.

752
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,800
I don't know what's happening.

753
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,600
I would like to have been there on this day

754
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,640
when this girlfriend asked this guy how much he loved her,

755
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,360
and he responded, I don't know.

756
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,840
I have to go to Yahoo Answers.

757
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,560
A hundred?

758
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,160
I literally can't quantify it.

759
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,200
How big is a house?

760
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,720
We have an opportunity here not to equate it to another metric,

761
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,280
but to come up with our own metric

762
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
that we can think about how much money we can make off of that

763
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,760
if we sold that shit to Hallmark.

764
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640
And we just said like, you know, 50 billion?

765
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,680
Throbs.

766
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,720
Throbs.

767
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,560
Throbs is so good.

768
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm mad that we were gonna have this whole riff

769
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
and Travis just nailed it right out of the gate.

770
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,600
It's Throbs, obviously.

771
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,440
It's sexual, but it's also heart-related.

772
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,680
Yep.

773
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,760
Okay, so zero throbs is just utter indifference.

774
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
And negative throbs, is that hatred,

775
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,640
or does hatred have its own...

776
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,320
Now, what is hatred?

777
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,120
What is hatred?

778
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,800
I'm sorry, I forgot the goof.

779
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,800
Dullard.

780
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm not even gonna do your throb goof now

781
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
because you ruined my goof.

782
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,560
No, this is, no, Justin, this is such a...

783
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,120
Please don't take this out on your money-making opportunity

784
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,400
that we have in front of us.

785
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,880
At once a season, I get a goof veto

786
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,200
and I'm using it to veto his goof as a punishment

787
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,360
for you unintentionally killing my goof

788
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
in the annals of goofdom.

789
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,520
This is like a goof end of Reservoir Dogs.

790
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Travis is cutting a goof ear off.

791
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,640
Dancing.

792
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,320
Fuck.

793
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,560
Fuck, say your dumb thing about throbs.

794
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,360
I'm just trying to come up with,

795
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,080
for our listeners to use with their lovers,

796
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,520
I just want us to come up with some sort of metric.

797
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,920
We founded the term, Travis founded the term.

798
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,520
Let's come up with some numbers.

799
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
So zero is indifference.

800
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,320
That's how I feel about like Kevin Costner.

801
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,080
Like fine, he can do his thing.

802
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,480
What is...

803
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,600
Okay, so then it's like friendship is maybe,

804
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,840
maybe a hundred?

805
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,320
A hundred throbs?

806
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,440
Why have a scale though?

807
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,800
Like what's in between those two?

808
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,480
I mean, there's a lot of stuff.

809
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,240
Acquaintance, business partner.

810
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,760
And there's levels of friendship.

811
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,800
You can be like, we're like go to lunch friends

812
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,280
and that's like 75 throbs.

813
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,600
It's nice because everybody's always saying love

814
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,680
and the word doesn't mean anything.

815
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,040
Let's get some numbers attached to it.

816
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,840
That's what I'm trying.

817
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,160
Thank you.

818
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,600
Welcome to the team building exercise.

819
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,880
A thousand I think should be friends of Benny's.

820
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,520
You know what I mean?

821
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,320
I think that pure and beautiful love clocks in around 10,000.

822
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,040
But 10,000 is like,

823
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,320
that's the kind of love that only your grandparents have

824
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
because they know what sacrifice is.

825
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,720
Like your pap, pap killed the Nazis

826
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
so he can love a lot harder than you.

827
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,520
The only way that you can reach 10,000

828
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
is if you've been married to the same person

829
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
for more than 50 years

830
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
and also one of you has been to war

831
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
and you know the loss.

832
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
I like this.

833
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,680
I like not only putting a number to it,

834
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
but putting restrictions to it.

835
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,160
So when someone's like, I love you 9,000 throbs

836
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,200
and you're like, no, you don't

837
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,920
because you didn't grow up in the same town

838
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,200
next door to each other.

839
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,400
So sorry.

840
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,080
How do we measure it though?

841
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,000
Is there a device like a meat thermometer

842
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
we can just plug into our hearts and know?

843
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,320
Mm-hmm.

844
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,360
It's a meat thermometer.

845
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,440
Hey, stab yourself at this.

846
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,400
I gotta know.

847
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,520
I gotta test it.

848
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:53,920
Right in the heart.

849
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,680
You know those things they put in turkeys

850
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,760
that you know it's done because it pops out?

851
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah.

852
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
It's like that.

853
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,120
Yeah.

854
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,040
It's like when you do your tire pressure

855
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,480
and it shoots out a certain amount

856
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,600
and you're like, oh, it looks like you're at about 5,000 throbs.

857
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,920
You guys are getting along well.

858
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,640
I wish that,

859
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
I think I'm just gonna stick to measuring my wife's love

860
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
the way I always have

861
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,120
and that's asking her to see a movie with Jason Statham in it.

862
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
What about the day when she one day says no?

863
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,400
That joke was actually donated to me by Ray Romano.

864
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,520
So I definitely want to thank him for all his.

865
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,120
Everybody like 4,000 throbs Raymond.

866
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,680
You know what I mean?

867
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,040
Everybody throbs Raymond.

868
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,200
That impression was the claim.

869
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,920
Was that the brother?

870
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,520
That was the brother.

871
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:53,760
Raymond's brother sounds like a vogue on Nightmare.

872
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,360
Hey, I have found that I become too emotionally invested

873
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,880
in television book series.

874
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
I tend to overload myself in the beginning

875
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,960
like when I discovered Doctor Who

876
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,040
and it consumed my every waking moment

877
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,440
and then feel empty and sad when they're over

878
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,200
or I'm caught up to the current season.

879
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
I don't know what to fill this void with

880
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
besides more television and book series.

881
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,240
Do you guys have any suggestions?

882
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,400
That's from Immoderate in Indianapolis.

883
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,000
I wish I knew the answer to this.

884
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,520
Travis is the king of just he'll call.

885
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,360
You'll suggest a new show to him

886
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,120
and he'll call you at like three in the morning.

887
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Like, well, I watched All Upon Stars.

888
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,520
Yeah, like literally I will consume them

889
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,280
to non-existence like to the point where I use it all up

890
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,480
and no one else can enjoy it.

891
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,280
It's like for me, it's like, I can't be,

892
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,440
I can't be, my work ethic goes right out the window

893
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
when I know that there's TV that I should be watching.

894
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,280
You know what I mean?

895
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,560
Like I've watched four episodes of Game of Thrones

896
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,720
and all I want to do is watch the rest of them.

897
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,320
But I'm trying to savor the experience,

898
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,560
but it's literally while we've been doing this podcast

899
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,880
all I can think about is that show.

900
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,200
You know, what I found funny is

901
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
I love when something like that happens

902
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,440
and it gets put in perspective for you

903
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
because like I had never seen that as weird,

904
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
like just sitting down and like,

905
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,080
well, I've got today off,

906
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,920
I'm gonna watch every episode of season three of Doctor Who, right?

907
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,040
And then when I started living with Teresa,

908
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,320
she would come home and be like,

909
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,800
you were on the couch watching Doctor Who when I left.

910
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
I was like, yeah, I've been doing it all day.

911
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,400
And she was just horrified.

912
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
Like, how do you do that?

913
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,600
The good news is-

914
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,520
And then I realized it was weird.

915
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,800
The good news is that you've already found

916
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,840
the answer to your question.

917
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,720
You have to just move on to the next thing.

918
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,040
Yeah.

919
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,480
You just soak up the radiance of the next thing.

920
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,680
You gotta be constantly on the hunt.

921
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,560
That's why we got Twitter.

922
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,800
You know what dad does?

923
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
Our dad does something that's always blown my mind.

924
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,360
And I first noticed it when we go on vacation.

925
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,680
Hi, dad.

926
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,480
He will simultaneously read like five books.

927
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,400
And that blows my mind.

928
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,960
That idea of like, not just one book that you're glued to.

929
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,400
Like he'll read a chapter of one,

930
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,160
set it down and pick up another one

931
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,840
and read a chapter of that one

932
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,440
and set that down and pick up a different.

933
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
It's amazing.

934
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,320
He has an apparatus that he built

935
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,600
that allows him to read and turn the pages of five books at once

936
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,280
that he reads with compound eyes.

937
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,960
Our dad has compound eyes.

938
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
I have a hard enough time

939
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,520
finding one books that brain giles won't disapprove of

940
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,760
let alone five that I can read concurrently.

941
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,560
So maybe that's it.

942
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Maybe pick like different shows

943
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,560
and try to like cut Dr. Who with Storage Wars.

944
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
Cut it, you know, and break it up a little bit.

945
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,800
Getting married helps us too.

946
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,240
Because when I conned my wife into watching Battlestar,

947
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,680
she ended up really liking it.

948
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,200
But at first when you're like,

949
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,160
and then this and then it's on space

950
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,600
and then it's old timey.

951
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,960
And as the captain, it's Edward James almost.

952
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,640
It's kind of a hard pitch.

953
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,400
So we had to watch Dawson's Creek alongside of it,

954
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
which is good because it took us longer

955
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,440
to get through both of them.

956
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,640
And now Dawson's Creek, of course, went on a lot longer.

957
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,040
So we're burning through those.

958
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,320
You got got though.

959
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,280
I got goofed.

960
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,400
Yeah, it was a dirty trick, but I fell for it.

961
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,720
Cause I do, cause that's my job.

962
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,920
And I think that's another thing,

963
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,640
watching something with someone.

964
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,600
So you have to like also match their schedule

965
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,080
cause like Teresa and I've been watching Downton Abbey.

966
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,360
That's how you do it, yeah.

967
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,680
Yeah, and because like we have two different schedules,

968
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
it's like, hey, let's find a special time

969
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,840
to watch an episode together

970
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,920
instead of like, well, she's off to work.

971
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm gonna burn through the day watching,

972
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,040
you know, every episode or something.

973
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,800
You really, really can't enjoy a show like that.

974
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,000
You really, if you watch,

975
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,240
if you spend an entire day watching the show,

976
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,840
it's not a special anymore.

977
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,480
But now whenever new episodes of Downton Abbey come out,

978
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,000
like I watch them with my girlfriend

979
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,120
and it's like an event.

980
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,080
It's like an exciting thing that I get so excited for.

981
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,240
And when I said Downton Abbey, I meant The Bachelor.

982
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,400
I wish we could talk about The Bachelor together because

983
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,600
We can't.

984
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,960
I wanna, I need to air out some grievances

985
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,920
I have with Courtney.

986
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,360
Okay, well, I'll just take a headset off.

987
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,200
Hey, you can talk about it if I can pretend

988
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
like you're talking about flavor of love.

989
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
Can you switch the names around?

990
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,040
Just replace all the girls with New York.

991
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,560
How many pushups should I be able to do?

992
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
I'm 30 and a guy.

993
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,880
Thanks, brothers.

994
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,840
There's only one way to solve this, right?

995
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,720
All three of us do pushups right now to see how many.

996
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,040
Yeah, we got to do pushups right now and see how we do.

997
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,640
I can't, I just got to type.

998
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,160
Only if we can edit it out later,

999
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,720
because I feel like it's only good if we can come back

1000
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,800
and say like 800.

1001
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,160
Okay, all right, here we go.

1002
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,840
800.

1003
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,600
800, I did 800 too.

1004
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I did 14.

1005
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,560
Wow, that is not good.

1006
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,680
You really did them, huh?

1007
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,280
But I had it, but my roommate sat on my back while I did it.

1008
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,800
The thing is, it doesn't matter how many that you do,

1009
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,640
it's the next time you got to do one more.

1010
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
Big dog, no fear.

1011
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,320
1998.

1012
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,920
D-D-Deep, no fear.

1013
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,200
Never give up, never surrender.

1014
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,360
You could fight, you could fly, you could grow.

1015
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,000
You got to save Maggie, got to save Jack,

1016
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,600
let your roommate sit on your back.

1017
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,160
Oh my God.

1018
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,080
Bangarang, no fear.

1019
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,760
You just got to get out there and bangarang,

1020
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,640
you know what I'm saying?

1021
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,160
No fear, I have all this,

1022
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,040
I'm reading this off my car's rear windshield right now.

1023
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,640
I have all this emblazoned there.

1024
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,800
I've been in several collisions.

1025
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,160
Travis, you could probably do,

1026
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,760
were we to actually do pushups,

1027
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,040
you could probably do more than us.

1028
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,480
That seems fair.

1029
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,760
That is probably true.

1030
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,080
I have healthy upper body strength.

1031
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,000
You use your physical form in the world

1032
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,680
in a way that Griffin and I are unaccustomed.

1033
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,760
I take a great offense to that

1034
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,640
because I have recently been crushing it

1035
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,200
with Mr. Bob Harper of The Biggest Loser

1036
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,720
and he has been toning and blasting me

1037
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,080
in ways that I did not know were possible

1038
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,680
for my body to be toned and blasted.

1039
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,840
Is the titular it that you're crushing your dignity?

1040
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,840
Is that how you say it?

1041
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,480
No kidding.

1042
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,640
I put the DVD, the workout DVD,

1043
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,720
in my computer in my room

1044
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,680
so that no one can see.

1045
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,720
Because when I work out,

1046
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,360
I look like a fucking sea creature.

1047
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,880
I look awful.

1048
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,960
I am like within three minutes

1049
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,120
before the fucking warmup is over,

1050
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,240
I am just drenched in sweat.

1051
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,480
I can't, I don't own free weights

1052
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,920
with which to do the exercises

1053
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,680
so I have to use cans of pineapples.

1054
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,760
Is that why you keep telling me

1055
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,040
you're eating so much pineapple?

1056
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,720
One time I tried to do it with yearbooks

1057
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,920
but they got too slippery

1058
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,520
from the sweat I put on them.

1059
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,440
I think the rule of thumb,

1060
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,400
the problem is however many you say you can do,

1061
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,480
if a person cares enough about it

1062
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,160
to ask you how many you can do,

1063
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,520
they're gonna say they can do five

1064
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,200
more than whatever you just said.

1065
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,520
Guys, I live in fear of the night

1066
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,480
that I'm at a party

1067
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,680
and all the dudes are like,

1068
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,760
let's have a push-up competition.

1069
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,320
I have defined my entire social life

1070
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,240
around congregating with people

1071
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,280
who are not gonna put me

1072
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,720
in that awful, awful position.

1073
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,440
And you ask, you know,

1074
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,880
obviously where are the pineapples

1075
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,000
if we're gonna do this.

1076
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,920
Yeah, if we're gonna do it right.

1077
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,280
Where's the cans of dole?

1078
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,960
I'm gonna need a pineapple can

1079
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,080
and I'm also gonna need

1080
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,920
the skinniest person here to sit on my back.

1081
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,000
I've been trying to get a little more active

1082
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,240
and yesterday I was actually

1083
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,760
riding the exercise bike

1084
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,400
while I was watching an episode

1085
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,520
of Parks and Recreation

1086
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,440
and I thought, if I'm not careful,

1087
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
I'm gonna lose touch with the streets.

1088
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,480
This, that's my concern,

1089
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,160
is I might not have the urban,

1090
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,160
the sort of urban edge

1091
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,760
that I once possessed.

1092
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,800
I should mention I was also

1093
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
drinking a glass of Pinot Gris.

1094
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,080
And wearing a vest.

1095
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,880
I was wearing a vest and nothing else.

1096
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,000
And a monocle.

1097
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,800
And a monocle.

1098
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,960
And reading monocle.

1099
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,040
Griffin, you got a yahoo?

1100
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,160
I have a few yahoos.

1101
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,880
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

1102
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,080
Thank you, Gali.

1103
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,360
It's by yahooanswersuser,

1104
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,240
I'm not even gonna try,

1105
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,320
K-X-F-L-E-U-G-H,

1106
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,000
which I think is pronounced Kla.

1107
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,000
Who asks,

1108
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,480
how do I keep my bat left sharp?

1109
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,320
How do I come out of the closet

1110
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,840
as a Jeopardy fetishist?

1111
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,920
Oh no.

1112
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,320
I mean, there is nothing sexier to me

1113
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,440
than a good looking

1114
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,960
female Jeopardy contestant.

1115
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,320
Wow.

1116
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,760
What?

1117
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,280
Maybe that's because of the rarity.

1118
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,840
This is the only thing

1119
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,440
I can ever think about again

1120
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,240
that this exists.

1121
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,720
Somewhere,

1122
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,480
there's someone going,

1123
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,080
what is my boner?

1124
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,800
You can do as much for the world

1125
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,400
as you want to to improve it,

1126
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
and this will still be a thing in it.

1127
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
It doesn't matter.

1128
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,360
It's sunk.

1129
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,320
The ship has sunk.

1130
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,280
We've had questions about

1131
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,200
wanting to bone Pokemon

1132
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,240
and porn parties with your friends.

1133
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,600
This is the most upsetting sexual thing

1134
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,640
I've ever heard.

1135
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
Because you record the episode

1136
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,960
and you have no idea.

1137
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,160
You're just trying to remember

1138
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,000
what famous actress, etc, etc.

1139
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
And there's some dude at home like,

1140
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,800
yeah, answer.

1141
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, ring that buzzer.

1142
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,080
You see how she signed her name?

1143
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,120
Bet it all.

1144
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,840
Let's deal with some

1145
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,120
pretty harsh truths right now.

1146
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,600
If you think that Ken Jennings

1147
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,040
didn't get more trim

1148
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,960
than a Persian rug factory,

1149
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,880
then you are fooling yourself.

1150
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,000
You are telling yourself

1151
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,880
goofs and lies.

1152
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,040
Yeah, but Griffin, here's the thing.

1153
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,520
There's him rolling up to a bar

1154
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,120
and all the Jeopardy groupies

1155
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,560
like falling all over him.

1156
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,680
That's perfectly fine.

1157
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,200
That doesn't bother me at all.

1158
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,560
But the idea of someone

1159
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,240
sitting at home in the dark

1160
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,000
in the glow of their TV screen

1161
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,720
just like losing it

1162
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,640
not because the person is winning

1163
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,440
and they want to like

1164
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,120
latch onto their coattails

1165
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,400
but like just because

1166
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,920
the person is on the show.

1167
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,320
That's weird.

1168
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,880
Situation.

1169
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,120
There's an attractive lady

1170
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,120
playing Jeopardy against two people

1171
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,160
crushing them.

1172
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,440
Crushing them.

1173
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,960
By the time the final Jeopardy comes

1174
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,560
there's no way they can catch up

1175
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,080
but she still bets everything

1176
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,960
gets the answer right

1177
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,800
and writes a little joke down

1178
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,160
in the answering field.

1179
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,360
Yeah, I'm beating it.

1180
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,000
All right.

1181
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,840
Dot's the eye with a little heart.

1182
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,040
Yeah, and the little heart

1183
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,800
has a mustache for...

1184
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, I guess Trebek

1185
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,960
doesn't have that anymore.

1186
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,480
No.

1187
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,440
And the little heart

1188
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,400
doesn't have a mustache.

1189
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,080
As she's leaving

1190
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,120
she books her flight home

1191
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,000
and they say,

1192
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,200
wait, you've got to come

1193
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,440
back tomorrow and win again.

1194
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
She said, I just won Jeopardy.

1195
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,720
Yeah.

1196
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,160
And then she winks and leaves.

1197
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,120
Batten a thousand.

1198
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,160
And then she gets...

1199
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,960
And then they say,

1200
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,640
did anyone catch her name?

1201
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,000
No, she was a Jeopardy angel.

1202
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
She was Roma Downey.

1203
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,800
She's gone now.

1204
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,360
Schooled by an angel.

1205
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,000
And that was the day

1206
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,840
I shaved my mustache.

1207
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,560
Alex Trebek.

1208
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,600
I'm saying there's a lot of

1209
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:30,880
I'll say

1210
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,360
sort of

1211
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,440
conspicuous sexual energy

1212
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,160
in Jeopardy.

1213
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,800
I think it's under the radar.

1214
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
And it's all generated by Alex Trebek.

1215
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,840
Well, and also in every episode

1216
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,000
someone talks about Merv Griffith.

1217
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,440
If there's ever been a dirtier name

1218
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,160
I don't know what it is.

1219
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Merv Griffith.

1220
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,920
I do love when that show

1221
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,120
gets accidentally sexual.

1222
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,920
Like when the guy

1223
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,680
got the question

1224
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,720
about the garden instrument

1225
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,640
that also means a person of loose morals

1226
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,360
and he said, ho.

1227
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,960
And the answer was rake.

1228
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,200
There was one where the guy

1229
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,720
got asked what a punch

1230
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,000
to the back of the head was called

1231
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,120
named after an animal.

1232
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,320
And he said donkey punch.

1233
