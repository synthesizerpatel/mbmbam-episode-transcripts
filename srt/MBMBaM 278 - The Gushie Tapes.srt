1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,880
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,840
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. God, guys, we have been fucking with audio shit

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:06,000
for a literal hour. 63 minutes by my count. 63 minutes we've been fucking with audio shit.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,640
We're professional podcasters in theory. Nobody has as many podcasts as we do,

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,440
and it's still an issue for us, and all I can say is Thanksgiving cannot come soon enough.

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,960
We had all these great plans to talk about Thanksgiving, this wonderful holiday

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,160
that we're going to talk about, which is I guess is where you just smoke a bunch of that sweet

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,400
sheep, and then- Out of a bong shaped like a turkey. Okay, do you eat the turkey afterward?

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,720
Hell yeah. Wait, is it a turkey, or is it just shaped like a turkey?

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,120
Nah, dude, I can bong out a turkey for sure, but my problem is I no longer want to talk about

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,800
Thanksgiving because the last 63 minutes have crushed my soul. We could have recorded a podcast

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,400
in that time. But think about all the things you have to give thanks for, Griffin. The fact that

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,880
we are even able to communicate like this in this modern era is a miracle. Yeah, I definitely get

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,160
that. It's just like if I can find myself in the mood to record a comedy advice podcast right now,

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,160
it'll be a fucking Thanksgiving miracle. Travis, how's your Thanksgiving spirit?

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,800
Honestly, it's doing great, Justin. Thank you for asking. Since I'm the one that seems to be

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
a half a second behind everybody, I feel like I'm time traveling when we record this episode.

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,560
This is what life used to be like a half a second in the past, and for that I am thankful.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,360
I used to record a podcast with a dude from South Africa. It was smoother than this. It went better

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,200
on a regular basis. He was getting attacked by lions every episode, and it still went better

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,680
than this. Maybe there was something there. Travis, can you fight off a big cat?

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,240
I'll see what I can do. It's Los Angeles. City of big cats is what that translates to.

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,400
Let's get back to Thanksgiving. I feel like there's a lot of meat on the Thanksgiving bones.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,000
I haven't been very playful, and I feel like that's my fault. That's on me. Let's get back

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,680
to it. What are some of the side dishes that go into Thanksgiving? It would just be the regular

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,560
side dishes, right? Pretty much everything you eat at Thanksgiving already is food for a high person.

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,760
Sweet potatoes with marshmallows on top? You were high when you came up with that. Guaranteed.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Guaranteed Baptist moms. I'm sitting here. I'm working so hard in my head to make more puns

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,720
based on... For some reason, I'm stuck on cranberry, but I can't find it. I don't

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,920
know that there's anything there. Is this something? Can we talk about how Thanksgiving

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:57,600
was first celebrated by pioneer chill-grooms? Okay, that's good. It helped them to celebrate

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
the fact that the Native Americans, which they did not call them at that time...

39
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,040
No, they didn't. Now we have the good sense to call them that.

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,440
The Native Americans helped them discover corn, or as their people called it,

41
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:17,120
haze. All right. Is that a thing? Is there something there Thanksgiving?

42
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,320
Are we shoehorning ourselves into weed culture a little bit too much? We had a run in the last

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,200
couple episodes. We talked about Batman villains and how we could fit weed jokes into there.

44
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:37,600
We don't smoke a lot of the kindness between the three of us. I think I have some dank

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
imposter syndrome going right now. Yeah, I know what you mean.

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm trying to stay relevant. I feel myself aging out of the world in a Logan's Run kind of way.

47
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,120
I want to be the first old person to try to stay cool longer.

48
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,080
Do you know the temperature? This is a safety part of Thanksgiving. You know the proper

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,480
temperature to cook your turkey at. Now, I do want to cut this off at the head

50
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,800
because I do think you're about to say 420, and that is actually very dangerous. I feel too

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,000
dangerous to even joke about that temperature. No, I mean, 420 would be a fast-cooking bird.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
I don't think you're going to get top flavor. You're not going to get an internal cook.

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,640
You don't want to do stuffing in the middle if you're baking at 420.

54
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Usually the reason we talk about weed jokes is that there's enough weed slang that puns

55
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:43,600
become very easy. They usually come fast and furious. Unfortunately, Thanksgiving was not the

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:53,360
ripe vein that I thought that it would be. I thought there'd be a lot of fruit to be plucked

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,240
from this particular vine, but you know what? We do the show in real time. You can't really penalize

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,880
us when things don't pan out. That's the nature of the theater of the mind that we present here

59
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,960
on a weekly basis at My Brother, My Brother and Me. Sometimes theater is just not very good.

60
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,200
Yeah, sometimes theater is bad. This isn't a show about comedy professionals performing

61
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,440
pre-scripted material. It's a communion really between friends, and sometimes your friends

62
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
try to do pot jokes about Thanksgiving, and it doesn't pan out so well, but we're all still

63
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,320
friends at the end of it, and that's what matters. That's what Thanksgiving is all about.

64
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Listen, if you want to watch good Thanksgiving comedy, just watch Friends.

65
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, that's a good point.

66
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Or Fringe.

67
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,720
Or Fringe.

68
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,440
Fringe. Yeah, they had that episode where they had to solve a sci-fi murder by

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
getting their head stuck in a turkey, huh? Do you remember that one?

70
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,520
The old scientist man was like, I know where I can find the solution to this one,

71
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
and he got his head stuck in a turkey.

72
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
If we examine the cornea of this turkey, we'll see the last thing it saw before it died,

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,720
and we'll be able to, oh, it was just a mill. Just a mill where they turned turkey into turkey.

74
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,000
That's weird if you think about it. Turkey the animal and turkey the food are really

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,040
the same thing, but you wouldn't really use that word the same way.

76
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Did you start celebrating Thanksgiving early this year, Justin?

77
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Sounds like it.

78
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,240
It's just a weird thing to think about.

79
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey, you guys ever thought about birds? Like, what are they doing up there?

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,640
It's like they're pigs. Okay, but like pigs have this where it's a pig, Charlotte's web,

81
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,640
and then it's pork is what's for dinner.

82
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,040
I understand what Justin's saying, yeah.

83
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,120
But turkey doesn't get that, which must be like that. That's a layer of abstraction

84
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
that pigs do not allow themselves. Oh, what are humans eating today? Pork.

85
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
Pork is very hot. Oh, I wonder what pork is. Well, we'll never find out.

86
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,480
Turkeys don't get that.

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,480
What can we, can you come up? Turkey's just no, one and one, that's my brother.

88
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,200
Oh, you mean turkey. Can you come up for me, Justin,

89
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,120
a name for an abstraction of turkey meat, what that would be called?

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,920
Yeah, no problem.

91
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm just, you're asking me to create a word from whole cloth.

92
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah, no, it's a, take your time.

93
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,600
What, what about, what about this?

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,740
Kay.

95
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,220
Kay. Pork too. Now hold on.

96
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,820
I edited most of that out, but that took you like almost a good minute and a half.

97
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:41,060
Yeah, pork too, uh, is, is, is maybe that's another thing that, that you could go with.

98
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,940
Pork too.

99
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,820
Can I hit you with this?

100
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:43,860
Yeah.

101
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,020
How do you, how do you guys feel about good bird?

102
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:48,980
Good bird.

103
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,820
So you can have like a slice, a white, a white meat slice of good bird.

104
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,100
And that sort of, that's, that abstracts it a little bit.

105
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,140
We do the same thing with chicken.

106
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,500
We do the same thing with duck.

107
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
And I feel like all, all of that falls into the same.

108
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,540
Yes, I guess you could call it poultry if you, if you want to be, um, a jerk about it.

109
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,780
But can, may I reckon, may I just slide my foot in the door here and say,

110
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,740
and say the word good bird into that crack in the door that I've just made.

111
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,660
Let me throw this out.

112
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,060
Something that's fun to say and fun to eat.

113
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
That's the tagline, right?

114
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,560
Waddle.

115
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,860
Oh my God.

116
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,060
Have a slice of waddle.

117
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,540
I love that Travis, some waddle.

118
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,860
That's a nice, that's a nice thing to do for turkey to start calling it waddle

119
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,140
because that's a layer of abstraction that they can find some comfort in.

120
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,220
No one, no turkey knows where waddle comes from.

121
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,140
And that's, that is a blanket that they like to sleep under at night.

122
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,700
You know?

123
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,980
Fellas, we've, uh, we found the, I think we found the nugget in here.

124
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,620
Uh, and I think we've really extracted and juiced that nug.

125
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,620
So let's, uh, well you say we move on to some advice, huh?

126
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
Why aren't there waddle nugs?

127
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
I would eat a waddle nug no problem.

128
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,180
Oh my God.

129
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,940
Waddle nugs with gravy dip and sauce, I guess.

130
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,420
Yeah.

131
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,300
Don't mind if I do.

132
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,380
Uh, so this is a comedy advice show.

133
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,740
We get half of that usually.

134
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,700
Um, except for the episodes where we get neither.

135
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,860
And this is who knows which this one will be.

136
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,780
You'll know at the end of this in about an hour or so.

137
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,980
Uh, you know what I would be really thankful for is if somebody would program us a

138
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:25,860
fucking telecommunication solution that doesn't shit the bed once every other one time.

139
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,340
Travis is, is using his phone to call into Skype to improve our lag.

140
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,660
And right now it sounds like he's balancing his checkbook with his nipples.

141
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,620
It's an absolute fucking pit.

142
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,140
It's like he's been giving me beard kisses in my ear for the last 13 minutes.

143
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,740
That's what it is, isn't it?

144
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,340
Those are your beard scrapings.

145
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,220
Those are your audio beard scrapings that only we can enjoy.

146
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,500
Ugh.

147
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,580
My office likes to celebrate birthdays and I must live in a time vortex because it feels

148
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,980
like we celebrated a new birthday every week.

149
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,060
Not every birthday with 52 people.

150
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,340
That's not that crazy.

151
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,140
Yeah.

152
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,660
It actually makes a lot of sense.

153
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,780
Every birthday, the office gets a cake, snacks and a card.

154
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,700
The awesome.

155
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,940
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.

156
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,540
I dread these cards.

157
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,700
What are you even supposed to write on these things?

158
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,460
At a certain point, how many ways can you write happy birthday, blah, blah, blah.

159
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,380
Do you have any creative things I can write?

160
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,220
Should I have a specific thing I write every time or come up with personal things every

161
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,780
time?

162
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,060
I need your help.

163
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,100
Another year older, no years wiser in Washington, DC.

164
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,580
Sign it.

165
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,340
Tom Hanks.

166
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,180
Because in 20 years, they'll look at that card and think, wait a minute.

167
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,060
Did Tom Hanks come to my birthday?

168
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,460
But put an H.

169
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,740
And they won't remember.

170
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,020
Put an H in Tom.

171
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,780
I think that that they'll probably know that that's not the real Tom Hanks.

172
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,500
Well, maybe or maybe when he's in public, he doesn't want the paparazzo chasing him

173
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,980
around.

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,780
What's up with you and Rhea Perlman?

175
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,420
Is that who he was?

176
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,700
You know, what do we get Joe for Volcano too, Tom?

177
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,460
What are you dropping it on us?

178
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,860
Don't touch the tough questions, Tom.

179
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,300
Tom, elaborate your relationship with Rhea Perlman.

180
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,260
I remember working in an office and like having the same fear and like sending thank

181
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,060
you notes and how many.

182
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,140
But here's the thing, question asker.

183
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,380
There is not a world in which people are comparing their birthday cards and going what

184
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,420
they write in yours.

185
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,020
Like that's not a fit.

186
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,300
Like you don't have to.

187
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,500
You can write every time like, hey, happy birthday.

188
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,860
It's great working with you.

189
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,940
Signed your name on every card.

190
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
And they're not going to be like, oh, did he write that again?

191
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,700
Wrote the same thing in mine.

192
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,300
Like nobody cares.

193
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,700
The one thing I always feel weird about in cards like that is just putting my John Hancock

194
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,980
on there because I feel like that's sort of saying like, you're welcome.

195
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,020
You know, like here, I just increased the value of your card because I too looked at

196
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,540
this card and signed it.

197
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740
I put my name right there.

198
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,780
This gets my approval.

199
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,060
Yeah, this is card.

200
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,820
I'm going to sign off on this.

201
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,660
The best thing to do is right on the fold.

202
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,780
Just write, I signed your crack and then put your name.

203
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,820
It's fun.

204
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,380
It's funny.

205
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,260
That's good.

206
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,940
Everybody loves it every time.

207
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,340
You could write in there, did you know Martin?

208
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,260
If it's Martin, whose birthday you're celebrating.

209
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,780
Hey Martin, it's me, Siobhan.

210
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,820
Did you know that Rhea Perlman was married to Danny DeVito and not Tom Hanks?

211
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,860
That was Rita Wilson.

212
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,420
Just a little Snopes fact for you and then sign it Snopes.

213
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:43,220
If maybe one thing you could do is wait until the very last person other than you has signed

214
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,940
the card and then once everyone has signed, you take the card and right at the very top

215
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,300
of it, we the undersigned certify that Greg is the chillest dude in the office and has

216
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:03,220
the best taste in music and always like brings the best snacks and is the best at bar trivia.

217
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,780
And then you can present that to people.

218
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,980
You can need to steal this birthday card, but you can present that to people and say,

219
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,060
listen, this is an official legal document.

220
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,500
This has been notarized.

221
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,380
Sorry, in this circumstance, are you Greg or is the card for Greg?

222
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,860
You're Greg and somebody else's birthday card.

223
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,980
I don't care who, it doesn't matter.

224
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,540
As long as we're having fun with legal documents, you could just write at the top above all

225
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,260
their signatures, the words asshole list and then a colon.

226
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,140
And then it's like, why would it, why would any of these people sign willingly put themselves

227
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,420
on the asshole list?

228
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,660
You would, you, that would, that could be your signature.

229
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,580
You're creating an opening for yourself.

230
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,900
You say, I don't know why everybody just write on the card.

231
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,620
I don't know why everybody else signed this, but I can't in good conscience put my name

232
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:43,940
on here.

233
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,500
I don't think I'm an asshole.

234
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,540
Have a great birthday.

235
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,900
I don't consider myself an asshole.

236
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,700
Or you could write something sweet like your name doesn't belong on this list because you're

237
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,420
not an asshole.

238
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,380
Have a great birthday.

239
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,940
Stay cool.

240
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,220
Have a great summer.

241
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,740
Love, David.

242
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,180
Love, David.

243
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,660
Oh shit.

244
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,780
I put my name on here.

245
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,580
Technically.

246
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,380
Ah, man.

247
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,220
Ah, man.

248
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,260
With like 60 A's.

249
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,060
Could you draw a cute picture of them?

250
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,220
Could you maybe get great at the art of caricature and then draw a fun picture of everybody whose

251
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,780
birthday it is?

252
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,300
Maybe add some value to this card.

253
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,060
Maybe just give them your own card like that.

254
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,020
Nobody else signed.

255
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,260
So you don't sign that one that everybody signed.

256
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,580
And they get a second card from you.

257
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,100
Travis fucking power play.

258
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,860
Count how many people you work with.

259
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,820
Go to Target or wherever people buy cards and buy that many cards.

260
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,340
And then say like, hey, I just wanted you to know that like I didn't want to like lump

261
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,260
in my feelings, which are so complex with everybody else's feelings.

262
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,380
So I got you my own card.

263
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,580
And then what's great is that that card will have a message in it already.

264
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,220
That's yours.

265
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,100
You own that message.

266
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
You don't have to write anything else extra.

267
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,660
You give it to them.

268
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,460
That's going to piss everybody else off until it's their birthday.

269
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,500
And they get that special treatment, that double card treatment.

270
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,460
Can you just find something important in this scenario?

271
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,380
You must not allow anyone else to sign your card.

272
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,780
So if they're like, hey, we forgot to get Steve a card.

273
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,300
Can we all just sign yours?

274
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,660
Because we know you're the card guy.

275
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,420
Like, no, no.

276
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,740
If they do just write asshole list above their name.

277
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:21,860
Done.

278
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,540
Done, everybody has something in their wallet that they'd like to unload, but they worry

279
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,820
that they might need it someday.

280
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,060
And this seems like a perfect opportunity.

281
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,700
Whenever this list, this card thing comes around, just slide them like, you know, your

282
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,940
pita pit punch card in there with a little notes like, hey, three more punches on this

283
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
bad boy and you're off to pita town.

284
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,580
No problem.

285
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,900
No problem at all.

286
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,260
Get something at the library.

287
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,820
My treat.

288
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,980
This is my library card.

289
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,540
Also, you owe them $6.75 in late fees.

290
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,500
Pay my late fees.

291
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,220
Happy birthday.

292
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,620
Do you guys want Yahoo?

293
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,820
I didn't get an affirmative word.

294
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,820
That was like the first time you said nothing.

295
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,180
I was scootching around a little bit.

296
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:11,460
My Chrome tabs are just a network of me trying to figure out in real time who the fuck Rhea

297
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,860
Pearlman is and how I possessed that name.

298
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,140
I think that gets you on some kind of watch list.

299
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,660
I don't think so.

300
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,940
I think next time I get on Netflix, it's going to be like, we heard you're interested in

301
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,900
Rhea Pearlman.

302
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,140
Here's a fuck ton of cheers.

303
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,660
It gets you on Rhea Pearlman's personal Google alerts.

304
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,220
Hey, I heard you were craving my waves.

305
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,740
You got any work for me?

306
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,780
Check this shit out.

307
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,820
Matilda 2.

308
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,300
It's not a thing, but it could be.

309
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
Patreon me.

310
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,940
Matilda's mom stars in Matilda 2.

311
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,780
Matilda 2, the story you really wanted to follow for that.

312
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,660
Forget about Miss Honey.

313
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,580
Forget about that magic little tyke.

314
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,020
You got Matilda's mom.

315
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,140
No, I got her back.

316
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
I got you back, didn't I, Matilda?

317
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,300
Somebody stole my child.

318
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,380
How do I not have the audience's sympathy?

319
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,740
My child's been abducted.

320
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,420
How about this Yahoo?

321
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,780
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

322
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,980
Yeah, Drew, Drew Davenport.

323
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,460
Thank you, Drew.

324
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user David, who asks,

325
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,500
can a teenager have a personal bodyguard

326
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,940
for a short amount of time?

327
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,820
If so, what website can I go to sign up for this?

328
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,060
Prices would be nice.

329
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,980
This person's asking us to do a lot of legwork, huh?

330
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,540
OK, gut reaction.

331
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,380
Bodyguards have to be expensive,

332
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
or else everyone would have one, right?

333
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,540
Like, it feels like a thing that everyone would want

334
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,820
if it were cost-effective.

335
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,300
I feel like everyone, a lot of people,

336
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,100
I shouldn't say everyone,

337
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,380
because I wouldn't count myself in this assembly,

338
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,140
but I feel like a lot of folks saw

339
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,300
the comedy classic, Trillbit Taylor,

340
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,860
and they saw that and they thought,

341
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,900
hey, that would be nice.

342
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,540
But if you think about it, that movie was,

343
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,860
and I saw a little bit of it on a plane,

344
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,140
that movie was a lot about an adult Owen Wilson

345
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,860
going around and beating the shit out of little kids.

346
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,340
And they don't let you do that so much.

347
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,820
No, not legally, no.

348
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,420
They let you do it once,

349
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,340
and then after that they pretty much put a stop to it.

350
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,740
The principal will go up to Owen Wilson and be like,

351
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,580
Owen, you need to stop, because they're children.

352
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,020
Owen, you're punching children.

353
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,660
And he's like, yeah, I punched a kid.

354
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,580
That was the worst thing I've ever seen.

355
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,940
That was the worst.

356
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,500
And he'll explain to them,

357
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,420
no, you see, I'm a professional.

358
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,100
I'm a professional body.

359
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,500
When you tell the principal of the school

360
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,980
that you're terrorizing, that you're a professional.

361
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,340
I'll leave your school for $1 million.

362
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
You know, there was never a scene in First Kid

363
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,020
where Sinbad beat up a bunch of kids.

364
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,700
At least I don't remember that happening.

365
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,220
But in that movie, Sinbad can't explain to a principal

366
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,340
or other adult, no, you see, I'm a paid professional.

367
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,580
That doesn't get them off your case.

368
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,220
You're still beating up a bunch of kids, Owen Wilson.

369
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,580
In every movie where somebody has a bodyguard,

370
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,300
especially if it's the president's teenage daughter,

371
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,260
there is inevitably a scene where the daughter

372
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,580
pulls some shenanigans or hijinks

373
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,340
and manages to shake her bodyguard

374
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,380
and get out there on the town.

375
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,260
Or at least that's the way it always happened in West Wing.

376
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,060
That is a freedom that I will never know.

377
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,340
I'll never know the suffocation

378
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,260
of having personal protection

379
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,420
and just like the ensuing freedom

380
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,820
when I managed to lose that protection

381
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,980
down like a blind alley or something like that.

382
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,620
Like I'll never be able to experience that

383
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,900
without laying out some cash.

384
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,580
It bothers me though that in movies like that,

385
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,860
when that scenario happens,

386
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,980
that the next scene isn't the bodyguard's boss

387
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,660
being like, what the fuck?

388
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,820
She's 16 and you lost her?

389
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,700
You're the worst secret agent at like,

390
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,300
why are we paying you?

391
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,580
You got outsmarted by like a 12 year old kid.

392
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,260
You're the worst.

393
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,740
You're really bad.

394
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,660
Like how are you supposed to stop Osama?

395
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Justin, I do wanna point out that

396
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,220
I know that sometimes you slip off that ankle monitor

397
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,260
that I gave you and you go eat some point-free cookies.

398
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,540
Some cookies that you did not exchange

399
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,940
a fair amount of cookie points for.

400
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,460
You didn't earn those cookie points

401
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,700
by eating cucumbers or whatnot.

402
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,460
And I think that you should get a similar thrill

403
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
for tricking me in that way.

404
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,780
That is a great point, Griffin.

405
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,300
If I'm gonna hire a bodyguard,

406
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,420
I need to hire a bodyguard from the most clear

407
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,620
and present danger to my body, and that is me.

408
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,020
I need someone to literally guard my body

409
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:06,580
from my various advances and hurtful attacks

410
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,820
that I launch against my body on a regular basis.

411
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,380
Yeah, and for me, that would just be sloth, I think.

412
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
Just like, hey, get up and do something.

413
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,580
Like, nope.

414
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,340
Ha-ha, I'm free of you at last, body-bodyguard.

415
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,460
Can you imagine Griffin just going full

416
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,580
dead man's float, cordwood,

417
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,420
trying to force a bodyguard to pick him up off the floor?

418
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,060
That's hard.

419
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,260
It's a lot of weight to try to just get up from a dead lift.

420
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,500
Did the kid in blank check hire a bodyguard?

421
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,980
No, he hired a driver.

422
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,540
I think maybe fought some guys for him.

423
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,740
But I don't think he hired a trained hit man

424
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,460
or something like that.

425
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,620
That is a good question, right?

426
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,740
Your blank check, you have a million dollars,

427
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,700
maybe $500 after you bought all your house

428
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,220
in your various accoutrement.

429
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,980
You realize that the mob is after you

430
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
to get the money back, right?

431
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,940
Wouldn't the most obvious course of action

432
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,540
be to hire a professional to remedy the situation for you

433
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,060
for one-tenth of the money?

434
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,740
Listen, I have a million dollars, I will cut you $100,000.

435
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,620
The only thing you have to do is find anybody

436
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,300
who knows anything about this money

437
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,540
and wipe them off the face of the earth.

438
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,220
Eliminate them.

439
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,820
Bring me the head of Tone Loc.

440
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,740
I would watch that movie.

441
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,220
How am I supposed to sleep at night

442
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,100
knowing Tone Loc is out there hungry for my kid blood?

443
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,600
And why?

444
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,260
And why?

445
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,460
For a million?

446
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,100
That's it?

447
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,540
Tone Loc is also very loosely associated with this whole thing.

448
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,660
How much money would I have to pay you

449
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,700
to murder Tone Loc?

450
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,740
Two million dollars?

451
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,900
Fine, I'll find the other million somewhere.

452
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,860
I'll pinch pennies.

453
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,420
Also, I want to remind you guys

454
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,100
that Tone Loc in this scenario

455
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,940
was just supposed to be the pickup man.

456
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,300
Like, it's not his money.

457
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,100
He's very loosely associated with the blank check scenario.

458
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,980
And yet he is on board with murdering this child

459
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,580
from the jump where he's just like,

460
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,620
I'm here to pick up the money.

461
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,980
And they're like, I already gave it to someone.

462
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,700
And he's like, all right, well, I guess I gotta kill that kid.

463
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,580
Tone Loc?

464
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,940
It took no convincing.

465
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,980
I guess I'll kill that kid.

466
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,540
Like, why?

467
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,220
What?

468
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,260
What are you talking about?

469
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,580
That's so far removed from the solution that we...

470
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,940
Guys, I'm a staunch detractor from the death penalty.

471
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,420
I don't support it in any circumstance,

472
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,380
except for this one.

473
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
Just let Tone Loc fry.

474
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,620
He's a monster.

475
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,300
He's out there terrorizing kids.

476
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,860
He's gone Tone Loco.

477
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,780
And there's no coming back from that.

478
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,580
We all agree.

479
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,100
Tone Loc showed up at Mr. Wilson's house.

480
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,820
Like, hey, if Dennis is being too much of a menace for you,

481
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,260
I can eliminate him.

482
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,540
Like, that's absolutely not what I would want Tone Loc at all.

483
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,380
Like, he is a menace.

484
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,060
But that just means like sometimes he messes up my azalea bushes.

485
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,900
Like, I don't want him killed.

486
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,100
What are you talking about?

487
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,500
Let me see.

488
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:56,980
Let me see.

489
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,700
Oh my God, it looks like he's destroyed your ship in a bottle.

490
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,740
I'll fucking teach him something about death.

491
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,780
Tone Loc?

492
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,280
What?

493
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,000
Hey, Papa Dinosaur, are you tired of the baby dinosaur telling you that you're not the mama?

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,640
Well, I might have a person who could slip a little something into his Gerbers,

495
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,520
if you know what I mean.

496
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:24,280
Are you talking about killing my baby dinosaur by poisoning his Gerbers prehistoric rat puree?

497
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,320
Hey, Hulk Hogan, how would you like it there to be zero ninjas?

498
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,240
Well, Tone Loc, I don't think I'd like that very much.

499
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,960
I have an image to uphold that I'm going to spend the next decade dismantling brick by brick,

500
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,880
and I don't want to do it all at once, okay?

501
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,040
I need a little runaway, my dude.

502
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,400
Oh, man.

503
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,880
Tone Loc, cut it out.

504
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,720
Stop killing kids, Tone Loc.

505
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,280
Stop it.

506
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,720
Read another question.

507
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,600
Hey, you know sometimes people tag people on Twitter?

508
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,240
No, don't, please don't.

509
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,360
Please don't tag Tone Loc and say, hey, there's a great dis-

510
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,560
People did that, we talked about killing Tom Baudette a lot on our other show,

511
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,280
The Adventure Zone, and a lot of people were like, Tommy, you gotta check this dude out.

512
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,680
Listen, how much these guys talk about killing you.

513
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,240
You're gonna love it.

514
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Now, I mean, no press is bad press, I guess, but this does not apply.

515
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,240
Here we have another question.

516
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,720
I'm looking for some social awareness advice here.

517
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,960
No one likes a spoiler, but at some point they lose their potency.

518
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,760
Clearly, I'm not going to discuss the happenings of the Nick the day after it

519
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,120
airs loudly in a group of people, but if they don't know Bruce Willis,

520
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,680
I can't finish the sentence, but there's a sixth sense spoiler here,

521
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,520
then they have missed the boat.

522
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,600
What is the timeframe in which a spoiler transitions to socially acceptable conversation fodder?

523
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,320
That's from Spoiler Free in Sydney.

524
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,960
As somebody who dropped a Firefly spoiler on our other podcast,

525
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,800
The Adventure Zone thinking, hey, that movie came out like nine fucking years ago.

526
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,240
Uh, longer than nine years, because I got an earful from a lot of folks.

527
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,360
Well, that's the thing is, this is, it's all context, because if you look at someone,

528
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,840
like if you're having a conversation about sixth sense and the person says,

529
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,360
oh, I've never seen it, then like that, then, then is too early.

530
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,520
Like if they're like, yeah, I saw it, or they're like, I'm never going to see it.

531
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,080
So what, we're just never supposed to talk about,

532
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,480
we're never supposed to talk about the fact that, you know,

533
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,960
Bruce Willis was a reincarnated horse the whole time, like to anybody,

534
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,200
just because one person on earth hasn't seen it.

535
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,360
When can you casually blurt things out?

536
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,360
And I think that there has to be,

537
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,680
so probably different rules have to apply to television shows and movies,

538
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,760
because if you really cared about a movie,

539
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,440
like just clear your schedule for two hours and like watch it.

540
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,480
But there's spoilers in TV shows where it's going to take you some seasons of like,

541
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,440
the OC is a perfect example, right?

542
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,920
I'm not going to spoil the end of the third season of the OC for you,

543
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,840
because it's going to take you a long time to get there.

544
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,240
And I've worked so hard just to get you to check it out,

545
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,120
because it's really, really, really a fucking amazing program.

546
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,240
Let's change the subject.

547
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,360
There's no answer to this.

548
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,240
I mean, you just got to be as cautious as possible in polite company, I think.

549
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,360
And also, like, please, if you've had five years to watch,

550
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,680
I think the better answer is this.

551
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,720
If you've had like years upon years to watch something,

552
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,280
don't get butt hurt when you find out what happened on the thing.

553
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,680
I'm about a year behind Game of Thrones.

554
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm a fairly good sketch of what happens in the season of Game of Thrones

555
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,840
that I keep putting off watching.

556
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,920
I can't get mad about that.

557
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
I should have watched it.

558
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,160
Yeah, if you really wanted to see it, you'd see it.

559
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,200
Just go see it.

560
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,360
It clearly didn't matter that much to you.

561
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,240
We actually, we got another question about spoilers this week,

562
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
and so we'll just lump these together.

563
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,760
And the question was, hey brothers,

564
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
sometimes I go out to see a movie with my friends

565
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,000
and we take a cab or Uber home.

566
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,360
What's the policy on talking about the movie in a cab or Uber?

567
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,000
Should we worry about spoiling the movie for the driver?

568
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,840
And that's for blabbing in the Big Apple.

569
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,920
That's a meaty question.

570
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
That's a savory meatball right there.

571
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,720
I just want to pop that in my mouth and just work it over.

572
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,960
Damn, that's a good question.

573
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,520
You need to agree on a code before you get in the car.

574
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,320
By which I mean, if you go to see, let's say, Night of the Roxbury II,

575
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,200
the Will Ferrell character whose name, of course, is Roxy,

576
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,400
and the Chris Kattan character whose name is Barry,

577
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,320
don't refer to them by those character names.

578
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,000
So you want to create new ones like Little Nick or Tom Bombadil.

579
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,640
Or Fat Hog.

580
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,880
And you would just, Fat Hog and Tom Bombadil,

581
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,520
and talk about their adventures that way.

582
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,960
The driver will have no idea what you're talking about.

583
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,240
Though you may want to consult the driver

584
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,160
because maybe this is how they watch movies.

585
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,160
Maybe they don't go to the theater

586
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,800
because they just get sort of the second hand movies.

587
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,400
No, no, please go on.

588
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,760
Did you see the new Star Wars?

589
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,440
Yeah, dude, I saw it like 17 times at this point.

590
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,240
I loved it.

591
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,880
I loved it when Blart Vader went in and he fought a bunch of guys

592
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,960
and then he farted in my car.

593
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,800
It's terrible.

594
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,320
I really liked the part where Princess Leia kissed Han on the mouth

595
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,640
and it was like that sweet music played.

596
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,920
And then someone spilled like half of a Sprite in my back seat

597
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,160
of my car that I own.

598
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,640
That's like my car and my super sticky seat.

599
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,720
And I really liked that part of the movie.

600
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,200
Would you agree that there's a huge difference

601
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,400
between doing this in an Uber or Lyft versus a cab?

602
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,680
There's something about it that seems like in a cab,

603
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,800
I wouldn't worry about it.

604
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,880
I would just have the conversation.

605
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,800
But in Lyft and Uber, I'd be like,

606
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
now this person is basically my buddy at this point.

607
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,800
They did pick me up from my house

608
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
and I'm sitting in their Toyota Corolla

609
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,960
and listening to their CD of bird sounds.

610
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,640
I'm not just going to talk about Zoolander 2 in front of them.

611
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,200
I bet it's a pretty funny gag

612
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,920
if you're going to get some dinner with your friend

613
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,400
that's an Uber driver if you get in the back seat.

614
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,640
I bet they probably get a big kick out of that.

615
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,200
Hey, just drive me wherever.

616
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I just need to be on the streets.

617
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,000
I say, once you get into the Uber,

618
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,520
say, all right, Derek or whatever their name is.

619
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,040
You know their name because it's on the app.

620
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,960
So like, hey, Derek, my name's Griffin.

621
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,080
What are you into?

622
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,920
And maybe they'll be like, I don't know.

623
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,120
I'm looking forward to getting home

624
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,320
playing that new Call of Duty

625
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,840
and being like, oh, cool, cool, cool.

626
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,200
The dog dies or whatever.

627
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,520
In the new Zoolander movie.

628
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,760
What, you intentionally spoil it?

629
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,480
Is that it?

630
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:03,980
Yeah.

631
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,720
Why?

632
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,120
Because that's a shady business, isn't it?

633
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,620
Uber.

634
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,720
I maybe haven't been following the tech press

635
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,560
as closely as maybe I should,

636
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,440
but people don't like what they're doing, right?

637
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Right, right, right.

638
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,400
Seems like they're rubbing some people the wrong way, maybe.

639
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,000
They're doing a lot of bad business out there.

640
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,880
Not to put too fine a point on it,

641
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
but they're doing some stuff

642
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,800
that I think a lot of people don't enjoy, I bet.

643
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,320
I think I have an answer to both questions at the same time.

644
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,540
Okay.

645
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,040
If you spoil something for the Uber driver

646
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,800
or the Lyft driver, you tip them extra.

647
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,720
If you spoil something for a friend,

648
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,800
you have to develop a sliding scale

649
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,960
that's like the length of time the thing has been out

650
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,360
and then you have to give them money for the spoiler.

651
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,440
Travis, I love the idea of dollar value,

652
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,320
but let me take the penalization one step further.

653
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,880
If you spoil something for the Uber driver,

654
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,280
then they get to ask you about movies

655
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,800
you have and have not seen

656
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,480
and wait till they find one that they have seen,

657
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,960
you have not, and they get to spoil the ending for you.

658
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,960
But that's a bad system because they could just be like,

659
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,440
hey, have you watched, you talk about,

660
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,640
oh, yeah, have you seen the new Star Wars?

661
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,200
The dog dies.

662
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,760
The guy's like, no, God, that, oh, okay.

663
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Well, tell me what, have you seen The Wire?

664
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,280
Yes, I have seen The Wire.

665
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,800
Because I haven't finished The Wire.

666
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,960
I certainly don't want that one spoiled for me.

667
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,400
And I just said that.

668
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,240
Now, that's like my whole Twitter next week.

669
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,400
But like, then I can just lie about it.

670
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,480
But then I have to prove that I've seen it

671
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,000
and they actually make you spoil it for them

672
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,360
to make sure you're not lying.

673
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,040
Have I taken it a layer too far?

674
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Like, have you seen The Wire?

675
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,760
Yeah, okay, well, what happens to Greg?

676
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Greg gets shot.

677
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,400
Damn, okay, you have seen The Wire.

678
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,640
That is the ultimate fate of Greg, you got it.

679
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,880
You don't have to worry too much, Griffin.

680
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Nobody's actually finished The Wire.

681
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,160
Everybody's gotten two and a half seasons in and thought,

682
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
oh, I just can't anymore.

683
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,600
I just can't.

684
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,480
Just like Dexter.

685
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,920
Except after the first season in Dexter,

686
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,400
they were like, and now season two of Dexter

687
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,080
with nobody you've ever met before

688
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,880
and a lot of it takes place on some boats.

689
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,080
Like, cool, bye.

690
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,880
Did you like those characters?

691
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Sure, yeah, I kind of liked those characters.

692
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,320
What if none of them were there

693
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,400
and you were just in an ugly shipping yard?

694
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,840
I guess that would be okay.

695
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,200
Let's try it.

696
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,480
No, not for me.

697
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,760
Oh, I don't like it.

698
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,640
Let's go to the money zone.

699
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,760
Too many crates.

700
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:56,920
My brother, My Brother, Me is supported in part by harrys.com.

701
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,120
Hey, you guys do Movember?

702
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,760
Anybody on this call can go visual hair Travis?

703
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,640
I do Mo Life.

704
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,160
Mo Life.

705
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,400
And then I just dedicate, I donate money to everybody.

706
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm doing Mo Rocca, by which I mean Mo Rocca and I.

707
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,360
You're dating Mo Rocca.

708
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,640
I'm dating Mo Rocca.

709
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,280
He's my boy.

710
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,440
Hey guys, he's my boyfriend, okay?

711
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,520
Harry's is the official partner of the Movember Foundation

712
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,120
and also the Mo Rocca Foundation.

713
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
Which is just mine and Mo Rocca's relationship.

714
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm very supportive of his endeavors.

715
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,640
I love his stuff on CBS Sunday morning and Monday morning.

716
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,840
Every day of the week.

717
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Every day of the week is Mo Rocca day for me, baby.

718
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,520
I like my mother.

719
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,560
I just donated $25 to protect Mo Rocca

720
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,120
because there's only one Mo Rocca left on earth.

721
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,680
Did you guys know that?

722
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,640
You're kidding me.

723
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,760
Yeah, there's only one.

724
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,000
Huh?

725
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,080
Yeah, so we have to put him into like a reserve.

726
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,760
He's gonna need to protect him.

727
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,640
You won't need to see, you won't get to see him anymore.

728
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,400
We have to protect him from you.

729
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,520
At least until we can find another Mo Rocca to mate him with.

730
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,480
And then it'll be, okay, so Harry's makes razors

731
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,960
and they're donating money to help raise awareness

732
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,280
for men's health to the Movember Foundation.

733
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,800
Harry's makes a really good quality razor

734
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,720
and they got a starter set for 15 bucks.

735
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,080
You're gonna get a razor,

736
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,880
you're gonna get a foaming shave gel or shave cream

737
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,000
and three razor blades plus free shipping.

738
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,480
Now that seems expensive, I know.

739
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,000
I mean, sorry, it seems cheap.

740
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,360
It doesn't seem expensive.

741
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,960
It seems like a very good value,

742
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,480
but we can get you a better value.

743
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,280
Go to harrys.com and get $5 off the starter set

744
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,600
if you use the code, my brother, all one word.

745
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,440
That's harrys.com for $5 off the starter set

746
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,640
with the code, my brother, all one word.

747
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,280
Start shaving better today.

748
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,400
Can I tell you guys about Blue Apron?

749
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,360
I wish you would.

750
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay, so Blue Apron has effectively

751
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,080
changed the way Teresa and I do dinner.

752
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,120
Same, same.

753
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,440
We, yeah, like for a long,

754
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,520
like we have always liked to cook

755
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,160
and now we do Blue Apron like three nights a week.

756
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
And the thing is, the beautiful thing about it is

757
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
whether you already love to cook,

758
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,400
this is just going to like suffuse your repertoire of meals.

759
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,960
And if you are someone who's never cooked before,

760
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,880
it comes with step-by-step instructions

761
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,280
and all the ingredients you need to make the meal.

762
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,680
So you don't have to like go out shopping,

763
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,000
worry about what it means when it says this

764
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
and how much of what do you need.

765
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,200
It all comes there in a box

766
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,440
and you make these amazing meals.

767
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,760
And for Teresa and I, the two person options,

768
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,240
it always leaves us with like leftovers

769
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,000
that we eat over the next couple of days.

770
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,880
And it's less than $10 a meal

771
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,240
and it's full of fresh ingredients

772
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,600
that are healthy for you.

773
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,360
Each balanced meal is 500 to 700 calories per serving.

774
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,960
So it's a really great deal.

775
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,800
And coming up, they have some amazing,

776
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,720
so like they've got stuff like

777
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,000
harissa lamb and beef burgers with roasted carrot fries.

778
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,640
Let's see, roasted sweet potato and caramelized onion pizza.

779
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,400
Did you get that chicken cow soy soup?

780
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,240
Did you get that with the yellow curry?

781
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,080
Oh my God, that shit was amazing.

782
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,120
How good was that?

783
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,560
I also want to point out,

784
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,840
they did a really cool thing this week

785
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,120
where you can donate your meals.

786
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,160
Instead of having them delivered,

787
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,240
you could donate them to a food bank.

788
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,000
They donated like 82,000 dinners for Thanksgiving for people,

789
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,800
which I thought was really nice.

790
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,360
That's nice.

791
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,920
This is one of those things where like,

792
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,920
we're telling you about a service we use.

793
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,280
Sure, they're a sponsor of the show,

794
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,400
they support the show,

795
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,000
but like Teresa and I tell all our friends about it.

796
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,360
You know, we're big fans.

797
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,640
And here's the thing,

798
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,680
right now I'm considering,

799
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,360
like I'm telling my friends about it,

800
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,280
the listeners of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

801
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,520
because if you go to blueapron.com slash my brother,

802
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,600
you will get your first two meals free

803
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,440
and you'll get to check it out.

804
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,000
Like it's, I promise you'll fall in love with it.

805
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,760
And two free meals, it's a great deal.

806
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,720
Go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

807
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,800
I got a message here and it's for Timmy.

808
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,120
Timmy, you guys remember South Park

809
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,560
and it's from your littlest niece, Maggie.

810
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
I'll cut out the South Park thing.

811
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,200
That was uncalled for.

812
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,600
No, you have to live it.

813
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
Don't you dare.

814
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm gonna keep mentioning your South.

815
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm gonna keep mentioning the South Park thing you said.

816
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
So you can't edit it out.

817
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Oh my God, you killed Timmy.

818
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,280
And it's from your littlest niece, Maggie.

819
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,560
And Maggie says to Timmy,

820
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,640
happy birthday, Uncle Timmy.

821
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,360
You are the best uncle and godfather in the world.

822
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,080
PS, I pooped in your pillowcase.

823
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Daddy said you like that kind of thing.

824
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,640
So this is from a baby.

825
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm guessing that Maggie's daddy

826
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,040
wrote this message to Timmy

827
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,480
or else we're dealing with an adult teen baby situation.

828
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,080
In which case I'm done.

829
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,520
We could also be in a baby geniuses situation.

830
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,320
That is a good point, Travis.

831
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,200
Didn't even consider that.

832
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,880
Or a baby stay out situation

833
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,960
in which the baby crawled across the keyboard

834
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
and miraculously, this is what came out.

835
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
You know, if you let a million babies stay out,

836
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,600
crawl across a million keyboards,

837
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,280
eventually they would make Hamlet.

838
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,000
Did you know that?

839
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,600
Do you guys think if a million babies stay outs

840
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,560
were all happening,

841
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,320
the movie we saw was the one survivor?

842
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,360
I think if you watch the other 999,999 baby day out,

843
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,800
like one of them like falls off of the steel beam.

844
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,440
And like dies.

845
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,920
They did have the heart to call the movie

846
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,960
its actual title,

847
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,200
which is babies day out experiment 24AB397.

848
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,680
Right.

849
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,400
Because that was-

850
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,320
That's actually what the movie theory of everything

851
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,720
was about in which Stephen Hawking theorizes

852
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,000
that out of the million different baby possibilities,

853
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,840
baby geniuses or babies day out

854
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
was the only one in which the baby lived.

855
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,440
So a million babies.

856
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,600
I'm saying like, fuck guys.

857
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,800
I don't know, like 213 die getting out of the crib.

858
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,880
And then like maybe only like 1400

859
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,960
make it to the construction site.

860
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,080
And then that proves to be a challenging crucible

861
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,840
for those babies to try and survive.

862
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,040
A lot of discussion of 90s kids flicks in this episode.

863
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,240
Got another message here though.

864
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,680
Please.

865
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,320
Thank you.

866
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,120
And it's for Ashley and it's from Tez,

867
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,000
who just says space jam.

868
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,360
The message just says space jam.

869
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,400
And then underneath that it says smart house.

870
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,440
So there it is.

871
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,720
No, Tez says to Ashley,

872
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,240
happy birthday to my podcast devouring Ryan Gosling

873
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,840
driving a total bamf of a wife.

874
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,440
Hope this message from the brothers

875
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,280
puts a huge smile on your face.

876
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,120
Lots of love from your husband.

877
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,480
Tez.

878
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,360
Tez.

879
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,560
The Tez dispenser.

880
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,680
Does she drive Ryan Gosling like a car?

881
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,240
I think so.

882
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,720
Because Ryan Gosling eats spicy food.

883
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,760
We did it guys.

884
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,600
We got our eight turbotin reference.

885
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,400
Confetti just shot out of all the lights and rails.

886
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,320
We can finally die eight times in our podcast.

887
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,080
We freed ourselves from this eternal podcast prison.

888
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,960
I'm like a genie or a Beetlejuice.

889
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,000
Let's re-reference turbotin eight times.

890
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,320
That was the lock they put on my eternal prison.

891
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,360
Those wizards that imprisoned me in this dark cage

892
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,280
so many eons ago say like,

893
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,680
well no one's going to talk about turbotin eight times.

894
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,000
You know how on the 100 lives of Blackjack Savage

895
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,280
he had to save a hundred people to save his soul?

896
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,840
We had to mention turbotin eight times

897
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,440
and the legend of the 100 lives of Blackjack Savage twice.

898
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,920
So we have fulfilled both of those criteria.

899
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,040
Now in a very, if I dare say, organic fashion.

900
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,280
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

901
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,080
And I'm Erin Gibson.

902
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,320
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

903
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,560
On Throwing Shade we look at an issue important to ladies

904
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,160
and an issue important to gay people

905
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,600
and then we basically make fun of it.

906
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,360
Yeah and just to answer your question,

907
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,720
no we don't have a marriage pact.

908
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,200
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30

909
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,080
we're going to do that for each other.

910
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,960
No, that's true.

911
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Although we have each been divorced three times.

912
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,200
How about a Yahoo?

913
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,160
Yeah, this Yahoo was sent in by Amanda Morhamy Aponte.

914
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,920
I think I crushed that.

915
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,480
Amanda, thank you.

916
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

917
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,120
Sorry something has gone wrong.

918
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,080
Let's call them.

919
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,600
Nope, sorry something's gone wrong.

920
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,720
What the fuck guys?

921
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,520
Yahoo fix your shit.

922
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,680
Let's say their name is Morgus.

923
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,280
Morgus, Morgus.

924
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,160
Morgus.

925
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,440
No, you're saying it wrong.

926
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,000
Morgus.

927
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,320
Morgus.

928
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,040
That's better.

929
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,160
Morgus asks, what would Quantum Leap have been like

930
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,600
if Scott Bakula's character were played by a horse?

931
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,280
I'm just wondering if you think the series would have been

932
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,480
as well received if a horse had played Dr. Sam Beckett.

933
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,160
How do you think it would have been different?

934
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,840
What horse actor would you choose to replace Mr. Bakula?

935
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,320
I said his name twice there in two different ways

936
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,080
just to sort of hedge my bets.

937
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,400
What?

938
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,920
Read the question again.

939
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,080
I can't even fucking parse it.

940
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,360
Because it's so great?

941
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,160
I agree.

942
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,440
What would Quantum Leap have been like

943
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,240
if Scott Bakula's character were played by a horse?

944
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,840
Just wondering, what are you tripping up on?

945
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,360
Which part of this are you tripping up on?

946
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,200
Instead of the human Scott Bakula,

947
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,160
we're dealing with a horse.

948
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,880
A horse is Dr. Sam Beckett traveled back through time,

949
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,720
but something went all wiry,

950
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,920
and then he ended up in a baseball legend,

951
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,680
and then he had to be the baseball legend.

952
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,560
So he was a horse,

953
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,640
but everybody else just sees the baseball legend.

954
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,080
But it's a horse, so he can't pitch there.

955
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,440
So he's a horse in a human body?

956
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,040
Yes.

957
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,680
I'm saying we're gonna have an episode

958
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,360
that is gonna teach everyone,

959
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,960
including Ian Griffin McElroy,

960
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,560
about the difficulties that people went through

961
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,320
during the civil rights struggle.

962
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,520
But they'd be struggling even more with opening a door.

963
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,680
Because horse hooves.

964
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,000
Griffin, I think the thing

965
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,920
that most trips me up about this question

966
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
is the question, would it be as well received?

967
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,120
Because basically what you're saying is,

968
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,640
if I almost completely changed inherently-

969
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,040
No.

970
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,200
What could possibly happen in the show?

971
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,840
Disagree.

972
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,760
Are we, okay, okay.

973
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,760
We're changing one thing,

974
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,560
and that is the specie of Dr. Sam Beckett from human.

975
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,480
We're gonna take that, we're gonna hit control F,

976
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,080
find all human, replace with horse.

977
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,520
Now, but here's my question, Griffin,

978
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,920
is it a talking horse scenario?

979
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,120
Is this a Mr. Ed,

980
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,680
or is this just like a Black Beauty scenario

981
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,600
where it's just a horse?

982
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,320
Right.

983
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,280
Am I gonna get a scene where like one aide

984
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,040
confidentially whispers to another,

985
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,200
why is President Kennedy eating oats?

986
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,520
Like all the time, always eating oats.

987
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,280
Sam, it seems like in order to get the leap this time,

988
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,120
you're gonna have to be Elvis

989
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,920
and perform at the Grand Ole Opry.

990
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Do you think you can handle that?

991
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,040
Oh, shit.

992
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,760
Probably not, it doesn't seem like.

993
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,720
I think singing might be a little-

994
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,080
Oh yeah, you don't know English.

995
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,120
It doesn't seem like you are any language for that matter.

996
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,320
I guess it's true what they say,

997
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,600
you can lead a horse to water,

998
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,800
but you can't make him leap.

999
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,760
And then he would laugh, and then he would leap.

1000
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,880
The episodes would be very short.

1001
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,480
And then he would leap.

1002
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:31,320
What I think we can all agree on is that Al, you know, Al Kalivici.

1003
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,360
Yeah.

1004
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,400
Rear Admiral-

1005
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,560
Did you have to fucking Google his last name?

1006
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,800
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Kalivici,

1007
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,440
while everyone else sees the person that has been leapt into,

1008
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,040
Al continues to see Sam Beckett.

1009
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,800
So by extension,

1010
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,680
Al would see a horse doing human things all the time.

1011
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,800
So basically what I'm saying is

1012
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,080
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Kalivici

1013
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,840
would have the best job on Planet Earth.

1014
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,480
He would be telling you-

1015
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,240
I actually think it would be better received.

1016
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,120
Put in that context, the show would probably be better received.

1017
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,440
Yeah.

1018
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,120
Like, how's your job, Al?

1019
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,920
Yeah, it's actually like really good.

1020
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,840
What I do is I watch a horse pretend to do human things

1021
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,280
and everybody else tries to figure out

1022
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,360
why the human is acting like a horse.

1023
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,840
It's basically a delight, nine to five delight, constant delight.

1024
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,520
Was your client able to save Jacqueline Kennedy?

1025
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,160
No, but he did take a boob in the middle of the Oval Office.

1026
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,280
Let's use that specific Emmy Award-winning series of episodes

1027
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,560
where Dr. Sam Beckett hopped into Lee Harvey Oswald.

1028
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,840
Fucking, by the way, we joke about quantum-

1029
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,040
Listen, guys, we tell a lot of jokes about quantum leaf in this show.

1030
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,600
Go watch that series of episodes,

1031
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,000
because it's fucking stellar television.

1032
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,520
It's about as good as TV gets.

1033
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,320
Let's talk about, though, I think that that situation would have played out differently

1034
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,880
if Lee Harvey Oswald, instead of having an itchy trigger finger,

1035
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,200
had gunproof hooves.

1036
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,200
How is he supposed to do it?

1037
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,400
How is he supposed to do it?

1038
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,520
That's true.

1039
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,240
Maybe this explains the whole thing, right?

1040
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,520
There wasn't a third man.

1041
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,880
There was no shooter on the hill.

1042
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,280
What happened was he was just as fast as a very fast horse.

1043
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,760
Lee Harvey Oswald could run at very fast speeds

1044
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,080
and that enabled him to take all the shots himself.

1045
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,840
Of course.

1046
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,880
Didn't even think about that.

1047
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,360
I want to revise my previous statement, by the way.

1048
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,160
It would not be a great job because the novelty-

1049
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:36,120
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Calvici would not have a very good job

1050
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,120
because in order for Sam Beckett to leap,

1051
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,760
he had to fulfill a certain set of criteria.

1052
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,000
I think we could all agree that a horse leapt into a human body

1053
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,920
would not be able to fulfill almost any of the criteria

1054
00:48:52,920 --> 00:49:00,360
that Dr. Sam Beckett had to meet in every single episode in order to leap.

1055
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:08,360
What I'm offering is this, that it would permanently be a horse

1056
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,240
in the body of Tom Stratton, an Air Force test pilot

1057
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,840
about to attempt a dangerous flight.

1058
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,680
It would just be a horse trying to fly a plane forever

1059
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,640
and he wouldn't be able to, so it would just be Al like,

1060
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,920
Al, how's your job?

1061
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,840
Well, my job's pretty bad, actually.

1062
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,280
I have to watch a horse try to fly a plane every day.

1063
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,600
Over and over and over and over again.

1064
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,800
I'm stuck in some kind of purgatory state.

1065
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,560
What if he leapt regardless of whether he succeeded or failed?

1066
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,960
And so his job would just be watching as a horse freaks the fuck out

1067
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,040
while Patricia Richardson gets strangled in the back of a car

1068
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,080
or something like that.

1069
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,880
Actually, Patricia Richardson was in the series

1070
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,120
where they were in a radio station on strike

1071
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,840
and I don't think anybody was in mortal danger that episode,

1072
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,720
but so incompetent is this horse Beckett

1073
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,400
that Patricia Richardson would find a way to get stabbed to death

1074
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,240
by Chubby Checker or some shit.

1075
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:04,280
Griffin, you are the resident Quantum Leap expert.

1076
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,240
Let me ask you a quick question.

1077
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,640
My wife is a Quantum Leap expert.

1078
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,800
If I know anything about that show, I am.

1079
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,120
I have gained it through osmosis.

1080
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,480
Is there any backstory or explanation of where Al goes when he's not?

1081
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,840
Does he, because he's in his present time, right?

1082
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,320
Yeah.

1083
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,240
As a hologram talking to Sam.

1084
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,120
So he goes home and hangs out.

1085
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,920
So he's got, there would be scenes at a bar

1086
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,920
where he's talking to the bartender about that stupid fucking horse Beckett,

1087
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,040
again, not being able to figure out stairs, right?

1088
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,520
Yeah.

1089
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,000
That would definitely be a scene we would love to see.

1090
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,920
That would definitely be a scene we would see.

1091
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,440
And that bar is called Cheers.

1092
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,000
Do you remember that Happo Zone Cheers, right?

1093
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,800
Where fucking Al Calavichie just like walks in and everyone's like,

1094
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,600
Al!

1095
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,800
He's like, how's your job today?

1096
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,560
It's like pretty bad.

1097
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,040
I watched Patricia Richardson just get the life completely strangled out of her

1098
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,960
while a horse like did nothing.

1099
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,080
Hey, that's pretty crazy.

1100
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,280
That means none of those words mean anything to any of us.

1101
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,520
Yeah, I know.

1102
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,920
It's hard to find people to commiserate with me.

1103
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,120
I have a question for you.

1104
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,040
Quantum League is obviously a series that played with time travel.

1105
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,360
So there is no reason to think that Al's life would have to happen in parallel with it.

1106
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,840
What I'm saying is that he could queue up a bunch, right?

1107
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,920
Like he could just bang out a bunch of them in like an hour his time

1108
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,560
and just hop in where Sam, like a disc jockey,

1109
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,600
who's like prerecording his bits for a whole four hour shift.

1110
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,800
He could just bang out like three episodes worth in an afternoon.

1111
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,600
You know what?

1112
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,520
I'm going to revise my previous statement.

1113
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,200
Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Calvici has a great job.

1114
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,000
Because from like 9 to 1130,

1115
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,120
he has to watch a horse fuck up like three different things

1116
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,560
and then he gets to go home for the day and rebook and drink lemonade.

1117
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,160
And listen, at worst, he jumps back in to check on it

1118
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,000
and the horse is dead and he's free.

1119
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,920
He's free.

1120
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,000
Well, no, he would just leap into a different horse.

1121
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,360
Wait, but if the body that the anima of Dr. Sam Beckett was inhabiting died,

1122
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,360
did Dr. Sam Beckett not die?

1123
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,600
Was there like zero mortal risk for him?

1124
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,960
That's a tricky question, Travis.

1125
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,240
There is one episode where he's in a prisoner on death row

1126
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:26,440
and he gets put in the electric chair and he leaps while in the electric chair,

1127
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:33,480
which makes me think that death can move him on to the next puzzle to solve.

1128
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,040
Oh man, I wish they had played with that concept more.

1129
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,840
Yeah, I wish, by the way, that situation I just described,

1130
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,560
you heard that and you thought like, wow, what could they hop into next

1131
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,480
that would follow like the dramatic conclusion of an arc

1132
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,080
where he's in a prisoner on death row who gets executed?

1133
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,080
And then they followed that like heart wrenching drama up with like,

1134
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,440
oh no, you jumped into like a silly boy.

1135
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh no, you jumped into a clown.

1136
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,760
Oh no, it looks like I'm a woman again.

1137
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,040
How am I supposed to walk in high heels?

1138
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,800
Like, hi, you just died, Sam, Samuel.

1139
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,280
I have to revise my stance on Rear Admiral Al Calavichie

1140
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,720
because of the episode A Leap for Lisa, season four finale,

1141
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,680
Sam leaps into the body of Rear Admiral Upper Half Al Calavichie.

1142
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,960
Can you imagine Al Calavichie's day where he's like,

1143
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,400
he shows up to work and he's like, so what's on the agenda today?

1144
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,320
Oh well, there's good news and bad news.

1145
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,640
Actually, just bad news, a horse took your body

1146
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,960
and now a horse is in you forever.

1147
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,960
I think those would be the days where the other hologram guy,

1148
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,000
the really like ineffectual weird one,

1149
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,720
What are you talking about?

1150
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,960
Only jumped in for like three, there was another dude that like

1151
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,520
was there sometimes that wasn't Al.

1152
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,800
I don't think it was Ziggy.

1153
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,520
No, I'm not, there's another guy.

1154
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,440
I will be vindicated by the internet.

1155
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,280
I mean, there was an evil leaper who had their own Al,

1156
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,400
but it was a woman.

1157
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,200
There definitely wasn't another Al that they popped in

1158
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,840
when fucking Dean Stockwell was drunk

1159
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,920
and they couldn't get him on set.

1160
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,280
I am so right about this, but there's another guy,

1161
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,320
he's a little bit pudgy and I think he had like curly hair

1162
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,080
and he was sometimes there like filling in for Al

1163
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,520
when Al was busy.

1164
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,040
What are you talking about?

1165
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,520
That's absolutely real, I'm gonna Google it right now.

1166
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,080
Yeah, Google fat Al, idiot.

1167
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,560
He wasn't, he wasn't called Al,

1168
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,960
it wasn't like he was Al 2.0, it was like another like hologram.

1169
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,600
There were other people working on the project with them,

1170
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,880
but there wasn't another person

1171
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,640
that was allowed to get in the holo chamber.

1172
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,640
What are you talking about?

1173
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,280
There was.

1174
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,120
This is all, all the Gooshy side plot has been edited out

1175
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,000
of this episode.

1176
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,440
It's gonna be very confusing for people when they listen

1177
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,800
and it just goes straight from the money zone to this.

1178
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,000
If you're just rejoining us,

1179
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,960
you have just been spared a 10 minute conversation

1180
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,040
about Gooshy, a real quantum leap character

1181
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,000
that leapt in to help Sam Beck at once when Al was busy.

1182
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,160
And it was a not a very good segment,

1183
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,000
but it was all about Gooshy and you really can't deny that.

1184
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,440
Thank you, Dennis Wolfberg for your one contribution

1185
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,960
to My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1186
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,200
And I'm sorry that it was left on the cutting room floor.

1187
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,720
Maybe one day fucking archeologists

1188
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,240
will unearth the Gooshy tapes

1189
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,840
and everyone will have a nice laugh

1190
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,320
about the screaming argument Travis and I got into

1191
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,280
about Gooshy's, whether or not Gooshy,

1192
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,120
literally, if you wanna know what you're missing out on,

1193
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,040
yes, of course I know there was a Gooshy.

1194
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040
The argument, the screaming argument we had

1195
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,840
was whether or not he ever entered into Al's holo chamber.

1196
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,120
And I don't wanna revive the argument,

1197
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,040
but I'm still very frustrated about it.

1198
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,720
I never thought that an argument about a man named Gooshy

1199
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
would ever take place in my life

1200
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,560
or that I would ever feel so sure.

1201
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,640
He's torn another family apart.

1202
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,120
Yep.

1203
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,120
There was a virtual season of Quantum Leap

1204
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,800
that was all fan fiction.

1205
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,960
And one episode called Fallen Hero

1206
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,880
was about the death of Gooshy.

1207
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,360
Someone was so anti-Gooshy

1208
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,160
that they wrote fan fiction about the time he died.

1209
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,240
Anyway.

1210
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,280
That's savage.

1211
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,040
So this has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1212
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,440
By the way.

1213
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,040
It's a little bit of a short episode,

1214
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,800
but if you'd gotten the full Gooshy tapes,

1215
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,680
it would be a long episode.

1216
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,000
Short in that it was previously an hour and 45 minutes long.

1217
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,320
And most of that was Gooshy chat.

1218
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,640
By the way, if you listen to this

1219
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,560
and you work at Telltale Games,

1220
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,120
first of all, legally, you have to tell me where it's entrapment.

1221
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,440
Second of all, I will for free, for free,

1222
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,360
I will write the plot Bible and dialogue

1223
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,240
of a Quantum Leap adventure game series.

1224
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,080
I will do that shit for free.

1225
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,200
Tell me what it takes.

1226
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,120
And hey, would it kill you to throw Gooshy in there?

1227
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,920
Justin, it might kill me.

1228
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,640
Because I think I've developed a heart condition

1229
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,760
from this, again, screaming argument

1230
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,360
that Travis and I had about Gooshy.

1231
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,160
Can you play?

1232
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,240
Okay, Griffin, I have a special request for you.

1233
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,760
Can you include the entire Gooshy segment

1234
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,440
played at 1000 times speed

1235
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,800
or maybe 10,000 times speed in this segment?

1236
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,240
It would just be like, Gooshy out!

1237
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,920
I want you to include it here at the end of the podcast.

1238
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,680
So if someone is so inclined,

1239
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,960
they can take that audio,

1240
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,680
slow it down and enjoy the entire Gooshy conversation.

1241
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,600
I'm actually not going to do that

1242
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,920
because I'm embarrassed about how passionate,

1243
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,680
I don't get passionate about anything in this life anymore.

1244
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,640
I got very into the stuff that I thought

1245
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,240
happened to Gooshy and Quantum Leap.

1246
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,760
Very, very into it.

1247
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,120
This has been My Brother, My Brother Beats,

1248
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,240
a device show for the moderator.

1249
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,440
Thank you so much for listening.

1250
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,440
Thank you to Blue Apron.

1251
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,000
We can get two free meals by,

1252
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,200
they make cooking at home easy

1253
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,200
and you can get two meals for free

1254
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,400
by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

1255
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,120
Good news, if you haven't got enough of us this week,

1256
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,080
we have a very exciting project for you

1257
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,120
to enjoy, it's called Till Death Do Us Blart.

1258
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,680
It's a new annual podcast that will continue

1259
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,960
until the end of linear time.

1260
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,040
Starring, currently starring us

1261
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,240
and the guys from Worst Idea of All Time.

1262
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,880
It is a podcast that will continue forever.

1263
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,280
It will happen every year on American Thanksgiving.

1264
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,000
It will be released.

1265
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,080
It is a review and encapsulation

1266
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,640
of the film Paul Blart Mall Cop 2.

1267
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,960
You can find that on iTunes.

1268
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,760
You can find it wherever you,

1269
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,480
wherever fine podcasts are sold.

1270
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,680
If you wanna just subscribe, like old school,

1271
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,360
blart.libsyn.com slash RSS.

1272
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,800
You can just like get it.

1273
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,160
I'm gonna put my foot down.

1274
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,920
This podcast is gonna come out once a year.

1275
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,920
Don't subscribe to it.

1276
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,720
What are you doing?

1277
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,760
What are you talking about?

1278
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,600
Comes out once a year.

1279
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,800
But I'm gonna put out some secret stuff.

1280
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,840
But do download.

1281
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,920
But I'm gonna put out some secret stuff throughout the year.

1282
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,720
What's funnier than a subscription to a podcast

1283
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,920
that releases once a year?

1284
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,720
That's like, oh, I subscribe to the new Star Wars movies.

1285
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,960
Every time they come out, I get a little email alert.

1286
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,360
Really?

1287
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,880
They probably come out more frequently

1288
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,120
till death do us blart.

1289
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,160
That is a good point.

1290
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,360
Please subscribe to the show

1291
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,880
cause it helps us on iTunes

1292
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,880
and we wanna be a big success there.

1293
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,120
We also wanna make sure that everybody knows about

1294
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,280
Candle Nights, our annual holiday pan-religious,

1295
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,600
pan-sexual, personal pan holiday,

1296
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,040
celebration, December 21st in Huntington, West Virginia.

1297
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,160
Tickets are still available.

1298
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,840
I think some people ran into problems

1299
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,520
because they used our old,

1300
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,400
like the Candle Nights link from last year.

1301
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,320
Make sure you go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights two,

1302
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,680
the number two.

1303
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,480
If you go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights,

1304
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,960
it's gonna take you to the link from 2014,

1305
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,520
which you can't get those tickets anymore

1306
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,760
unless you can leap back there like Gushy.

1307
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,280
So go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights two,

1308
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,560
come to Huntington, do our holiday thing with us.

1309
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,760
We're gonna hang out with you.

1310
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,320
We'll probably hang out afterwards.

1311
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,520
We're gonna have some beautiful posters, some merch.

1312
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,960
It was a great time last year.

1313
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,320
It's gonna be a great time this year

1314
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,360
and we hope to see you there.

1315
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,760
Oh, don't sleep on that because we're 60% sold out

1316
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,320
of that show.

1317
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,400
We've got less than a month.

1318
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,600
So you don't wanna miss out on that.

1319
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,880
Also, if you are coming, we have special rates for you

1320
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,920
at the Pullman Plaza Hotel, 866-613-3611

1321
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,520
or the Holiday Inn at the Big Sandy Arena,

1322
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,920
which is right next to the venue, 304-523-8880.

1323
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,720
Those are both 99 bucks if you ask them for the

1324
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,480
My Brother, My Brother, and Me rooms.

1325
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,600
So we got some discounts there if you wanna go that route.

1326
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,960
Also, I would recommend hopping on our Facebook group.

1327
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,800
Just search for My Brother, My Brother, and Me

1328
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,560
and see if anybody wants like carpool

1329
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,360
or like, you know, go in on a room or anything.

1330
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Cause you know, maybe Huntington's not super convenient

1331
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,120
but you wanna go.

1332
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,360
And if you could find like three other people to ride with,

1333
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,640
it would make it a lot more fun.

1334
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,920
So do that.

1335
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,240
Also, as long as you're following us

1336
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,360
and joining the group on Facebook,

1337
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,320
you should follow us on Twitter, at MBAM.

1338
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,760
And check out our YouTube channel.

1339
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,840
We have a lot of animated videos on there,

1340
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,600
a couple of live show clips.

1341
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,600
Justin put up the Till Death Do Us Blart preview on there,

1342
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,200
which is really, really good.

1343
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,640
There's lots of fun stuff on there.

1344
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,000
And we're really close to like 10,000 subscribers on YouTube,

1345
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,200
which I have chosen as a very personal goal

1346
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,320
that will finally make me feel

1347
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,920
like I've done something with my life.

1348
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,280
So go subscribe to us on YouTube and be awesome.

1349
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,720
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1350
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,800
for using our theme song, Into Departure,

1351
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,400
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1352
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,000
This is a really good album.

1353
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,080
So is When I Pretend to Fall.

1354
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,080
That's a good Long Winters album.

1355
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,000
John Roderick did a Christmas album,

1356
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,360
a holiday album with Jonathan Colton,

1357
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,320
which is also good.

1358
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,840
Yeah, good music all around.

1359
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,120
I wanna personally recommend,

1360
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,680
I have been listening to Quality Control,

1361
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,880
Justin, the Polygon game review podcast

1362
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,600
that Justin hosts and Griffin is regularly on.

1363
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,360
No joke, in the last like four days,

1364
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,680
I've listened to every episode that exists of it.

1365
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,880
Because not only is it a game review podcast,

1366
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,400
where you learn about games,

1367
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,080
it also like really lets you in on the review process

1368
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,640
and kind of teaches you not only about the games,

1369
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,840
but like how they look at them, how they review them,

1370
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,240
how they came up with the scores and reviews

1371
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,520
and everything for them.

1372
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,920
And it's really been incredibly enlightening

1373
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,440
and very, very funny.

1374
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,480
And even if you're like not a huge game player

1375
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,440
or interested in games,

1376
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,120
I think everybody would really like it.

1377
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,160
So go listen to Quality Control, I love it.

1378
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,840
Thanks, Trav, I appreciate it.

1379
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,360
Trav's got a great podcast too,

1380
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,200
called Trends Like These with his buddy, Brent.

1381
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,320
Both very funny dudes taking on the news of the day

1382
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,200
as it pertains to trending materials.

1383
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,040
And it's a very enjoyable show that I think you would like.

1384
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,280
So go get it, go fetch.

1385
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:33,800
Mongrel.

1386
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,040
Sing for your supper, gushy.

1387
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,840
It's the end of the show, right?

1388
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,160
We're done?

1389
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,600
Yeah, final Yahoo!

1390
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,160
Sent in by the level 9,000 YajuJu Javenport.

1391
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,880
Thank you, Drew.

1392
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,520
It's about a YajuAnswers user, MusicIsLife.

1393
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,320
I didn't, oh God.

1394
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,480
I didn't read their name until just now

1395
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,880
and their name combined with the subject matter of the question

1396
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,960
is, it's one of my new faves.

1397
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,200
MusicIsLife asks,

1398
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,840
what celebrity would you like to swim with?

1399
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,920
Why are you just gushing?

1400
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,040
I'm gushy.

1401
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:10,600
Stop it.

1402
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,160
This has been my brother, my brother.

1403
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,360
Can we kiss your gushy square?

1404
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:26,920
I'm gushy.

1405
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:43,880
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon

1406
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,560
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

1407
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,880
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

1408
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm a dragon man.

1409
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,960
I cast fire on him.

1410
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,760
It's very good.

1411
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,680
I address the red dragon and say,

1412
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,480
us, we're the hosts of the Adventure Zone, a podcast

1413
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,960
about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

1414
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,080
Very good synergy.

1415
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,960
Commit to the bit.

1416
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,560
I roll to charm new listeners.

1417
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,360
It is very effective against all odds.

1418
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,400
Everybody, we're the Mackroys.

1419
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,320
We host the Adventure Zones, a podcast where we play

1420
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,440
Dungeons and Dragons together.

1421
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,720
It's a comedy podcast.

1422
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,080
We don't take the rules too seriously

1423
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,120
because there's a lot of them

1424
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,480
and we did not take the time to learn them.

1425
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,200
Maybe listen to us.

1426
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,840
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

1427
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,560
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

1428
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:33,320
I think this promo is a critical hit.
