1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Travis, I don't know that I have questions.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I had emailed them to Christina, but I can email them again.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, it's just in the same, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No, that's all right, no, no, no.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It probably didn't have ads in it, right?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can just take a little time and just say I fucked up.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, I fucked up.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And I didn't anticipate your incompetence, and that was my fault.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, no, no, it's not my incompetence because you did not add to that.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, you definitely fucked this up.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, I fucked up because I forgot that both of you don't know how to search in your email.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's fine.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, no, the ads aren't, you didn't put the ads in, so you did fuck up.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, right, right, right, right.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I fucked up by not spitting and feeding you the ads.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm glad we decided to start doing these cold opens.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I feel like it lends a real air of excitement and intimacy to the program.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm a dog.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My name is Griffin McElroy, and I'm the youngest brother.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I have the intro.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's what Travis' last words to us.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, no, no, can I tell you, that was a completely separate thing.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I simply am a dog.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's consistency, Justin, and we've got to respect that.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, completely different thing.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Normally, my kind of bit here goes a little bit longer, but it's because I have an important presentation for you guys,

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and I appreciate you taking this time to hear said presentation.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Kind of out of our hands.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I really wouldn't participate.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hold on, Travis.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I need to sync up into the Google Buzz meeting room that you've set up here.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, hold on.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've got to download a flash update in order to see these slides.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hold on.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I didn't do slides.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Was I supposed to do slides?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, then what am I down—oh, virus.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So here's the thing.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think I'll leave a space here for you guys to answer.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is so hot right now?

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Breakfast.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Fast-food breakfasts.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's what you want in on that game.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Cryptocurrency.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, shoot.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And so I have been thinking that now here at the very start of the very idea of cryptocurrency,

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that the McElroy should get in on the ground floor, and that is why I have created McElbucks.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
McElbucks?

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Finally.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How much is it, Travis?

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just give me a number.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't bullshit me.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Griffin, let me tell you, that is point one of two points that separate McElbucks from

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
all of the cryptocurrency.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
One, McElbucks will always equal $1.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it'll be one McElbucks to $1 all the time.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It will not change.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And two, it is paper currency.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, so it's just like—you could just call them bucks then.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They are McElbucks.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do they look different?

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They look slightly different.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How slight?

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because there's people—

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have taped our pictures onto dollar bills.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That is noticeable enough.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I feel like we're not going to get dinged.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, it's different.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sorry, I should take that back.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They're worth $1.01 because of the paper that I have taped onto there.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So each McElbuck, if you can trade one regular dollar with a McElbuck with a friend, you

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
have made a penny, basically.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I think you've actually lost a penny in that exchange.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Someone has.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Someone has—

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think we can agree on that.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A penny has been abandoned.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm looking at the—there's a Udemy course, $12.99, to learn how to make your own cryptocurrency

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
just like Bitcoin.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's what it says, actually.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It says right here, create your own cryptocurrency just like Bitcoin.

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So is $12.99 going to be a sunk cost into this?

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And does that need to be amortized into the cryptocurrency, the $12.99 I'm going to need

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to spend?

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
To say nothing of the time.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I mean, obviously.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you just talking about funding McElbucks?

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm saying there's a sunk cost in McElbucks of $12.99.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I had to Xerox all the pictures of us.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It wasn't free.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I had to go down to Kinko's.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, Trav, I'm afraid you've forgotten one important facet of cryptocurrency, and that

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is the blockchain.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wow.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And what the blockchain is, is math puzzles that computers work on, and that gets you

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
money.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So for this—but listen, we don't got to toss all this out.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll tell you why.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because I'm going to write down a math problem right now on a scrap of paper, okay?

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then once there's enough McElbucks out there, maybe we can solve this bad boy.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Can I just say, this is kind of getting away from me a little bit, and I was wondering

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
if it would be okay if I just muted real quick, and I called my friend—I don't want to

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
say his name, so let's just call him Mellonusk.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let me call Mellon.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, the only—

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Griffin, I'm just going to mute.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm glad you're not calling the person whose name sounds like that, and has some hugely,

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
hugely terrible ideas about life and existence.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fuck that guy.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm calling Mellonusk.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Right.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a different guy.

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hold on, hold on.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm muted now.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mellonusk is kind of—

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is that—I mean—

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hey, Jeff Bezos?

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, it's Kevin.

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, no, I tried the cryptocurrency thing, and—yeah, no, they—yeah, no, it was—I

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
told them I taped our faces on the dollars, and they weren't—what's that?

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I mean, I can try.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, let me try.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This—wait, if he's getting advice, like money advice from Bezos, this might actually

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
be good, Justin.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Unmute.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Unmute, really.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you don't buy into this, I'll kill you.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, that's nothing.

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's not—

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I love the idea.

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The problem is you're not thinking big enough.

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A million mackle bucks isn't cool.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know what's cool?

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, it's not a billion mackle bucks.

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's not cool either.

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's not an amount of mackle bucks that's cool.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well—

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
A trillion?

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's a—

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Still not—

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, no, picture it, Justin.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You have a trillion mackle bucks that's not cool?

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A trillion of anything?

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't think it's cool.

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's cool.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's going to be a storage issue.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
At that point, where am I putting this stuff?

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, they're very small.

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That wasn't clear.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, yeah.

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sorry.

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So people have to get their own wallets.

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's another—

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've cut dollar bills into tiny strips, and each one is a mackle buck.

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh.

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We're hitting them in the fortune command.

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Fortune commands.

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's great, Travis.

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

190
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's like confetti that was money.

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe there's just one mackle buck, and that's what makes it so valuable.

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, but I don't want to have to keep track of how much it's worth at any given time.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That seems like a lot of work for me.

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's true.

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's true.

196
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When did this show get so corporate?

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, when we started doing ads, probably.

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is an advice show, and what we do is we help you to build your wealth.

200
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's the middle one thing.

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's our thing.

202
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Our thing is to help you get that dream of living on the beach and just raking in the

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
winds and help you build your wealth by following our simple tips.

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Can I give a piece of advice?

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you can figure out time travel, and that's going to be a big hurdle here—

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A big one.

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Huge one.

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But go back and buy Bitcoin when everybody was like, ha, ha, Bitcoin.

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How stupid.

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's very good.

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's very good.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then sell it before everybody was like, ha, ha, Bitcoin.

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How stupid.

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Again.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So if you can figure out how to split that upright, you're rich.

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Or go into the future when Bitcoin crashes and buy it then, and bring it back to now

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and sell it.

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's another option.

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Or if you can know what's going to happen, you could just—I don't know if you can

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
put out a put order on a cryptocurrency.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's me.

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's me, Travis, from the future.

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Macrobucks is going to be huge.

225
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Everybody buy into Macrobucks now.

226
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Now, wait.

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Maybe this is what Jeff actually told him to do.

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't miss your chance buying Macrobucks now before it's too late.

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The squids.

230
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The squids.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hmm.

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's not what I expected.

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think it's effective.

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, I mean, that's why he got to be where he is, is with that kind of lateral thinking.

236
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is an advice show.

237
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, my God.

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's an advice show.

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, right.

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We help people.

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I wish—I'd love to have one episode in the past five years where I didn't have to say

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that line defensively.

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know what I mean?

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

245
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Almost like, Uncle, Uncle, let me up.

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That kind of vibe.

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Every time I'm like, this is an advice show, I promise.

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why is this happening?

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's advice.

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I mean, we're doing our best.

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm not.

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Are we?

253
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, I guess not.

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

255
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, this is an advice show.

256
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'd like to help a lot of people today.

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Woo!

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I feel like we haven't helped—yeah, I know.

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I feel like we haven't been particularly helpful lately.

260
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The votes are in.

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The votes are in.

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Not helpful, say the iTunes reviews.

263
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So, I'd like to be a little bit more helpful.

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So, I've got some questions here, and we're going to get right down to them.

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I've been talking to this girl for a little over a year.

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ooh, la, la.

267
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
A month again.

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ooh, la, la.

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's a long time to be talking to someone, I feel like.

270
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Uh-oh, folks.

271
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It looks like we got a Romeo.

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A little over a month ago, we got into an argument that ended with, don't call me,

273
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and her hanging up.

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I tried to text her a couple of times and haven't received any response.

275
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So, I'm assuming we're done.

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So, my problem is my drill is at her house, and I'd really like it back.

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How soon is too soon to call her for my drill back without her assuming I'm using it

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
as a way to reach out to her.

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's from sick of screwing around in Charlotte.

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't call me.

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I won't, but I do need to call you.

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Ooh, but I do.

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, if I could just get my Dewalt back.

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There is, you know this situation better than we do.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But, like Dr. Strange, I do not see that many scenarios where this pans out good for you.

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In most of those scenarios, the drill is gone, and you need to be okay with that.

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

288
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to talk to you about sunk costs.

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah.

290
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to help you build your wealth.

291
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And here's how we're going to start your portfolio.

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Negative one drill.

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That is the beginning of your portfolio, and let's build from there.

294
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you have anything of hers that you could organize a neutral party swapsies situation?

295
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, maybe on a long bridge.

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They send out their representative.

298
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You send out your representative.

299
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Each representative is walking halfway there and back.

300
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Maybe it's time to upgrade.

301
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The universe wants you to upgrade your drill.

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mm-hmm.

303
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Maybe treat yourself to a nice Milwaukee or a nice Makita.

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No, Dewalt's the way to go.

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Dewalt.

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

307
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You got a good Dewalt, baby.

308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm already sunk so deep into the battery system for Milwaukee.

309
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't have a choice in cordless tool.

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, you lost the battery too, Justin.

311
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Do you think that question asker took over a batteryless drill?

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That word was one of the worst.

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It got away from me.

315
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you don't have two batteries, you don't own a drill.

316
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But now they have a battery.

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Nobody says, I want to drill later.

318
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You know what I mean?

319
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Nobody's ever thought, later I hope to do some drilling.

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I better charge it.

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to drill now and then not drill for an hour while it recharges and then start drilling again.

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That is a good way to excuse yourself from a job you gave yourself though.

323
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's like, oh, I was going to put together this cabinet, but who doesn't want to get some drilling done?

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I would love to.

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, sometimes you're tired.

326
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sometimes you have a headache.

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Never too tired to drill.

328
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The drill's gone.

329
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Go buy a new drill.

330
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm so sorry.

331
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's expensive.

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What if it was like their grandpappy's drill?

333
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's not.

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If it's your fucking grandpappy's drill, you need to dump that garbage because drill technology has come a long way since your grandpappy's time.

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is a hand crank drill that grandpappy used to cross the plains.

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's been in our family for 2,000 years.

337
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He burrowed through the plains like a mule man.

338
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He dug the train holes with this.

339
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That may be true, Trav, but now it is in her family for a couple weeks.

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's just another chapter in its incredible story.

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No one saw this coming, but the drill is gone.

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think for me, if that happened to me, the greatest fart in the face would be that if I had left a drill bit in there that was part of a set,

343
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think that would be worse than anything because then it's like, am I going to buy a whole new set just to replace the quarter-inch bit?

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Or am I going to try to find just a quarter-inch bit that matches that set and fits in the same?

345
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ugh, don't even get me started.

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Nightmare scenario.

347
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Have we ostracized?

348
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you think that was the question we ostracized the rest of our listeners with?

349
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, we hit it with cryptocurrency and then business and then ostracized.

350
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I just don't know that there's a big market for people who listen to our shows who are mega into hardware.

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Griffin, you have no concept of the restraint that I just brought to that question.

352
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I find it so disheartening that you think that was me chatting about tools.

353
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I brought a light dusting of expertise.

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Justin, I'll make you a deal.

355
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can have two minutes unfettered if I can have two minutes to talk about my new favorite show, Forged in Fire.

356
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, I don't want either of them.

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm responsible, you know what I mean?

358
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
To know and have the passion for tools that I do and not bring it to a show like this after 10 years of doing it.

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When I think I've earned it, you know what I mean?

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
In the words of Chris Fleming, that's grace.

361
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's poise.

362
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The only thing that eclipses Justin's love for tools is his love for the band Tool.

363
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's the only thing greater.

364
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And my passion for the fabric, Tool.

365
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's true.

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And cookies called Twittles.

367
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

368
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And a pair of the letter L.

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, Tools.

370
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, God.

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, we just got canceled.

372
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We got canceled for a podcast?

373
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, just right there.

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It came through the wire.

375
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This one's sent in by the wizard Ben Cant.

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you, Ben.

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's Yahoo Answers.

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They're anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I'll call him Patrick with a G at the end.

380
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So yeah, it's a hot new name.

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Patrick asks, I don't like my dad's song.

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I recently started playing guitar and I've shared the few I've learned with my parents.

383
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm in college and still live with them.

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So my dad had the idea to write lyrics and for me to play.

385
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I thought he was joking at first, but we just now spent an hour dragging through his very depressing song.

386
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't like it, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What should I do?

388
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've written a new song, boy.

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I've written lyrics.

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The song is called My Disappointing Son.

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There's a very well thought out, I would say heartfelt answer that is the only answer that has been left on this Yahoo Answers question.

392
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But the first two words of this answer, they very much sum up how I'm feeling about it.

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And it's just, tough one.

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It is.

395
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That should have been the name of this podcast.

396
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Tough one.

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think a parent's greatest wish is to be eclipsed by their child.

398
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let me just say, good parents, not mine.

399
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's not my thing.

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But I think that if you come back and take down a few notes on this song you've written and you've changed every lyric and it's better,

401
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but you still make him feel like he's part of it, that's really all he's looking for.

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Huge.

403
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Huge for dads.

404
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you think this depressing song is about?

405
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It could be about anything with dads.

406
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You know how dads are.

407
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You know how dads get.

408
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You know how dads get.

409
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I have a solution to this.

410
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You say to your dad, you say, dad, I love this track and the thing is we've got to get it out live.

411
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We've got to get it out there.

412
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And so you go with your dad and you get him on guitar lead vocals and this part is important, you're on drums.

413
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So you get upstairs and then the announcer guy's like, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage.

414
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Wait, what announcer?

415
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Somebody's announcing your show about to start.

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That you're in your house.

417
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Where did you do the show?

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I just said you've got to play it out live.

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Please try to keep up.

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But you said they go upstairs and it made it sound like they went up to the bedroom.

421
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The green room was downstairs, Travis.

422
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You said they go upstairs.

423
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's the second floor stage, Travis, shut up.

424
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Why would I?

425
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I didn't say they go upstairs.

426
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You did say they go upstairs.

427
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Rachel, please play back whenever I play it and we'll move forward.

428
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay.

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And this part is important.

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You're on drums.

431
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So you get upstairs and no matter what just happened there, I think what we can all agree is they're on stage.

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And the announcer says, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage of the YMCA.

433
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Dad and him.

434
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And then you get up and you get out your sticks and you put on your shades and you're like.

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And you're picking up the pace.

436
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Your dad's looking back at you like, it's too fast.

437
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's too fast.

438
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And you're like, sorry, dad, this song's a banger.

439
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And Steve Zahn's like, let's roll with it.

440
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's roll with it.

441
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's go with it.

442
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I love it.

443
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Snowy Sunday, thinking about the friends we lost.

444
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know.

445
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is it.

446
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
This is the sound.

447
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Shut the war.

448
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But that is another option.

449
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Broken promises and broken dreams.

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And all the kids are like, whoa.

451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

452
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess it sounds like your ex-wife really is a piece of work.

453
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You got me.

454
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Everybody do the ex-wife.

455
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Everybody already has kids.

456
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Take it from me.

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yikes.

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm canceled.

459
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We had a short career.

460
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Better to burn bright than to fade away.

461
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How about another question?

462
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

463
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I love this.

464
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I love this energy.

465
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah, me too.

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's so helpful.

467
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I have a question here.

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You do?

469
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.

470
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let's see.

471
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

472
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I interrupted myself?

473
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I want to munch.

474
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Squad.

475
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Squad.

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I want to munch.

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Squad.

478
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Squad, I'm not-

479
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That wasn't- you didn't interrupt yourself, Justin.

480
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You possessed yourself.

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And also, I'm not- I don't know that I'm ready for the munch squad.

483
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The munch squad is a little post ads foothold that I get while climbing-

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We got other exciting stuff.

485
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Jokes.

486
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We got exciting stuff for after.

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay.

488
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So I want to get it out.

489
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It wouldn't feel weird though if you were like in the middle of a fancy dinner party

490
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and they said, yeah, we're going to have the main course out in a second, but first,

491
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
here's some brandy and cigars.

492
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You're like, oh, not yet.

493
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, okay.

494
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You guys know those parties, right?

495
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Sure, sure, sure.

496
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This is a munch squad.

497
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a podcast within a podcast.

498
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Only slightly munch squad related because my munch squad is not related to this, but I

499
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
did want to say it's wild that we didn't talk about the big game.

500
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I can't remember the last time a big game rolled around.

501
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh, I just assumed they canceled it because it wouldn't be safe to play sports and stuff

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
in the current pandemic.

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

504
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
How are they doing that?

505
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Because I haven't watched any football this season, but I just assumed they were zooming

506
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
it.

507
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, what it is is from six foot away, one of the defensemen will say, I tackled you

508
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and the runner's like, oh man, you got me.

509
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh yeah, maybe they all have lances, like six foot lances.

510
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah.

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Nerf guns.

512
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's good.

513
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah.

514
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yeah.

515
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, can I just say paintball football would be amazing.

516
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I have a few sort of juniors.

517
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I just want to hit y'all with it.

518
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The first is just the beginning of this story on QSR, which is one of my quick service restaurants,

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
one of my sources, main sources.

520
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's your fucking homepage.

521
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's basically my homepage.

522
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The headline is how Wendy's got people talking about breakfast in a pandemic.

523
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Subhead, one of the biggest launches of 2020 was derailed by COVID-19 or was it?

524
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know, dude.

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're writing the story.

526
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm not going to do your work for you.

527
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I did want to say that handsome ass Carl Laredo is in this one.

528
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Everybody knows Carl Laredo, the CMO of Wendy's.

529
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's a breakfast he said was a competitive landscape that Carl Laredo in classic Carl Laredo style referred to as the world of frozen arches.

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, boy.

531
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It says here it's a not so veiled reference to McDonald's.

532
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Just say fucking McDonald's Carl at that point.

533
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Carl doesn't, then it wouldn't be a Laredo own.

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It would just be a regular burn if he didn't have a little spin on it, a little poetic license.

535
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You know how Carl is.

536
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So they're wild out there.

537
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Taco Bell's got a new five dollar build your own cravings box for the people.

538
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay.

539
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You take a boring burger bundle, you add a celebrity in the mix, you put it online and you've got the perfect recipe for, well, eating someone else's favorite.

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Taco Bell wonders, why not just eat like you?

541
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
A lot of people watching the fucking throne right now, huh?

542
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
A lot of people making a run at the king.

543
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So wait, wait, wait.

544
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Not the king. That's confusing.

545
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is the statement here the accusation of like, you don't want to eat some famous person's favorite meal.

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You want to eat yours.

547
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And only with our help will you be able to do that.

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's exactly right.

549
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You're going to be able to, rewarding their most passionate fans first, the new build your own cravings box will be exclusively available exclusively to Taco Bell rewards beta members on the Taco Bell app.

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
As a beta member myself, I have to say this is fair and they got me.

551
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Stretching customers dollars further than ever before.

552
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The build your own cravings box is the ultimate Taco Bell eating experience.

553
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So basically you tell them what you want to put in this big box of garbage and they're going to serve it up to you.

554
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Right. No problem.

555
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And no questions asked.

556
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
No judgment.

557
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Nikki Lawson, who sort of like the Carl Laredo of Taco Bell, says in honestly, one of the most inscrutable quotes that we've had in this segment and that is saying something.

558
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
As we see it, there aren't a lot of choices out there when it comes to value.

559
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Forcing customers to play by others rules.

560
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

561
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But when your fans have different favorites on the menu, why not celebrate that?

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh God, I feel free for the first time.

563
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The Taco Bell I'm proud to lead does it differently.

564
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The Taco Bell I'm proud to lead does it differently.

565
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
This is my Taco Bell.

566
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This is my Bell.

567
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Taco Bell I'm proud to lead does it differently.

568
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
We put fans in the driver's seat and allow them to eat how they want to eat.

569
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Not how someone, irrespective of how famous they may be, tells them to.

570
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Can I just say that that's a horrible kind of phrase to use?

571
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because if I went to a NASCAR race and they put fans in the driver's seat, horrible things are going to happen.

572
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's going to be a bloody massacre.

573
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I want experienced eating professionals in the driver's seat.

574
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you very much.

575
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Like your Travis Scotts, I think.

576
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Travis Scott did the McDonald's meal.

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What's wild about that quote is that it's not rules.

578
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Travis Scott wasn't like, you got this new McDonald's meal and it's all about me and it's a weird burger and a flurry and a lot of fucking fries.

579
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And just a massive, unconscionable amount of Sprite.

580
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And that's the, those are the fucking rules.

581
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
That's it now.

582
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And it's the only thing they sell.

583
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Taco Bell is, this is a great part.

584
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They've got a digital and social campaign for this initiative that includes some of Taco Bell's most influential fans, including actor Noah Centineo, TikTok influencer Nova Rose, K-pop star CL, iconic drag queen Onyx Black and BMXer Brad Sims.

585
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I wonder if all of them agreed on BMXer way back in the day.

586
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I can't imagine.

587
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But the celebrities aren't going to be sharing their own order.

588
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, okay.

589
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They're going to be reminding consumers to never settle for someone else's taste buds.

590
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Then I'm going to make my own fucking tacos at home.

591
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
This is the weird thing.

592
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't listen to the celebrities when they tell you what to eat at Taco Bell, but do listen to the celebrities when they tell you to eat at Taco Bell.

593
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Noah Centineo will walk you right up to the door and you'll turn around and thank him and he's gone.

594
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You can do a passionate TikTok duet with Noah Centineo, by the way, which I plan on doing right away.

595
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
How many items do I get to put in this box?

596
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Is it like you get four items to put in the box or is it however much ground beef you can stuff?

597
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's anything they have.

598
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Whatever can fit in the box.

599
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's like a yogurt place.

600
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's by weight.

601
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You can get a box full of loose hot sauce and that's it.

602
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And it still is $5.

603
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You could ask for the employees to put their wallets in the box and they have to do it because there are no fucking rules.

604
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You choose from one of like four different categories, basically.

605
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sounds like a rule to me.

606
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Which is like a signature item, like the Chalupa Supreme rules.

607
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then they have the charmingly named starters.

608
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And one of those starters is a beefy five-layer burrito.

609
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm just feeling a bit peckish.

610
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I think I'll just have a fucking beefy five-layer burrito for the table, please.

611
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I couldn't possibly eat six layers.

612
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'll take the five-layer one, please.

613
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Just five layers to begin.

614
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I do want to do that TikTok.

615
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Look for that on my TikTok, my duet with Noah Centineo.

616
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Griffin, when are you going to get on that TikTok?

617
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
As soon as somebody tells me how it works.

618
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Real quick, before we head into the break real quickly, I did want to let everybody know that this is just kind of a public service announcement.

619
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The Shamrock Shake coming back February 15th.

620
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Just in time for Valentine's Day.

621
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I hear you saying I don't give a shit.

622
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, that's not what McDonald's thinks.

623
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They're welcoming back not only the Shamrock Shake, but also the fan favorite Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.

624
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I always like when restaurants call something a fan favorite.

625
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Because the alternative is they're bringing back something that no one seemed to enjoy, but it was cheap.

626
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We're bringing back real underdog, the Shamrock Shake.

627
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
We're giving you one more chance to enjoy spicy chicken nuggets.

628
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We think that this is an acquired taste, and one more time, please give it a try.

629
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We ordered so many of them.

630
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Please.

631
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If you learn to read between the lines in these things, they're actually pretty sinister.

632
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The Shamrock Shake features creamy vanilla soft serve blended with our unmistakable Shamrock Shake flavor,

633
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and finished with a whipped topping for a minty treat.

634
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Now, there's a lot of things that they said there.

635
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There's a lot of things they didn't say as well as like, what is in this?

636
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Like, why is it like this?

637
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's minty.

638
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's not mint though, is it?

639
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
They explained the burning that you feel when you eat it.

640
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because you can justify that.

641
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
That must be that they mentioned.

642
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But everything else is a puzzle box.

643
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I know Chef Mike would not do a sturdy like that.

644
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh, no.

645
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
No, no, no.

646
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But I have allergies, you know?

647
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
For more than 50 years.

648
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It strains cajolity at this point, some of these quotes from the marketing people.

649
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This cat, Chad Schafer, is the director of culinary.

650
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

651
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Senior director of culinary.

652
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
For more than 50 years, fans have eagerly awaited the annual return of the Shamrock Shake,

653
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
counting on the arrival of Shamrock Shake season to mark the unofficial start to spring.

654
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Huh.

655
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And we heard they especially enjoyed getting a taste of the one and only Shamrock flavor in a new way last year with the Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.

656
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We know this winter may feel longer than others.

657
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So we had to do it, had to get it in there.

658
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So we're thrilled to give customers something to look forward to by bringing both fan favorites back to the menu this month.

659
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So hang in there.

660
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The Shamrock Shake is coming.

661
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I cannot wait for, like, the first hint of, like, now everything's, like, on the upswing.

662
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
51% of the population is vaccinated.

663
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You know, we're seeing daylight.

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Because at this point, I feel like quick service restaurants have run out of euphemisms for saying, like, I don't fucking know, man.

665
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Give them some new material about hope on the horizon and just watch them fly.

666
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I cannot fucking wait.

667
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We're going to sup on that forever.

668
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You know, it's funny.

669
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You always see these announcements for, like, ding, ding, ding, ding, dinner bells on, dipshits, your favorite green shake is back in stock.

670
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They never have a press release that's, like, funeral for a friend, saying goodbye once again.

671
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We know you've all looked forward to it and fucking clung to it to get through these cold winter months.

672
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But, oh, well, it's March 18th, so this shit's going right in the dumpster.

673
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Come give it a lick if you want, if you miss it, assholes.

674
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's gone.

675
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Anyway, that's the Munch Squad.

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Let's take a break for some more positive commercialism in a segment we like to refer to as the Money Zone.

677
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You know, when I was a young man, I was told quite often that I was something of an upstart.

678
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Upstart, they would say to me.

679
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You whippersnapper, they would say.

680
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But now upstarts are having their day, aren't they?

681
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Because if you have multiple credit cards, you know that tracking multiple balances, due dates, and website logins can be stressful.

682
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Upstart makes things simple with one monthly payment in one place.

683
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Unlike the premise of this video, it's simple and easy to understand.

684
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I am not British. I'm just old.

685
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You don't turn British when you get old.

686
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm an old-timey man.

687
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm from a time before when we lost our British accents here in America.

688
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm so old that I still have my-

689
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Vestigial British accent.

690
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I have a vestigial British accent.

691
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And a lot of credit cards.

692
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah, no, that's for sure.

693
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,000
When I was a whippersnapper, I signed up for a lot of credit cards to get the free things that they offered at baseball games.

694
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Right, and how old are you?

695
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I am 175.

696
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000

706
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Brooklinen sells very soft.

707
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
When I was a young man, people used to call me Brooklinen.

708
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Brooklinen, they'd say, get off my bed.

709
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Now he's rolling his fucking R's, dude.

710
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Get off my bed, Brooklinen.

711
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They'd say, ah, ah, bean.

712
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
They'd say, get off me bed, Brooklinen.

713
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And I'd say, this is my bed.

714
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And they'd say, no, it is my bed.

715
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And then we'd fight in the street with pistols.

716
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah, but we don't do that anymore, we just chill in our beds with our comfy sheets and stuff that Brooklinen provides us.

717
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Because they got the really good stuff.

718
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, they do.

719
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I sleep on Brooklinen's sheets, and I sleep like an absolute baby.

720
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And whenever I used to travel, I didn't sleep in Brooklinen's sheets, and that made me sad.

721
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Sorry, I just realized that I've slept in my own bed every day for the last year, and it got me good.

722
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
But they got a bunch of different colors and patterns and materials to fit your needs and your tastes.

723
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And they got comforters, pillows, and towels.

724
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And if you want to just feel like you have a sheet on you all fucking day, they got loungewear.

725
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So that's great.

726
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000

Thank you.

733
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
No problem.

734
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

735
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
What do you look for in a podcast?

736
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Reliability is big for me.

737
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Power.

738
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'd say comfort.

739
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What do you think of this?

740
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh.

741
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That's Jordan, Jesse, go.

742
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Jordan, Jesse, go?

743
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
They came out of the floor?

744
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And down from the ceiling?

745
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That can't be safe.

746
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm upset.

747
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Can we go now?

748
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Soon.

749
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Jordan, Jesse, go.

750
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
A real podcast.

751
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Another question that I would like to shoot your way.

752
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This summer I moved into a new home.

753
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Everything was good apart from each Friday when a loud ice cream van would park right

754
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
outside my house at 8 p.m. and serve customers till late.

755
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
However, it is now well into December and the van still shows up each week.

756
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I mean, we're really getting to this question pretty late, huh?

757
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah.

758
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What are you going to do?

759
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, we're well out of December and music well after dark.

760
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
No one is buying ice cream at night in winter, and at this point I'm too nervous to go out

761
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and talk to the owner in case this is some front-flat illegal activity.

762
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
How should I discover what they're up to and do I even want to know?

763
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's from John in Norwich, UK.

764
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I've got no idea.

765
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah, I don't see us being capable of answering this, but I have very good news.

766
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah.

767
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
My friend, Christina Ariel, who I recently did some game streaming with, she was telling

768
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
me that there is an ice cream truck outside of her house all the time, so I think we should

769
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
call her and get her opinion on this.

770
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Let me ring her up on the phone real quick.

771
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

772
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So many numbers.

773
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You don't have to hit that many numbers.

774
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Brrring.

775
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Brrring.

776
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Are we hearing the bells of Christina's phone through the phone?

777
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, I put a microphone in Christina's house so we could record her side of it.

778
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah.

779
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Hello.

780
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, thank God.

781
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hi, Christina.

782
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's Travis.

783
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Travis McElroy.

784
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Who?

785
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Travis McElroy.

786
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Who?

787
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Travis McElroy.

788
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We did that game stream to get her where we played.

789
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
We played that post-apocalyptic game.

790
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You probably stream with a lot of people, though, so if you don't remember him, let's

791
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
just clean slate it right now.

792
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Dad, Travis McElroy, hi.

793
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Hi.

794
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
There's another Travis.

795
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That's not important.

796
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We had a question here, and I'm going to repeat it.

797
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Blah, blah, blah.

798
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So now we want to get your opinion on this, because I know that there's an ice cream truck

799
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
that seemingly lives outside your house.

800
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So what's going on here, do you think?

801
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, I think if you want to know if this truck is actually up to something, I actually

802
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
have the perfect plan for you.

803
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And this works in any case if you suspect that an ice cream truck in your neighborhood

804
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
is maybe not just selling ice cream.

805
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Go and order a Sonic the Hedgehog ice cream with bubblegum eyes or a Ninja Turtle ice

806
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,000
cream, and how much frost is on top of it to determine if this truck actually sells

807
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
ice cream.

808
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So what you're suggesting, Christina, is that they have a freezer, and inside that freezer

809
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
is one Sonic the Hedgehog popsicle with gumball eyes and one Ninja Turtle popsicle with gumball

810
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
eyes and nothing else.

811
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There might be an ice cream sandwich or a bomb paw.

812
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
One of each item.

813
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, there's one of each, and you've got to be careful.

814
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yes, it's an ah.

815
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes, an ah ice cream pop.

816
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You've got to be careful because one of them is also going to be the code word for the

817
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
drugs that you are also selling today.

818
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So if you are going down the list of menu items and it says like, an It's a Caduzzi

819
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
is $400, then you can assume that that is some sort of slang for a drug of some sort.

820
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I bet it's pretty frustrating if you have an ice cream truck that's a front for your

821
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
drug selling business, but nobody knows it's a front for a drug selling business.

822
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
They just keep buying ice cream, and you're like, oh man, nobody bought drugs for me today.

823
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I need to work on my branding.

824
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Well, I mean, it's an interesting occupation, but it's an entrepreneurial intent.

825
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't know what it is.

826
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's funny, though.

827
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Do you know, this happens in New York City.

828
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
There are trucks that drive around, and they have like pot leaves all over them and stuff,

829
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and the candy will be called like, Hemp and Honey or whatever, but like, there's no actual

830
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
marijuana in any of it.

831
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's just implied, but it would be completely illegal if it was actual THC in these things,

832
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but it just looks like it, and so tourists are like, oh my God, big city, and then they

833
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
just buy what is essentially regular candy for like $20 an ounce.

834
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So this, the impropriety, the appearance of impropriety here is a feature and not a bug, is what you're saying.

835
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yes, exactly.

836
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And you know that if you go to this ice cream vendor who is selling in such a shady way,

837
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
you know that this hits a Caduzzi is going to fuck you up, fam.

838
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's not a question about it.

839
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It is actually a Caduzzi.

840
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh boy.

841
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It is.

842
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
There's no doubt about it.

843
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
This one's a Caduzzi.

844
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Christina, how do you deal with your children constantly asking you to patronize the ice cream

845
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
truck that is taking root outside your home?

846
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because that would be, I feel like, a basically constant struggle between my children and I.

847
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, I think the best way to interfere with that is the fact that my husband is an ice cream junkie,

848
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
so there's always ice cream in my house, and it's like, oh, let's go to the ice cream truck,

849
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
but why would we do that when we've got Good Humor strawberry shortcake bars in the fridge?

850
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We've got Oreo ice cream.

851
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Do you want a Fat Boy?

852
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Like, they do like Fat Boys with peanut butter.

853
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You can't do that with your hard ice cream you're going to get from the ice cream truck

854
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
that's been sitting in there for 14 years.

855
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Christina, my wife calls the Strawberry Good Humor bars Scooter Crunch bars,

856
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and I didn't know if I should divorce her or not.

857
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What do you think?

858
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I think that you should say, you know what, hun, you call it whatever you want to,

859
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and I'll call it what I want to.

860
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You can be wrong, but we can continue on.

861
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
We don't talk about it that much, to be fair, actually.

862
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah, how often does that come up, Cayman?

863
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It does come up organically.

864
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
To each their own. To each their own.

865
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And also, it makes me think about, do you remember those commercials for Six Flags?

866
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And they had that old dude, and he had like a bald head, and a black tuxedo, and it's like,

867
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
da-da-da-da-da-da.

868
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You can't see me, but I'm doing like this little jig.

869
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But that's what I always think about, because there was like a 90s commercial for Good Humor,

870
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and they're like, ba-da-bee, ba-boo, ba-da-ba.

871
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm the Good Humor man.

872
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah, they would play that in those commercials, and I think the short part of the story is,

873
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I really like Good Humor bars, man.

874
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Christina, so just to clarify, talking about an ice cream truck made you think about the Six Flags guy,

875
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
which then made you think about the Good Humor guy, and not the other way around?

876
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
No. I'm confused.

877
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, so I said we have Good Humor bars in the fridge, which then made me think about that song,

878
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
which then made me think about the Six Flags commercial with the guys doing the dance,

879
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
which then brought me back to the Good Humor song.

880
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Speaking of.

881
00:42:48,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm the Good Humor man. I'm the only man, man with an ice cream pan. I'm taking my ice cream across the land.

882
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Cook a cookie sandwich with a chocolate chip. How about a Sunday car that'll make you flip?

883
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm the Good Humor man.

884
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I wish to God I could be there when this ad exec pitched this.

885
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You know what the kids are so into right now is Scatman. I love Scatman, John.

886
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The wildest thing about that is it is a parody of Scatman, but the syllable count is so far off.

887
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They are doubling the syllables of the term Scatman. It's wild. It's hubris.

888
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's so strange that someone heard I'm the Scatman and thought,

889
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
you know what that makes me think of? Good Humor man. That's wild.

890
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You know what's great about it is that it was like during that area,

891
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
not area, but during that era where it was like Alley Cat Strike came out as a decom.

892
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It was like a big boom and like, what are those guys called? The little like, not the tub thumping dudes,

893
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but the big band swing kind of like.

894
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Oh, like the Ryan Seds Orchestra.

895
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Big Band Pootoo Daddies.

896
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The Squirrel Nut Zippers. Every band had the worst names. It was the worst.

897
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It seemed like they drew their names syllable by syllable out of a hopper.

898
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yes, it was quite terrible.

899
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Why couldn't they have a cool name? Like Stained.

900
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Or Puddle of Mud. Or Puddle of Mud.

901
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Jars of Clay. Jars of Blur.

902
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Creed. You can't even tell.

903
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You can't even take me higher with that name.

904
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm pretty sure most of the bands we just mentioned were undercover Christian rock bands.

905
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Sure. It's a great genre.

906
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah. Okay. Not just rock. Not just Christian. Undercover Christian rock.

907
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You might listen to several of their albums before you figure out.

908
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Gotcha. Gotcha.

909
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Didn't the big like Insane Clown Posse story come out?

910
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh yeah. The most undercover undercover Christian rock band.

911
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You're like, the Juggalos were a Christian rock band all along.

912
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The Juggalos are like, they were a plant and a criminal organization.

913
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But they were under so long, they forgot how to live a clean life.

914
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And I'm like, did we start as a Christian band or did we just decide what's happening here, guys?

915
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They got departed.

916
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's it.

917
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The Juggalos got raptured.

918
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's like the great philosopher once said, 50 told me, go ahead and switch your style up.

919
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And if they hate, then let them hate and watch the money pile up.

920
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah. That was from the Bible, I think.

921
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That's also from the Bible.

922
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That 50 he was talking about was Jesus Christ.

923
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Sometimes they called him 50 because he took the bread and the fish and he turned it into 50 bread and fish.

924
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, that's cool. Good job, Jesus.

925
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That's not enough for everybody. There were hundreds of people there.

926
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Not even close, not even close. But still, it was more than one.

927
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, that's true. That is true.

928
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh my God, Charles, this is so awkward.

929
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But you go ahead and ask your question and then I'll ask my different question.

930
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Okay.

931
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I just wanted to thank Christina for taking time out of her incredibly busy schedule

932
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
hosting the Star Wars High Republic web series,

933
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
the official Star Wars show discussing the Star Wars High Republic series.

934
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It must be so much more fun to do that than to record this show with us.

935
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So it means so much to us that you took the time to come on our show to talk about dumb things.

936
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I like talking about dumb things and I like you.

937
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Well, thank you.

938
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We talk about Star Wars sometimes on this show, but people weirdly don't like it.

939
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
No, no, no, no.

940
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
We think Star Wars is cool. Spaceships and laser blades and all that shit is radical.

941
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But I guess we got a lot of just jocks, just a lot of jocks listening to our show.

942
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You know what you could talk about though and just change all the discourse

943
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
because it's one thing that everyone can agree on?

944
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
What's that?

945
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Ivan Ooze is one of the greatest villains in all of cinema and he deserves his flowers.

946
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
The courage, the bravery required to come on our show and be a proponent of Ivan Ooze.

947
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It took my breath away, Christina.

948
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's the audacity of hope, that's what that is.

949
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Some people say he's a bit much.

950
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I prefer Zed, I prefer Goldar, but no.

951
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The best part of this entire movie, think of all the things I've missed, the Brady Bunch reunion.

952
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Are you kidding me? That is awesome.

953
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm sorry, I have a lot of feelings about this.

954
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Who do you think is a more iconic movie villain?

955
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Ivan Ooze or Raul Julia as M. Bison in the Street Fighter movies?

956
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh man, don't make me choose.

957
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, why would you do that?

958
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Don't make me choose.

959
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I think the reason it popped into my head is I think they're both playing at the same level.

960
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Just acting choice-wise, the same incredible level.

961
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's high camp.

962
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah, oh yeah.

963
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It is high camp and it is a fine art and I think they are both incredible artists when it comes to the camp.

964
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And I'd refuse to make a choice on this, but I will continue to say Ivan Ooze as a villain had bars.

965
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's fair.

966
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think it's just that now that we're into the new year, it's 2021, I wanted to make sure that I could reference the best line in cinema ever

967
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and make sure we get it in before we have to worry about it, which is the day that M. Bison invaded your city is the worst day of your life.

968
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
For me, it was a Tuesday.

969
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's just the best.

970
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's very good.

971
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And as long as we're quoting Street Fighter adjacent things, I can't let the opportunity pass me by to quote the interview that somebody did with Jean-Claude Van Damme

972
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
when it was revealed that he had an affair with Kylie Minogue on the set and he said,

973
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

974
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It happened.

975
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I was in Thailand.

976
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
We had an affair.

977
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Sweet kiss, beautiful lovemaking.

978
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Thanks, John.

979
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Thanks, Jean-Claude.

980
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
To be fair, I hope Jean-Claude Van Damme says something about me someday.

981
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Sweet kiss, beautiful lovemaking.

982
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Beautiful lovemaking.

983
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Awesome.

984
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All I can say is Jean-Claude Van Damme.

985
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Do you guys know that the bad guy from Raiders, Bellic, was played by the same guy who played Ivan Ooze?

986
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Really?

987
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That's quite a trajectory, huh?

988
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You must have had one moment where they were putting on the applique on your face, the blue, the purple tentacles,

989
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
where you're like, this is where I'm at currently, that's okay.

990
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
What's Harrison Ford up to?

991
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
What's he doing?

992
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I bet Harrison is maybe in the Mighty Morph-

993
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You think he called Harrison Ford like,

994
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Hey, Harrison, are you in this Mighty Morph about Rangers movie too?

995
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I assume you got the offer right alongside me?

996
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Got an opportunity for you.

997
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
This is a rocket, baby, going all the way to the top.

998
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Harrison, can you put on your helmet?

999
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm not putting on my helmet.

1000
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
You're the Black Ranger, Harrison, please.

1001
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm not doing it.

1002
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Where can people watch your program?

1003
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I mean, I guess the internet, right?

1004
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You get everything on the internet these days.

1005
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yes, you can watch The Higher Public Show on the Star Wars YouTube or on StarWars.com

1006
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and you can check out more information about The Higher Public in that little tab about said show.

1007
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And other than that, you can find me, oh, on Mondays I host a show called Improvised Champions

1008
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
with Mark Muir, who is the voice of Commander Shepard in Mass Effect.

1009
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, yeah.

1010
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And there's someone who plays through the game, Idle Champions.

1011
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We voice act all the characters and we also commentate as two of our original characters.

1012
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So it's really fun.

1013
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That's fun.

1014
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's on the C&E Games Twitch.

1015
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Cool.

1016
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I also highly recommend if you are subscribed to Dropout, you can watch Dimension 20

1017
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and Christina just did a series there on Dimension 20 called Pirates of Leviathan.

1018
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And when she played Barbarella, it's very, very good.

1019
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Oh, I need to say it for you.

1020
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Okay, please.

1021
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Her name is Barbarella Zasparela Gangland, but you can call her Bob.

1022
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That's really good.

1023
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
How talented people might be so angry.

1024
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It must be so stressful to have talent.

1025
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I can't imagine.

1026
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You are in trolls.

1027
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You are in trolls.

1028
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You are an icon in this house.

1029
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
They let us talk at the same time and then they put it through a bunch of computers.

1030
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You know how it is, the music industry.

1031
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We watched it the other day and it's like my son's in a trance by it.

1032
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So like my oldest comes in right at the part where it's the incredibly sad Kelly Clarkson song.

1033
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And out comes the tumbleweed.

1034
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
You suck!

1035
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And everyone in my kitchen.

1036
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Busting up, busting up.

1037
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Some debate amongst the trolls community and our community about which one of the three of us that is.

1038
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Credited in the books, in the IMDB books to the J-Man.

1039
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Definitely if you listen to the voice, it's absolutely Griffin.

1040
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It's 100% Griffin.

1041
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
No question.

1042
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But I'm on the poster.

1043
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So, hey, Christina, thank you so much for joining us.

1044
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Really appreciate you being here.

1045
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
My pleasure.

1046
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I think we've really helped this time.

1047
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
This person we've helped.

1048
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

1049
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Buy that ice cream, man.

1050
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Buy that ice cream.

1051
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Hey, Griff, how about a yahoo?

1052
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, I have a very fast one here.

1053
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I think this is going to be just a heads up call, like which way you're leaning on it.

1054
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It was sent in by a bunch of people.

1055
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Thanks, everybody.

1056
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Dump D asks.

1057
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, challenging.

1058
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Do you wish your bath could be the soup?

1059
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Imagine taking a warm, relaxing bath and you can drink the savory fragrant soup as you bathe and dip crackers in it.

1060
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Now, now, now.

1061
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Now, let's talk about doing it in the Japanese style because there is a sort of usually you'll shower off and then you'll get in the bath.

1062
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Right.

1063
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And the shower gets all the particulate.

1064
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
The gunk.

1065
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The gunk.

1066
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Because you don't want to get in the bath and get your gunk all over the bath.

1067
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And then somebody else gets in the bath later.

1068
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1069
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
You shower off first.

1070
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So I would need a pre soup bath to even consider this.

1071
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And even then, I'm sorry, you would never.

1072
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I mean, you would never.

1073
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
We are all of us made of stardust and gunk.

1074
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
We are we are made of gunk.

1075
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
If we clean off all the gunk, we'll make more gunk.

1076
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But OK, but let me let me can I add an element here, which is to say how big a container before it would be dispersed enough.

1077
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That's what I'm saying that you would be OK.

1078
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like you got into a lake of soup and you knew there were no fish or like rocks or anything.

1079
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's just you and the soup.

1080
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is that then dispersed enough?

1081
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Because I would posit the issue comes down to the twist is unless you have like a super long spoon, you're still eating the soup from immediately around your body.

1082
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Yeah, sure.

1083
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You would want to get, you know, you would want to dive down deep into the depths far from where your butt stuff and your pee pee stuff might accidentally get in your foot stuff and armpit stuff.

1084
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Like those are the worst parts.

1085
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Your body stuff could just say your human body.

1086
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Well, no, they're saying if I spill some soup on my thigh, I'll eat that right off there.

1087
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That's not a problem.

1088
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
If I spill it on my butt, I'll spoon it up there.

1089
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
But if I drop soup on my foot or my penis or my butt or my armpits, then that's going in the trash.

1090
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Or your hair or your face or your ears.

1091
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
If I get soup on my face.

1092
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
OK, you've never gotten you never been eating soup excited and you get soup on your face and you just kind of lick it off.

1093
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
No, no, no, I have a beard friend.

1094
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I can't do that.

1095
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
OK.

1096
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Yeah, but I got Travis really fucking knocked this one out of the park because the question is how big a body of soup do you need to be in?

1097
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Because I would argue a bathtub is too small, too small.

1098
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Because like at that point, so much of that soup is coming contact.

1099
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Can we just can we OK.

1100
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Can I let me in the interest of we all agree we're made of gunk.

1101
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah.

1102
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's untrinkable.

1103
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It's like Ralph Nader wrote undrinkable at any size.

1104
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
No, no.

1105
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But let's pretend in a world where like we have we can divorce ourselves from like hygiene.

1106
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Right.

1107
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
What are you asking?

1108
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
You get you get laminated before you go in.

1109
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I don't I don't know.

1110
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But like, let's talk about all other elements of this question, because I feel like will you enjoy the sensation, you know, of floating in a lake of chunky chunks?

1111
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Of chunky chicken?

1112
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Hold on.

1113
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Now, that is the other question, Justin, because I would I would argue I would fight so hard for tomato soup.

1114
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah.

1115
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Wait.

1116
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
See, I go tomato, tomato, basil bisque, which I mean, sure.

1117
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
As long as I can't see my own body in it.

1118
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So no broth.

1119
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I want no chunks either.

1120
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
No chunks.

1121
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
No chunks.

1122
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I got too many crannies and or nooks in my human body to do chunks.

1123
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah.

1124
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I watch if I don't have chunks, I'll be hungry after.

1125
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Justin, we're not talking about Sacy.

1126
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I assumed we were in a fear factor-esque scenario here and not like, well, this is my life now.

1127
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah.

1128
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
No, but like, what is somebody going to bring you bread?

1129
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Like, it doesn't make sense.

1130
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Okay, but here's me.

1131
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If I'm already good.

1132
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Okay, listen.

1133
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay, shut up.

1134
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Shut up.

1135
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:56,000
If you painted soup and an hour later you tell your significant other, feeling a little peckish, they're going to look at you like,

1136
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
didn't you just fucking bathe in soup?

1137
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Okay.

1138
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
How are you hungry?

1139
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Justin, the other side of that is like, if you said, I'm starving, what should we do for dinner?

1140
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And then you saw a lake of soup and you said, never mind.

1141
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Not that.

1142
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Not that.

1143
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
That would be completely bonkers.

1144
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Here's me though.

1145
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'm over here getting showering off my pre-soup shower.

1146
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Or maybe it's a burning, like in Andromeda Strain where they just kind of blast you with hot light.

1147
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And your outer layer of skin cells just comes off.

1148
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And also a full, like, ne'er de-hairing.

1149
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
De-hairing, you are a perfectly hairless, beautiful, just harp seal.

1150
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You're Neo in the Matrix, right?

1151
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah.

1152
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
When he first comes out of the pod.

1153
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And then I walk over to the kitchen real quick and I do whip myself up a grilled cheese sammy, cut it in half.

1154
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
One half in each fist, run, jump into the tomato basil bisque lake.

1155
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And now I'm having a fucking party.

1156
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I mean, the ideal is you have a sandwich big enough to float on.

1157
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Goddamn grilled cheese out there.

1158
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You're floating on the grilled cheese.

1159
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You're just ripping tiny pieces off, dipping it into the tomato soup lake.

1160
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That's the ideal.

1161
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But admittedly, that is not the question, right?

1162
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I understand that.

1163
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,000
If I did enough deep grouting, I would get in a bathtub of tomato basil bisque and I would eat some of it.

1164
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And I don't think that makes me nasty.

1165
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I mean, you can think whatever you want, can't you?

1166
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah.

1167
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Listen, Griffin, we can talk about if it's okay or not.

1168
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But the way you said it made it a passionate thing, like a thing you wanted to do actively and that bothered me.

1169
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Since we got rid of the chunks, I feel like everybody has kind of lost the passion for this, you know?

1170
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Because it just doesn't make, it's not appetizing.

1171
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Okay.

1172
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Wait, Justin, can I follow you down this path in for a second?

1173
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
When you're talking about these chunks.

1174
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh, wait, did you want me to list some of my favorite things?

1175
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
No, we'll get there.

1176
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
When you're talking about chunks.

1177
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Orzo for this table.

1178
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Thank you.

1179
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Are you talking about a lake with now in the can as exists on earth sized chunks or that this whole thing is scaled up?

1180
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
In the can?

1181
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
No, no, no.

1182
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Hear me out.

1183
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm not bathing in cans.

1184
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
No, no, no.

1185
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
You're misunderstanding Travis' question.

1186
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Please.

1187
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
What I'm saying is someone has taken soup that now exists on earth and filled the lake with it.

1188
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Or rather we're in a honey, I shrunk the kids scenario where now you're shrunk down, the bowl is you sized and all the chunks are gigantic.

1189
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Right, yes.

1190
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I don't want that, nobody wants that.

1191
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Okay.

1192
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Okay, so you're just talking about small chunks.

1193
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
No, I'm just talking about open my mouth and let a little Orzo slip in, you know?

1194
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah.

1195
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You're going to munch, munch, munch around this lake.

1196
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Well, no, I think Justin's talking about filtering Orzo through his teeth like baleen.

1197
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Ah.

1198
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Exactly, and I'll actually have to filter out the bay leaves too because it's a very fancy soup.

1199
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah, it's a very fancy soup.

1200
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Now if you could give me a matzah ball perhaps to float on, that would be ideal.

1201
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Now that would be fucking great is if there was lake sized matzah ball soup with one big fucking matzah ball right in the center that you had to sort of climb king of the hill style.

1202
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You can't just make a soup wonderland for you to play in, you're like inventing this chiliwonka style landscape where you're just floating.

1203
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Come with me, have a bean.

1204
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes.

1205
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
You can't just make it a playground, it's just soup.

1206
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Fuck.

1207
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
But why not, Justin?

1208
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Why can't we dance on moonbeams and have big old chunkums?

1209
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You're like, you're like, you're perverting the whole idea of a theoretical question.

1210
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It would be like saying like, hey, imagine you could take a bath in soup and also your right arm becomes incredibly strong and powerful, able to lift anything.

1211
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It's like, well, yeah, I'd go ahead and do that.

1212
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But you're not, you're just talking about taking a bath in soup.

1213
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's not hard, it's just a question.

1214
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I apologize, I thought that was going to be a quick one.

1215
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Well, no dice. Thanks for listening to our program.

1216
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I feel like, by the way, that is unanswered still.

1217
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I feel like we did not reach a core.

1218
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I answered it, I said yes.

1219
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I just feel like what we answered is something more important, which is that we're three different people with different priorities about soup.

1220
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah, but I feel like this is the first time in like 547 episodes that the three of us been so divided on an issue.

1221
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That like, I feel like I don't know you, Justin.

1222
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That's an exciting new chapter to end our show on.

1223
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Thanks for listening to our program.

1224
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
We hope you enjoyed yourself.

1225
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Thanks to MaxFun for having us as a part of their extended podcasting family.

1226
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Thanks to you for listening.

1227
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I think we got some new merch.

1228
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh yeah, there is.

1229
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Justin, let me tell you about it because it's very exciting.

1230
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
We've got a really great boy car pin of the month.

1231
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's so good.

1232
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000

1235

We've got the Taste of Luxury Shirt designed by Kevin Budnick.

1236
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So cute.

1237
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
The Candle Nights video on demand is there from our virtual Candle Nights show.

1238
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's pay what you want and all proceeds are still going to Harmony House.

1239

1240
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000

1241
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:26,000

Go get it at bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book.

1243
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,000
But the main thing is our Adventure Zone live virtual show happening February 19th at 9pm.

1244
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It's a 9pm Eastern, I should say.

1245
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
It's virtual and interactive.

1246
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:48,000
So there will come major points where you, the audience, will get to vote on what the player characters will need to do.

1247
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And we're going to be playing Honey Heist with special guest Erica Ishii, which is very exciting.

1248
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Erica is amazing.

1249
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Tickets are only $10 and you can get them at live.themacroy.family.

1250
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We're close on that new theme song.

1251
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh, so close.

1252
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So watch this space.

1253
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So when I say we, I mean the people who are actually working on the song.

1254
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But it's nearly finished.

1255
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
We had input in it.

1256
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
That's real good.

1257
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I guess so, yeah.

1258
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You're doing good.

1259
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Do a good job.

1260
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Maybe more drums or maybe less.

1261
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Have you thought about adding in a note here that's like, buh, buh, buh?

1262
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So here's that final.

1263
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It was sent in also by thewizardbencan.

1264
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Thank you, Ben.

1265
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You crushed it.

1266
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It's from a Yahoo Answers user, Vic, who asks,

1267
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
If Michelangelo painted the 16 Chapel, who painted the first 15 chapels?

1268
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Oh boy.

1269
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Hey.

1270
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Thanks for listening to our podcast.

1271
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1272
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Kiss your dad's scrub lips.

1273
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Wait, are we supposed to say our names?

1274
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Travis.

1275
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Wait.

1276
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, Travis.

1277
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It fell off.

1278
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It fell off.

1279
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I'm Travis.

1280
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1281
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I'm Travis.

1282
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm Griffin.

1283
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm not saying it again.

1284
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Okay, that was the show.

1285
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Hope you had some fun.

1286
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1287
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Go back into the world.

1288
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Face the day ahead.

1289
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
