1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,520
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,800
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,120
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:49,120
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:01:03,800
Hello, everyone, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,160
era.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,640
Like Chilean miners emerging from their holes, we have returned to you, Boston.

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
From their holes.

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
From their mine holes.

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,120
My name is, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,120
So Boston, Boston, I need to, we need to talk for a second before we get started.

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Can we get real?

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,040
Listen, listen, Boston, shut up.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,120
It's going to be a few months until we can do a live show again.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,080
I don't know if you know this, but my wife is just dating a baby and Griffin's wife is

20
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
just dating a baby.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
It's true.

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,920
So this might be our last one for a grip of time.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
So that leads me to my question, Boston.

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,320
We were thinking, is this going to be the last one we do for a while?

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Are you ready to get weird?

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, yeah.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,800
We thought just for this one, we get weird because Griffin, what did you think?

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,040
You thought something.

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,760
We took a poll before when everybody was coming in and we have the results of the poll available

30
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
now, Griffin.

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,400
And I've been looking at the data and I've had my analysts going over the data and it

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,840
seems like just based on sort of the demo, which is what we call demographics in the

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:03:00,040
data analysis industry, that there's a 90 to 92% chance that they horny for this.

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
And now we're going to produce actual content and not just fucking hype ourselves up.

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,800
Grab in because it's content time.

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,320
By the way, everybody, you're welcome for the hot poke stop lure that I dropped here.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
I just hit 13.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Travis just hit level 13.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
What up?

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
We're having a great day.

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,640
I've been catching a lot of ghastlies, a lot of ratata.

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,480
I got to say, Boston, I don't know if y'all have like a city slogan, but if you do, it

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,760
should be, we have like infinite drowsies up in this motherfucker.

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,880
That's the state bird.

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,240
Also as long as we're talking about Boston, so when you come to Boston, what's the one

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
thing you're going to do?

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
No.

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Wrong.

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Wrong.

50
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Wrong.

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,280
I didn't hear it anywhere.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Okay.

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,000
This was a poorly conceived bit.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Let me give you a hint.

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,560
In common, everybody's favorite sitcom with the guy from Yes, Dear that ran for TV.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,760
Travis made us go to fucking Cheers today.

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,560
Now, wait, here's the conversation.

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,280
We're walking there with a dear friend to Cheers, and he's from New York, and he said,

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
so what made you guys want to go to Cheers?

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,320
You guys must be big fans.

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,800
Took a quick poll, the three of us, and none of the... Travis is insistent that we go

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
to Cheers.

63
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,200
I want to make this super clear, has never seen an episode of Cheers.

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,240
You know how I think sad lives are funny?

65
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,880
You think the existence of Cheers is funny.

66
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,960
Sometimes I think really not funny things are funny, and dragging my brother and our

67
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,480
friend JD to Cheers was one of those.

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,840
We lasted all of 30 seconds before the words 35 minute wait escaped the hostess' mouth.

69
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,200
Too many minutes to wait.

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,080
I was horrified before we knew what the wait was when we walked up and we saw a couple

71
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,640
taking a picture in front of the Cheers sign, and they said, one, two, three, Cheers.

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,140
You can't do that, actually.

73
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,560
That's against the law.

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
What you did there was a crime.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,480
It was a crime.

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,040
It wasn't nice of Ted Danson to stop by, though.

77
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Was he in?

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
He greeted the door.

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
He was in Cheers then.

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,400
Okay, so what we do on this show is we take your questions, and we turn them alchemy-like

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
into wisdom.

82
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,640
And special for our live shows is we will do audience questions, but we have a very

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
specific rule.

84
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,660
No bummers, that's right.

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,240
And also keep it short, if you could, and a new facet that we've had to add after a

86
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,600
recent show, apolitical, if you don't mind.

87
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
That would go down real smooth.

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,040
I believe the microphone is over in that area.

89
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
We'll bring up house lights when it comes time to not trip and fall over each other.

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Yeah, it'll be super, super casual live show hang set.

91
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,560
Just a real laid back.

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Let's do some questions, though.

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Wild and crazy kids.

94
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
All right, here comes the first question.

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,000
This is from someone from this area who I think will be here, so after I read the question,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
please let me know.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
My mom is completely obsessed with the musician Sting.

98
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,320
Oh, so it's everyone's mom's, then.

99
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Wait, are you here?

100
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,400
Yeah, okay, so everybody's mom's are into Sting, cool.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,520
Whenever he's going on tour, she buys tickets to his shows multiple times to get better

102
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,420
seats, and in just everyday conversation, she'll insert comments like, you know, Sting

103
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,760
also does sessions.

104
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:38,840
It's cool your mom has so many conversations about tantric fucking.

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
And double stuffed Oreos.

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
The two things I know about Sting.

107
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Motherfucker loves double stuffed Oreos.

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
That's a reference everyone can enjoy.

109
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:51,040
She managed to find him on a street corner in New York just based on her knowledge of

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
where he lives.

111
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
What?

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,600
This is kind of a one way.

113
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,400
No, no, it'll be two way later on.

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,640
Just based on her knowledge of where he lives and his activity on social media.

115
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,840
That's also a criminal crime from the laws.

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Sting crime.

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,120
Hold on, I got wifi here right now.

118
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Let me just look up.

119
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,520
Yeah, that's a criminal crime from the federal law book.

120
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,160
The question is, should I do something about this?

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
That's from Tom in Red Hook.

122
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Tom, are you here?

123
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Hi Tom.

124
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Okay, oh shit.

125
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,520
Tom is apparently a tuvian throat singer.

126
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
How do you feel about Sting?

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
No feelings whatsoever.

128
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
No feelings on Sting.

129
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll be honest, that's exactly how I feel about Sting.

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,840
Let me take you inside, Tom was about to drop the hammer on Sting and then the thought

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,600
flashed across his head, wait, Sting could be here.

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Sting might be here.

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I need to play it cool.

134
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,840
My mom would be so pissed if I put Sting on blast and Gordon was in the room.

135
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,600
What could you possibly do at this point for your mom?

136
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
What are you going to do?

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,200
Look at her and go, mom, cool it and her go, yeah, you know what?

138
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
No, you're right.

139
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,120
Now that you mention it, I've gone over the top.

140
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Yeah, I think tracking down Sting based on his GPS signal that you hacked from the government

141
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
is you've already-

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Yeah, I've got it.

143
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
You need to do immersion therapy with your mom.

144
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
You need to get Sting to come and hang out with her every minute of every day for the

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,600
next two weeks until she looks at you and goes, I'm fucking sick of Sting.

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Yeah.

147
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Yeah, they did it.

148
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,980
Yeah, if Sting could pick up a dish for once and wash it and someone, no, I take 12 hours

149
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,240
to wash a dish.

150
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
That's the problem.

151
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,400
Yeah, that's the problem actually with this tantric stuff is that he's been in you for

152
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,880
five days and at that point, you're just like, I'm tired of Sting.

153
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,360
He's been brushing his teeth for 13 hours.

154
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,960
I need to get in the bathroom, Sting.

155
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,040
He's the only human being who listens to podcasts at half speed.

156
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,240
He loves to say it.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
I want to accentuate the goofs.

158
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,160
Okay, great, Sting.

159
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm Marc Maron.

160
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Welcome to my podcast.

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Tom, let me give you some friendly advice.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,760
Don't make your mom choose between you and Sting.

163
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,000
You may not like the way that particular deal breaks.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Here's a quick quiz.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
Actually, we can solve this right now.

166
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,440
Were you in the police?

167
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,100
Probably not.

168
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,200
You might have been.

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
I don't know the other fellows who were in there, frankly.

170
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
So yeah, you could totally pull one over on us right now, vis-a-vis the police members.

171
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,600
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

172
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Rare exception.

173
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
No.

174
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,280
Was Danny Elfman in the police, who was the other fool in the police?

175
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Stuart Copeland.

176
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,640
He wrote the theme song, The Equalizer, which is fucking... Do we have that queued up?

177
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,920
No, we don't have that one, but we'll get it for you later.

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,360
Yeah, I'd like a Yahoo.

179
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,320
A hot Yahoo here from the Yahoo Answers service.

180
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
It was sent in by, right in high, Zoe Kinski.

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,120
Thank you, Zoe.

182
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user, sorry, something has gone wrong.

183
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,120
We'll call them Sting.

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
He spends five days inside of you.

185
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
He gets bored, he gets on his phone, and he wants to know some stuff on Yahoo Answers

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
like this.

187
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:42,120
Did Guy Fieri ever eat a meal in Diner, Drive-In, or Dive that he didn't think was totally awesome?

188
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,780
I've been to a few of the restaurants they've been on his show and had the same meals he

189
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
had on TV.

190
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,520
I must tell, most of them really sucked by a wide margin.

191
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,040
I know, TV requires him to be super excited with every bite, but come on, man, Guy really

192
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:08,440
must be a huge tool bag to go into Diner after Diner and watch these people cook crap food

193
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
day after day.

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Who's the tool bag now?

195
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,720
And then shovel that crap into your hole and act like it's the best thing he ever ate.

196
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,320
That takes a certain kind of tool bag.

197
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,840
I don't care how much they pay him.

198
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,680
There isn't enough money to make me become a totally different person for a living.

199
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,880
This question took a wonderful turn.

200
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Hold on.

201
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Isn't there?

202
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,680
Yahoo Answers question asked, how much money would it take before you ate something and

203
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,720
went, this is delicious, because I guarantee it's way less than you are claiming here,

204
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,320
which is no amount.

205
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,720
He looks like two Smash Mouths got crushed together in the Large Hadron Collider.

206
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,880
He's never said a word that wasn't screamed through a throatful of chili fries, but what

207
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,120
I don't like about Guy Fieri is he seems a little disingenuous.

208
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,400
I was actually ready to jump on the like, fuck Guy Fieri, like what a tool bag, until

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,080
he started listening to me, I was like, maybe he's doing something for the mom and pop industry

210
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,160
of America, where he goes in and eats the crap food from these mom and pop diners, and

211
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,600
he looks at the camera and goes, it was great.

212
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Come here.

213
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Guy Fieri came to Hillbilly Hot Dogs in Huntington, West Virginia.

214
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
That's right.

215
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah, what's up, Huntington?

216
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,480
Had himself a home wrecker, which is a foot-long hot dog that is 18 inches long.

217
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,120
It's a weird name for it, if you think about it, and it has lots of stuff on it, and he

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
ate the whole thing, and then he brought it on Jay Leno's show, which is the perfect venue.

219
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
He regurgitated it into Jay Leno's mouth like a baby bird.

220
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
It was fucking insane.

221
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,040
The answer to your question of whether or not Guy Fieri's ever had anything he didn't

222
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,400
think was totally awesome is, of course, yes, obviously.

223
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,200
But what this question posits is that he's an amazing act.

224
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,320
No, he's a true fucking professional who's in there day in, day out eating trash for

225
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,480
you to mock him from the sidelines.

226
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,600
He eats those cheddar jalapeno popper explosions, and he eats them, and then his brain goes,

227
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,480
I've had better, but his face screams, yes, yes, please got another.

228
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,120
Everyone in Flavortown just had a simultaneous orgasm.

229
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,720
My brothers and I ate there with a friend of ours named Lynn, and it was a delicious

230
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
meal.

231
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,120
It was a delicious meal, and I think he does a hell of a restaurant.

232
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,920
I just want to say- His restaurant's real good.

233
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
If his restaurant is in question, it was a fine meal.

234
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:33,720
As far as food that you eat as a joke goes- High marks all around.

235
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Can I interest you all in another question?

236
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Yes, please.

237
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Yes.

238
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
One of my friends in...

239
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
I want a munch.

240
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
This bitch.

241
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
I want too much.

242
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Welcome to Munch Squad.

243
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,720
How many of you, this is your first time listening to my brother, my brother, and me?

244
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Hold on.

245
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,960
Let the applause roll in for Munch Squad.

246
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Justin.

247
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Team Mac.

248
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I got to stand for this one.

249
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,200
Can you get me another brewski open so I can tell everybody about Domino's unveiling a

250
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,160
new pizza burger hybrid called the Pizza Burger.

251
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,600
Munch Squad, if you don't know, is a bit where I talk about the new food trends coming to

252
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,960
fast food restaurants, fast casual.

253
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,520
It is six episodes old.

254
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,800
It's a classic.

255
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Here's the tagline.

256
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,280
Here's the tagline.

257
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
It's upside down.

258
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
There you go.

259
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,760
Looks like a burger, tastes like a pizza.

260
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Simple enough.

261
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Easy enough to understand.

262
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,160
I would like my food to look-

263
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,600
Looks like a garbage can.

264
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,240
Tastes like 10 tacos.

265
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
It's a garbage can full of tacos.

266
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,760
You're going to love it.

267
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
So we have quotes.

268
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,000
The thing about Munch Squad is I take the quotes directly from the professionals, the

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,780
people who should know what this food is like.

270
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:01,000
The first comes to us from S. Murugan, who is the senior vice president of marketing

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,120
for Domino's Pizza India, where the-

272
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Oh, man.

273
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I can't get one of these bad boys.

274
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Nah.

275
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,880
The burger pizza is exclusive.

276
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,960
And here's what he says about it.

277
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,480
The burger pizza is different from conventional burgers in many ways.

278
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,360
I can think of one major way off the top of my head.

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,480
I want to clarify, in case you can't picture it in your head, if you're picturing like

280
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,360
a pizza-flavored burger, you are wrong.

281
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
If you're picturing a calzone, fucking leave.

282
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,400
Just fucking leave.

283
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:37,240
Picture like an egg and cheese McMuffin, except it's mostly made out of pizza.

284
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:48,680
So the burger pizza is the chain's attempt to break into the all day individual consumption

285
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:05,960
market, which is of course what Guy Fieri calls his home.

286
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:19,320
We aim to address the desire for a burger through a new kind of pizza.

287
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Something came out of Travis on that one.

288
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,600
It makes no sense.

289
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,720
It is available at the more than 1,000 Domino's Pizza locations in India.

290
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,220
How's it going, India?

291
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,640
But unfortunately for America, burger and pizza lovers, it is an available state side.

292
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,640
I think they're assuming a lot by thinking that burger and pizza lovers are going to

293
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,920
be a fan of this fucking Island of Dr. Moreau style.

294
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,120
The only way that works is if every time someone went to a restaurant, they ordered both pizza

295
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,240
and burger because they couldn't decide between the two.

296
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Right.

297
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
No, I want pizza.

298
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,680
If you find it hard to choose between burgers and pizza when you're hungry-

299
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,560
And oh man, that's every day for me.

300
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
For sure.

301
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,760
Domino's has a solution for you.

302
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,960
The appropriately, if not so creatively tiled burger pizza.

303
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Does it say that in there?

304
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Wait, hold on.

305
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Is that a quote?

306
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
That's a quote from the fucking article.

307
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,240
We did a shitty job.

308
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
We get it.

309
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,040
We get it.

310
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,720
The burger pizza hybrid costs an affordable 89 rupees or $1.33.

311
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,160
Holy shit.

312
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,120
How much did your lunch cost, Justin?

313
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,680
I'd rather not say.

314
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,760
Unlike this is a direct quote from Dev Amaritesh, president and chief business officer of Domino's

315
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,240
Pizza India, as I'm certain you know.

316
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Unlike other burgers, the burger pizza is comfort food.

317
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,120
No.

318
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,100
Unlike the health food burgers you're all used to.

319
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:56,120
Unlike other burgers, burger pizza is comfort food, full of pizza goodness and has been

320
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,920
specifically designed for the Indian palate.

321
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
Okay.

322
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Sure.

323
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:11,480
Anyway, that is the story on burger pizza.

324
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:20,320
You just closed your computer, but do you really want to read a question for us now?

325
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,920
Thank you, Jeeves.

326
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
One second.

327
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I got some owls on my screen.

328
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,240
Let me swipe them out of the way, and we're going to get this show rolling here.

329
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,640
As soon as we deal with these fucking owls.

330
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,680
The owls on my screen saver.

331
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,480
One of my friends believes in mermaids.

332
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,180
At first, I thought it was some sort of inside joke I wasn't getting and didn't pay much

333
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,240
attention to it, but then she almost broke up with her boyfriend when he tried to explain

334
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,320
to her that they are fictional.

335
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,240
She constantly points to the fake Discovery Channel documentary as proof of her existence.

336
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Good work, Discovery Channel.

337
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh, it's going to be totally harmless.

338
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Fun joke.

339
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Fun joke.

340
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Cool ratings.

341
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Cool job, guys.

342
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,240
In college, she took marine biology classes and is even trying to get a job in an aquarium

343
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,440
with hopes of someday learning enough to go out and find the mermaids herself.

344
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,960
She has been venting about it to me lately, and I have no idea what to do.

345
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,380
Should I let her have her delusions or try to burst her bubble?

346
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,040
That's from Miffed with mermaids.

347
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,600
I have a two-part question.

348
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,480
The second part, I'm going to skip to it, is this person who you are talking about here.

349
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Thank you.

350
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Yeah.

351
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
You did great.

352
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,760
We won't make that mistake a ninth time.

353
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Yeah.

354
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,920
We've fallen into that trap before.

355
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,920
We're done with interventions here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

356
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
It's just advice.

357
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,080
Now, she believes- Now, ask question one.

358
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,120
Well, I got my answer because they said that she wasn't here.

359
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:52,160
My favorite player in this tale is the boyfriend who I'm guessing should know better.

360
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah, for sure.

361
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,240
It sounds like this is a pretty defining characteristic of this individual.

362
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,720
The boyfriend was probably having a shitty day and said, you know what?

363
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I'm going there.

364
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
You know what?

365
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Yeah.

366
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I'm done dancing on eggshells.

367
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
You know what?

368
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Fuck it.

369
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Today's the day.

370
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,480
Tell me again about mermaids, Deborah.

371
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,920
The New York Times recently ran an article, I think the headline was like, yes, there

372
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,480
have been aliens.

373
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,720
And I didn't read it, but the point of this article, I bet, was that the universe is so

374
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,200
infinitely large and there's so many planets out there that certainly at some point there

375
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,680
have been aliens.

376
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,320
And I would like to pause at the same point here, which is to say there have been so many

377
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:53,160
people that at some point one of them fucked a fish or a dolphin or a whale.

378
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,120
There's 12 people like, yes.

379
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,280
You got it.

380
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Life finds a way.

381
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,820
I'm just saying, it's not my that would be fucking great.

382
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,040
Mermaid Park, I don't understand where they're coming from.

383
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,080
You were so busy worrying about it, you really didn't.

384
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,840
Well, yeah, I didn't think people were fucking fish, yes.

385
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
That's on me.

386
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
People are getting killed by mermaids.

387
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,320
I'll sit on this one because I didn't think people were going to fuck fish.

388
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm just saying it's not my thing, but I'm just saying, I get it.

389
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
It's probably a thing.

390
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,160
I don't want to yuck any yumps, but I'm just saying sometimes you see those salmon.

391
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,960
I actually do want to yuck this yump.

392
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
No, no, no, no.

393
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Please do not fuck fish.

394
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,020
Let me describe the yum first.

395
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,000
You see one of those salmon and they just finished spawning and they have that dope

396
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,480
pearlescent red color and they look awesome.

397
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm saying not me, but somebody probably sees that and is like...

398
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,720
I actually want to still yuck that.

399
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,020
Might I yuck that, please?

400
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,840
How much of the earth's deep oceans is unexplored?

401
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,800
All of it.

402
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,720
There's no way of... Prove to me that somewhere in the Mariana Trench... Okay, these are

403
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
probably mermaids.

404
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,200
A lot of people think that they're going to be human size, but it's a human fucking a

405
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
fish, right?

406
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Yeah.

407
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,680
So why wouldn't they be like human top, fish bottom, but on fish scale like David the gnome

408
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,980
of mermaids?

409
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,680
What I'm saying is how deep have we been in the Mariana Trench?

410
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,360
Not particularly deep, I'd assume.

411
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,560
If this is what's waiting for us down there, we've gone deep enough.

412
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,120
Can I also say that I think it is silly of us to assume that it'll be half and half,

413
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,280
which is not how breeding ever works.

414
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,600
You think it's like fish, guy, fish, guy, like 10%, 10%.

415
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah.

416
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,560
Evenly spaced.

417
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,120
This is like... But if it's more like a calico and kind of splotches everywhere.

418
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
That's fun too.

419
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,520
That's a fun luck of the draw thing where it's like, I hope I get gills in a dick.

420
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:08,000
I prefer my mer parfait of just like, there's like a belly button scales, pee pee scales,

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,760
knees scales.

422
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,560
So did that help?

423
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,880
Wow.

424
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,080
We didn't even touch on the shit at all.

425
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Should we touch on this?

426
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,680
I mean like- No, we good.

427
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,200
Which of these two, Trev?

428
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
This one.

429
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Yeah.

430
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
This one's sending by level nine.

431
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Yeah, true, true, Drew Davenport.

432
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Thank you, Drew.

433
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:41,840
This is by yadrewanswersuser Ahmad who asks, don't you wish that donkeys only existed in

434
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,320
legends?

435
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,800
Instead of wishing mythical creatures to be real, why not exile trouble making creatures

436
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,280
into legends?

437
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,640
I follow this question up to this point and then, like boneheaded donkeys wearing dress

438
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
of humans.

439
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
What?

440
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
What?

441
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,480
How often is that coming up?

442
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,740
I just unlocked this because I read it earlier and I've just unlocked it.

443
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:21,340
I think this person saw the movie franchise Shrek the movies and said, everything in this

444
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,720
movie is fantasy bullshit and they're like, donkeys are real and he was like, yeah, right.

445
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,720
They make super hairy horses that aren't as attractive.

446
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Sure.

447
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Yeah, right.

448
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Great.

449
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:43,000
Do you think everybody sees a donkey in the hat and is like, no, not again.

450
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,600
Do you wish that donkeys only existed in legends?

451
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:55,400
The ideal for me would be if we could like exile donkeys to legend, but it would be like

452
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,560
tomorrow.

453
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,120
So like from this point forward.

454
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,760
From this point forward, all donkeys are legend.

455
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,000
Donkeys never exist, but donkeys did exist, but now they're legends.

456
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,120
So when I have grandchildren, I can tell them about the donkeys.

457
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,320
No, grandpa Paul, there was never a boneheaded donkey in people's dress.

458
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,920
They were small, stupid horses.

459
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,040
It's true.

460
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,080
I never actually saw one myself.

461
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I never saw one.

462
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,880
That's a good question, Travis.

463
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:35,440
Listen, everybody out there, listen, I need you to pay attention for once and engage.

464
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,200
If donkeys disappeared tomorrow, do you feel like you've appreciated donkeys now?

465
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,560
In the arms of the donkey far away.

466
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,460
I think when you all go home tonight, you'll really think twice about just walking past

467
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,000
that donkey on your front lawn.

468
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

469
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,720
How many donkeys have you walked past just today and they have their little signs that

470
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,040
are just hoof prints because they're donk, because they're donkeys.

471
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,480
And you turn towards them and you held up your phone and you caught a ghastly on their

472
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,760
fucking face.

473
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,300
Let me tell you about a real life Pokemon friend of mine.

474
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,400
It's called the American donkey.

475
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,360
That's a donkey is a fun character from the show, my brother, my brother and me that we

476
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
do.

477
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,200
I mean, that is our IP.

478
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,680
So you're going to be sued now.

479
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Yeah.

480
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
In jail.

481
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Do you want another question?

482
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Yeah.

483
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Yeah.

484
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,080
This one comes to us from Caroline.

485
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,840
It says, dear brothers, I've moved in with my girlfriend and her family and overall things

486
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
have been good.

487
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,960
I get along with her whole family, but there's one issue.

488
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,900
After years of living with roommates and buying individual food, I'm very defensive over my

489
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
food.

490
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,920
I know it's a shared household and I do eat some of their food, but I can't.

491
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,400
We got to circle back on that one.

492
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,020
But I can't help but be a little hurt when the lunch meats I bought Tuesday are gone

493
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
by Thursday.

494
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,440
How can I become less of a food hoarder with my new family?

495
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Carolyn, Carolyn, are you here?

496
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Hey Carolyn.

497
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Hey.

498
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Let me tell you where you lost me.

499
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Can you guess?

500
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Do you have the insight?

501
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Can you guess where you lost me?

502
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Let me help.

503
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,760
It was when you said you did eat their food.

504
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,080
I want to eat their things without having my things be eaten.

505
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Sincerely, a human representation of the United States of America.

506
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:45,320
But no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade, we're just having fun up here, Caroline.

507
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I get it.

508
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
Yeah.

509
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah.

510
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
I've done that.

511
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,680
When I moved in with my wife at that time, my girlfriend, I would buy treats just for

512
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
me.

513
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Yeah.

514
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I think that was going to be my idea.

515
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,920
And I will also say in your corner, Tuesday to Thursday, that's a heavy lunch meat consumption

516
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,600
that this household represents.

517
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
There is a luxury monster in your house.

518
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,680
Do you live with Chad from The Bachelorette?

519
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,720
A lot of Chad fans in the fucking crowd tonight.

520
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,640
He's a horribly abusive man and we should never applaud him.

521
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,920
And he loves lunch meat.

522
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,800
But boy does he love to eat lunch meat.

523
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,320
And that's funny.

524
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,580
But he's violent and horrible.

525
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
And that's not.

526
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,840
And that's not funny.

527
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,200
But he eats lunch meat like it's Pringles, it's great.

528
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,760
Um, hmm, there's nothing wrong with having secret food.

529
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,400
You just got to have a good place to hide it.

530
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,480
That's not good for frozen.

531
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,880
It's not good for frozen.

532
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
That's right.

533
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
You can't hide your frozen.

534
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,040
Going grocery shopping with Travis is like going grocery shopping with an old prospector.

535
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,040
You got to get your frozen.

536
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
You got to get some Vittles.

537
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,560
You got to get your secret soup.

538
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,120
You got to get your greenie meanies.

539
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,440
And your flapjack makings.

540
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,400
Your flapjack makings and your porkums.

541
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
Limes.

542
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
For scurvy?

543
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
For scurvy.

544
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Yeah.

545
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
For all the prospectors scurvy.

546
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
You got to get your red buddies.

547
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Are you talking about apples or tomatoes?

548
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Yes.

549
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,440
You got to get your brown friends.

550
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,120
All the red foods you can handle scares the mountain ghosts away.

551
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,440
Did you mean mountain goat?

552
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,640
What are you fucking talking about?

553
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,960
Are you even a prospector?

554
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,800
Are you doing research for a part?

555
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,460
Are you, are you Jared Leto?

556
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,200
You have to tell me legally if you're Jared Leto.

557
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Um.

558
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,640
We got a lot of Leto heads.

559
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,640
Yeah.

560
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Leto fiends.

561
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
We've been going maybe like a half hour.

562
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
When should we do audience questions?

563
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Uh.

564
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
I know you got one more Yahoo.

565
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
I got one more Yahoo.

566
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
I thought you were.

567
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I just want to send them by.

568
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,680
I just want to send them by Riding High and Zoe Kinsey again.

569
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Thank you Zoe.

570
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,600
Yahoo answers user Joey asks.

571
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,160
What extreme unreasonable things would you do just for one slice of piping hot Chicago

572
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,280
style pizza?

573
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,000
It's a weird exchange race.

574
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,400
I mean I have an extreme unreasonable thing I do whenever I have one slice of piping hot

575
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:39,360
Chicago style pizza and that is have diarrhea for three days.

576
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,180
I got to play the local crowd.

577
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:48,280
My favorite pizza chain is actually the Canadian Boston Pizza.

578
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,200
What situation are you running into where someone's like hey do you want this pizza

579
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
pizza?

580
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Prove it.

581
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,720
How much does it cost to fly to Chicago?

582
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,080
That's like that's the furthest you should ever go.

583
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Yeah.

584
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Cause it's literally everywhere.

585
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,520
If it's like I would pay $400 it's like you could pay $300 and get to O'Hare and snatch

586
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,040
that za.

587
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
If you're in Chicago you shouldn't do anything.

588
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,720
You should just go get some of it.

589
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Just go get some.

590
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,720
That should inexplicably need Chicago style pizza.

591
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
You should just.

592
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Have the stuff.

593
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Just have some.

594
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Yeah.

595
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,320
The furthest most unreasonable thing you should do is teach yourself how to make it.

596
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,280
Do you think the great Chicago fire was somebody just like I got to get me that za.

597
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
That would have been ill-advised.

598
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Yeah.

599
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,320
Ah beans I burn all pizza town down.

600
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,160
There isn't any pizza here.

601
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,360
Oh sorry you guys never lived in Chicago so there's this dope part of town called Pizza

602
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Town.

603
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
It's right next to Roscoe Village.

604
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,640
It's sick.

605
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,400
The streets are literally pizza.

606
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,840
It's actually horrible and disgusting.

607
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,400
When there's potholes just grease pools up.

608
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,000
It's really really horrible.

609
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,560
And it's like an ice nine situation.

610
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:12,440
If you touch the pizza you turn into pizza and die.

611
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
I think we're ready for audience questions.

612
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Yeah.

613
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Can we get some house lights.

614
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Please don't line up.

615
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
It's not a TED talk.

616
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:25,040
This just came in so hot.

617
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,160
This is breaking news that comes fresh on my phone.

618
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,880
We've got a haunted doll watch.

619
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
You take him back down.

620
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
No house lights.

621
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,240
Justin's a liar.

622
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
We pranked you.

623
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
That was a fun.

624
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Bring the house lights down.

625
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
Hold on.

626
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Sorry.

627
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
This just came in so fucking.

628
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I got a notification.

629
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
This is a hot haunted doll.

630
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Haunted doll.

631
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
Gonna go fast.

632
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Gonna go fast.

633
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,760
Haunted doll called Hunter.

634
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Haunted doll.

635
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Active.

636
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Don't even sweat it.

637
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Sunshine Maquia.

638
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,820
And it says again here on the listing.

639
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Active.

640
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm gonna ask my brother Travis one of the most notable things about this listing of

641
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,560
a haunted doll on eBay.

642
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,960
Travis, why don't you tell me the backdrop that they've chosen for haunted doll Maquia?

643
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,320
It's like $100 bills.

644
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
Yeah.

645
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,400
It's just lots of haunted dollar bills.

646
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,160
It's just so fucking fresh.

647
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,560
I don't know how to doll who's also a baller.

648
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,680
The most balling thing.

649
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,040
This is my favorite doll.

650
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,160
I call her Sunshine Makiya.

651
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,680
She is the spirit of a spunky eight year old.

652
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,060
She brings a sense of brightness to any room.

653
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,720
You will need that after thinking about

654
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,680
an eight year old dying.

655
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,740
So it's refreshing.

656
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,360
It's good that the doll brings that lightness to any room.

657
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,680
She laughs and sings.

658
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,960
She doesn't, she's a doll.

659
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,760
And turns night lights on, that's okay.

660
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,480
And off, well that's, that's earth conscious of her.

661
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,920
It's very eco-friendly.

662
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,840
She wants to bring happiness to a family

663
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,720
who doesn't care about their electric bills presumably.

664
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,240
And here's the thing about Sunshine Makiya,

665
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,620
she needs help finding the light.

666
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,240
And she did get her picture taken in front of several.

667
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,200
A million dollars.

668
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,800
Like a million dollars, so she can afford it.

669
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,320
Anyway, that's Haunted Doll Watch.

670
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,160
Now we.

671
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,840
That's a little thing just for you.

672
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,600
Hey everybody, we want to take a quick break

673
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,160
from this live extravaganza of this

674
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,400
physical manifestation of joy and acceptance

675
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,200
to tell you about some of our sponsors this week.

676
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,280
Yeah, Travis isn't here because we,

677
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,200
ah dang it, Kevin!

678
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,240
We left him in Boston.

679
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,520
And also we called him Kevin.

680
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,920
And that's probably why we lost him.

681
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
We were like, Kevin, you ready to go?

682
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,460
And nobody answered, so we just got on the fucking plane.

683
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,300
Well, there we know.

684
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,120
Travis did not change his name to Kevin.

685
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,920
It's still just Travis.

686
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,840
What if one of the parents of that movie did

687
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,200
definitely see he was still asleep?

688
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,360
He's like, I can't fucking deal with Kevin.

689
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,200
I can't.

690
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,240
I'll figure this out later.

691
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,760
This fucking pizza monster.

692
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,200
Always demanding his own pizzas.

693
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,320
I hate this kid.

694
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
You are, you're getting homed alone.

695
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,640
Our sponsor this week is Harry's.

696
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,920
They have supported us for so long.

697
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,480
And let me ask you a question.

698
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,180
Have you wondered why all the razors are behind glass?

699
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,480
I just thought it was because they did crimes.

700
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
And so they were in razor jail,

701
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
the most dangerous jail of all.

702
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,640
They're not in razor jail.

703
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,760
In razor jail, you don't get cut.

704
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,800
You cut, do the cutting.

705
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah.

706
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,000
No, it's because they're so flipping expensive.

707
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,160
They're really, really pricey.

708
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,360
But you don't have to worry about that.

709
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,580
That's not your problem anymore.

710
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,400
That's the rubes problem.

711
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,920
No, you are gonna start shopping at Harry's.

712
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,600
These are German engineered five blade cartridges

713
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,400
that provide a close, comfortable shave.

714
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
And the quality is guaranteed.

715
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,920
If you don't like them, I bet you will.

716
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,680
But if you don't, you get a full refund.

717
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,500
And these are at half the price of the leading brand

718
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,880
because these are like factory direct prices.

719
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,320
I wanna tell you about the Truman Starter Set.

720
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,720
It's a great option for new customers.

721
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,560
It's an amazing deal.

722
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Just 15 bucks, you get a razor handle.

723
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,880
You get moisturizing shave cream

724
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,680
and you get three of Harry's five blade,

725
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,220
German engineered razors.

726
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,320
They're gonna give our listeners five bucks off

727
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,800
that Starter Set with your first purchase

728
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,320
at H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.

729
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,160
That's Harry's.com and use the promo code,

730
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,560
my brother, all one word,

731
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,700
and get that dope Starter Set for 10 bucks.

732
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,640
Again, that's H-A-R-R-Y-S.

733
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,840
Make sure you use that promo code, my brother.

734
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,080
I also wanna tell you about MeUndies.

735
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,800
MeUndies.com slash my brother

736
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,920
is gonna be the address for this one.

737
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,040
Listen, if you are wearing underwear right now

738
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,840
and they aren't MeUndies, you're cheating your nuts.

739
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,360
Or your vagina.

740
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,840
Vagina or a non-binary.

741
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,800
I don't know what you got in there.

742
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,600
It's none of my fucking business.

743
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,760
The important thing is you gotta cradle it.

744
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,960
And the only thing to cradle your non-specific genitalia.

745
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,320
Every pair of MeUndies is made from sustainably sourced modal.

746
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,160
What's modal?

747
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,040
Well, it's a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

748
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
It shouldn't exist.

749
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,680
It should not exist.

750
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,180
It's a crime against God.

751
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,000
And every month I got new styles.

752
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
We get the new styles in the mirror.

753
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,680
This one's flavor is inspired by my Miami Beach.

754
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,360
You know that's my vibe.

755
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,280
Yeah, the styles are very, very fresh.

756
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,120
I get very excited.

757
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,560
It's the most stylish clothes I wear

758
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
and most people don't get to see it.

759
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,840
Just analyze.

760
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,040
Shipping is free in the U.S. and Canada.

761
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,280
And you can, that one's terrible.

762
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
You can save up to $8.

763
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,960
It's like, that's Borat's last words.

764
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,960
My man, my boy, my wife.

765
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,900
You can save up to $8 a pair

766
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,440
with the MeUndies subscription plan.

767
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,000
Get the plan, get a pair.

768
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,020
Either way, you get 20% off your first order

769
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,340
when you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

770
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,300
That is MeUndies.com slash my brother

771
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,560
for 20% off your first order.

772
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,680
Got a Jumbotron here.

773
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,640
This message is for Katie and it's from Edbury

774
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,960
who says, it's almost Valentine's Day.

775
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,480
Oh no.

776
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,920
But the Max One calendar says it'll be more like July.

777
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
Yes. Yes.

778
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,880
When the brothers read this.

779
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,040
Uh-huh.

780
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,760
We've only been seeing each other for a few weeks

781
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,640
so this is either going to be,

782
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,480
this is either going to make future Katie's day

783
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,260
or be incredibly awkward for both of us separately.

784
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,600
Even if things don't pan out,

785
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,360
you definitely deserve a V-Day surprise this summer.

786
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,480
Holy shit. Oh shit.

787
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,560
Please email right this second

788
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,960
and let us know which it is because I have to know.

789
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,720
I'm actually okay with the sort of Schrodinger's cat

790
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,080
situation. Okay, okay.

791
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,920
Schrodinger's relationship.

792
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,880
Yeah, this is really wonderful

793
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,660
and best of luck for your relationship

794
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,240
over the past five months, I guess.

795
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,060
That's applicable.

796
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,120
Best of luck to you two.

797
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,080
Yeah. To both of you.

798
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,120
Best of luck.

799
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
And one, oh, do you want to do this one?

800
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,680
It's a message for Faye slash mom

802
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,880
and it's from Jake and Max.

803
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,600
So maybe, maybe she's Faye to one of them

804
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,480
and mom to the other.

805
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,960
I don't know exactly what the breakdown is.

806
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,240
Well, that's revealed in literally

807
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,680
the first sentence of the message.

808
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,120
Happy birthday to the mess mom and partner.

809
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,720
Try that again because you did say mess mom and that's.

810
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,720
I am mess mom, welcome to my comic strip.

811
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,740
It's very long running and poorly read.

812
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,280
Happy birthday to the best mom, not mess mom

813
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,920
and partner from your best family and favorite brothers.

814
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,020
May your year be full of geeky wonders

815
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,040
and boundless adventure.

816
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,240
Also stop listening to the adventure zone without Jake.

817
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,360
The brothers command it.

818
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,880
Now your birthday was April 6th

819
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,600
and we're very sorry about that Faye mom, mess mom.

820
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,360
But you have heard this message now.

821
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,200
Yeah.

822
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,120
So it's a fish.

823
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,360
Just remember it on your next birthday, I guess.

824
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,720
Thank you all the folks who came out to Boston.

825
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,500
It was seriously like the wildest, wettest crowd

826
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,760
like we've probably ever had.

827
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,600
It was, yeah, it was wet and wild.

828
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,440
It was so good.

829
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,080
Thank you everybody at the Wilbur theater

830
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,920
for being so great.

831
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,680
Thank you to Kelsey who helped us,

832
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,760
who managed this show for us.

833
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,560
I wanna say something real quick.

834
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,520
Just wanna remind everybody that we are doing a card game.

835
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,840
It is an expansion of the card game monikers.

836
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,080
If you don't know monikers,

837
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,960
it's a great card game that's basically

838
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,920
like an expanded re-imagined version of charades

839
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,140
is perhaps the best way of explaining it.

840
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,840
But we've got an expansion of it.

841
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,060
It's 112 cards.

842
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,280
Every one of them is a reference to something

843
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,760
in one of our podcasts,

844
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,120
but they're not just like in-jokey references.

845
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,360
This is something you can play with everybody.

846
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,660
You can share with the whole family.

847
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,400
Seriously, it's my favorite party game right now.

848
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,360
It has replaced a lot of the other party games

849
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,240
that we used to play.

850
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,560
And every time we go on a trip with our friends,

851
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,240
we bring it and play it every single time.

852
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,560
And it's hard to get a lot of the times.

853
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
A lot of times it's like sold out places

854
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
because it's really hard to get.

855
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,040
I waited for months to get my copy,

856
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,280
but you're not gonna have to do that.

857
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,280
If you wanna get just our collection

858
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,940
that we hand wrote every single card in this bad boy,

859
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,580
it's $10 to pre-order and we're only doing pre-orders.

860
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,800
Once that's over, that's it.

861
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,080
We gotta stress that this time,

862
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,300
like this thing's gonna be available for pre-order

863
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,180
for a few more weeks.

864
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,020
And then after that,

865
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,080
it will not be available just to purchase.

866
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,800
The only way that we can get it in your hands

867
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
is if you pre-order it.

868
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,160
So please do not sleep and ask us like a month from now

869
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
how you can get it.

870
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,880
And if you don't have the game, that's okay.

871
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,720
Like half of the pre-orders have been,

872
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,800
you can pre-order it with the actual game for 35 bucks.

873
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,040
And about half the pre-orders have been that.

874
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,600
So that's a lot of people getting in the monikers

875
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,400
and you're going to have so much fun with it.

876
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,040
And it's really, really, really, really cool.

877
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,200
And we're really proud of it.

878
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,560
We worked really hard on it.

879
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,520
Also a portion of the sales are gonna go

880
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,640
to benefit Grow Huntington,

881
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,360
which is a, it's a urban farm

882
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,120
that's going to be helping people in addiction recovery.

883
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,400
And I'm really excited about the project.

884
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,120
They just got their land and they're trying to pay for it.

885
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,320
So by buying this collection,

886
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,760
you're actually gonna be helping to do that.

887
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,320
The address is mackleroycollection.com.

888
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,040
Mackleroycollection.com.

889
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,960
Please, you have 23 days left.

890
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,880
Please don't sleep.

891
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,260
Go and pre-order right this second.

892
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,040
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,040

899
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,720
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

900
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,560
for the use of our theme song.

901
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,640
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

902
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,880
And seriously, again, everybody who came to our Boston shows

903
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,640
and who was involved in the production of the Boston shows,

904
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,480
thank you.

905
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,400
It was like, it was the best,

906
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,620
like it was one of the best weekends like of my life.

907
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,700
The My Bim Bam show was so much fun.

908
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,040
The Adventure Zone was like, holy shit,

909
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,880
like mind-blowingly great.

910
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,920
Just thank you all.

911
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
Thanks.

912
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,580
Thank you.

913
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

914
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,360
Now back to the show.

915
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,760
You guys, I'm so excited to introduce to you

916
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,760
my new baby, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.

917
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,440
This is gonna be a really fun look

918
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
at things that I find curious,

919
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
whether it's a menstrual cup,

920
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,320
it might be the Romanov family,

921
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,040
it might be fracking, it could be Carly Fiorina.

922
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,880
I don't even know.

923
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,700
Who knows?

924
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,800
It's gonna be whatever I think is interesting.

925
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,940
I can't wait to bring it to you guys.

926
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,440
We're gonna be bringing in content experts.

927
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,840
I'm gonna be learning the things.

928
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,560
It's only gonna take about 30 minutes

929
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,720
for you to expand your baby brains with me

930
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,040
and have a super fun time.

931
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
So I can't wait to see you

932
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,160
on our first episode of Getting Curious.

933
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,240
Okay, now can we get house lights up?

934
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,400
Sorry, we're the fucking worst.

935
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,480
Listen, I'm at the whim of the app.

936
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,320
Let's see here.

937
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,640
Let's go a little bit more.

938
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,480
Can we get more house lights?

939
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,320
A little bit more.

940
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,140
A little bit more.

941
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,980
Yeah, a little bit more.

942
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,800
Now that doesn't help.

943
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,640
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait.

944
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,480
I'm gonna say.

945
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,300
In the back of the...

946
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,140
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

947
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,320
Two hands up right here.

948
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,160
Blonde hair, yes.

949
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,000
You.

950
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

951
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,660
Come on down.

952
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,500
Yes, you got it.

953
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,320
Yes, come on down.

954
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,160
Wait, yes.

955
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes.

956
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,820
Hi.

957
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,660
Yes, you're doing it.

958
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,500
Hello.

959
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,320
Where's the mic?

960
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,160
Where's the mic?

961
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,000
Wait, no, no, I think...

962
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, shit.

963
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Wait, wait, where's the mic?

964
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,820
Oh, God.

965
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,660
Hey, hold on a second.

966
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,880
Hold on, wait, we lost the microphone.

967
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,900
I thought we had a floor mic.

968
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,740
Hold on one second.

969
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,160
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

970
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,000
So...

971
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,340
Okay, but seriously, there's a Hamburglar for microphones

972
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,920
somewhere in the crowd.

973
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,740
Which is a fun bit.

974
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,580
His name is Clint McElroy.

975
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,200
Somebody's like, hell yeah, I'm gonna get a free mic.

976
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,020
That's a weird reaction to that.

977
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,860
Hi, what's your name?

978
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,920
Hi, I'm Sandra.

979
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,760
Hi, Sandra.

980
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,600
Hello, Sandra.

981
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,420
Sandra, what's up?

982
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,260
Are you gonna have any...

983
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,100
Are you thinking about maybe a bummer tonight,

984
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,920
or what are you...

985
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,760
No, no, no, no bummers.

986
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,600
Great, great, great.

987
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,420
Okay, no bummers.

988
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,260
Okay, great.

989
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,460
Can we get a little more Sandra in our ears, please?

990
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,660
Crank up the knob that says Sandra back there.

991
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,620
Do you have a Sandra knob?

992
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,500
Can you give me like 70% more Sandra?

993
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,300
Hey, is there any more Sandra you could provide?

994
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,460
Waitin' on the Sandra.

995
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,960
Waitin' on the Sandra drop.

996
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,320
I can't get any Sandra on my left.

997
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,160
Hey.

998
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,000
So, hey, what's up, brother?

999
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,360
How are you doing?

1000
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm super drunk, but...

1001
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,420
All right.

1002
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,260
Yeah.

1003
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,100
Yeah.

1004
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,920
Yeah.

1005
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,760
Yeah.

1006
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,600
Yeah.

1007
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,420
Yeah.

1008
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,260
Yeah.

1009
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,800
So, I actually sent this in,

1010
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,000
but I wanted to like really drive it home.

1011
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,320
It's not a bummer, I promise.

1012
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,160
Okay.

1013
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
So, my friend just said she's pregnant.

1014
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,000
Cool.

1015
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,820
And if it's a girl,

1016
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,220
cause I know you guys are dads or about to be dads.

1017
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,060
Yeah.

1018
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,900
And if it's a girl,

1019
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,560
she wants to name her Winslow hyphen Stephanie.

1020
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,400
So, like...

1021
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,400
So, either A, how do I help this future small person,

1022
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,700
or B, when is a good age to tell them

1023
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,060
to pack up and move away?

1024
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,700
Good question.

1025
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,660
Winslow, okay.

1026
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,360
Winslow, correct me if I'm wrong,

1027
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,860
but Winslow hyphen Stephanie sounds like

1028
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,460
somebody named Stephanie bought a bar called the Winslow.

1029
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,960
And she's like, well, people won't know where to come,

1030
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,560
but I do want my name on it.

1031
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,360
I'm gonna call it Winslow hyphen Stephanie.

1032
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,700
Without giving a last name, what's the last initial?

1033
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,620
S.

1034
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,460
Okay.

1035
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,660
Hmm, that's just nothing for us.

1036
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
I just wanna make sure it wouldn't end up being like,

1037
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,020
Winslow Williams.

1038
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,860
If it was a...

1039
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,820
Hey, Travis, what would have been the funny letter?

1040
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,660
W.

1041
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,820
Okay, W, okay, got it.

1042
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,060
If it had been a boy, would they have named them?

1043
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,400
I think Winslow's still on the table, if it's a boy.

1044
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,500
Oh, okay.

1045
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,860
I was gonna make a Carl Winslow joke,

1046
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,720
but the construction of it would have been extremely tedious.

1047
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,720
I will say, I recently watched a clip from the hit show,

1048
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,260
Family Matters, and Reginald L. Johnson

1049
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,260
delivered quite the performance

1050
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,160
when challenging some real jerks.

1051
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,600
And I'm down with it.

1052
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,000
I shot a kid.

1053
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1054
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,460
Carl Winslow never shot a kid that I can remember.

1055
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,460
I shot a kid.

1056
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,560
Still the best delivery of any line of movie history.

1057
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,860
Sorry, that has nothing to do with what you've asked.

1058
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,500
It's not the best name, but you know what?

1059
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:47,900
I don't know what.

1060
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,800
There wasn't an end to that sentence.

1061
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,500
It's not the worst ever.

1062
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,660
Does it change anything that they only wanna name her

1063
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,360
Winslow so they can call her Winnie?

1064
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,060
There's so many other shortcuts to that, though.

1065
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,620
I know, that's what I told her.

1066
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,420
They're thinking, why not just go with her Winnie?

1067
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,260
Yeah.

1068
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,100
That's what I said.

1069
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,560
I swear to you, that's what I told her,

1070
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,220
but she said, no, Winslow's prettier.

1071
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,120
I'm gonna go with Winnebago hyphen Billabong.

1072
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,960
Why?

1073
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,120
You super don't.

1074
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,420
Winslow, okay, if Winslow's prettier than Winnie,

1075
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,160
guess what they shouldn't do?

1076
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,120
Name her Winnie?

1077
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,260
Correct.

1078
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,800
Why would they call her Winnie

1079
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,560
if they think Winslow is prettier?

1080
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,400
That's okay, you caught on.

1081
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,960
Also, does it change anything that her husband hates it?

1082
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,800
Then hold on.

1083
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Then wait, that's not a good arrangement, then.

1084
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,100
Yeah, it seems like something's broken down there.

1085
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,860
He's kind of whipped, I don't know if that's okay.

1086
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,700
Okay, okay, you've gone beyond our energies.

1087
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,160
Then you've asked the wrong question.

1088
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,600
The question you wanna ask is,

1089
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,800
how do you get her husband to really step up

1090
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,200
and shut this shit down?

1091
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,360
It's, for under any other circumstances.

1092
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,500
As per usual, Travis, you're right.

1093
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,760
Yeah.

1094
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,460
I hope that helped.

1095
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,300
Did that help?

1096
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,120
All right, cool.

1097
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,600
Okay, who's gonna take Sandra's place?

1098
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,420
Yeah, okay.

1099
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,360
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

1100
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,800
We got a microphone coming down.

1101
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,620
Oh, excellent, thank you.

1102
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,460
Right there, perfect.

1103
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,300
Thank you.

1104
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,120
Thank you.

1105
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Please don't wave your hands like that.

1106
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,400
It's gonna give me a stroke.

1107
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,900
Uh, uh, how about, yeah, you right in front.

1108
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,020
Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:06,960
You should show your shoulders.

1110
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,660
Do you have a question or not?

1111
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,900
Okay, then make your way through.

1112
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,220
You got a long way to go.

1113
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,860
I'm so sorry, you are surrounded by.

1114
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,860
Anybody caught any good Pokemon in here?

1115
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,000
Only drowsy?

1116
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,820
Only fucking drowsy.

1117
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,660
I caught a pretty good drowsy.

1118
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,500
Hey, what's up?

1119
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,320
Hey, guys.

1120
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,160
What's your name?

1121
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,000
Connor.

1122
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,820
Hi, Connor.

1123
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,660
How are you?

1124
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,500
Good.

1125
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,320
Pretty good.

1126
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,160
Still?

1127
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,000
Pay attention, Connor.

1128
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,820
I just said how I was doing.

1129
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,660
All right.

1130
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,120
Two minutes ago.

1131
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,260
So, funny story.

1132
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,120
I just got married yesterday.

1133
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,300
Holy shit.

1134
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,000
Hilarious.

1135
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,460
Hey, hey, Connor.

1136
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,200
Are you on your funny moon?

1137
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,020
Ah.

1138
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,000
Good one.

1139
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,120
How dare you?

1140
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,200
So, my question for you guys is,

1141
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,620
all three of you are very happily married.

1142
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,460
Congratulations.

1143
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,300
Thank you.

1144
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,400
And I wanted to know, did you have, you know,

1145
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,200
any advice for newlyweds?

1146
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Like, when you guys kind of made that transition

1147
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,500
from, you know, partners to actually married couple.

1148
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,260
Like, did anything change?

1149
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,200
No.

1150
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,520
Taxes get pretty cool.

1151
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,360
Shit.

1152
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,860
Here's the thing I'd say.

1153
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,160
This is the best advice I ever got about being married.

1154
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,060
Treat the whole marriage like it's a 60-40 relationship

1155
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,900
and both of you treat it that way.

1156
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,720
And you do 60 and let them do 40.

1157
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,920
Because if you treat it 60-40, both of you,

1158
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,120
you are always trying to take that next step.

1159
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,660
And you're always trying to get that one thing

1160
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,800
to help that person through,

1161
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,420
to let them relax a little bit.

1162
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,720
And if you take it 60-40, and both of you do,

1163
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,420
and really commit to it, you're gonna be married.

1164
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,760
That's 200% then.

1165
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,600
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,160
Listen, if Justin's gonna go to legitimate,

1167
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,360
I'm gonna go legitimate.

1168
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,400
Yeah.

1169
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,520
The answer is, for me, that the difference between

1170
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,360
marriage.

1171
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,200
You've been married longer.

1172
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,020
I've been married longer.

1173
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,860
It's not a big deal.

1174
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,700
I believe it.

1175
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,620
The difference between a marriage and dating

1176
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,260
or anything you've done before now to you now.

1177
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,060
I would say, I wouldn't say marriage.

1178
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,720
Because expanding that widely to like,

1179
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,560
long-term commitment.

1180
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,820
The difference between a long-term commitment

1181
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,320
is that you gotta play it long-term.

1182
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,120
And so right now, if there's something that comes up,

1183
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,920
you need to address it right away.

1184
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,620
Because what you're doing is you're building

1185
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,420
a building over time.

1186
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,360
And so you need to go brick by brick,

1187
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,720
build a strong foundation, and every moment

1188
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,860
is an opportunity to strengthen your relationship.

1189
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,120
Because if you're committed to making it last

1190
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,760
for a long time, you need to make it structurally sound.

1191
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,900
And that only comes from being open and honest

1192
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,920
with each other and saying how you feel in that moment.

1193
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,560
Because anything you hold back, any frustration

1194
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,400
you don't share.

1195
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you have Pokemon Go open

1196
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,160
on your fucking phone right now while you're doing this.

1197
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,160
I do.

1198
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,720
It's not a goof.

1199
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,260
I'm not gonna miss out on some Gastlys.

1200
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,300
Listen, if you need to catch another Drowzee.

1201
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,760
Wait, I'm done, sorry, there's a Pokemon in here.

1202
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,200
Yeah, if you need to catch another Drowzee,

1203
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,260
that's fine, go for it.

1204
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,220
I said that, Griffin, do you have anything to add?

1205
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,120
I said that is going to be funnier or better

1206
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,820
than the things that have already been said.

1207
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,660
Okay, thank you, Connor.

1208
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,500
Thank you, Connor.

1209
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,360
Congratulations, by the way, that's fantastic.

1210
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,200
Hey.

1211
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,160
Okay.

1212
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,460
I'm sorry, there's somebody that's been waving

1213
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,920
their arms so furiously back there.

1214
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,200
Yes, guy with two hands up.

1215
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,960
Yes, come on, guy with two hands.

1216
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,860
You've earned it.

1217
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,200
And he's jogging too, this is awesome.

1218
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,040
Hi.

1219
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,120
Hi, thank y'all, my name is John Paul from Nashville.

1220
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,080
John Paul!

1221
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,100
You were here last night, right?

1222
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,480
So, y'all have inspired me to start my own

1223
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,660
hobby business called HauntedComputers.com.

1224
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,500
Uh-huh.

1225
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,320
Oh, yes.

1226
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
And I have a, well, yes, sir.

1227
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,240
Okay, I'm sorry, I hate to stop you.

1228
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,760
Put your phone away.

1229
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,160
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

1230
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,960
You gotta stop catching Pokemon.

1231
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,800
I'm done, I'm done.

1232
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,620
I may need your, okay.

1233
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,560
Sorry, JP, go ahead.

1234
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,840
Is JP cool, is that?

1235
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,780
JP is great, softball coach.

1236
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,620
How about JP?

1237
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,460
Ah!

1238
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,240
Fucking rules.

1239
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,080
Glorious!

1240
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:15,900
What's up?

1241
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,740
Okay, keep going, I'm sorry.

1242
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,400
I have a lot of friends who've expressed interest

1243
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,280
in helping me with this project.

1244
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,280
How do I evaluate their haunted computer skills?

1245
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,480
How do I know who is gonna help me

1246
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,160
in evaluating haunted computers?

1247
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,920
Are they good at lying?

1248
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Now, hold on.

1249
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,800
Wait, that's true, unless.

1250
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,640
Unless.

1251
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,480
Unless.

1252
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,960
Unless.

1253
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,320
Ghosts are real.

1254
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,200
What if computer, okay, computers can do a lot of things.

1255
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,220
Maybe ghosts?

1256
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,760
I think a computer could do a ghost.

1257
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,800
Yeah, what if you programmed a ghost?

1258
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,640
Can I ask what qualifies as a haunted computer?

1259
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,920
It's just one that has like all the porno viruses in it.

1260
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,840
My practice is that it's a Venn diagram.

1261
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,400
If you believe that you don't understand computers

1262
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,340
and you believe in ghosts,

1263
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,240
then you might have a haunted computer.

1264
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Okay, so if you're 85 years old,

1265
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,720
every computer's haunted.

1266
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,360
So what you're saying is you're setting up

1267
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,840
a very predatory business,

1268
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,060
and you want to figure out which of your friends

1269
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,640
are qualified to do that.

1270
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,000
Yes.

1271
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I assume that you guys might have a more intimate connection

1272
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
with what might make a great cyber paranormal specialist.

1273
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,840
Here's what you need to do.

1274
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
You need to, in your interview with them,

1275
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,960
at the very end,

1276
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,240
reveal that you will not be charging customers

1277
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,720
or paying them,

1278
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,000
and anyone who sticks around is in it for the goof,

1279
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,440
and you keep them.

1280
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,080
Okay, okay.

1281
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,520
Can I tell you something, though?

1282
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,400
I would, depending on the price,

1283
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,660
I would buy the fuck out of a haunted computer

1284
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,860
and try to crack the code of the spirit within.

1285
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,400
Me too, Griffin.

1286
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,060
I would, I mean, I'm literally talking about

1287
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,680
any computer that had Kazaa on it in 1998.

1288
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,400
And it's still downloading.

1289
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,880
Party of five.

1290
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,700
Woo!

1291
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,540
Did that help?

1292
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,380
Tremendously.

1293
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,200
Cool, cool.

1294
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,040
Thank you.

1295
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1296
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,700
I want to keep a balance.

1297
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,280
Can we get a woman,

1298
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,360
or transitional, or non-binary?

1299
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,200
Right there, Stripes.

1300
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,020
Anybody, yes.

1301
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,680
Stripes, Stripes, Stripes, Stripes, come on down.

1302
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,520
You can do it.

1303
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,400
It's a long road, but you got it.

1304
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,200
Okay, take what, actually?

1305
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,140
Stripes, start making your way over.

1306
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,240
You're next.

1307
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,080
And we'll get somebody from over here.

1308
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,320
Oh, you're in the queue.

1309
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,240
Right there with the glasses.

1310
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,060
Glasses.

1311
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,400
Yes, yes, yes.

1312
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,240
Come on down.

1313
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,060
And then Stripes.

1314
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:56,900
And then Stripes.

1315
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,880
Stripes, you got this next.

1316
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,720
Put your coat on.

1317
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,000
I like to reduce people to one description.

1318
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,840
Hello.

1319
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,660
Hi.

1320
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,500
Hi.

1321
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,760
My name is Hani.

1322
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,580
Hi, Hani.

1323
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,420
I'm here to say,

1324
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,480
I love Fruity Pebbles in a major way.

1325
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Oh, ho, ho, I'm hungry, Santa, my Pebbles, your Pebbles,

1326
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,440
it's the season to be sharing, friend.

1327
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,320
Happy Holidays, pal.

1328
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Is that what you meant when you said we're gonna get wild?

1329
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,320
That's so wild, it's weird.

1330
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,320
That was fucking weird.

1331
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,320
Thank you for answering my question.

1332
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Hi, yeah, thank you.

1333
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
You're welcome.

1334
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
No, what's your question?

1335
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
Hey, my question is,

1336
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,320
how did that feel?

1337
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,320
How did that feel?

1338
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,320
How did that feel?

1339
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
How did that feel?

1340
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,320
My question is, how did that fucking Christmas

1341
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,320
Fruity Pebbles jingle go?

1342
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Hi.

1343
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,320
Hi.

1344
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,320
Okay.

1345
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,320
Sorry, what was your name?

1346
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Hani.

1347
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,320
Hani, Jesus.

1348
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,320
Sorry.

1349
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
What's up?

1350
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,320
So, I have an extremely cute dog that lives with my parents.

1351
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
He's our family dog.

1352
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:01,320
And whenever me and my sister go home to visit our parents,

1353
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,320
she hogs the dog.

1354
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,320
She does not let me cuddle with him.

1355
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
She calls him over whenever I'm playing with him.

1356
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,320
She locks her door at night whenever he's sleeping on her bed.

1357
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,320
So, what I want to know is, we are grown ass adults,

1358
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
how do we share the dog?

1359
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Pocket full of bacon.

1360
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Pocket full of bacon.

1361
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:31,320
And put in her pockets, mailman cologne.

1362
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:38,320
Dog catcher perfume.

1363
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Do you have a kosher option?

1364
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:50,320
Wait, you have dogs that keep kosher?

1365
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,320
I don't know anything dogs like other than turds.

1366
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,320
And I don't think you should put dog turds in your pocket.

1367
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,320
That's me.

1368
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
Oh, man.

1369
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,320
I mean, turkey bacon is the obvious answer.

1370
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,320
It's just, is it funny?

1371
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,320
See, that's what we have to worry about up here,

1372
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,320
that you out there, you just shout whatever.

1373
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,320
Okay, you need to show up next time with an identical dog.

1374
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,320
And then swap them around and put them back down

1375
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,320
and tell her she can have one of them.

1376
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,320
That's kind of like the wisdom of Solomon, but double and not.

1377
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
So, you don't have to cut anything in half.

1378
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
That's my baby, that's my baby.

1379
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
Well, here's two babies.

1380
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,320
All right.

1381
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,320
Cool, cool.

1382
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,320
Yeah, Solomon, you're wise as fuck.

1383
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,320
That's way smarter, Solomon, than cutting a stupid baby in half.

1384
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,320
I'm going to cut both babies in half.

1385
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,320
Fuck it, get ten babies in here, I'm cutting them all up.

1386
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
No, Solomon.

1387
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
No, no, no.

1388
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,320
That is decidedly unwise.

1389
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,320
Not against, Solomon.

1390
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
We got babies coming out the ears here.

1391
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
You want a baby, I'll get you a baby.

1392
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,320
That's crazy Solomon's house of babies.

1393
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,320
I'll get you three and a half babies from seven different babies.

1394
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Solomon, no.

1395
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Bad credit, no credit, it doesn't matter.

1396
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
I'm going to get you a...

1397
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,320
We're sending a half a baby home with you.

1398
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,320
Listen, the price is going to grow up and the kids are going to grow up.

1399
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,320
So, you need to get into one of these babies, not in a baby.

1400
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,320
I mean get a baby in, like get a...

1401
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,320
Hey, um...

1402
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
Try my best.

1403
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Do you have to pee?

1404
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
I do.

1405
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Great.

1406
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
Do you...

1407
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
Who loves the dog more?

1408
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,320
That's the real question and I don't want to put you on the spot.

1409
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Who loves the dog more?

1410
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
Yeah.

1411
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
I do.

1412
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,320
Okay.

1413
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,320
If they were here, would they say the same thing though?

1414
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,320
She's not here, so...

1415
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
Oh, that's a good point.

1416
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,320
So, you know what?

1417
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,320
Fuck her.

1418
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
You know what?

1419
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,320
Seriously, if you really care about this dog, the important thing is that that dog is being

1420
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
cared and loved for.

1421
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
That is wrong.

1422
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,320
As a dog owner, the important thing is you get the face licks.

1423
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,320
I'm expecting a dynamic rescue where she closes the door, you kick that shit in, you take

1424
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:03,320
that dog out, and then, I don't know, a smoke bomb or something, you and the dog are never

1425
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
seen again.

1426
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,320
You go live in a Wahaneho.

1427
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,320
A what?

1428
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Is that where they go in Shawshank Redemption?

1429
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,320
Does that answer the question?

1430
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
Perfecto.

1431
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Great.

1432
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Glad we could help Stripes.

1433
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
Stripes, Stripes, Stripes, Stripes.

1434
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
Hi.

1435
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,320
Hi.

1436
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
What's your name?

1437
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
Hi, I'm Tiffany.

1438
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,320
What if you had been like, it is actually Stripes.

1439
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,320
Stripes.

1440
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,320
Stripes.

1441
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
No, that's totally fine.

1442
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Named that for my grandmother.

1443
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,320
Perfect.

1444
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
I feel the heritage.

1445
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,320
So, I was wondering, so two-thirds of you move a lot.

1446
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,320
Yes.

1447
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,320
And I was wondering, how are you guys like cool when you move?

1448
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,320
I've moved eight times in the last eight years.

1449
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,320
True.

1450
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,320
How do you make friends?

1451
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,320
Oh, man.

1452
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
I left.

1453
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,320
You have friends like Griffin.

1454
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
You have a friend named Pop Tart, right?

1455
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,320
That's a horse.

1456
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,320
I met a mini-donk once that was named Pop Tart.

1457
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,320
Dope, for sure.

1458
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,320
I will say this.

1459
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,320
It was fucking legendary.

1460
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,320
It was a legend.

1461
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:10,160
I didn't make friends the first time I moved to beautiful Batavia, Ohio because Travis

1462
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,800
and I were the only living human beings there.

1463
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Sure.

1464
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,960
Everybody else there was like an animatronic mannequin and it turns out it was a real house

1465
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,960
of wax situation.

1466
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,960
Wow.

1467
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,960
Okay.

1468
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
Luckily, we got out of there with our skin still.

1469
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,960
Some of us did.

1470
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,000
So, I think it turned out okay.

1471
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,880
And then in Chicago, basically same situation.

1472
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,920
And then when I moved to Austin, I just had friends there already and built my friend

1473
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,920
group out.

1474
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,080
Having a foundation friend is really important because you can spiral out from that.

1475
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,600
As long as they're like real salt of the earth, cool people.

1476
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,000
What happens if I move from...

1477
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'm from Phoenix and I moved to Portland, Maine.

1478
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,800
There you go.

1479
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,800
You need to take a listen from...

1480
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1481
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,800
Seriously.

1482
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,800
Any Portland, Maine people out here?

1483
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,800
Raise your hand.

1484
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Up there.

1485
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
There you go.

1486
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
Okay.

1487
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,800
There's like 30 people like...

1488
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
Okay.

1489
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
Okay.

1490
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,080
Tonight, tweet with the bim bam Portland, Maine hashtag and we're going to get everybody

1491
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,080
connected.

1492
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,080
It's going to be good.

1493
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
That's a good...

1494
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,080
That's legit.

1495
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,080
Hey, listen.

1496
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:17,080
It is really... it's genuinely very, very hard and it seems like hopeless when you don't

1497
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,080
have any friends.

1498
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,440
Literally, all it takes is that first step, that first friend, that first place of like

1499
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,120
putting yourself out there and like meeting a person who's also like in our day and age,

1500
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,880
like everybody's moving around all the time and doesn't have like a lot of friends and

1501
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,880
so everybody's kind...

1502
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,240
There are lots of people in your position that are also looking for people like you

1503
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,160
to be friends with and start a friend group.

1504
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,160
I got one.

1505
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,160
I brought her.

1506
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
Okay.

1507
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
So...

1508
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,160
Hi.

1509
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,160
Yeah.

1510
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
What's her name?

1511
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,160
Yeah.

1512
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,160
Her name's Swathi.

1513
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,160
Hey, Swathi.

1514
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
What's up?

1515
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,160
You should also take a lesson...

1516
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Hi.

1517
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,640
You should also take a lesson from five-year-olds, which is if you ever see five-year-olds make

1518
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,160
friends, they make friends like this.

1519
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,720
I want to be your friend now.

1520
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,720
Yeah.

1521
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,720
Yeah.

1522
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,400
Because I think as you get older as an adult, you get very self-conscious telling people

1523
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,800
you want to be their friends, but if you have a good conversation with someone at a thing,

1524
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
tell them you want to be friends.

1525
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,560
I wish the hell somebody would say that to me.

1526
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,560
You know, I don't move.

1527
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,560
I only got one friend.

1528
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,560
It's my dear friend Dwight Slab.

1529
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,560
He co-hosts the things I bought at Sheetz.

1530
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,600
That's it.

1531
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,440
I have other friends, but he's the only one I do a hit web series with, so...

1532
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,120
It's cool, though, because it's a pretty dope web series.

1533
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,360
It's a good web series.

1534
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,960
I'll also say one last thing.

1535
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,880
Download the application Pokemon Go on your cell phone, because I was at Starbucks the

1536
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,160
other day and I was just having my breakfast sandwich and I was just catching my Nidorans

1537
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,200
and this dude walked up and he was just like, hey, you doing any good gym battles lately?

1538
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,000
And I was like, yeah, and then I nervously looked back down at my computer.

1539
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,480
So as long as you don't get a Griffin, you're going to be fine.

1540
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,480
You're going to be great.

1541
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,720
That's actually how we're friends.

1542
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,160
You are the best Pokemon Goer that there is.

1543
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,160
She's putting you on blast.

1544
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,160
What's up, Stripes?

1545
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,160
What do you got?

1546
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Does that help at all?

1547
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,160
Yeah.

1548
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,160
No, that totally...

1549
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,160
Hell yeah.

1550
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
Let's do one more.

1551
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,160
One more?

1552
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,920
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1553
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,120
We have somebody pointing to somebody else who's pointing at themselves, yeah, in the

1554
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,120
back right corner there.

1555
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Yeah, you.

1556
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
Yeah, you.

1557
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
You jumping up and down.

1558
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
Yes.

1559
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Yeah, you won.

1560
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Come on down.

1561
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,120
Somebody's just screaming like, no, no.

1562
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,120
I'm sorry.

1563
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Hi.

1564
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
Hello.

1565
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,120
Hi.

1566
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
What's your name?

1567
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,560
Britney, but I'm also known as Slick Tracy.

1568
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:38,000
I play for Boston Roller Derby and we just won our game, so yeah.

1569
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah.

1570
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,800
Who'd you beat, who'd you beat?

1571
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
We beat the Harbor Horrors.

1572
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
Okay.

1573
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Okay.

1574
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,800
There's actually no way for us to respond to that.

1575
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,800
We're the Wicked Pissas.

1576
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Yeah.

1577
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,800
Very good.

1578
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,800
What is your question?

1579
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
It's not how do I roller derby good, because that's not...

1580
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,800
It's not.

1581
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
No, it's not.

1582
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
Okay, good.

1583
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,800
I'm actually curious since you're all married.

1584
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
I got engaged a few months ago.

1585
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Congratulations.

1586
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
Thank you.

1587
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,800
Big fans.

1588
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,240
I'm just curious if you have any advice for wedding planning, because it's a daunting

1589
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,240
task.

1590
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,240
Don't do it.

1591
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,240
Don't do it.

1592
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,240
Yeah, don't do it.

1593
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,520
Just fucking show up.

1594
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,520
That's 90% of wedding planning is just showing up.

1595
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,120
Make it like a puzzle room, an escape room.

1596
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,760
Have someone else plan it and you got to figure out what's going on.

1597
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:33,160
Or make the wedding like an escape puzzle room.

1598
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:40,200
Everybody shut up and let me figure out how that would work.

1599
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,320
You would need 100 rooms.

1600
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,320
That sounds expensive.

1601
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Yeah.

1602
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,320
Let us finish.

1603
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,320
It will be expensive.

1604
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:55,080
You will also need to employ 100 discrete puzzle masters.

1605
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:01,960
And I mean discrete in both senses of the word discrete.

1606
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:08,280
If you and your betrothed are not the first two people to escape-

1607
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,280
It was not meant to be.

1608
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:18,640
Then the first two people to escape have to get married, high stakes.

1609
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,640
High stakes.

1610
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,000
You got to make it the first couple has to get married, second couple has to get a little

1611
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
married.

1612
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,760
The first couple has to get barely married.

1613
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,760
That's it.

1614
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,760
Fuck.

1615
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,760
I had it in my grasp.

1616
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,480
Let me ask you a question.

1617
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,680
Think in your sphere of people you know and love and trust.

1618
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,760
Is there one person that presumably it's not any of them.

1619
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,760
They're here.

1620
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,760
Okay, cool.

1621
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,760
Hey.

1622
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,640
Think of the whole sphere of people you know and love and trust.

1623
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:49,000
Is there one amongst them who would like really, really get into planning a wedding?

1624
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Me.

1625
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah.

1626
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Okay.

1627
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But like we were trying to offload.

1628
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Oh.

1629
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
My mom but she lives in Seattle.

1630
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Period.

1631
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I don't want to hear any more.

1632
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Chosen person.

1633
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Chosen person.

1634
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,880
It just became your mom's problem and then do what I do, show up to your wedding and

1635
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,080
be like this is beautiful.

1636
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,480
Everybody did a great job.

1637
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,480
I didn't help.

1638
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,480
No.

1639
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,480
You did a bad job.

1640
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,880
You also want to make sure like balance however you want to do that.

1641
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,800
If you feel like you want to take control of it a little bit more, make sure you tell

1642
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,640
your betrothed that so that they know where they stand.

1643
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,640
Why do we keep saying the betrothed over and over again?

1644
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,640
You said it first.

1645
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,640
Hey, listen.

1646
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,640
I will tell you one practical tip.

1647
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,240
If you're going to hire a DJ, make sure you pick the playlist before you get it.

1648
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,240
Oh, my God.

1649
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,240
100%.

1650
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,240
Fuck yes.

1651
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,240
I know.

1652
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,240
Let them go hog on it.

1653
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,440
I had the wedding DJ at my wedding attempt to close the wedding.

1654
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:43,880
With first Frank Sinatra's Love and Marriage.

1655
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,200
You know, the theme song to Married with Children.

1656
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:54,360
And then he tried to, I shit you not, tried to wrap the whole shindig up with Garth Brooks'

1657
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,360
The Dance.

1658
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,360
Holy shit.

1659
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,360
I just put a nice bow on it.

1660
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,360
Did you apologize to Sydney?

1661
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,760
Yeah, but it was just the two of us there at that point, so it was fine.

1662
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,960
Because everyone left at Love and Marriage.

1663
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Right.

1664
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,880
I went to a wedding once where somebody played an Elvis Presley medley.

1665
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,360
No, dawg.

1666
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,040
Nobody wants this.

1667
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,480
If you're playing a medley of any sort, here's something y'all are going to dance to, nine

1668
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,720
different songs in three minutes.

1669
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,240
No, wrong.

1670
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,640
Incorrect.

1671
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,800
False.

1672
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,560
Uh, yeah.

1673
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,920
But if they will do, play Soul Man and do a Blues Brothers thing, that's always a big

1674
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,920
deal.

1675
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,640
I used to have to do that at the Pub Family Fun Center.

1676
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,640
It was great.

1677
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,640
It was good.

1678
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,640
How did we do?

1679
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,640
How did we do?

1680
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,640
Great.

1681
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,640
You're invited.

1682
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,640
Yay!

1683
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:57,000
I think that's going to do it for us.

1684
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,920
Thank you all so much, Boston.

1685
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
You've been so good.

1686
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,920
It's been so cool.

1687
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,560
Can we kill the house lights?

1688
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,320
I don't want to look at them while I thank them for their kindness.

1689
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,160
Dismiss them.

1690
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,680
So like we mentioned, there's going to be posters after the show, but it's very limited

1691
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,680
so we don't even know if there's any left.

1692
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,680
Maybe.

1693
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,680
I don't know if they sold out of them.

1694
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,680
Yeah.

1695
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,680
We fucked up the poster situation last night.

1696
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,680
Did not print enough.

1697
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,680
Who was here last night for Adventure Zone?

1698
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,840
Okay, so fucking everybody then.

1699
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,240
We would ask just to throw it out there.

1700
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,560
If you bought a poster last night, leave some for the rest of the people.

1701
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,960
Unless as you're leaving, there are some.

1702
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,960
We don't want to take it.

1703
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,960
Okay.

1704
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,960
I have a flow chart.

1705
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:40,280
We sold, we signed all the posters backstage before we put them out there and we were talking

1706
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:45,440
backstage and cannot imagine a sadder situation than us walking back to our hotel carrying

1707
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,520
a bunch of signed posters that nobody bought.

1708
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
So please buy them.

1709
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Please buy them.

1710
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,720
Don't make us face that reality.

1711
01:08:53,720 --> 01:09:01,760
On a sincere note, we will not be doing a live show for a while and I have to say sincerely,

1712
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:07,680
the two crowds at the Wilbur Theater here in Boston have been the loudest and best ever.

1713
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,680
Seriously, the fucking best.

1714
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:17,160
I promise, I'll say this right now, hand to God, we will come back to Boston in this exact

1715
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,200
theater because this has been the best ever.

1716
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:27,880
That's what I will also say, it's just the people here at the Wilbur have also been just

1717
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,880
amazing to work with.

1718
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,880
Amazing.

1719
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,880
Thank you so much to Kelsey.

1720
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,440
She's our tour manager for these two shows and has been so amazingly helpful.

1721
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,440
So thank you, Kelsey.

1722
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,440
You're the best.

1723
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,440
Thank you to Rachel, my wife, and Teresa.

1724
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,640
Oh, and my own wife, thank you very much.

1725
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,640
Thank you, Teresa.

1726
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,640
Thank you to Sawbones.

1727
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,640
Thank you to Sawbones.

1728
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,640
This is featuring Sidney McElroy.

1729
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,880
Thank you to Riley and Clint for the intros for the evening.

1730
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,200
Thank you to Riley, Smurl, and Clint McElroy, another big hand for them.

1731
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Thank you to Billions.

1732
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,560
Billions booked these two shows for us.

1733
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,800
We would not be here without them.

1734
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Thank you to Sean Roderick and the Long Winter Shoes for their song.

1735
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:04,120
Thanks to all the singers that's been part of it today.

1736
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
And mostly, thank you.

1737
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,120
Yeah, thank you all.

1738
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,120
Thank you, mostly, at all.

1739
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,700
Now listen, if you never listen to my brother more than me, you may not know, but every

1740
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:14,540
episode Griffin leaves us with a single Yahoo Answer that we think about, talk about, and

1741
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,900
then come back the next week and discuss.

1742
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,440
And Griffin, what is it going to be this week?

1743
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,920
This one was sent in by Dana Scarborough.

1744
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,920
Thank you, Dana.

Nope.

1748
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1749
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,120
