1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,920
Welcome to my brother, my brother made an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,000
You can smell it in the air. Crisp, inviting, warm scent of the pumpkin spice latte.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,880
It's back and we're celebrating. I just had my first one of of this of 2011.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,960
Yeah, I still have. I finished it moments ago, mere moments ago. I went with the PSL with no

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,160
whip on top, went skim milk in it. I love the idea of I love seasonal flavors,

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,240
like the idea of like peppermint, everything in winter. But if it were like summer and someone's

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,160
like, do you want some peppermint coffee? I'm like, no, fuck you. Fuck that. And fuck you

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,120
for that idea of pumpkin muffin. What month is it? It's June. Get out of here. Get out right out

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,040
of this town that we people who say they should have the pumpkin spice latte every year.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,120
Why don't you start your day off with some birthday cake asshole birthday cake?

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,800
How about it? How about a Thanksgiving, a plump Thanksgiving turkey on your birthday,

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
which isn't on which is not on Thanksgiving nor a birthday turkey?

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,920
Asshole. I cannot have the pumpkin spice latte anymore. I'm trying to watch my carbs. Oh,

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,480
Justin. I know. I don't want to think about my tree. No, it doesn't have carbs. If it's delicious,

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,160
I have a terminal disease. I might treat myself to one. I'm really more of an eggnog latte man

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,920
myself. Hey, listen, I didn't come here for your judgment. I came to give it. It's not winter yet.

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,360
You keep your eggnog latte to yourself where it belongs. I'll keep my eggnog latte in my tummy.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
Do you know what? I'm a little disappointed. I'm a little disappointed in the fact that the

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:29,120
PSL lacks any rejuvenative properties. I spent all day yesterday just drinking whiskey and eating

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:37,440
Tex-Mex basically from sunup to sundown. Alone in your apartment. Just alone. And I was really

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,160
hoping that a morning time PSL would bring me out of my stupor, but it has actually redoubled.

26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
My sorrows. I am actually on a pumpkin spice latte with like some ginkgo and like some beta

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,440
carotene and some David Carradine. No, I just want to say and then not. Hey, Tommy, not doing so good.

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,800
How about some cream? How about some sweet pumpkin cream? Yeah, I just I want to be able to drink it

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,080
and then not ship my guts out later. That ship has sailed. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy.

31
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm really, guys, burning the candle, burning the candle at both ends over here. I'm holding it

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,640
together with scotch tape and floss. This is, of course, an advice show for the modern era. We take

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,000
your questions and unsolicited questions from the Yahoo answer service and turn them into wisdom,

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,600
like alchemy or like pumpkin spice lattes. Boy, one of those would go down good. I wish I wasn't

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,680
so fat. Here's your first question. I'm a lady who has got her sexy right. No pumpkin spice latte

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,240
is there. However, I feel weird approaching guys I'm interested in, afraid I'll appear too forward

37
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,760
and scare them off. My friend, a male, says that this is not the case, that men would love to get

38
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,200
proposition. Bad word choice. Bad word choice. I feel this is a myth and that most guys would get

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,000
and that most guys would get freaked out. Is my friend right or crazy? Mystified in Michigan.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You make me so... First of all, propositioning someone is what a prostitute does. Yeah. Hey,

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,440
sailor. Hey, sailor. Did you see what I'm working with? Coming to this port often? Hey, uh, hey,

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,120
ladies and gentlemen, if you're wondering why there is a battle of the sexes, why the sexes

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
can't seem to agree on anything, this is how fundamentally they misunderstand each other.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,560
Make me so angry. A base level, like this is what we're building from. Do you know what I think it

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,400
is? I think it's that everyone speaks in generalities. Like the guy said, all guys would

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
love this. And the girl said, all guys would be afraid of this. I think that there are definitely

47
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,480
guys that would be very intimidated by a girl walking up to them and hitting on them. I also

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,000
think that there will be guys that will be flattered and totally into it. And then I think

49
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,400
there'll be guys who wouldn't fucking care. The guys, but Travis, like the guys who would be

50
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,040
intimidated by it are also have like a genetic predisposition to propagate the species. Yeah.

51
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,800
And like, they're not going to like, huh, shriveling, shrinking violet. They're going to be...

52
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,640
If you're walking up to them and like grabbing them by the nuts and just saying like,

53
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,520
give me these. Yeah. This is my seed. Yeah. I've never, I don't think any dude has ever looked

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,040
across the bar at a pretty girl and said, man, I hope she doesn't come talk to me.

55
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
It's always, I hope she stays at least 20 feet away. Yeah. It's always, how can I trap her?

56
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,920
I need to make a, like a nest of leaves and sticks with a big pit underneath. You need to

57
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:46,560
make a bamboo tiger pit and catch that broad. Like, yeah. Like eat. I don't know the mind of

58
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,360
the woman as my wife is keen to remind me, but I do know that in a man's mind, if an attractive lady

59
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,200
were to come up and talk to you, you may have to turn her down because you're otherwise occupied.

60
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,520
I mean, like with another, with another lady first. I'm playing snake on my phone. I'm sorry.

61
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,160
You can wait. You should see how long this snake is. I've got to quickens right now.

62
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,560
I just want to check. Doing some quickening. I have to quickens. Yeah. Like you have to turn

63
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,120
down, but nobody's going to be like, leave. Yeah. I think also, I think that there's a certain amount

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,120
of when a girl has approached a guy in the past and the guy has like not been interested, what

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,920
she's told herself is that that guy was intimidated by her. And that's how that rumor got starting.

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,160
I think that it is just as likely that the guy just wasn't feeling her vibe.

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,320
See, that's such a shame because I think it, I don't claim, I also don't claim to know the mind

68
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,560
of a woman, but I think that if you're a super attractive lady and you go up to a dude who is

69
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,200
clearly less attractive than you are at a bar and you proposition him and he turns you down,

70
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,800
you never recover from that. You, you, you ain't never coming back from that. I'm sorry. Like,

71
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,120
can we take a step back here? Why is prop, why is like every romantic encounter that this girl has

72
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,960
like Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal? Why there be a proposition like, excuse me.

73
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,320
There is $10,000 in my hotel room upstairs. You have to find it. Associate Reginald has

74
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,080
a briefcase with $100,000. I am propositioning you.

75
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,920
What accent is that?

76
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,200
What? Half comic, the guy half, uh, Hitchcock.

77
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,240
Okay.

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,800
It was really, really scary.

79
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,200
Maybe that's why the guy is intimidated.

80
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,200
Hello.

81
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,880
Unmarked, much like myself. No needle of tattoo has touched my skin. I am ready

82
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,600
to make love to you. Ah, Jesus.

83
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
I am so upset.

84
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,600
Reginald, open the briefcase.

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,840
You will see the bills are in Ugandan currency. They are untraceable.

86
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Oh, $100,000 in gold Cougarands.

87
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:19,040
This is gold bullion. My associate Reginald will take this gold bullion to a deposit box

88
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,800
of your celebrity. At that point, a brief fleeting lovemaking will commence.

89
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,320
Oh, Jesus. Now I'm just thinking about-

90
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,360
Where are you going?

91
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm thinking about being at a bar and then like-

92
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,840
Excuse me.

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,520
The Lord of House Harkonnen from Dune, like floating over.

94
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,680
Good evening. The spice is life.

95
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,360
I have a briefcase of spice.

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
Oh, Jesus.

97
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
Derek, actually, at the end there, there was some Borat thrown in.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,880
People seem to like that.

99
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
That crazy Borat cat.

100
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,400
Yeah, like don't proposition. Maybe just strike up a conversation, see if you have some chemistry.

101
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
Try that out, maybe.

102
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
Hey, I'm getting married to the love of my life next year.

103
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,000
Thing is, I'm a freelance writer who doesn't make a lot of money,

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,480
so all the cash we're saving now is going towards making the wedding awesome.

105
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
Making sure we don't have to live out of a dumpstrap afterwards.

106
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
Because of this, our budget for our honeymoon is pretty low.

107
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,680
Where are some good places my future wife and I can go and enjoy our new married life

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
without spending a lot of dough?

109
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
We live in the Dallas, Texas area, if that helps.

110
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
Britain in Burrokesville.

111
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
I actually have a pretty good suggestion for the-

112
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,840
A couple of my friends got married a year or two ago,

113
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,160
and before they went on their real honeymoon because they were very busy with work and

114
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,080
everything, they did this thing that I really liked and they stayed in Cincinnati,

115
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,040
but in a hotel and acted as though they were tourists in their hometown.

116
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,600
So they went and did stuff that they never do.

117
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,080
They went to restaurants and to like theaters that they never go to and like stayed in a hotel.

118
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,440
So they did a honeymoon, but in the town that they lived in.

119
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,200
They didn't have to travel, no like expenses to like get overseas or anything like that.

120
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
So you might try that out.

121
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,520
A stunning moon?

122
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,120
Is that the-

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,720
Okay, yeah.

124
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,760
A stunning moon, maybe.

125
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Okay, yes.

126
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Maybe you guys just don't even get a hotel.

127
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,520
Maybe you just like sleep in a different room in your own house and just like take care-

128
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,640
She like set up a tent.

129
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,040
Just like take care of each other.

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,100
Oh.

131
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,760
Oh, you mean-

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,200
Oh, yeah.

133
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,920
Oh, boy.

134
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,400
Oh.

135
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,040
Oh, golly.

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,840
Oh, yikes.

137
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,080
What my wife and I did is we actually-

138
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,000
We had already been living together when we got married.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,920
So we had most of our like household appliance type things.

140
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
What we did was we had people-

141
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,640
We used this site called-

142
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,120
I think it's thebigday.com maybe, but it lets people give you money for a trip,

143
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,520
but they're buying you things for your wedding.

144
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,040
So like we had a $50 denomination and that was dinner at a restaurant.

145
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,640
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.

146
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,120
Didn't you also put on there at one point dancing lessons with Antonio Banderas?

147
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
That was one of the options.

148
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,720
And I actually had someone come to me afterwards and say,

149
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,200
so how are those dancing lessons?

150
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,800
And I had to break the news to them that I'm sorry, I did not actually have that.

151
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,960
You just gave me some money that I probably spent on-

152
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,360
Because Antonio Banderas isn't real.

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,440
He's not real.

154
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,160
He's not real.

155
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
He's a computer generated meme.

156
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,720
It's got spread around the web.

157
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
So I joked the one a little too far.

158
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,680
He went viral and he went Zorro and then he went Zeta, Zeta Jones.

159
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,400
What a talent she is.

160
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
Also computer generated.

161
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
I don't want to pat it on the back too much,

162
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,360
but we had like two or three legitimate answers to this question.

163
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
I feel pretty good about it.

164
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,440
Yeah.

165
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
Let me take your temperature, Griffin.

166
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
How do you feel?

167
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,800
I don't know.

168
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
I feel like there's some stuff.

169
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,720
I feel like the Texas aspect.

170
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,080
I feel like we could explore that.

171
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,320
Well, maybe you could address, of the three of us,

172
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
I think the best one to address that would be Travis.

173
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,040
Yeah.

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
Travis, what's going on in Texas these days?

175
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm glad you asked.

176
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,520
From what I understand, there's just oil being struck everywhere.

177
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,840
Okay.

178
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,640
And so maybe you could have like an oil-themed honeymoon.

179
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,080
So you're saying that to celebrate their newfound eternal love,

180
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,960
they indulge in some tycoon-ship?

181
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,720
Yeah.

182
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,360
Big hats, big buckles, a bolo tie.

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
Big shiny white teeth.

185
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,800
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
And like a walrus style mustache.

187
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,640
Don't make your wife grow a mustache.

188
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,440
Yeah, don't make your wife grow a mustache.

189
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,480
Let me ask you this, Justin.

190
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,080
As the only one of the three of us that is married, as far as I know,

191
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
what, in your opinion, is the actual point of the honeymoon?

192
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Is it just like a celebration of, hey, we're married now?

193
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Let's have two weeks of awesome party?

194
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,880
I'm glad you asked, Travis.

195
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,400
The point of the honeymoon used to be that you could finally do it.

196
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,200
Yeah.

197
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,120
So you'd want to do it all the time.

198
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,840
Maybe you remember that hit episode of Wings when Joe and Helen got married.

199
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,600
I guess they had never done it before because they really hung out in their hotel room.

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,520
He must be a stronger man than I, because how can you resist Helen?

201
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah, that's a good question.

202
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
She starts playing that cello and it's like, don't mind if I do.

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
Don't mind if I do forever.

204
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
These days, people tend to live together.

205
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,400
They tend to have a little bit of that stuff beforehand.

206
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,560
So I don't think that it serves the same traditional role.

207
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,760
I think for my wife and I, we went out of the country.

208
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:11,280
It was a really nice opportunity to sort of get used to the idea of being married

209
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,320
and kind of get away from everybody and have our first week and a half

210
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
as a married couple, sort of figuring that out ourselves.

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
So it's like marriage spring training.

212
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
It's marriage bootcamp.

213
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,640
Exactly right.

214
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,140
Okay.

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,200
And you just explore each other's bodies.

216
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,640
So I guess what you're saying is real advice here.

217
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,520
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do as long as you're together.

218
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,600
Just explore each other's bodies.

219
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Just every nook and cranny.

220
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,840
Honeymoon in each other's bodies.

221
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,760
Every crag, every cranny.

222
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
All right.

223
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,400
Set up a hotel room in each other's bodies and just stay there for a while.

224
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
It's really good to know it.

225
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,720
More than 10 milliliters of pumpkin spice latte.

226
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
I need you to explore it.

227
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,680
Yeah, just kind of whatever you do,

228
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
make sure that you cut yourselves off from everybody for a little while.

229
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,560
Just really treat yourself.

230
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
Six or seven months tops.

231
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,880
You don't feel like that sets up the bar a little high though.

232
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,520
Like I feel like I feel like fresh off the wedding block.

233
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,960
I feel that you should maybe have like a shitty honeymoon

234
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
and then have it get better from there.

235
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,600
Do you know what I mean?

236
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Like you came back from Europe.

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,600
You were probably expecting every day to be a sweet Irish adventure,

238
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,640
but it wasn't, was it?

239
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,600
That's true.

240
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
It wasn't a sweet Irish adventure every day.

241
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,400
Marriage isn't a sweet Irish adventure every day.

242
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,200
You got to come to grips with that fact.

243
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,880
I feel like maybe for your honeymoon,

244
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,920
you should just have this really acrimonious sort of rapport with your new wife.

245
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,600
I think maybe you should go do something unpleasant like help a friend move.

246
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,880
Like maybe that's your honeymoon.

247
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,080
And then it only gets better from there.

248
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,640
That's true.

249
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,200
Help your friend move whether they were planning to or not.

250
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,400
Secretly help your friend move and then face the

251
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,320
breaking and nearing charges together as a couple.

252
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,820
Yeah.

253
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,320
You know what?

254
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,800
You know where no one ever goes on their honeymoon?

255
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,520
Prison.

256
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:05,760
Yeah.

257
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,840
I beg to-

258
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,600
I am adjacent to Logan County.

259
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
I'm pretty sure some people have gone to prison for their honeymoon, sir.

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,080
How about a Yahoo?

261
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Yes.

262
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,680
Okay.

263
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,360
Um, this one was sent in by FaceStyle.

264
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,400
Thank you, FaceStyle.

265
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, NerdyGameGirlDoll.

266
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:27,840
Okay.

267
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,680
Who asks?

268
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,560
She's trying her best.

269
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,960
Is it a little extraordinary that I accidentally speak in an English accent?

270
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,520
Every once in a while, I slip into an English accent,

271
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,160
even though I was born and raised in Colorado.

272
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't count to ten with no waiting times without doing it.

273
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,240
I've never known anyone from out of the country except for Russians and Canadians,

274
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,560
and I don't notice when it happens until my friends start to talk in their English accents,

275
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,680
which frankly are horrid sounding most of the time,

276
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,080
and then I'm not too sure what to do.

277
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,680
So, could anyone tell me if it's a little extraordinary or odd?

278
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,200
Does anyone else do this?

279
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,280
Does anyone have any idea why I might do this?

280
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,080
Thanks for your help.

281
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,520
I have an idea.

282
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
I am trapped in a douche ice age.

283
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,000
You have...

284
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,280
You have douche blood in your veins.

285
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,320
Yeah.

286
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,640
Is your grandmother half douche?

287
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
Because that would make you, I think, a quarter douche, right?

288
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,400
I am 1 16th douche, and that's why I speak with an English accent sometimes.

289
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,000
You know that sometimes they say when they're telling you about,

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,040
you know, talking to you about writing literature,

291
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,120
that you should use efficient language that communicates the most amount about a person,

292
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,520
you know, without saying, showing rather than telling.

293
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,400
Feeling, doing.

294
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,720
That first sentence of this question tells you everything

295
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
you could ever need to know about this person.

296
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,680
That seems like the type of name badge they should wear

297
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
if you were meeting them for the first time.

298
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
You just look down and be like, oh, okay,

299
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
and then walk away from them and never acknowledge their existence again.

300
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
Does this make me special?

301
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
Am I a special snowflake because, oh, blimey, gov.

302
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Oh, god.

303
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,520
I guess it makes you special in the way that I hate you more than anyone else.

304
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
Oh, my god.

305
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,400
Can you imagine trying to talk to this person in real life?

306
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,280
They're like, yeah, I think we should go to Hot Topic and then, oh, gov, that's it, no.

307
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Why does this keep happening to me?

308
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,320
Apples and pears.

309
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,280
Every time I try to have a conversation with you,

310
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
with you, it comes out.

311
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,880
I don't know what-

312
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,120
If you know this person, if you in your life are acquainted with this person,

313
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,240
do me a favor and start to slowly convince them that not only is it not normal,

314
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,040
that it is cause for concern when that happens.

315
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,280
Yeah.

316
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
It's like a really shitty version of the movie phenomenon.

317
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, convince them that they need to go talk to somebody professional about this

318
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,920
and start to get really worried about them

319
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,000
and maybe cease to hang out with them for a while.

320
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
I have a confession to make, Daniel.

321
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,760
You and I have been in a relationship for three years now.

322
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
I have a condition.

323
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,440
I haven't had an episode in over 12 months,

324
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,920
but I do have a condition where I occasionally speak in an English accent.

325
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,040
Is that extraordinary?

326
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,120
I'm taking medication.

327
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:39,760
I've been on a pretty intense therapy regimen for a while now, but it could strike at any time.

328
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Is this extraordinary?

329
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,560
Do you know what medication this person should go on?

330
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,760
What?

331
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,320
Poison.

332
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,720
Nah, she's trying her best.

333
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,160
It's just like-

334
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,680
She'll look back at this and laugh when-

335
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
It's bad enough.

336
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,240
What's worse?

337
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,680
This person who is probably a 12 year old who is trying to find her place in the world-

338
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,880
I was going to say 12.

339
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Or the person who goes to London with their rich parents on a summer break

340
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,760
and then comes back and then exclusively talks with a British accent, which is worse.

341
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,040
Which one's worse?

342
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Yeah.

343
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
Oh, God.

344
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,960
It's like so tiny a difference.

345
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
Both are so terrible.

346
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,280
I think that this person is worse because they're asking if it's extraordinary.

347
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,520
Yeah.

348
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,800
Okay, there it is.

349
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,440
They recognize they're doing it and they're still doing it.

350
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,240
But they recognize that they're doing it, but they claim to have no control over it.

351
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,520
I just slip into it.

352
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,400
What's going on?

353
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Am I possessed?

354
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,080
Can we do the rest of this episode of our comp pod?

355
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
Can we do it with accents and then this will be the accent episode?

356
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,440
Would that be extraordinary?

357
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
We're a little too deep already.

358
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,880
Well, I can only do French-Canadian trapper, like a French-Canadian,

359
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,840
and I can only say the sentence, I am a French-Canadian trapper,

360
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,920
and that's the only thing I can say.

361
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,480
Well, that'll be the only thing you say for the rest of the podcast.

362
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,320
Justin broke out his Baron Harkonnen-

363
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,080
Can it be the last thing he says?

364
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,320
Yes.

365
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,920
That would be ideal.

366
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,000
Justin can bust out his Baron Harkonnen.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,640
I will do that drunk beetle accent that I was doing a few minutes ago,

368
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,840
and then Travis just says that one.

369
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,800
That was a good one.

370
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,360
Yeah.

371
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,200
Travis just says that one thing over and over again.

372
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,200
So before we take a trip, I would like to throw out-

373
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Justin made the mistake of giving me time between the time when we were going to record the episode

374
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,360
and the time when we actually did, so I played a game with our listeners

375
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,720
and asked them for words that they would like to hear on the show.

376
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,120
You made a mad list.

377
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,000
And I arranged those words into a short story that I would like Griffin to read now.

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,080
Okay, so what I'm looking at is a mad lib that-

379
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,280
It's a mad lib.

380
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,960
Like, let's not split hairs.

381
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,400
Yes.

382
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,560
Sometimes we make bits on the show because I think they'll be funny,

383
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,760
and then sometimes we make bits on the show to antagonize each other.

384
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,560
For instance, monthly observances, I hate that bit.

385
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,080
I think Travis kind of does too.

386
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,920
Griffin inflicts it on us every fucking month.

387
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,880
This was actually Justin's punishment for not being ready to record the call when he was supposed to.

388
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,040
So now he has to hear this mad lib.

389
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,560
I had something really important come up.

390
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
What was it?

391
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
It was a cliffhanger.

392
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
What? Excuse me?

393
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
It was a cliffhanger.

394
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,480
Could just not watch the second half.

395
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
Of what show, Justin?

396
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,900
Forget.

397
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
Was it Toddlers and Tiaras?

398
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,340
Yeah.

399
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:54,180
Inwood lost her foot in a logging accident and she didn't actually be able to perform.

400
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,700
This is the epic and moist fable of Bumsie Clumhole and the marshmallow debacle.

401
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,820
Why am I doing this?

402
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,100
Read away.

403
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,580
Don't stop now.

404
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,580
Travis, this is making me hate you and our listeners who sent this shit in.

405
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,540
I knew it.

406
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,260
One fine and scrumptious day Bumsie was hanging out with his funkalicious friend Batman.

407
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,180
They were runny late for the big race.

408
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,980
The thick freakness.

409
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,740
They've been watching the clock when suddenly everything got all timey wimey wibbly wobbly.

410
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,940
There's a Doctor Who thing.

411
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,100
So they leapt onto their Pegasus, Celestia Sprinkles, and sprang into action,

412
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
only stopping to get a fish taco on the way.

413
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,100
Slow down, yelled Batman.

414
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,780
This is chafing my turgid front butt and giving me lavish thoughts.

415
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,260
Oh hogwash, yelled Bumsie.

416
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,220
Stop being persnickety.

417
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,020
This is funkalicious.

418
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
Incredible, sighed Batman.

419
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,740
But sadly the whole thing was a boondoggle.

420
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,540
Bumsie died and Batman was left as the only living boy in New York.

421
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,820
That was the end of it and we will never do that to you again.

422
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,860
And I promise you that.

423
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,460
I wrote a book in second grade called Grant Andrews Kid Cop

424
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,060
that reads better than that thing that you made.

425
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,180
Why did you do that to him?

426
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,740
Why is it that you were trying to punish me, but Griffin ends up catching the brunt of it?

427
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,700
Because it was humiliating.

428
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,540
I said words in there that I would never say.

429
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,500
Funkalicious?

430
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,300
You realize that every word I say is like a precious treasure, right?

431
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,140
And you just tarnished my streak.

432
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,260
Precious treasures.

433
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,060
There's only one way I can watch this day, so I'm going to have to do it.

434
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,060
I'm 30 though.

435
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
I think old people jokes are funny.

436
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,380
Let's go to the money zone.

437
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,740
Let's go to the suicide zone.

438
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,460
And then the money zone.

439
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,300
Hey, Katie.

440
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,860
Happy birthday, lady.

441
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,220
Thank you for being you.

442
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,580
Thank you.

443
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,260
Your boyfriend, Charlie, you introduced to a lot of great stuff like My Brother, My Brother,

444
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,740
Me and The Vice Shelf of the Modern Era and Katamari Damacy.

445
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,220
And now he's returning the favor by saying, hey, happy birthday.

446
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,380
You know, there's so much of a connection between those two things, don't you guys think?

447
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,780
Between My Brother, My Brother, Me and Katamari Damacy?

448
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:29,220
Yeah, because in Katamari Damacy, you roll a ball and you pick up things to make the ball bigger.

449
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,380
And in My Brother, My Brother, Me, you roll your ears

450
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,420
through our words and it makes your heart bigger.

451
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
Wow, you're right, that's haunting.

452
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,260
Until your heart gets too big for your chest and then you die from it, it explodes.

453
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,700
Like Seabiscuit.

454
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,940
That's my favorite trap from the Saw movies.

455
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:57,060
Hey, Charlene, your boyfriend, Adam, Gaber, is having his birthday today and you...

456
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,740
You fucked up twice really bad so far.

457
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,300
Let me try this.

458
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,660
Let's take it apart.

459
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,380
Let's take it apart.

460
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,180
The first goof was that you called her Charlene and not Charlene.

461
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,460
Okay, that was my bad.

462
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
You know who my favorite Hollywood actress is?

463
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,740
Charlise Theron.

464
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,460
Hey, Adam, happy birthday and anniversary from Charlene.

465
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,380
Both are within about...

466
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,220
It's a soft, it's a soft shuh.

467
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,780
Sha- Charlene.

468
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,140
I mean, I'll tell you the other problem is that you were stuttering earlier

469
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,260
and you said Adam is Gaber and that sounds like...

470
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,740
No, Adam is Beaver.

471
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,780
Adam is Beaver.

472
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,740
Adam, Gaber, it's their anniversary and his birthday.

473
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,180
They're within about three days of each other.

474
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,220
He likes many things, but loves bumblebees.

475
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,580
I'm going to call Charlene out on something here.

476
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,140
What do you mean it's about three days apart?

477
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,180
Like it fluctuates?

478
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,020
Well, his birthday...

479
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,420
Yeah, right.

480
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,260
Shouldn't it be exactly three days apart?

481
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,020
Why are you acting like this?

482
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,700
You know that every day is like incrementally, like microscopically longer than the last day.

483
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,420
You know that, right?

484
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,780
Like days are getting longer.

485
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,180
Yeah.

486
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,260
She's actually far more accurate than you are.

487
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,540
Oh.

488
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,020
Because they started dating at some point during the day

489
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,540
and he was born at some point during the night.

490
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,620
Oh, so she's got it like down to the second.

491
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,660
She knows exactly the second.

492
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,020
She just didn't want to bore you with the details.

493
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,460
But hey, happy birthday and anniversary.

494
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,940
If you'd like me to mispronounce your name,

495
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,140
you can go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron

496
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,820
and get a message up there.

497
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,180
But thank you to all of you and happy birthday or anniversary as the case may be.

498
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,460
I'd like to come off it with a Yahoo answer if we can.

499
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,660
Okay, gladly.

500
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,180
This one, this one's actually old.

501
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,540
I've been holding on to this one.

502
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,820
I've had this arrow in my quiver for a long time in the cinema by Jacob Locker.

503
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,180
Thank you, Jacob.

504
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,500
It's by Yahoo Answers user James who asks,

505
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,060
how can I make myself into a human peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

506
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

507
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,420
I like making messes.

508
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
And I want to really do this.

509
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,100
The first thing I want to do is get covered in a peanut butter type of mixture

510
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:15,460
and then a jelly type of mixture and have like some giant bread made of smaller bread.

511
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,460
And also when I get the peanut butter mixture and just a jelly,

512
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,060
mixture poured on me, she, I lay on the bread and get it dumped on me.

513
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,700
Or just stand up and have it poured on me.

514
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,420
It's your vote.

515
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,740
And last but not least, how could I make like a maybe runny,

516
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,180
liquidy peanut butter mix and running liquid jelly mix?

517
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,740
That guys, that, that was all one, one sentence.

518
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,780
Oh no.

519
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,980
Tell me what you guys think and how could I, how I could make a mess with this stuff.

520
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,900
And I forgot to say that at the end, after I get the mixtures poured on me,

521
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,540
I'm going to get two giant pieces of bread, cover it with regular PB and J,

522
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,820
cover myself up and maybe roll around in it, unleash the ideas and the creativeness.

523
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,780
This will be so much fun and feel awesome.

524
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,060
I'm right in thinking that there's an underlying and all the

525
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,740
while I'm going to be jerking it so right.

526
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,900
I'm going to jerk it in this runny liquidy jelly type mixture.

527
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,180
Oh, and BT dubs, I'm just going to be jerking it.

528
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,220
Danny is just one flag away from that trip to Universal Studios.

529
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,420
He's made through the gap fountain, made it through the car wash.

530
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,100
Now he's just got to get this one last flag from a giant peanut butter jelly suit.

531
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,380
And oh my God, is he masturbating?

532
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,780
He's so excited about that Casio keyboard.

533
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,700
That Casio keyboard that he has flowed on the flag.

534
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,260
He is using the flag as some sort of,

535
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,860
he is using the flag as some sort of jerk it sheath.

536
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,700
I'm Mark Summers and I quit television forever because I am yucked.

537
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,660
I am retired.

538
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,460
I have now have obsessive compulsive disorder.

539
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,620
I know because of this child's lewd act, I am leaving the entertainment business.

540
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,500
And that completes our Mark Summers origin story.

541
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,580
Those flags, those flags are for, those are roller skate vouchers, not jerk it sheaths.

542
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,940
Sir, sir, sir.

543
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,060
Pardon.

544
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,700
Good day.

545
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,020
You win nothing.

546
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,060
Hey Mark, you want to watch?

547
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,780
Hey Mark, I double dare you.

548
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,100
I'm going to ask a question.

549
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,620
Mark you up for a physical challenge?

550
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,700
Come over here and watch.

551
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,740
I, I might be hoping for too much here when I ask this question.

552
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,820
To what purpose?

553
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,340
He likes to make messes.

554
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,300
But like that's it?

555
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,380
Like he's going to do this in the privacy of his own home?

556
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,060
He likes to get super sloppy.

557
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,740
Like he's just going to be in his parents basement making himself a giant PB&J?

558
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,460
I think it's going to take him a while.

559
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,420
I think it's going to take him a long time, but not too long,

560
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,300
because if he wants to make a giant bread out of tiny breads,

561
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,820
those are going to get kind of, kind of moldy after.

562
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,780
Oh, so you're afraid of this getting gross in some way?

563
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,780
Right, I'm saying that he's got a really small window.

564
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,660
If he wants to do this tastefully, he's got to be quick about it.

565
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,460
If he does this at home by himself, it's disgusting.

566
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,780
If he does it in front of a crowd, it's modern art.

567
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,380
Yeah, well, that's the idea, right?

568
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,260
He wants to unleash the ideas and creativeness.

569
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,340
And as a side effect, it's going to be so much fun and it's going to feel awesome.

570
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,700
And like, I don't deny that.

571
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,740
Can you guys imagine how good that would feel?

572
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,940
Well, as long as he doesn't use Chunky, because that shit gets everywhere.

573
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,860
Yeah, that would be kind of abrasive on your skin.

574
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,620
You would have to go Jif Smooth.

575
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,620
Yeah, totally.

576
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,660
Cheesy moms choose Jif for their man-sized PB&Js.

577
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,420
Can I change my either legal name or karaoke name to Jif Smooth?

578
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,420
I think you can go Jif Smooth.

579
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:59,220
Who borrowed your car?

580
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,260
I loaned it to Jif Smooth as a misstep.

581
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,220
Yeah, I shouldn't have known.

582
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,460
Yeah, because he likes to make messes.

583
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,300
It's a messy, messy boy, Jif Smooth.

584
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,620
He says like a jelly type mixture.

585
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,900
Does he mean jelly?

586
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,100
I believe jelly is a jelly type mixture.

587
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,340
It has to be some sort of gelatinous,

588
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,980
plasmatic substance, something that oscillates between liquid and solid.

589
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,420
Oh, like lava?

590
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,580
Like lava, yeah, which would be great.

591
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,740
Hey, why don't we do this?

592
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,660
I'll wrap you up in a blanket or an afghan, and I'll say you're a burrito,

593
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,740
and I'll throw you in a volcano so that we never have to think about you again.

594
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,860
That sounds great.

595
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,300
That sounds like a real tasty mix.

596
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,180
Will this guy eat it later?

597
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,780
Yeah, that's what I don't understand.

598
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,660
Is he doing this, and then he's gonna be like, now somebody eat me.

599
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,140
Or is he just doing it, and then he's gonna be done,

600
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,620
and then he's gonna shower, and then go to work at the bar?

601
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,580
I don't think he's gonna shower.

602
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,780
I think he's gonna go to work still covered in, you know, placenta or whatever he is.

603
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,340
Jeff, you've been trying to get fired for a long time.

604
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,460
I feel like you've finally crossed the line.

605
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,060
Outlandish plan yet.

606
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,660
Again, or he's gonna do this in the middle of his local park,

607
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,180
and people will be like, this is Jif Smooth's magnum opus.

608
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,540
Or he'll do it on NBC late nights,

609
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,940
and have Guy Fieri give him a hundred thousand dollars on minute to win it.

610
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,260
That's basically what minute to win it is, just making a giant peanut butter.

611
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,580
I bet.

612
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,980
You have 60 seconds to get so nasty.

613
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,580
If you can cut yourself a peanut butter then steal my head visor,

614
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,180
I'm gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars.

615
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,060
Let's play Meme to Meme.

616
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,740
I have not seen this yet.

617
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,620
Oh, he's got peanut butter stuck in his mouth.

618
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,020
Why are you licking Jif Smooth off?

619
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,660
Can we create a reality TV show that's like sort of most dangerous game,

620
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,140
like or Hard Target is a better example,

621
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,580
where it's just you have to find Guy Fieri and take his head wear.

622
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,100
Make it your own.

623
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,020
Like a Lord of the Flies kind of thing?

624
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,780
Yeah, it would be sort of like the Amazing Race mixed with Hostile,

625
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,820
because you have to take his head, too.

626
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,900
You gotta take the head of Guy Fieri.

627
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,620
Bring me the head of Guy Fieri.

628
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,260
Well, all his life power is bound to his head visor.

629
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:28,420
That is the sort of the magical root that animates his Golem-esque body.

630
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,300
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

631
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,100
Hey, you know what?

632
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,220
You guys laugh it up.

633
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,260
Man makes a hell of a Tex-Mex salad plate.

634
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,900
That man makes a great Chinese.

635
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Yum, yum, yum.

636
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,180
Yum, yum, give me some.

637
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,260
For the last year and a half,

638
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,220
a friend of our family has been staying on our couch Monday through Friday.

639
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,100
He works in Manhattan during the week, returns to his family upstate on the weekend.

640
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,740
My question is, how do I let him know he needs to find another couch

641
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,500
without being the asshole who stops him from providing for his family?

642
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,940
Bewildered in Brooklyn.

643
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,500
Wow, that's a toughie.

644
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,420
Hey, I do want to alleviate your guilt though.

645
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,020
You are not, like, you're not stopping him from providing.

646
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,540
He's not providing for his family.

647
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,980
He's living on your couch.

648
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,580
You're providing for his family.

649
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,140
You're meeting him halfway here.

650
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,220
A year and a half?

651
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,140
It's no big deal.

652
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,380
No, that seems like the kind of thing you do where you say,

653
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,980
hey, I need to do this until I can find other arrangements.

654
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,620
It's just 500 days of Devin, just 500 days of Devin just crashing on the couch.

655
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,940
This is fucking you, me, and Dupree's shit.

656
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,660
Hey, when people go to look for a place to live, they do that.

657
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,980
Like, this is not how people do.

658
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,820
Like, we get places to live in.

659
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,100
Yeah.

660
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,900
We find a place to live and then we live in it every day of the week.

661
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,340
Is he in any way, like, compensating you or, like, paying you for bills or?

662
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,460
Rent or something?

663
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,260
Listen, I want you to know something, friend of the show.

664
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,700
You should have, like, guilt should not even be in your, like,

665
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,540
you could not be further from the asshole.

666
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,420
You could set the couch on fire and throw it out a window while he's sleeping on it.

667
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,460
You still would not be the bad guy in the situation.

668
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,660
Yeah, I think all you have to do is say, listen, it's been a while now

669
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,220
and I'd like to know what the permanent solution is.

670
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,340
A while?

671
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,500
It's been a goddamn year and a half.

672
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:38,740
Yeah.

673
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,140
It's been all the while.

674
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,820
Seasons have changed.

675
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,820
Winter has melted into spring.

676
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:45,940
A young man's-

677
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Now it's time for you to get the fuck out.

678
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,820
A young man's fancy has turned to fucking leave.

679
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,020
Get out of my house.

680
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,420
If this living situation were a human being, it would be, like, walking and almost talking.

681
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,060
Yeah.

682
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,020
Yeah, it is talking.

683
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,100
It's saying, get the fuck out of my house.

684
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,860
Fucking leave.

685
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,620
I want to sit on that couch.

686
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,460
It smells like you forever.

687
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,140
It smells like you sleep.

688
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,060
It smells like you when you're asleep.

689
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,860
I hate it here.

690
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,460
I'm moving.

691
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,580
You can stay if you want.

692
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,820
How is your friend comfortable with this living arrangement?

693
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,980
Well, it's a great couch.

694
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,860
I don't want to pass judgment here, but I can't imagine living on someone's couch

695
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,820
for five days a week for a year and a half and not feeling like an asshole myself.

696
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,340
I have this theory that living in New York is kind of like living in an awesome

697
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,500
but also post-apocalyptic world where it's like, we just got to survive, man.

698
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,860
We got to survive so we can go get to the good parts.

699
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,380
Oh, so it's like catch as catch can.

700
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,940
Like, you find a closet to sleep in and you sleep there.

701
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,260
I saw this video of this gentleman who was living in an apartment that was 63 square feet.

702
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,420
63 square feet.

703
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,420
His bed turned into a couch with the use of special panels,

704
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,300
and he kept his microwave in his clothing closet.

705
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,820
Oh, no.

706
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,940
That's not an apartment.

707
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,860
That is not an apartment.

708
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,980
That is a boxcar.

709
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,500
You are a boxcar hobo.

710
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,820
But think about what a great scene that's going to be when they do his true Hollywood story

711
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,500
because he turns into a famous actor.

712
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,860
He was totally happy about it.

713
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,780
He's like, oh, I prefer, you know, I just I go out and do all my business in the city,

714
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,660
and then I come home.

715
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,860
I just sleep in here.

716
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,500
And it's like, yeah, but that's what like prisoners say.

717
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,180
I live in this Iron Maiden.

718
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,500
It's rent controlled, so that's pretty nice.

719
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,340
It's just $850 a month, no bills included.

720
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,100
It's it gets pretty cold.

721
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,580
It gets pretty cold in the winter, but my four friends just come in and sleep on top of me.

722
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,140
Make a human peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

723
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,620
Yeah.

724
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,220
Do you know what he paid for that apartment?

725
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,220
Like 800 bucks.

726
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,700
Yeah.

727
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,500
That's that's not OK, guys.

728
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,420
So, yeah, kick your friend out.

729
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,340
Kick him the fu- Hey, you know what?

730
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,860
Hey, you know what?

731
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,260
You know what?

732
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,660
Seriously?

733
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,700
Not not even a joke.

734
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,540
I know this would be an aqua moment for you.

735
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,740
Take us over there.

736
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,300
Pick us up.

737
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Carry us over there.

738
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,300
You're on.

739
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,180
Pick up the computer.

740
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
Lug us over there.

741
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,900
Hey, friend.

742
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,460
Hey, listen, these times that, you know, you know what?

743
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,700
I'm not even going to do the nice thing is being a year and a half.

744
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,260
Time to go.

745
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,060
Yeah.

746
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,900
Time to time to fish.

747
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,460
What is it?

748
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,140
Fish and friends keep for three days.

749
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,300
Yeah.

750
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,700
What is it?

751
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,260
What's the thing?

752
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,380
Fish and friends?

753
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,860
Yeah, you you wrap up your friends in some newspaper and you toss them to people and

754
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,540
then you throw them out the door.

755
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
Yeah, it's it's time to come.

756
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,220
Company and poultry stink after a week.

757
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,820
That's what that's what the quotables please, please go.

758
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,940
Yeah, I now I'm talking to Griffin also.

759
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,180
But the friend friend, you've been sleeping on the couch.

760
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,780
We've all had some good times.

761
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,260
It was the one time when Jeff brought over the whiskey and you guys got really drunk.

762
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,740
It was great.

763
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,300
And everybody.

764
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,940
It's time to go.

765
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,100
It's gone far enough.

766
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,860
It's time to leave.

767
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,580
It's time to go.

768
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,740
Are you going?

769
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,020
You're still out now.

770
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,980
Pick up the gun.

771
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,780
Is he gone?

772
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,900
Hey, pick up a bag.

773
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,820
Put your things in the bag.

774
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,220
That's right.

775
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,460
You don't have anything because you're sleeping on the couch and just go.

776
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,300
Go find a partner.

777
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,380
Find a bag that's big enough for your things.

778
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,500
Collect them and skedaddle, skedaddle, just GTFO.

779
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,100
Come on, it is.

780
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,860
Let me check my watch.

781
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,820
Bounce a clock.

782
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,580
Time to bounce.

783
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,780
Why are you still here?

784
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,100
Get out.

785
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,300
No, we can hear you.

786
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,700
Just pretended to walk away and then froze.

787
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,540
We heard you open the door and then shut it.

788
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,900
It is dip time.

789
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,180
It is time to dip.

790
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,740
Go.

791
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,780
You're still here.

792
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Go.

793
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,260
You're still here.

794
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,580
Go.

795
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,620
Close the door behind you.

796
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,700
Now don't come back.

797
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,540
Change the locks.

798
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,060
Quick, quick.

799
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,540
Get a two by four and board it up.

800
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,100
Board it up.

801
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,220
Now listen, you got to leave through the window and you can never come back.

802
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,140
They can never see you again.

803
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,180
You're a ghost now.

804
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,820
You hear me?

805
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,460
You're a ghost.

806
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
Why are you still here?

807
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,780
You need to go too.

808
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,620
You got to go and do a gas station bathroom and cut and dye your hair.

809
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,140
Shave off your beard, change your clothes and never come back there.

810
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,780
Change your name.

811
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,820
Now, quick, wait, wait, come back.

812
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,620
Come back.

813
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,220
Turn us around towards the TV and put on Steve Wilkos.

814
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,500
Now go.

815
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,980
This is our house now.

816
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,380
Man, this couch chair is comfortable.

817
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,980
I get why you slept on it for 500 days.

818
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,620
Oh, man.

819
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,540
Free apartment.

820
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,500
You got any fun Joes?

821
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:35,940
That's all right.

822
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,060
We'll find them later.

823
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,700
We'll walk around.

824
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,500
Where are the fun Joes at?

825
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,460
Going to dip them.

826
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,260
We're going to evolve.

827
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,820
So this is our pad now.

828
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,500
It's pretty nice.

829
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,140
Yeah, it's nice.

830
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,980
I like it, especially the couch.

831
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,100
I'm going to ask you guys to leave because I have a girl coming over.

832
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,660
Oh, okay.

833
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,620
Oh, yeah, no worries.

834
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,500
No sweat.

835
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,940
She's on a MacBook Pro.

836
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,060
It's casual.

837
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,500
I recently started dating this amazing girl.

838
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,340
We only have been dating for the past three weeks, but I can tell there's a true connection.

839
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,620
The problem is we're both in our mid-20s back living at home,

840
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,980
trying to get back on our feet.

841
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,380
Neither of us are that happy with our current living situation.

842
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:16,020
My question is, is it too early to see if she's interested in looking for a place to live?

843
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,700
And if she wants to make a roommate out of her new and super fun boyfriend,

844
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,460
lovebirds leaving the nest.

845
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,820
I know what my answer is.

846
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,140
That's a tough one, man.

847
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,820
Three weeks.

848
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,580
Three weeks is not a lot of weeks.

849
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,260
That's not very many weeks.

850
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,980
Here's the thing.

851
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,220
I don't think it's too early.

852
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,060
I just don't know what the rush is.

853
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,620
Like, are you about to get kicked out of your house?

854
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,740
You know what I mean?

855
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,460
Like, maybe talk about this in like a month or two.

856
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,300
Yeah, I'm all for rushing it, but you're going to sign a year lease.

857
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,700
And like, that could be really uncomfortable.

858
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,260
Well, like Teresa and I, both of our leases were ending at the same time.

859
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,140
And we'd been together for about two or three months.

860
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,380
And we realized that it was stupid to get two separate one bedroom apartments.

861
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,060
So we just got one bedroom apartment together.

862
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,500
Can you find a month to month?

863
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,460
That's the true sign of love right there, is a month to month.

864
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,900
A month to month is a true sign of love?

865
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,980
Yeah, because it's like, I respect you, you respect me.

866
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,980
This might work out, it might not.

867
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,020
But regardless, if we get angry in September,

868
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,900
we can stop seeing each other in October.

869
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,060
We don't have to wait until May.

870
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,500
We will have to wait to the end of the month, though.

871
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,940
Yeah, try to hold off that fight to at least like the 23rd.

872
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,380
Like, you terrible bit.

873
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,180
Oh, wait, hold on.

874
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,060
Oh, it's the 15th.

875
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,660
Just you wait.

876
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,460
Just you wait.

877
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,220
I'm putting this in my journal.

878
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,260
You're gonna get it.

879
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,420
That would actually be a really good relationship tincture, I think.

880
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,180
If every time you were gonna have a fight,

881
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,100
you had to wait to the end of the month to have it.

882
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,420
Uh-huh.

883
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,020
You would never fight.

884
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,020
You would never fight.

885
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,980
It would be great.

886
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,460
Except on the 30th.

887
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,380
And then you would fucking explode.

888
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,020
Fucking cage match.

889
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,340
Yeah.

890
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:12,580
Um, I would say wait at least another month and really just maul it over.

891
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,940
Because you've got nowhere to go.

892
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,340
Like, your parents aren't kicking you out.

893
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,980
But they do, but maybe they have apartments where they're,

894
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,420
oh, they're living at home.

895
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,220
Just wait another month and give this a lot of thought

896
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,900
and think about, is this a person I want to spend at least a year,

897
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,100
if not more, with and then start talking about it.

898
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,260
You don't have to do it right away.

899
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,260
Start talking about it and then wait like another month.

900
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,780
Yeah, another month after that month.

901
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:48,740
So we're saying four months and then maybe consider doing it like six months out.

902
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,940
So 10 months.

903
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,940
The thing is, is living together,

904
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,700
it doesn't matter how awesome you think each other are.

905
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,060
There are going to be things that they do.

906
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,020
Every human being has things that they do that get on your nerves.

907
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,140
Some more than others.

908
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,700
Yeah.

909
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,260
And so living together is what you do after you love each other so much

910
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,020
that those things don't matter.

911
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,740
Yeah.

912
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,300
That you can go, okay, it annoys me that you always eat the last waffle.

913
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,340
But I love you so much that I just don't care.

914
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,020
Is that a concern for you, Travis?

915
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,220
God, I love waffles.

916
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,420
I worry that three weeks in, you barely know each other well enough

917
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,700
to even like consider living together.

918
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,300
Yeah, I mean, it's really early, dog.

919
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,420
I'm sure you're cool.

920
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,180
I think it's beautiful that you are thinking about it now.

921
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,860
I'm happy that you're so in love.

922
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,580
Yeah.

923
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,580
It's also going to put a lot of pressure on your relationship early that you may not want.

924
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,380
But at the same time, maybe you should just do it.

925
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,060
But here's the other thing, three weeks in, you have to talk about money

926
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,660
and who's going to pay for what bills.

927
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,980
Oh, love will find a way, Travis.

928
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,940
What happened to your heart?

929
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,740
Love will find a way.

930
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,260
What did Vin Diesel say?

931
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,380
That you either have to get busy living together or get busy dying together.

932
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,060
I think it's time.

933
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,860
I think, you know what?

934
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,060
I think you're one week late.

935
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,500
Oh.

936
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,940
I think you're one week late to the party.

937
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,940
I feel like 14 days is long enough to know.

938
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,420
Okay, then let's flip the script here and say if he's going to bring it up,

939
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,380
how does he bring it up?

940
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,900
Hey, you know how we've been seeing each other for approximately 22 days?

941
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,100
Maybe we should cohabitate because what did Vin Diesel say?

942
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,420
He said, get busy living together, get busy dying together.

943
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,220
And then you have Vin Diesel there to ask her.

944
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,500
He says, hey, Mallory.

945
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,420
Mallory, will you live in sin with Jeff?

946
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,260
With Jeff Smith?

947
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,700
With Jeff Smith.

948
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,420
He's going to get into some weird things so you just got to stay by him.

949
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:44,980
He's pretty cool.

950
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,620
He's a good roommate except for this one thing.

951
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,420
There's his room.

952
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,260
There's this one little thing.

953
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,580
So here's my other advice if you're just going to jump in.

954
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:03,300
Like full immersion therapy, tell her every annoying thing that you do

955
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,940
and make her tell you every annoying thing that she does.

956
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,380
Day one, lock the doors.

957
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,180
I'm telling you, this is what Teresa and I did after knowing each other for like three

958
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,620
or four months and moving in together.

959
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,260
I sat her down and said, you know, I am messy.

960
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,020
I leave shit all over the floor.

961
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,980
He's still listening to them today every Tuesday.

962
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,620
Oh, I forgot.

963
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,300
Wait, hold on.

964
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,260
I thought I said something else.

965
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,020
When I spit out my toothpaste, I just spit it right into the mirror.

966
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,520
Yep.

967
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,700
And then I draw faces in it.

968
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,420
It's pretty cool.

969
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,220
I'm a monster.

970
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,420
Yeah, just make sure that you both communicate everything.

971
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,660
Even, you know, after you live together because that's the downfall of living together.

972
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,700
If you don't communicate, you will harbor resentment towards each other for the littlest things.

973
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,420
If you don't communicate, you're going to communicate.

974
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,860
Yeah, that's what Vin Diesel says.

975
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,220
That is what Vin Diesel said.

976
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,620
Have you been reading like Vin Diesel books or something?

977
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,780
Is he like a motivational guy now?

978
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,500
10 tips, 10 tools to being a more effective lover by Vin Diesel.

979
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,780
I do find him very motivating.

980
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,540
That sounds beautiful, Griffin.

981
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,500
It is beautiful.

982
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,740
He's he's got a beautiful mind and heart.

983
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,020
Have you seen Pitch Black?

984
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,940
I want to hear Griffin's last question first.

985
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,500
Real quick, housekeeping maxfundstore.org you can get or maxfundstore.com.

986
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:25,460
You can get your t-shirts, MB&B AM t-shirts and other Max Fund podcast t-shirts.

987
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,500
There's some really cool ones.

988
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,020
Are you guys listening to those?

989
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,620
Oh, God, I sure hope you are.

990
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,140
Yeah, they're all really funny.

991
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,500
Jordan Jesse Goh just did an episode with fucking Joshua Molina.

992
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,700
Are you kidding me?

993
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:42,660
Josh Molina, who a lot of people say his name is the best part of the lyrics I wrote to the West Wing theme song.

994
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,940
So, so that was quite the get for that.

995
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,900
My favorite part is Richard Schiff.

996
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,300
You like that part?

997
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,060
Look for it on YouTube, everybody.

998
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:53,460
It's there.

999
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,260
Just got to dig it up.

1000
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,780
What else has got what else we got cooking?

1001
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,660
What else is we haven't talked about a while, but there are some really fun Max Fund forums.

1002
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,460
If you haven't checked them out, it's a really great community.

1003
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:12,580
And every time we post a show that day, like as soon as we post it, there's a forum entry

1004
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,060
about us, a thread that starts about that episode.

1005
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,940
So if you have comments you want to make, or if you just want to talk about the show,

1006
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,940
make sure that you go to the Max Fund forums and check it out and post on there.

1007
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,660
Some people get in touch with us about us doing guest spots on their podcast.

1008
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,460
We'd love to do that.

1009
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,180
Note that it probably won't be all three of us.

1010
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,580
It's hard enough to get us in one room to record.

1011
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,540
And outside of the hour we record the show, we really hate each other.

1012
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,460
Yeah, we really do not do not talk much.

1013
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,100
But that's not true.

1014
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,820
I love you guys.

1015
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,060
But make sure you email us nbnbam at maximum fun.org.

1016
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,180
Don't tweet at us.

1017
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,900
Don't tweet it.

1018
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,060
It gets lost in the ether and the shuffle.

1019
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:55,380
That said, if you do have that NBA hashtag, set it up because it is locked in there.

1020
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,500
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of their song.

1021
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,340
It's a departure from the album, putting the days to bed, which we use as our theme

1022
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,380
song and money zone break.

1023
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,180
If you haven't listened to his new podcast with Merlin man Roderick on the line, they

1024
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,460
just did their second episode.

1025
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,500
It's super good.

1026
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,260
Yeah, we need to get that on the network.

1027
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,780
I'm going to sign them up.

1028
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,020
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show.

1029
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:28,660
Duckloft 13, Alex Batty, Church's wife back in the saddle, as it were.

1030
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,860
Fathom, so many.

1031
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,460
Radstromical, so many great people.

1032
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,620
Trey Cup, back in full effect.

1033
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,820
Gowdy James, who got engaged.

1034
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,460
Daddy James Gowdy.

1035
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,940
Yeah, he's having a first.

1036
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,620
He put down those riots.

1037
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,980
Kimbo 2042.

1038
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,860
Thank you, everybody.

1039
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,660
You're all the best.

1040
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,860
Jeff Whart, everybody.

1041
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,820
You're all the best people.

1042
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,620
So God bless you.

1043
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,420
And thank you for tweeting about the show.

1044
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,860
NBMA hashtag.

1045
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,580
Just do it.

1046
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,420
Is that everything?

1047
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,540
I feel like that's everything.

1048
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,660
We're trying to get that quicker.

1049
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,860
I feel like that was pretty quick.

1050
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,980
We're doing a bad job, though.

1051
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,180
Let's just shut it down.

1052
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,620
This final question was sent in by Catherine Morale,

1053
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,260
whose name I said very wrong last week.

1054
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,260
And I would like to take this time to formally apologize.

1055
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,900
Sorry about that.

1056
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,980
She just got married, too.

1057
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,740
And her new name is Rude.

1058
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,340
That's kind of a...

1059
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,820
I've gone far too long.

1060
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,100
Catherine Morale, Rude.

1061
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,580
Thank you.

1062
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,660
It's asked by Yahoo!

1063
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,140
answers user, no chance without Christ puncher.

1064
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,980
Who asks, in all caps, so I'm going to yell it.

1065
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,860
Was that dog Eddie on Frasier, a real dog or computer generated?

1066
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm Justin McElroy.

1067
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,220
I'm Travis McElroy.

1068
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1069
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,100
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1070
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,140
Kiss your dad.

1071
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,180
Square on the lips.

1072
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,620
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1073
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,660
Keep your heart.

1074
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,260
Hey, keep your heart.

1075
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,700
Hey, keep your heart.

1076
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,380
Hey, keep your heart.

1077
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,260
Three stacks.

1078
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,300
Keep your heart.

1079
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,580
Man, these girls are smart.

1080
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,220
Three stacks.

1081
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,340
These girls are smart.

1082
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:34,900
Play your part, play your part.
