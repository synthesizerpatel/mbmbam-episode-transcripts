1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,880
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,760
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,560
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis of McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,080
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, you wascally wabbit.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,480
Happy birthday to you. Hi, everybody. We're celebrating the life of Bugs Bunny,

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,640
who turns 80 years old today. I mean, he doesn't. So excited to have...

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,800
He's not on the show, but if he was, I think he'd sound a little something like this.

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:30,480
Okay, but he wasn't born, right? So he'll never die.

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,360
He was born. Just because he never died doesn't mean he was born.

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,080
Well, let's not be so quick to judge, because Maude Flanders died famously of Simpsons,

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:48,160
so there is precedent that cartoon characters can pass away, and we write about it in our TV guide,

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,680
and we try to solve who shot Mr. Burns, and it's very important to us.

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,480
So Bugs Bunny could get very, very sick, Travis, with some sort of disease for rabbits.

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,560
Yeah, some kind of carrot-related thing.

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
Some sort of thing like that, yes.

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,880
Like maybe he ate some tainted carrots and shit himself to death.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,640
And he's little. Rabbits are little. It wouldn't take much, would it?

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,040
And you're thinking about it now. He's a fragile little guy.

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,680
We have to protect this 80-year-old rabbit, man.

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,960
You know, I never cared for his antics. I'm just going to put it right out there.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,240
Okay. Of all the kind of cartoon, I would say, figureheads,

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,160
I always found Bugs Bunny's acerbic wit and japery to be a little bit on the mean side.

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,920
This is now the moment where we can exclusively reveal that Travis was adopted.

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,520
His birth name was Travis Fudd, and I'm glad we could finally put that out into the world.

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,640
I don't think you have to be cut from that particular bald, impotent cloth to hate this rabbit.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
I think dude sucks.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,200
You watch Space Jam, fucking Lola Bunny shows up like,

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
hey everybody, check out how good I am at basketball.

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,600
And this fucking idiot rabbit's like,

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,280
I have a boner.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,560
It's like, yo, she didn't come here for you to do that, Bugs.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
She came here to play basketball with Michael Jordan,

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
which is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
If I rolled up to that gym and was like,

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,320
let me play basketball, show you how good I am.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,640
Tash, check out how good I am at dunking.

41
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
And fucking Wile E. Coyote was like, let me fuck you.

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
I would be like, this is not what I signed up for.

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,320
Okay, Griffin, to be fair, please don't besmirch Wile E. Coyote.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,960
He'd buy you dinner first and he would ask for consent.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,680
He would hold up a little sign that would say, gotta fuck you.

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
He wouldn't say it out loud.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,240
He would hold up a sign that said, would it be okay if I fucked you?

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Can I talk about the stuff that I want to talk about with Bugs Bunny?

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,960
Is it about how much he sucks?

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,440
I did my research on Bugs Bunny.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
I put up some facts and figures and stats.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,320
And I have two things I'd like to share with you about Bugs Bunny.

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,840
Thank you, The Mental Floss, as always,

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
for pairing all of human history down to the real tank nugs.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
Here's one fact that I'd like to discuss.

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,200
In several psychological studies about false beliefs,

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
scientists have shown people fake advertisements for Disney World

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
featuring Bugs Bunny.

59
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,360
A significant portion of subjects then claim to remember going to Disney

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
and meeting Bugs, even though Warner Brothers character

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,360
would never be on display at a Disney theme park.

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,960
Now, okay, hey.

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,760
I want to be the, I want to hang out with these people like,

64
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,000
yeah, I fucking saw Bugs Bunny.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
I remember when I was there, it was me and the mouse and Bugs.

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,600
All three of my best friends just hanging out.

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
How much time do you think there had to be

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,320
between showing them these fake ads and then asking them like,

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
hey, look at this ad.

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,560
Do you remember this?

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,200
Yes.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah, I guess.

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
Do you remember when you saw Bugs Bunny?

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,160
Oh yeah, I think he was there.

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,000
Although, yeah, to be fair to science,

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
to be unfair to science, I guess I should say,

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
to be fair to these people who were in a study,

78
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,480
you showed me a commercial for Disney World featuring Bugs Bunny

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,040
and then they're like, is Bugs Bunny in Disney World?

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
I would probably say, well, it'd be a fucking weird commercial if he's not, huh?

81
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
They're gonna have a lawsuit on their hands, huh?

82
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Who is wasting their time making false Disney World ads if not?

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,080
That's weird.

84
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,880
I mean, to be fair, there is a lot of weird stuff at Disney now.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
Sometimes I'm reminded that the Muppets are owned by Disney

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
and that seems interesting and strange.

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
But if someone said, was Bugs Bunny at Disney?

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
I'd be like, I don't know, man.

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
You said you'd give me a hundred dollars if I did this study.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
Is that now?

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
Do I, is it check or cash or what's the deal?

92
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,200
My second fact about Bugs is in 1961,

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,760
Mel Blanc, who voiced Bugs Bunny,

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,800
got into a serious car accident that left him in a coma for weeks.

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
Eventually a doctor tried to get the unresponsive patient to talk

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,520
by asking him, Bugs Bunny, how are you doing today?

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Blanc responded in Bugs' voice, what's up, doc?

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,080
Later the doctor would say of the incident,

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
it seemed like Bugs Bunny was trying to save his life.

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,400
Oh God.

101
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,320
That's not a good, and that doctor's license to do literally anything

102
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,560
that involves helping people medically,

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,040
touching people, being near people was instantly-

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,560
Driving a car, he shouldn't be allowed to do anything.

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,320
So this, so are you telling this doctor after this moment

106
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,880
like went back to the other doctors as like,

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Bugs Bunny is, listen, I know how this is gonna sound,

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
but Bugs Bunny is in there

109
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
and he's trying to help me save this man's life.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,880
Anyways, I'm gonna go write a movie called Monkey Bone now,

111
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,160
if you'll excuse me.

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
The next morning he came in all embarrassed like,

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
guys, I'm sorry, I watched Patch Adams 30 years before it came out

114
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,320
and it led me to some questionable decisions.

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,320
Hate this fucking rabbit.

116
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,520
This is what I'm saying.

117
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm done with him.

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
You know, if Donald Duck was talking shit,

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
Mickey wouldn't trick a hunter into shooting him.

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
That's what I'm saying, right?

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
Like Mickey Mouse would never be like,

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,560
ha ha, it's duck season, fucker.

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
Like he wouldn't do that.

124
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,360
Yeah, it's like if Peg like Pete was there

125
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
and he was terrorizing Mickey Mouse,

126
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
Mickey Mouse wouldn't be like, stop Donald to death instead.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
We were watching a Donald Duck cartoon recently

129
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
and my two-year-old just out of nowhere

130
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
and loudly announced, Donald Duck is a grass hole.

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,080
What?

132
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,640
He said, Donald Duck, he's a grass hole.

133
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
And we, after a little bit of searching and digging,

134
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,480
we found out that she had confused him with Donald Trump

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,440
and was just echoing things that we had said around the house.

136
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,240
All right, cool.

137
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,720
So Donald Duck is a grass hole now.

138
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,840
Is that how you sort of like get your political frustration out?

139
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,760
You walk around your house loudly proclaiming

140
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
that Donald Trump is an asshole?

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,760
No, my five-year-old does that.

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,400
Oh, okay.

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
And then so.

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
Okay, cool.

145
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,760
Okay.

146
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,120
I was gonna say that's probably not,

147
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
that ain't gonna move the needle.

148
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,240
That ain't gonna move the national conversation forward.

149
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,760
It's a big tit at our house.

150
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,680
We like to let all political abuse.

151
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
Foment.

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
All right.

153
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,920
This is an advice show and it's specifically an advice show

154
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
on the Maximum Fund Network,

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,280
which is more specifically doing its annual pledge drive,

156
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,760
the Maximum Fund drive.

157
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,720
Maximumfund.org slash join is the address

158
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,880
where you can go right now and support the shows that you love.

159
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,640
You listen to Bim Bam, Sawbones, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

160
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,400
Jordan and Jesse Go, The Adventure Zone,

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
whatever, Switchblade Sisters, you name it.

162
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,640
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

163
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,440
All those great shows need your support now.

164
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,160
And the cool thing is if you can pledge a few bucks a month

165
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,240
or a lot of bucks a month, whatever works for you,

166
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,520
we know there's a weird time for money.

167
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,040
So whatever you can do, we really appreciate it.

168
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,920
But that money goes directly to the shows you listen to.

169
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,000
You choose the shows you listen to when you sign up

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,160
and Max Fund takes a small portion

171
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,720
to sort of keep things operating on their end.

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
They do a lot to support our shows.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
And then the rest goes,

174
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,000
it just split up between the shows that you enjoy.

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,440
It's a way to support the stuff you like.

176
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,160
And I know times are weird for y'all out there financially

177
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,040
for a lot of folks.

178
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,840
I will say it's also pretty weird on our end.

179
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,160
Touring and stuff like that is not currently an option for us.

180
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
So we really do depend on your support

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
to keep things going around here.

182
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,520
So if you like what we do and you have a few spare bucks

183
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,360
and just a few spare seconds,

184
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,400
maximumfund.org forward slash join is the address.

185
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,680
There's gifts too.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
Yeah, if you can pledge five bucks a month,

187
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,400
you get a ton of bonus content.

188
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
10 bucks a month, you get all that stuff

189
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,760
and a beautiful pin from the show of your choice.

190
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
But the real thing is you're supporting things

191
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
that you love and with that,

192
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
not to put too far a point on it,

193
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
but we really need you.

194
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,920
So if you can help out, if you're able to,

195
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,240
maximumfund.org forward slash join.

196
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
More like maximumfund.orgasm

197
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
because that's what you're gonna have

198
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,560
when you go to this website.

199
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,120
Wow.

200
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm not gonna say it again.

201
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
We didn't used to work so blue.

202
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,720
I told you I would say it again.

203
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,320
What are we, Redbook?

204
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,520
Come on, can we do a question?

205
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
At the office, my desk is right next

206
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
to our single occupant bathroom.

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
Unfortunately, I'm able to hear

208
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,440
some of the louder sounds

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
that come out of the bathroom.

210
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Oh, baby.

211
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,440
However, there's a new guy in the office.

212
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, Marmaduke, you've done it again.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,760
Snap into a slim jam.

214
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
However, there's a new guy in the office

215
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,680
who goes into the bathroom

216
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,120
and immediately starts playing drums

217
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,600
on his legs.

218
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,320
Fuck yeah.

219
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,920
The thing is, he's really good.

220
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
That's funnier than our things that we said.

221
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah, it's almost like you should

222
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
let me get through the questions.

223
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
I've been looking for a new drummer

224
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,520
to jam with and would love to ask him

225
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,880
to jam sometime.

226
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
How do I approach the new guy

227
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
and tell him that I'm impressed with him

228
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,200
bathroom drumming and invite him

229
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
to come jam?

230
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
That's from shamefully shy in Chicago.

231
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,880
Okay, we can assume this person

232
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,080
is drumming on his legs when seated

233
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
doing twosies or a comfortable onesie, right?

234
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,360
Listen, if they're not sitting down

235
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
to onesie, what are you doing?

236
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah, you're wasting a perfectly good

237
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
chillax opportunity.

238
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
Sit down.

239
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,080
I don't think people are standing

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,560
at the urinal pulling their pants down

241
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,640
to the point where they have exposed thighs

242
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,120
to create that sort of sonorous slap.

243
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
Yeah, it's a hand bone.

244
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,260
Doing that.

245
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,200
So that's important to know.

246
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,040
Yeah, I mean, listen,

247
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,520
if he's gonna get a good drum on,

248
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,800
if he's gonna hand bone,

249
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
he needs to get some skin.

250
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,200
Maybe he's also pulling up his shirt

251
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
to get the tummy symbol going.

252
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, belly, like a deep bass drum.

253
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,080
Yeah, right?

254
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,120
That's the bass drum.

255
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
So what would symbols

256
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,600
and maybe like the shoulders?

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
You get the fucking hi-hat at the like,

258
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,360
but then you get that.

259
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,000
Here's the problem.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
Let's play a game.

261
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
Hold on.

262
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,160
Can we stop?

263
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,720
Can we stop?

264
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
Let's play a game where I slap

265
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,280
a part of my body.

266
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
You guys tell me what you think it is.

267
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,680
Okay, got it.

268
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
Wait, Justin, be quiet.

269
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,280
I hear it.

270
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
I think we have played this game,

271
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
this exact game before.

272
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm gonna say that's a clavicle.

273
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,760
That's like a-

274
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
No, you think my clavicle would make that,

275
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,480
like there's not that much clavicle surface area

276
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
to make that, it's like loud of a slap.

277
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,200
Justin, do you want to hear it again?

278
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,920
Are you shirtless?

279
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,720
No.

280
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,400
That's like your flank.

281
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
Travis, you want to guess again?

282
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm gonna say it's your bicep.

283
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,560
That's my foot.

284
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,600
Wonderful.

285
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,320
So this can be,

286
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
everybody's always getting on my goners

287
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,080
because I don't have a great segment.

288
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,520
Like you guys have all these great segments.

289
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,040
So maybe now in the middle of an episode,

290
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
I'll be like, everybody shut up.

291
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
That was my elbow.

292
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
If you say that you're going to do this

293
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,240
throughout the episode,

294
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,200
it will be the first time

295
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
that we've ever actually said that

296
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
and actually followed through on it.

297
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,480
Probably won't.

298
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,760
We'll be doing this throughout the episode.

299
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,120
Probably won't be doing that.

300
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,840
Probably not.

301
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,400
I, listen, all you got to do is let,

302
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,920
you got to lure him out with a tasty groove.

303
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
And that's the thing is with,

304
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
if you're within earshot of this guy

305
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,360
and you're just like sitting at the coffee maker

306
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
and while you're sitting at the coffee maker,

307
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,600
you just lay out a little

308
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,520
He's going to pick up whatever sticks he can find

309
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
right around you

310
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,920
and start laying down another lick.

311
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,040
Maybe give you a little bit of that.

312
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,720
And then you're giving him like

313
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,840
and he's going to do that.

314
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
And then Susan from down the hall,

315
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
he's going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

316
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
I really wish we could have built that chronically.

317
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,720
I really like-

318
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
We were.

319
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,480
Travis helped it.

320
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
Yeah, but at different times.

321
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

322
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,680
That's going to be, actually that, you know what?

323
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,120
I want to do a backwards segment.

324
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,640
That's your, that's your TikTok assignment.

325
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,680
Oh shit.

326
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,560
That'll be a good one.

328
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,760
I don't think that's how TikTok works.

329
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,280
Here's the problem.

330
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,760
Oops.

331
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,120
No, whoa, whoa, what?

332
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,400
The problem is this, Justin.

333
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,480
You're going to start laying down that tasty groove

334
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,760
and he's going to get a little embarrassed to maybe walk away

335
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
and you're going to push it

336
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,600
and find out that he is only comfortable,

337
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,200
much like someone singing in the shower,

338
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,960
he's only comfortable playing drums sitting on the toilet.

339
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
So you're going to need to get a porta potty

340
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,200
into your garage where you jam

341
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
for him to be comfortable doing it.

342
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Now, if you can figure that out,

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
that's a great gimmick for a band.

344
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,120
It's a great fucking gimmick.

345
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,280
It's like Frank sort of, but-

346
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,840
Yes.

347
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,400
With a guy in it.

348
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Would you have, would you cut out arm holes?

349
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh, cool.

350
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
In the porta potty?

351
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,400
So it's like the porta potty is playing the drums

352
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,280
or would you put the drums?

353
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
I had, I'd pictured the drums in the porta potty,

354
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,520
but now-

355
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
That's going to fuck the whole Sonic,

356
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,480
you know what I mean?

357
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,160
Sonically, that's not going to work.

358
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
Now, now I'm seeing it

359
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
and I like your version much better.

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,240
Yeah, like little arms stick out of the porta potty

361
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
and they're just ripping.

362
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,680
Ooh, and let me say-

363
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,360
I guess you got to have feet holes for the kick drum.

364
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
But then an LED face

365
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,840
so that it can take on different facial expressions

366
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,560
like you don't really-

367
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,600
One more time.

368
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
Really getting into it, you know?

369
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,120
It's like, oh, the porta potty is fucking rocking today

370
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
and then he's biting his little LED lip or whatever.

371
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
You've got, you've also got the built-in like,

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
when you need publicity,

373
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
be like, he's finally stepping out of the porta potty.

374
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,160
You know, it's funny, actually,

375
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
Neil Peart used to do this called the porta potty.

376
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,200
It's like, not a lot of people do it.

377
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,360
Oh, come on.

378
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
You dumb piece of shit.

379
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm checking with the judges, hold on.

380
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,880
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

381
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,680
Yeah, I love that, girl.

382
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
So here's a Yahoo that was sent in by,

383
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
as long as we're talking about jamming on music,

384
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,800
here's one sent in by Adrian Cowles.

385
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,440
Thank you, Adrian.

386
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,960
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user

387
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,680
who I'm going to call Megan,

388
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,640
like Megan, but with an M at the end asks,

389
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
why do cello players shake their head

390
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,960
when they play the cello?

391
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,280
Okay, no joke.

392
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,000
Everybody knows this.

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You look at the string quartet,

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,280
the cello players are always like,

395
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,400
always kind of grooving.

396
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,000
I was watching a Rachmaninoff concert last night.

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,960
Oh, fuck off.

398
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,480
Well, no.

399
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,360
Fuck him on and off.

400
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,280
That's two.

401
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,480
That's two in a row.

402
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
And it featured a young woman playing the piano.

403
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,320
She was really getting into it.

404
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,720
And as much as I enjoyed her performance,

405
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,680
all I kept thinking was like,

406
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,280
how much more interesting it would be

407
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,120
if she just looked really bored.

408
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,400
If she was yawning and checking the time and stuff

409
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,600
and playing almost like she was just killing time

410
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
until some of these really difficult licks.

411
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
And I think that maybe that's it,

412
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,240
is at this point, all cello players are so good at it

413
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
that they have to act like it's really hard

414
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,920
so that people are impressed

415
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,600
because if they showed how it was like,

416
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,960
no, at this point, man,

417
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,640
I'm not even thinking about it.

418
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,080
I'm trying to remember that recipe

419
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,560
from my grandmother's really good banana nut muffins.

420
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,600
Like, this is easy.

421
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,360
It's possible.

422
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,480
It's possible.

423
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,320
It could also be that Yo-Yo Ma started doing it

424
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,120
and everybody was like,

425
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,000
well, if Yo-Yo's, if Ma's doing it,

426
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,040
I need-

427
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
There have to be trends like that, right?

428
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Absolutely there's cellist trends.

429
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,640
Absolutely there is.

430
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, this guy started wearing real jangly bracelets.

431
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
So now we're all wearing jangly bracelets

432
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
so that you can hear us like,

433
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,800
as we go.

434
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
I would think bowstring composure is like a big-

435
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
There's always like a new shit

436
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,880
that's continually more sort of devious,

437
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,120
like a more, like a worse,

438
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,520
just worse.

439
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,720
For the environment, worse morally,

440
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
like more bankrupt.

441
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,600
Like if it gets like cow,

442
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
like baby cow innards, stuff like that,

443
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,600
it just gets like worse and worse and worse.

444
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,880
This is hair from the Christ.

445
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
Yeah, we stole it.

446
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,840
We stole it from the church.

447
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,080
We hired Nicholas Cage to steal the hair of Christ.

448
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,320
Steal a fistful of Christ hair.

449
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
Yeah, do you guys know the kind of head shake

450
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,760
that I'm talking about?

451
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,400
Like that kind of like,

452
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,520
oh, fuck, yeah.

453
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,880
Yeah, I'm into it.

454
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Really going on it.

455
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,520
Really hitting it.

456
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,760
Well, oh, yeah, shredding these, shredding these.

457
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,680
I'm ready to tell you, Griffin, the truth.

458
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,400
Yeah.

459
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,760
And I only know this because I'm an honorary cellist

460
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
because I saved a cellist's life.

461
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,680
And so now their life is mine to do it as they please.

462
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,480
Sure, sure.

463
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah, we know how it works.

464
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
What a lot of people don't know

465
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
if you don't play a cello is,

466
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,920
actually the way a cello works is

467
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,800
as you're playing it,

468
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,640
it is fighting back the whole time.

469
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
And so it's kind of like,

470
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
yeah, it's like a wrestling match.

471
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,360
So there's a lot of like kind of like

472
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
throwing it back and forth that has to happen.

473
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,480
So that head shake is like the kind of counterbalance

474
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,320
to keep the cello from getting away.

475
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Because if it were to ever get free,

476
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,680
that little, it has that big spike at the bottom.

477
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
A dangerous.

478
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,560
It would use that to kill everyone in the room.

479
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,320
To hurt, yeah, at least, yeah.

480
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,080
And then there's also the danger that, you know,

481
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,680
a lot of times Yo-Yo Ma before he was

482
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,360
such an accomplished cellist,

483
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,360
he would finish a performance

484
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,320
and then people would be like,

485
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
oh, shit, where did Yo-Yo Ma just go?

486
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
And then be like, ah, fuck,

487
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,800
he got trapped inside his cello again.

488
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,040
And you would look inside the little hole

489
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,920
and he would be in there.

490
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,360
Like, ah, fuck, it got me.

491
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
That's why the concerts go so long.

492
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,560
They have to wear out their cellos

493
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
so that they can be put away for another night.

494
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
So they can be put away

495
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,040
or else they will not get back in their boxes.

496
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,560
They don't like it at all.

497
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,440
They will kill and they will not stop killing.

498
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,040
Once they taste human blood,

499
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,160
the cello will never rest until we are all dead.

500
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
And that's why violinists are weak babies.

501
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,040
Because it's like fight a real fucking instrument.

502
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,120
A double bass is like, all right,

503
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,240
fucking, wow, we get it.

504
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
You're so strong.

505
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
You can kick a double bass.

506
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,280
But even that, that's why, see,

507
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
the violin is too weak

508
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
to really hurt human beings all that much.

509
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,760
But a double bass is so heavy that it's easy to catch.

510
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
A cello is right there in the middle.

511
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,080
It's easily God's most dangerous creature.

512
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,160
And then you see a swing band

513
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,440
where they're like fucking spinning

514
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,320
that double bass around.

515
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,680
It's like, wow, big dick energy, anybody?

516
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,520
Is that Bach?

517
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
I don't think so.

518
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
I don't know.

519
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,080
It kind of felt like it was digging its head back in.

520
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,240
And everyone said, that's not Bach.

521
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,720
It's like, hey, guys, are we doing big dick?

522
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
Are we doing big dick energy?

523
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,680
Nope, not saying that.

524
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
No, no more?

525
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,080
It is problematic.

526
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
Okay, I'll see.

527
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
I'll try again in another couple of years.

528
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,920
Bye.

529
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Here's another question.

530
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,480
I just purchased a basketball for my father's birthday.

531
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
Unfortunately, he decided he would go out

532
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
and buy one for himself at the end of the week,

533
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
two days before I was gonna give it to him.

534
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
The problem is simple.

535
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
How do I keep him from buying his own basketball

536
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
while not letting him know what I've done?

537
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,080
Because of everything, the store is not accepting returns.

538
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
I don't want him to buy another thing.

539
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,640
What can I do?

540
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,600
You gotta read the name.

541
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
Basketball Bungle and Benetiquette.

542
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,760
What kind of relationship...

543
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
Oh, man, I have a lot of questions.

544
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
What kind of relationship do you have with your father

545
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,560
and what kind of relationship does your father have

546
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,680
with money and also the sporting goods store?

547
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
And basketball for that matter.

548
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
And basketball for that matter

549
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
that he would say something like, at the end of this week.

550
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
God is my witness.

551
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
Listen, everyone, everyone.

552
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,080
Gather around.

553
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,200
Everyone, shut up and listen.

554
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,360
This Friday afternoon, I will be going to Dick's Sporting Goods

555
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,680
to purchase one American basketball.

556
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
55 birthdays have passed in which I did not have a basketball.

557
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,400
Another one will not come and go

558
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,360
until I have that rubber bastard under my thumb.

559
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,560
That is such a wild thing that I did not even process.

560
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,760
That's what they were saying.

561
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,840
I thought they were talking in the past tense,

562
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,280
but no, a declaration has been made

563
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,440
about basketball purchasing plans in the near future.

564
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
Your dad is from a different generation.

565
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,760
We're going to the store, used to be an event.

566
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,800
People used to gather around and circle the basketballs

567
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,440
they were going to buy or maybe just look at

568
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
if they couldn't afford it.

569
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
That used to be a big day out during the Great Depression

570
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,040
just to go to the Dick's and look at the basketballs.

571
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,520
Maybe bounce them up and down the aisles,

572
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,560
get a sense of their action, you know what I mean?

573
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,760
And then dream about the day

574
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
when you could afford a basketball.

575
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,200
Cut out clips of the old Sears robot catalog

576
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
of some beautiful new basketballs.

577
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,680
Why do you think, did he look when he announced this,

578
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,520
did he maybe look knowingly at everyone

579
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,520
thinking someone might say, no, please don't do that?

580
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,080
Hint, hint, hint.

581
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,160
I mean, again, a strange relationship with basketball

582
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,200
if that is the case.

583
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,560
Like, I really want to make sure.

584
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I'm really going to put a gun to everyone's heads

585
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,560
on this whole basketball thing.

586
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,520
Well, one of two things has happened.

587
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,160
Either your father has never owned a basketball,

588
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,800
at which point him deciding two days before his birthday

589
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,760
to buy it is an interesting, why now, father?

590
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,400
Or he has owned a basketball before, routinely used it,

591
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
and now it is, I don't know, destroyed somehow?

592
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,480
He loves basketball enough that both you and him

593
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,560
have thought about getting him a basketball,

594
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,080
but not so much that he has a basketball at the ready.

595
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,400
Can I ask us just a stupid question?

596
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,320
Yes. Yeah.

597
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,760
Is Dr. Anthony Fauci on cameo?

598
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,480
Because if he is, you could just pay him like a hundred bucks

599
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
or something to do a cameo for your dad

600
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,000
that's like, basketball is dangerous

601
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,880
or contaminated in some way.

602
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
Oh, so not as a present?

603
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,280
No, I mean, it would be a present.

604
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,880
You could have him be like, happy birthday,

605
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,200
you old son of a gun, and also don't touch any basketballs.

606
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,760
They're so dangerous and it's really bad.

607
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,840
Unless given to you by a loved one.

608
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,560
Unless they're my own special brand of Fauci balls.

609
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,680
And then you are going to have to coordinate with Fauci

610
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,400
to get him to decorate the basketball,

611
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
like maybe it's just a big cool sticker that he puts on it

612
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,120
that lets people know this is a genuine clean Fauci ball.

613
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,800
That's a genuine Fauci.

614
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,320
I really hope I'm saying that name right.

615
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,320
Yeah, you're doing pretty good.

616
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,520
I don't think he's on cameo though.

617
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,600
When your dad says, I'm going to go buy a basketball,

618
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,000
say no, don't buy a basketball.

619
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
And he's like, why not?

620
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,680
You say, cause basketballs are stupid.

621
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,560
Make him feel really bad about it.

622
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,120
Or you could pay $100 beloved Dr. Anthony Fauci

623
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
to do that for you, Trav.

624
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,440
Your idea was just a worse idea version of my idea.

625
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,120
Hey, let me throw this out.

626
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
10 minutes before he's about to leave to go to the store,

627
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,680
hand him the basketball and say, happy early birthday.

628
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,560
That's because that is the play.

629
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
You've gotten him two presents then,

630
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,040
you've gotten him a basketball

631
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,680
and he doesn't have to go anywhere to get it.

632
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,960
That would be perhaps if I were your father,

633
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,040
which I'm not, then unless this is BB,

634
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,040
then I would be so joyous to have just been miraculously saved

635
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,760
any amount of effort whatsoever,

636
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,080
then like that would make my day.

637
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,760
What if your child just walked into the room right now, Travis,

638
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,280
and just like launched a fucking bullet chest pass right at you

639
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,840
like, let's go pops, happy birthday.

640
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,440
Oh my God, I'd be so excited.

641
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
I don't even like basketball, I'd be excited.

642
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
Let's put it a different way.

643
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,080
What if BB walked in and said, here on this memory drive

644
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,880
is the rest of the episode already recorded,

645
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,560
you can go fuck off, I'd be so excited.

646
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,880
That would be so sick, yeah, I would love that.

647
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,640
Right, if Henry and Charlie and BB had just gone ahead

648
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,800
and recorded the rest of the episode for us,

649
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,480
I mean, I'd be watching Avatar The Last Airbender right now.

650
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,520
Cool life that you're living.

651
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,480
Can I do another Yahoo?

652
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
I love that, Griffin.

653
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,800
I love how we're just churning through questions this time.

654
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,520
Yeah, we're really blasting off into some new levels.

655
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,040
Finally getting some work done.

656
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,160
Emma can't send this in.

657
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
Thank you, Emma, it's Yahoo Answers user.

658
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
They are anonymous also, I'm going to call them.

659
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,120
Preston asks, do people travel to the USA

660
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,240
for good American food like hot dogs and burgers?

661
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,400
Oh my God.

662
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,800
There's gotta be some reason they're doing it

663
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,040
because it was Broadway, but now it's not that anymore.

664
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,200
And listen, just to be clear,

665
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,360
there are good restaurants and good cooks in America.

666
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
I'm just gonna come right out and say it.

667
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
Wow, what a bold supposition, Travis.

668
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,520
But what I like about this question is,

669
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,440
there are good restaurants and good cooks like everywhere.

670
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,280
What this question is asking is,

671
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,600
is America a destination for food

672
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,800
for specific American cuisine that you can only get in America?

673
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,400
And like that, I do not know that there's an answer to that.

674
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,280
If it does happen, I hope they're listening

675
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,160
so I can give them this special public service announcement

676
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,200
right now.

677
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,800
Hello, my name is Justin McElroy.

678
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,440
I host a podcast and several other podcasts.

679
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,400
We are proud Americans.

680
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,600
But if you love American food so much

681
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
so you're thinking of coming here

682
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
to eat our hot dogs and hamburgers,

683
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
here would be my question to you.

684
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,720
How much do you like hot dogs?

685
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,000
I mean, do you really love hot dogs?

686
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Because this is a weird time for us right now.

687
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,280
We're trying some different things out

688
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,280
in terms of vis-a-vis managing some different situations

689
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,960
that we have going on right now.

690
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,160
And I mean, I hope you really like hot dogs.

691
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,520
I mean, like you have to really, really, really love hot dogs

692
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,000
for this to make any kind of sense for you at all.

693
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,520
But the good news is, here's what you do.

694
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,800
You fly here, you land in probably Atlanta,

695
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,600
hit up that Nathan's hot dogs, get back on a plane,

696
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
go right back on home.

697
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
Get the, you gotta, you gotta go.

698
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,600
Hey, bring a Justin's size suitcase with you

699
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,000
and leave it unattended near my home.

700
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,640
You never know.

701
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,840
That'd be cool.

702
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,480
Pretty neat.

703
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,520
Swallow your boy out.

704
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,320
Please don't do that.

705
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,560
It's not, but it's not worth it.

706
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,320
Come on, let's go.

707
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,280
You'll get so sick.

708
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,480
Get on my back.

709
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
If you come here, you'll get so sick.

710
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,760
We're going, let's go.

711
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,360
Hey, gramps, get stamps.com.

712
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,640
Grandpas love stamps.

713
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,080
So what you just said, it's like their favorite thing.

714
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,880
No, but that's what I'm saying.

715
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
So they like, they're gramps

716
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,760
because they've always used analog stamps.

717
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,920
I'm talking about digital stamps.

718
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,440
Okay, cyber stamps.

719
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,120
Cyber stamps at stamps.com.

720
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,360
Well, you should have just said that.

721
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
Well, but now I'm worried

722
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
that there are cyber grandpas out there.

723
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,040
I am cyber grandpa.

724
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,840
I hope not.

725
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,960
Have my digital world as a new hit character.

726
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,040

Nope, residential surcharges.

731
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,160
Hey, what about a character named surcharges?

732
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,120
Is that anything?

733
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,920
That sucks too.

734
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Damn it.

735
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,120
Okay, simply use your computer

anywhere you want to send.

Once your mail is ready,

just leave it for your mail carrier,

741
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,480
schedule a pickup or drop it in a mailbox.

742
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
It's that simple.

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,360

Just go to stamps.com,

750
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

751
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,200
and type in my brother.

752
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,360
Go to stamps.com, enter my brother, hi, I'm surcharge.

753
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,240
And I'm cyber grandpa.

754
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,880
It's funny, man.

755
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,920
And we're in love.

756
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,060
All right.

757
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,920
And there's nothing you can do to stop that.

758
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
Beep boop, eat my digital worthers.

759
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,480
That is good, Trav, it felt good.

760
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I took that boy on a walk, it felt good.

761
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,200
Feels good.

762
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,040
You know what else feels good?

763
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,480
Entering in a promo code

764
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,560
when checking out on an internet website

765
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,200
and getting it right and getting money

766
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
off your purchase for it.

767
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,280
Because here's the thing,

768
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,400
whenever you don't have that code

769
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
and you see the field where it's like

770
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
punch in a code to save money,

771
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,240
you know if you don't know the code,

772
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,120
someone somewhere is saving money and you're not.

773
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,320
And that's not fair.

774
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,160
But Honey is the great equalizer

775
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,080
because it's a free browser extension

776
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,680
that just finds those fricking codes for you

777
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,440
while you're just shopping like normal.

778
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
There's a little button that says apply coupons

779
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
and if Honey can find a coupon,

780
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,560
it just beep boop boop boop.

781
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,380
Sunny!

782
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,200
And the prices go down.

783
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,520
They've been advertising with us for a while

784
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,600
and I have now, not an exaggeration,

785
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,440
saved like over $100 using Honey every time I shop.

786
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,480
It is a absolute grand slam fantastic addition

787
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,600
to your web browsing and web shopping experience.

788
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,160
You can get Honey for free at joinhoney.com

789
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,000
slash brother, that's joinhoney, H-O-N-E-Y,

790
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,800
not the stupid way Pooh Bear spells it.

791
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,520
Dot com.

792
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,280
Okay, the way we also spell it,

793
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,040
it's the way we also spell it.

794
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,520
What do you mean?

795
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
20honey, that's H-U-N-N-Y.

796
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,080
Oh, is it spelled like that?

797
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,920
For our thing?

798
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,880
I don't like that.

799
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,400
Anyway, go to joinhoney.com slash brother.

800
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,080
It's money, honey.

801
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,060
Nope.

802
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,740
Okay.

803
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:52,100
Let's see, guest, I want a munch.

804
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,600
Squad.

805
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,300
I want to munch.

806
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,800
Squad.

807
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,940
Welcome to Munch Squad.

808
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,980
It's a podcast within the podcast detailing the latest

809
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,820
and greatest in brand eating.

810
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,900
Rather than go back into the time machine,

811
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,700
I've got a trio of new small munch squad stories

812
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,260
to share with you.

813
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,760
Oh, God.

814
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,660
The first is not thematically tied to the other two,

815
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,020
but I did want to share it with you.

816
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,580
This is about Bang Energy.

817
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,820
About what?

818
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,380
And what's that?

819
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,180
Bang Energy.

820
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,900
It's an energy drink.

821
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,300
Okay.

822
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,260
They got a new flavor.

823
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,940
It's a mouthwatering, ultra delicious.

824
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,780
This is thanks to Katie Bello who sent this in.

825
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,300
Mouthwatering and ultra delicious Radical Skedaddle

826
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,220
by Bang Energy.

827
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,620
The name radical tells the story of this new flavor

828
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,660
is extraordinary while the skedaddle will literally

829
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,020
make your tongue rattle.

830
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,780
After simply skipping radical skedaddle,

831
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,700
you'll feel the vibes of beating drums,

832
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,180
electric guitars and rock music flowing through your brains

833
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,380
and pulsating through your veins.

834
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:51,880
What?

835
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,460
With the new Rad Scad flavor launch,

836
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,940
rock and roll was the goal and cutting edge nutrition

837
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,900
was the vision.

838
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,700
It's easy as fishing when ambition drives the mission.

839
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,740
Holy shit.

840
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,620
Jack O'Oak, Bang Energy CEO,

841
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,180
who seems to be in my humble amateur opinion.

842
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,980
I have no information about a bad person.

843
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,620
Seems to be a bad person.

844
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,140
Hey, just real quick.

845
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,060
I wanna get a quick poll of the three people on this call.

846
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,420
Do you think Bang Energy doesn't know

847
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,700
what the word skedaddle means?

848
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,580
Yeah, I think that that's fair.

849
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,940
Okay, because they're trying to spin it

850
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,140
like it's like rock and roll.

851
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,980
That's not at all what I get when I see like

852
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
maybe a little scamp whose baby-

853
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,260
Skedaddle makes your tongue rattle.

854
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,760
Okay.

855
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,620
Jack also said we don't make people want our products.

856
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
Bang Energy makes products people want.

857
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,260
Huh.

858
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,460
Bang, we don't make people-

859
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,180
It's interesting.

860
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,060
Bang, Bang Energy.

861
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,020
Anyway, that was wild.

862
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,860
Maybe that's why I've never heard of Bang Energy.

863
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,060
Okay, meat of the future.

864
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,620
KFC is 3D bioprinting nuggets in Russia.

865
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,120
Good.

866
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,220
Huh.

867
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,820
Just wanna share everybody with that.

868
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,660
It's a 3D meat of the future printing thing.

869
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,300
Project aims to create the world's first

870
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,060
laboratory produced chicken nuggets.

871
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,580
They'll be as close as possible

872
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,220
in both taste and appearance to the original KFC product

873
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,140
while being more environmentally friendly

874
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,660
to produce than the ordinary meat.

875
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,140
Badass.

876
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,820
Receiving a final product for testing

877
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,740
is already being planned for the fall of 2020 in Moscow.

878
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,580
This uses chicken cells and plant matter

879
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,580
to create lab-grown chicken nuggets.

880
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,020
Where do they get the chicken cells?

881
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,620
It doesn't harm chickens.

882
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,300
Chickens, I think, give them freely.

883
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,180
Maybe it's hair.

884
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,660
They have lots of cells.

885
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,300
Maybe it's beard.

886
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,500
They have so many cells.

887
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,860
Maybe it's beard trimmings.

888
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,420
Bio meat has the same micro elements as the original product

889
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,180
while excluding various additives

890
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,820
that are used in traditional farming and animal husbandry,

891
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,900
creating a cleaner final product.

892
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,620
Cell-based meat products are also more ethical.

893
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,500
The production process does not cause any harm to animals.

894
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,820
KFC remains committed to continuous improvement

895
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,180
animal welfare from the farm

896
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,660
through all aspects of our supply chain,

897
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,260
including raising, handling, transportation, processing.

898
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,660
Beheading is not listed there, but I'm assuming that's taken at face value.

899
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,980
At KFC, we're closely monitoring all the latest trends and innovations

900
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,380
that are doing our best to keep up with the times

901
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,300
by introducing advanced technologies to our restaurant networks.

902
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,980
So this is a race by KFC

903
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,220
to produce a more environmentally friendly chicken nugget

904
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,540
so we can all, you know...

905
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,420
Thank you to Caroline, by the way, for sending that one in.

906
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,260
So we can all enjoy, you know, a safer,

907
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,740
more sustainable chicken nugget.

908
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,780
We're working together.

909
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,540
And then to do that, a lot of work and energy is going into it

910
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,460
just to make it, you know, a little less of an impact on the planet.

911
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,260
I think that's cool.

912
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,860
I do think they're missing an opportunity

913
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,620
if they are 3D printing this stuff to make it in a way cooler shape.

914
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,780
Like, for instance, just one very, very, very long rope.

915
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,380
Like a long...

916
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,700
Like a chicken spindle.

917
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,580
I just want to...

918
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,980
I think it's great that they're putting all this effort

919
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,380
into a more sustainable product, more humane product

920
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,020
so we can all eat chicken and, you know, feel a little bit better about it.

921
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,260
There's one more story here I want to share from John.

922
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,420
Central Florida PDQ locations to offer milkshake on Monday

923
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,780
with blended chicken tenders.

924
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,740
Whoa!

925
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,820
On Monday only, guests can order their chicken tender handspun shake

926
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,060
which contains vanilla ice cream

927
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,780
and a whole chicken tender blended up inside of it.

928
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,500
Fucking in Russia, people are racing against the clock

929
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,900
to save our bedraggled planet

930
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,980
by coming up with plant-based 3D printed chicken tenders.

931
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,340
In Florida, they're fucking jamming them into blenders

932
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,980
almost as fast as they can produce them.

933
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,860
This is why we need sustainable chicken tenders

934
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,020
is because PDQ is fucking jamming them into blenders.

935
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,420
I consider myself a pretty with it, dude.

936
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
Is this a thing people were asking for?

937
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,620
I've never heard of this.

938
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,980
Like I've never heard of like,

939
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,420
oh man, you like that milkshake?

940
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,740
Well, you haven't really enjoyed it

941
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,740
till you've put a chicken tender in it.

942
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,660
Well, Trev, I'm glad you mentioned that.

943
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,420
PDQ's chief marketing officer said in this article,

944
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,220
our guests love our craveable fresh chicken tenders

945
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,540
and our delicious handspun shakes.

946
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,500
This shake combines the amazing flavors in both.

947
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,060
Oh boy, you motherfucker.

948
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,620
This reporter who gets bonus points,

949
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,180
bonus points to Dave Plotkin for asking the hard questions

950
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,620
is basically like, is it fucking whack?

951
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,300
Because it sounds whack.

952
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,220
It sounds absolutely terrible.

953
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:58,820
The quote that Dave got back was,

954
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,060
we have heard from our guests

955
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,940
that they love our hand-breaded chicken tenders

956
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,660
and they also love our handspun milkshakes.

957
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,180
So what better combination

958
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,460
to celebrate National Chicken Tender Day?

959
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,500
You mother, just, you can't, it's 3.99.

960
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,320
That's a good deal.

961
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,380
There's gonna be chunks in like,

962
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,900
what are you doing, are you doing straw?

963
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,380
That's the plan, bud.

964
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,340
Yeah, but I, is it a spoon thick?

965
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,900
Oh, there's another chicken tender on top.

966
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,580
Fuck.

967
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,220
Travis, who is this imaginary person

968
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,820
that you have breathed life into the ether

969
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,420
who says, yeah, let me get one of those,

970
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,300
I guess it's gonna be either a hamburger

971
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,980
or the chicken tender milkshake.

972
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,500
You know what, I'll do the chicken tender milkshake

973
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,700
and then gets it back to their table

974
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,140
and takes a big bite and is like,

975
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,460
hey, there's a chunk in this.

976
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,580
No, I'm not sending this chicken tender milkshake back.

977
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,780
No, I'm talking about just consumability, Griffin.

978
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,460
What is the method?

979
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,780
Because this would have to be spoon, right?

980
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,700
Because a chunk of chicken ain't going up a straw.

981
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,980
This is not a straw drink.

982
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,740
I assume it'll be placed at your tomb with you

983
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,340
like an Egyptian pharaoh's cats.

984
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,860
Dave writes, the small size of this monstrosity is 3.99

985
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,660
and the regular size is 5.29.

986
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,260
Now, Justin, was there a little editorializing in there?

987
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,100
No, I'm reading from Dave's story.

988
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,380
It's in orlandoweekly.com, find it.

989
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,220
The small size of this monstrosity is 3.99

990
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,380
and the regular size is 5.29

991
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,500
and there is no large

992
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,900
because there is truly no justice in this world.

993
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,740
Have we heard from Dave before?

994
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,420
I feel like we've heard from Dave before.

995
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,420
It's possible we've heard from Dave before.

996
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,620
I do like, I wish there was a large

997
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,980
because I like the person's like,

998
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,060
I'm going to order this and I'm going to commit.

999
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,260
Why don't you go ahead and put a biscuit

1000
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,660
and maybe some like solid sugar packets

1001
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,860
or whatever in there too.

1002
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,100
Just swirl it all up.

1003
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,620
Swirl it all up.

1004
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,660
Anyway, that's the much squad.

1005
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,420
Sorry to take up so much of your time with it this week

1006
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,660
but I just thought that those stories

1007
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,580
were a really nice pairing,

1008
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,540
almost as nice a pairing as handspun milkshakes

1009
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,740
and chicken tenders.

1010
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,420
Hey, real quick, can I tell folks at home

1011
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,780
about the Max Fun Drive?

1012
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,660
Yeah.

1013
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,140
Okay, I'm going to speed through this

1014
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,380
because I don't want to waste too much of your time, folks.

1015
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,820
Right foot in the door.

1016
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,580
This is the straight shit.

1017
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,100

00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,660
You get to pick yours.

1045
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,980
You decide which level you're comfortable with.

1046
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,660
Maybe you're already a member

1047
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,140
and you have come to depend more and more

1048
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,540
on Max Fun shows for entertainment,

1049
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,740
education or information or whatever, right?

1050
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,740
And you're ready to move up to the next level.

1051
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,340
You can do that at maximumfun.org slash manage.

1052
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,060
Maybe you are a big fan of Max Fun.

1053
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,420
You're already a Max Fun member.

1054
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,980
You want to be able to give more to the shows you love,

1055
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,940
but you aren't able to move to the next level.

1056
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,180
This year, we're offering a new thing called boosting

1057
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,900
where you can go to maximumfun.org slash manage

1058
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
and you're able to give a little bit more

1059
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,620
without having to move up to the next level, right?

1060
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,860
So you're able to support the art and artists you love

1061
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,340
without having to commit to a higher membership level.

1062
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,740
Now this won't qualify you for the rewards,

1063
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,660
but you'll have the reward of knowing

1064
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,820
that you gave more to the art and artists you love.

1065
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,860
If you're not able to give it all, we totally understand.

1066
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,340
Things are really, really uncertain out there.

1067
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,020
And you know, these are scary times.

1068
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,540
And if you aren't able to commit yourself

1069
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,700
to a monthly payment, we totally get it.

1070
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,500
You can still support the shows by sharing the link,

1071
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,060
maximumfun.org slash join,

1072
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,780
telling people why you love Max Fun shows,

1073
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,540
using the hashtag Max Fun Drive,

1074
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,340
sharing links to episodes, anything like that.

1075
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,780
And really just listening to our shows is a lot of support.

1076
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,140
So thank you so much for that.

1077
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,140
When you become a member or increase your membership,

1078
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,740
30% of what you are able to give goes to Max Fun

1079
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,980
to pay their staff, to keep the lights on,

1080
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,780
and to fund next year's Max Fun Drive.

1081
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,420
The rest goes to the shows you listen to.

1082
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,340
When you become a member or upgrade your membership,

1083
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,340
they will ask you what shows you listen to,

1084
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,860
and that's where your money goes.

1085
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,700
So you are directly supporting the art and artists you love.

1086
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,380
So one more time, those URLs are maximumfun.org slash join,

1087
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,700
and maximumfun.org slash manage.

1088
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,020
And if you're thinking about doing either one of those,

1089
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
we would ask that you go ahead and do it now

1090
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,980
before you forget.

1091
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,220
And if you're not able to, totally cool.

1092
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,140
That was so easy for me.

1093
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,060
I didn't have to say or do like anything.

1094
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,860
And that's just a service I offer.

1095
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,020
It was pretty rad, pretty righteous, and I do like it.

1096
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,900
I do appreciate it.

1097
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,740
Please go to maximumfun.org slash join.

1098
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,340
It would be really cool of you.

1099
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,100
Can I do a Yahoo?

1100
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,540
Yeah.

1101
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:35,940
Yeah.

1102
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,940
This one is sent in by Adrian Calz. Thank you, Adrian.

1103
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,820
It's from Yahoo Answers user Britt Britt, who asks,

1104
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,780
what is some advice you wish someone would have given you

1105
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,860
before starting your own clothing business?

1106
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,060
Oh, don't open that chest.

1107
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,860
It's cursed.

1108
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,820
I don't know how common.

1109
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,940
I went into great-grandma-ma's attic to look for clothes-

1110
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,580
For your business.

1111
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,140
Yeah, to look for clothes that I could sell.

1112
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,140
It was a consignment business, and I found-

1113
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,580
So you were robbing your grand,

1114
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,620
just to start from the beginning.

1115
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,140
Oh no, she's super dead.

1116
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,460
She's real dead.

1117
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,220
Just know what, I've been in the house for a while,

1118
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,860
and I was like, I know great-grandma-ma has some old clothes

1119
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,860
out there that I could sell for consignment.

1120
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,660
And so I went up there looking for clothes,

1121
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,540
and I found that old sailor's trunk.

1122
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,660
And I said, there's probably some cool old sailor clothes in there.

1123
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,460
And I opened it up.

1124
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,340
And first let me say,

1125
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,660
there were some cool old sailor clothes in there,

1126
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,540
but also a scary sailor ghost.

1127
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,780
And so I had to contend with that for a while.

1128
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,100
And eventually, the only way I could get him to leave me alone

1129
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
is I had to make him a silent partner in the business.

1130
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,740
And now he gets 50% of every t-shirt I sell.

1131
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,620
And that's really draining my profits, frankly.

1132
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,060
And my overhead is over my head, if you know what I mean.

1133
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,620
Did you think about putting him back in the trunk

1134
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,060
and dropping the trunk into the deep-

1135
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:55,700
I tried.

1136
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,980
... into the ocean, no?

1137
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,820
I tried, but it showed right back up in my living room.

1138
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,380
And then I burned it, and it was right back there.

1139
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,860
And I gave it to a friend, and it was right back there.

1140
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,220
And the only way I could get him to go away

1141
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,020
is the 50-50 partnership.

1142
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,520
Right.

1143
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,860
And the worst part is sometimes he does show up at the shop,

1144
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,260
and he tries to make interior decorating decisions.

1145
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,500
And he's like, I think that the pants rack

1146
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,620
would do better over there.

1147
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,420
And I'm like, fuck, Stuart, get out of here.

1148
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,460
He does have a good point.

1149
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,660
Listen, I know, but at that point, it's a thing.

1150
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,340
You know, I don't want to give in to him,

1151
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,060
because then it's going to make him feel entitled to come back.

1152
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,300
And he kind of bosses my employees around,

1153
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,980
and I don't care for it.

1154
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,980
I think that I wish somebody would have stopped me

1155
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,820
before I cut holes in the back of all the pants

1156
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,420
to make little holes that people could poop through

1157
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,660
so they don't have to pull their pants down in the toilet.

1158
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,180
But those were a hit for a while.

1159
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,340
For a while, but then it-

1160
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,780
I was psyched, Travis, the week that people started to post

1161
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,980
about that on TikTok.

1162
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,900
And they're like, you've got to get these butthole pants.

1163
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,620
And I was like, yes, I've made it.

1164
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,780
But then the following week, nobody came in,

1165
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,420
and I realized I was just sort of a novelty to them.

1166
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,100
What do you think changed?

1167
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,220
The pants, well, I guess they thought it was a joke,

1168
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,660
but jokes don't stay funny for very long.

1169
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,460
And then it was not even a practical thing

1170
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,100
that people wanted.

1171
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,460
So then I put patches on them, but the patches-

1172
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,580
Just regular bad pants?

1173
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,580
Now there's just bad pants with a patch on the back.

1174
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,860
I wish jokes stayed funny for longer

1175
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,580
so we didn't have to do this every week.

1176
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,340
Can you imagine how nice it would be

1177
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,540
if we could just say like,

1178
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,700
no, those other jokes are still funny.

1179
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,500
Yeah, those are the jokes.

1180
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,180
Go back and listen to them.

1181
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,780
They're still actually pretty funny.

1182
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,380
They're just a week old jokes.

1183
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,580
It's still pretty funny.

1184
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,540
Go back and listen to those again.

1185
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,580
I bet there are people on Earth

1186
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,620
who still haven't even heard them.

1187
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,060
That's possible.

1188
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,060
They're funny to them sharing their laughter.

1189
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,740
You know what I mean?

1190
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,540
What about you, Justin?

1191
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,140
What's something you wish that someone had told you

1192
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,740
before you opened your clothing business?

1193
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,580
That, hold on.

1194
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,080
Uh-huh.

1195
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,620
We've already done cursed pirate chest

1196
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,460
and we did butthole cutouts.

1197
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,180
You can do this.

1198
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,540
I tried to get the multi-scarf thing going.

1199
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,140
It was one scarf, but I pre-knitted them together

1200
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,700
to get that Johnny Depp, Steven Tyler look.

1201
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,200
Uh-huh.

1202
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,780
I did not appreciate three things.

1203
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,280
Okay.

1204
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,980
One, that look.

1205
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,620
One, that look would become unfavorable

1206
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,260
much quicker than anyone could have possibly imagined.

1207
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,940
Two, people like to mix and match their various scarves

1208
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,380
to create a new multi-scarf look every day.

1209
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,860
It's an expression of their own personality.

1210
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,500
I should have appreciated that and I didn't.

1211
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,980
Now, the third thing is crumbs.

1212
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,140
You know, you have separate scarves.

1213
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,140
You enjoy a Long John Silver's chicken tender meal,

1214
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,740
three pieces, two pieces.

1215
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,540
It doesn't matter.

1216
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,940
You start getting crumbs in there.

1217
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,420
If the scarf is all stitched together,

1218
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,660
if it's several scarves that have been merged,

1219
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,340
that's the problem.

1220
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,060
Now, you got birds.

1221
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,780
Now, you have a bird problem.

1222
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,620
That's what happened to Brenda Fricker.

1223
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,820
Everybody knows she had one of my multi-scarves.

1224
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,540
She ate the chicken.

1225
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,140
Yeah, the pigeons won't leave her alone.

1226
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,020
You get the fries in there.

1227
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,540
You get some of those crumblies, you know,

1228
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,540
where they've just fried the fat,

1229
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,260
like just to put some batter in there, you know?

1230
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,780
And the birds love the batter.

1231
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,340
They eat batter up and then they will pick you up

1232
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,540
and fly you away.

1233
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,900
I wish somebody also had told me

1234
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,860
that there already was a store called Lids.

1235
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:34,740
Yeah.

1236
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,460
Because I'm open.

1237
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,180
I paid all that money for a store at the mall called Lids.

1238
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,060
And then I made all my shirts that says,

1239
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,900
like, I'm a happy Lids employee

1240
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,340
that I made all the employees wear.

1241
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:50,740
And then I got a very terse email from the Lids owners

1242
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,620
of the real Lids.

1243
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,860
And they said, hey, you can't do that.

1244
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,740
And so I said, what else am I supposed to call it?

1245
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,420
What else am I supposed to call my shoe store?

1246
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,700
And they're like, you're what?

1247
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,020
And I was like, yeah, dummy.

1248
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,860
They're Lids for your feet.

1249
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,900
And then Griffin took the war to them.

1250
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,400
Yeah.

1251
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,700
You'll probably write about it in the paper,

1252
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,580
but Griffin went to the Lids when the store was empty

1253
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,900
and he threw a Molotov cocktail in there,

1254
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,220
except he messed it up and he didn't do it right.

1255
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,340
And there was somebody in there,

1256
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,220
but he didn't do the fire part right either.

1257
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,700
So it was just a broken pot on the floor.

1258
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,660
And it was just soda.

1259
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,500
It was just a bunch of cola.

1260
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,180
They made him come back and clean it up.

1261
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,380
And then they said, you did such a good job cleaning.

1262
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,500
Do you want a job here?

1263
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,260
And now Griffin works at Lids.

1264
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:36,580
Yeah.

1265
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,300
Well, no, he works at Lids in the mornings

1266
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,660
and then Lids in the evenings.

1267
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,140
Oh, I did have to change the name of my store

1268
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,980
and I did change it to Feet Lockers

1269
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,460
because it's like little prisons for your feet.

1270
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,780
I also decided like you're locking them up, you know?

1271
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,980
You know what I wish I'd known

1272
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,900
before I started my clothing business?

1273
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,620
I wish I'd known that people liked airbrush shirts

1274
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,180
made to order because I just made a whole bunch of them

1275
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,620
ahead of time that said like Deborah and Tommy

1276
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,740
together forever.

1277
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,580
And it just said that one thing, like a bunch, like a lot.

1278
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,620
I made like 600 shirts that just said Deborah and Tommy

1279
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,500
together forever.

1280
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,980
And it was T, it was the letter T and then the letter two

1281
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,620
and then gather and then it said F

1282
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,100
and then the number four and then ever.

1283
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,660
And people pointed out that that looked like together

1284
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,940
and for forever.

1285
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,620
Yeah, it wasn't good.

1286
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,460
I didn't even think about that.

1287
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,740
Well, and also I don't know anyone named Debbie or Tommy

1288
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,500
and I don't even know if they're together.

1289
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,220
Yeah, you were able to salvage a little bit of that though

1290
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,980
when you scratched out everything except Deborah

1291
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,420
and you did put in a sort of crude caricature of Ray Romano

1292
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,980
and you did add like eight more A's on the end of Deborah.

1293
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,580
And that's why I made my first million.

1294
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,780
Hey guys, hey gang, hey fam,

1295
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,460
I would wear the fuck out of that shirt.

1296
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,660
Picture of a caricature, fucking Ray Romano

1297
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,620
and it just says Deborah on top of it.

1298
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,220
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1299
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,260
Lock that up.

1300
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,020
Man, but here I go again.

1301
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,060
Fucking lids too.

1302
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,740
You can't just do that.

1303
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,540
Isn't it weird how the Calvin peeing on stuff took off

1304
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,980
but Ray Romano screaming Deborah never became

1305
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,820
like a thing you saw in the back of trucks

1306
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,420
and like ski news and stuff.

1307
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,140
Or all the ones of Ray Romano very realistically

1308
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,140
like photo realistic peeing and you see it from the front.

1309
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,740
So it's like coming at you.

1310
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,380
Yeah, or Ray Romano kneeling down before the cross.

1311
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,020
Ray Romano peeing on Peter Boyle.

1312
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,820
I wish that I have-

1313
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,740
Ray Romano kneeling at his wife's grave

1314
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,580
just saying Deborah, but in a sad way.

1315
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,460
Yeah.

1316
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,340
Deborah, period.

1317
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,860
He's in love with Deborah.

1318
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,540
I wish, I wish.

1319
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,020
What about the ones where there's like a bunch of E's

1320
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,140
instead of a bunch of A's?

1321
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,820
So he's just saying, Deborah.

1322
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,860
Deeb.

1323
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,700
I wish before I made my unlicensed Pickle Rick hot pants

1324
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,820
that I had Googled what that character looked like.

1325
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,700
It has a face, that's number one

1326
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,300
that I should have accounted for.

1327
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,060
Because right now I have a lot of shorts

1328
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,300
with Pickles with hands and feet and no face.

1329
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,580
And I can't convince people

1330
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,100
that they're this Pickle Rick they're all about.

1331
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,580
And also, Justin, you did kind of lay the letters out

1332
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,020
in the back so that a lot of them went into the butt crack.

1333
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,260
So when people wear it, it just looks like it says Pickick.

1334
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,700
Yeah, it's not good.

1335
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,820
That's not great.

1336
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,020
I really wish somebody would have told me

1337
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,820
to check the carning when I did establish Griffin's tank top

1338
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,740
so that it didn't look like I was trying to sell

1339
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,180
Griffin stank tops because those went over

1340
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,780
like a real lead balloon.

1341
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,140
I just wish people had told me how litigious Ray Romano was

1342
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,540
before I did all this branded content.

1343
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,980
Yeah, it's really important to him

1344
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,260
that people thinks his penis and wiener looks a certain way

1345
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,420
and they don't like it when you make a sticker of him.

1346
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,340
He also said he wanted to decide when Deborah died and how.

1347
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,140
Yeah.

1348
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,540
That wasn't really important to him for the character.

1349
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,500
If they ever get to make another season

1350
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,620
of Everybody Loves Raymond,

1351
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,500
most of it is going to be about how Deborah dies

1352
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,140
and how the character of Ray reacts to it.

1353
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,500
And let me tell you, he let me in on it.

1354
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,620
It's gruesome.

1355
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,380
Yeah, that sort of Damocles has been swinging over

1356
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,700
Patricia Heaton's head for some time now.

1357
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,940
And it's probably why she turned out the way she did.

1358
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,420
Well, Ray told me that he was kind of envisioning

1359
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,460
a spinoff series in which Ray became a mentalist like

1360
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,820
crime solver and there needed to be something

1361
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,180
that fueled him into that.

1362
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:35,700
And it did involve Deborah's gruesome, gruesome.

1363
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,660
What if instead the series, he had been the lead suspect

1364
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,500
and he had to find the person that did it

1365
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,020
and it was called Everybody Hunts Raymond.

1366
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,620
It's just all the different government agencies

1367
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,260
working together to bring down Raymond.

1368
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,460
You're a police officer.

1369
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,660
Tell us where your brother is.

1370
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,820
Yeah, it's led by his brother for reasons that are clear

1371
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,260
and by his stepfather for reasons that are not.

1372
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,700
Everybody loves Raymond's blood

1373
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,460
because within it lies the pathogen

1374
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,940
that will cure the world's ills.

1375
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:16,260
A bearded outdoorsman, Joel, has to lead his charge.

1376
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,460
Ray Romano through a zombie-infested wasteland

1377
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,860
because Ray Romano's blood may be the only hope

1378
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,780
humanity has for creating a vaccine to the zombie blood.

1379
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,700
And then I heard that in the fourth season

1380
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,020
of Everybody Loves Raymond, it was basically gonna be like

1381
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,700
no one had been pregnant for a long time

1382
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,700
but now Ray Romano was pregnant

1383
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,620
and they were gonna call it Children of Ray.

1384
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,060
And then it just seemed like he was just kind of doing

1385
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,940
what different like post-apocalyptic things.

1386
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,180
There was one where it was called Ray Box,

1387
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,620
where it's like, Ray's in that box.

1388
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,500
Don't look in that box.

1389
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,820
Did you see 28 Ray's later?

1390
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,300
Thank you so much for listening.

1391
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,500
The Walking Deb.

1392
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,860
Wait, the Walking Deb.

1393
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1394
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,660
Travis bursts into the door.

1395
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,060
Wait, you can't lock me out.

1396
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,820
The Walking Deb reopened.

1397
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,420
What about the day after Romano?

1398
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,220
Yeah, absolutely.

1399
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,780
Absolutely.

1400
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,860
Okay, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1401
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,980
We very much appreciate it.

1402
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,500
One more quick pitch.

1403
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,620
The Max Fund Drive is-

1404
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,540
For another Ray Romano show.

1405
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,860
For another Ray Romano show that I just came up with.

1406
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,820
That is gonna do it for us.

1407
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,380
But the Max Fund Drive will keep on going

1408
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,420
for a little bit longer.

1409
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,380
You're running out of time though

1410
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,500
to support the shows that you love.

1411
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,900
Maximumfund.org forward slash join

1412
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,260
is the address to do that.

1413
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,580
Remember, a $5 pledge gets you all the bonus content,

1414
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,620
which is great.

1415
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,740
$10 pledge, you get the enamel pin

1416
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,300
from whatever show that you choose.

1417
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,460
At $20 a month, if you can pledge that,

1418
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,900
gosh, we appreciate that.

1419
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,620
And we're gonna send you a Max Fund game pack

1420
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,620
with like dice and cards and stuff like that.

1421
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,100
Plus the pin and the bonus content.

1422
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,980
There's a beautiful camp mug at $35 a month.

1423
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,060
There's just a lot of great stuff.

1424
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,500
But the real thing is supporting the shows that you love.

1425
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,260
And if you can do it, we know it's a weird time,

1426
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,380
but if you can do that,

1427
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,100
it really would mean the world to us.

1428
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,660
We just really appreciate anything you can give.

1429
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,380

So thank you.

1434
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,180
Thank you to John Roderick and The Long Winters

1435
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:38,980
for these four theme songs.

1436
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,820
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed,

1437
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,580
an album that makes my life possible

1438
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,660
because I need that rock and roll in my veins.

1439
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,700
I do have a final Yahoo.

1440
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,060
This one was sent in by Emma Cant.

1441
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:49,780
Thank you, Emma.

1442
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,740
It's another anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

1443
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:00,660
This one was sent in by Bear who asks,

1444
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,460
how was the Golden Girls filmed

1445
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,420
in front of a live studio audience

1446
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,660
if it was filmed in a house?

1447
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,500
My name is Justin McElroy.

1448
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,540
I'm Travis McElroy.

1449
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1450
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,180
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1451
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,900
Kiss your dad.

1452
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:39,860
Square on the lips.
