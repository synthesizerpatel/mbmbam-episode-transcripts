1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Welcome, my brother, my brother, me. We're this week, we're, we just want to say we're sorry.

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,320
We want to kick off by making some corrections and some apologies.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,680
And some retractions.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,640
And some retractions.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Patently untrue stuff.

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Patently untrue things. I should say, this is my brother,

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
my brother, me and the advice show from the modern era.

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,840
And Benjamin Franklin, guys, wasn't a president.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,800
Nope, he was king.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,120
Apparently we said that in the last episode. He was king.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
Okay, see, I said that, but I said it as a goof.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,440
And I thought you guys would be like, that's Jay goofing again, and you call me on it.

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,440
But no dice, he just let it slide.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,120
And I didn't want to go back. I didn't want to pick up the trail and say, hey, hey.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,520
This thing I just said was a joke.

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
Remember that thing?

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
Let's, let's move on to the other big thing, which is Ewan McGregor.

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,080
He wasn't in Contagion, was he?

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,040
That was on us.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,080
That was, that one, that's, that was Paul Rudd.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Yep.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,040
No, that was, who's the other guy?

30
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,640
Evan McGregor.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,600
Jude Law.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
Jude Law. That was Jude Law.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
And you know what? I apologize to Ewan McGregor.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't apologize to Jude Law, because guess what?

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
Got a really fucked up grill still.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm sorry about Evan's grill.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,200
He's got a real jacked up tooth situation.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,080
I said last week that I cried during Katy Perry's firework.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,080
I just want to correct that.

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
It was Lady Gaga's Born This Way.

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh my god, how can you cry during that song?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,560
No, it wasn't.

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,200
How can you not just damn?

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
No, it was a happy cry. It was just epic.

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,880
Like, I was born this way as a full grown male.

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,200
Well, speaking of Gaga, she's got a new track,

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
sort of a country inspired joint.

48
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,240
That's the weirdest shit.

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
You and I.

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
So here's the weird thing about it.

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
The first 100 times I heard it, she sings about Nebraska.

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
Last night, I had a little wine.

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm driving home.

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,920
Uh oh.

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
No, I mean, I'm not driving home.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm sitting at home.

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,640
And that song comes on the radio,

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,360
except instead of Nebraska, she's talking about West Virginia.

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,720
What?

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Are, has this song been localized in other states?

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
Is this going on elsewhere?

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,320
You're telling me that there is a

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,240
fill in the blanks Lady Gaga song

65
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,560
that radio stations can change?

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes, this is what I'm saying.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Is it like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
West Virginia.

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,560
And Jesus Christ.

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
It's, yes.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
Like, West Virginia, West Virginia, I love you.

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
Like that.

73
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
I don't think this is going on in every state.

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,600
It's a very country inspired song.

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,040
I don't think she's somewhere like.

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
You're saying she hit the fucking Bible Belt

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
and then Nebraska also?

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah, yeah, this is what I'm saying to you.

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,520
That's the weirdest shit I've ever heard.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,360
If other people have heard this song,

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
here's what scares me the most.

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,440
There, maybe this like read geographically sensitive version.

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
Maybe some people have only gotten that version.

84
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,680
So there are people walking around right now thinking like,

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
ah, Lady Gaga, she really gets North Dakota.

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,000
You know, that same thing happened to John Denver

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
and fill in the blank Mountain Mama.

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah.

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
That was a weird song.

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
It sure was.

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,760
Florida.

92
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
It's New Jersey.

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
Look at those moms.

94
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,760
So the first version of the song you heard was Nebraska, right?

95
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,080
Yes.

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
And you heard that on the radio, I'm imagining.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm guessing you didn't pick up the CD.

98
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,920
Yeah, I didn't.

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,600
Does the album have 51 tracks on it, including DC?

100
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,960
Puerto Rico.

101
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,480
District of Columbia.

102
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,320
So you heard Nebraska on the radio.

103
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,640
How fucking dumb is that radio DJ?

104
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
How's that radio DJ like, where are we?

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,640
Somebody comes running down the hall, knocks on the window.

106
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,480
You played the Nebraska one.

107
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,080
Just fuck it, play Nebraska.

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,800
Close enough.

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
So bad.

110
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
I gotta hear this track.

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
Yeah, you gotta track it down and see if it's...

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,400
Yeah, I think if the original one is Nebraska,

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
I just listened to the CD version that I have stored in my heart.

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,480
And it is in fact, Nebraska.

115
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
Hey, let's move on to the advice.

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
My friend Kevin regularly drinks Smirnoff.

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
My leg is bleeding.

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,160
What's going on down there?

119
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
My friend Kevin regularly drinks Smirnoff.

120
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
Hold on, do you need a second?

121
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,960
I mean, it's like...

122
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
Did you stab yourself?

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
No, it's just like, I think the skin,

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
from where my muscles have stretched my calves.

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
The skin jumped off.

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
From being so diesel.

127
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
It's like paper thin down there.

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,920
It's like super muscly, but translucent.

129
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,880
It's like popping a balloon.

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
I look like someone on a Batman cartoon

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
that's been coated with mutagenic ooze.

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah, you'd be like Paperman, Tissue Man.

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Tissue Man.

134
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,240
Tissue Man's so strong, but he's so vulnerable.

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
But so tender.

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,640
My friend Kevin regularly drinks Smirnoff ice and not alone,

137
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,520
but in public and during social gatherings.

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
We all try to tell him it makes him look creepy

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,040
and like a pedophile, but all the laughs,

140
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,160
he hasn't curtailed his efforts or shamed of his poor taste.

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
I'm out of ideas for discouragement.

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
He's an avid listener like me.

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
Perhaps he will heed direct advice

144
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
from our favorite brothers, Smirnoff in St. Louis.

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Did this person write into us so that we would shame Kevin

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
into not drinking Smirnoff ice?

147
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,640
Because we can do that.

148
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm going to pause it, though, just real quick.

149
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,320
I think it's better that Kevin only drinks Smirnoff ice in public

150
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,080
because if he were a secret Smirnoff ice alcoholic,

151
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,320
that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

152
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
Guys, it's 11 o'clock.

153
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
I gotta go home and get smeared.

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
If he's just like sitting at home in the dark,

155
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,760
chugging Smirnoff ice.

156
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,760
Hello, Kevin?

157
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,080
Kevin, yeah, yeah.

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
What are you doing right now, Kevin?

159
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,320
Nothing.

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,320
Don't worry, Kevin, you smell like sugar.

161
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,520
Trust me, they've got this new cranberry fizzle spritz out

162
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
and it's so good.

163
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
I want to go out on a limb for Kev

164
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,600
and say that if that was really his favorite drink

165
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
and it just had a stigma attached to it,

166
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,480
I don't think I don't buy a drink stigma.

167
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I think you should be able to drink whatever you want.

168
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,960
But that drink has the most stigma on it, though.

169
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,280
Yeah.

170
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,000
No, Zima has the most stigma.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
But what I'm saying is that the problem I have with it

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,320
is that there are many better drinks.

173
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,400
Smirnoff ice is the grossest shit.

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
It's just really gross.

175
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
I don't understand being able to drink enough of them

176
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,800
to get drunk.

177
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Yeah, because you get so much, you get tummy rot

178
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,680
if you put too much, there's so much sugar.

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
It's basically like you took a beer

180
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,360
and then filled it with pixie sticks.

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,200
Yeah, you just put a bunch of sprees in there

182
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,080
and then all of a sudden-

183
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Disgusting.

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
I'll never forget there was a time me and my friends in college,

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,040
you know, we're hanging out watching a football game

186
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,120
baseball game, some kind of sports event,

187
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,600
and we had drank all the beer in the house

188
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,560
and there were three Smirnoff ices left over from some girls

189
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,320
that were there at the party the night before.

190
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,920
And we're like, well, this is all that's left.

191
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,680
And we each took one sip and vomited like right then.

192
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,160
No, okay.

193
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,720
Hold on.

194
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,760
I don't think that's stop.

195
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,880
Stop right there.

196
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,760
Absolutely true.

197
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,480
Did they maybe-

198
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,880
Was it the new Ipecac flavored Smirnoff ice?

199
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,280
It wasn't like an instant thing, but it's just-

200
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,040
As soon as it crossed your lips, like, no.

201
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,880
You and two friends were like, bros, let's do this.

202
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,080
Clink bottles.

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440
Everyone lifts the cups at the same time to their mouths

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,760
and it just suddenly the room is a soft film.

205
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,400
It's just coated in vomit.

206
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,280
I mean, more or less.

207
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,600
That might be colored by the fact that we've been drinking all day,

208
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,560
but I remember it clearly vomiting right away.

209
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,840
You're saying that smear before beer never fear.

210
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Beer before smear throw up everywhere forever.

211
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,200
Yeah.

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
Get the fuck out of that room.

213
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,880
Get out of the room.

214
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,920
Stop drinking it.

215
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,400
Like, there are many better things that you can enjoy.

216
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
The thing is you can have a whiskey sour.

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,000
You can have-

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,640
Yeah.

219
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
Like, there's so many-

220
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,160
Start there.

221
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,560
Yeah, start and then work your way up to like-

222
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,040
Even those can rust out your insides like battery acid.

223
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,960
You know what you should do?

224
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Like old fashions.

225
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,640
Oh, no.

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
I think this man wants a flavor sensation.

227
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
If that's the case, I'm going to suggest a seven and seven.

228
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
That is still my DOC to this day.

229
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh, what about a sweet tea vodka with a little bit of lemon?

230
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
That shit is delicious.

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,080
I just get a vodka gimlet like a boss.

232
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
That goes down smooth every time.

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,520
What about a-

234
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,960
What about a tulip?

235
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
Like, there's so many-

236
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,160
A tulip?

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,040
No one can make those.

238
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
There's so many options for you.

239
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
Straight up, don't order a tulip at a bar.

240
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
It's the most annoying drink.

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
It's like, hey, bartender.

242
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
Get out that mortar and pestle.

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,700
Yeah.

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,360
I want to-

245
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm ready for a project.

246
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,680
Let's get into a project together.

247
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
It's like making an album together.

248
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,880
Let's build a blanket.

249
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, we're looking for something.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
We, you know, project we work on together.

251
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,240
So we decided to make this mint julep.

252
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,440
I'm a girl.

253
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,680
Okay.

254
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,840
I've been dating a guy for a couple months and I really like him.

255
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,640
But he's four years younger than me and it shows.

256
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,840
I'm 24 and think of myself as a pretty laid back girlfriend.

257
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,080
Definitely not one of these overbearing types.

258
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,800
But anytime I try to have an adult conversation with him or ask him nicely to do something,

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
his temper goes wild and he thinks I'm attacking his character.

260
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,680
Even if it's something as small as, hey, could you please not walk in my flower beds?

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,520
Or will you rinse your spaghetti bowl out?

262
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,560
Spaghetti is a funny food.

263
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,000
He always has to be right about everything and he gets his front hiney hurt if he isn't.

264
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,920
Is this something he will grow out of or should I dump him?

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
Temper troubles in Dallas.

266
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,160
I don't think you're using that right.

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
I don't like his dick.

268
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
He gets his dick hurt.

269
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,800
He gets dick hurt.

270
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,560
How often is the problem arising of him walking in your flower beds?

271
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
I feel like that should be like a one time problem.

272
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
Hey, wait, are you dating a raccoon?

273
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,080
So you're saying that what she should start doing is just spraying him with the hose when

274
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
she gets in the flower bed, right?

275
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey, I'm just imagining some fucking bumpkin like wearing overalls and like stomping,

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
like marching in your flower bed while eating spaghetti and just like sloshing it around

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
everywhere and he's whistling a tune.

278
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
What an asshole.

279
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,120
You know, I don't think this has anything to do with him being younger.

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,680
I think maybe he's just kind of ill mannered.

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,960
I don't know why she's suddenly dating Boo Radley, but there you go.

282
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I have to imagine you have a cement path leading from your stairs to the sidewalk.

283
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,200
And does he just like does he take a fucking shortcut through the tulips?

284
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,920
What's he doing?

285
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,880
I don't.

286
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,560
Far be it from me to to pass judgment on anyone's relationship or character.

287
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,120
But that's what we do constantly on this show.

288
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,120
Yeah, but this is a serious one.

289
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,080
OK, should I break up with him or does he sound fixable to me?

290
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,840
You have great taste in podcast, if nothing else.

291
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,000
I you seem like a down girl.

292
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,840
I would not stick around with this dude.

293
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,680
He sounds he sounds like bad news.

294
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,720
How I I think what it is is you always got to give them the opportunity to improve and

295
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,360
she did.

296
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,960
But I'm saying like cutthroat ultimatum say that, hey, I'm sick of, you know, every time

297
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,120
I bring something up, you flying off the handle.

298
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
So either cut it out or this isn't going to work out.

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,080
Yeah, it's I think it's more of a problem that he gets angry when you say don't walk

300
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,960
in the flower bed.

301
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,640
Is he like, that's what I do in the flower bed whenever I want.

302
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm the flower bed guy.

303
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,880
Yeah, that's my bit.

304
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm going to eat that spaghetti later.

305
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,560
Like, no, you're not.

306
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,360
It's in the sink.

307
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,520
I have a pan on top of that bowl that had dirty eggs in it before.

308
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,840
You're not going to eat your dirty egg spaghetti.

309
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,120
So I say, yeah, call him out on it.

310
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,040
Yeah, but like, I don't know.

311
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,040
How much are you?

312
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,240
How much are you in a relationship, how much are you sort of required to clean out your

313
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
fucking spaghetti bowls?

314
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,480
No, deal with somebody who, you know, doesn't have their shit together.

315
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,760
I think that it is there somewhere is an equation of like an inverse property of like the amount

316
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,840
you you actually care about them.

317
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,160
The strength of your feelings for them is the amount of time you're willing to invest

318
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,520
into making it work.

319
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,920
Yeah.

320
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,040
And I'm not at all disparaging your feelings towards this person, but at some point the

321
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
balance shifts and you go, you know what?

322
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Now I'm just fucking fed up with it and I put too much work into this and I'm out.

323
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,000
You know what?

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
The reason he's so he gets so quick tempered about these things is because you're older

325
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,480
than him and he has sort of an inferiority thing going for him about that.

326
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,520
And so when you call him out for things like that, it's sort of you may not be meaning

327
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
to, but you sort of asserting your age over him.

328
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,440
And but I'm going to say this, though, if if he cares about you and you ask him to do

329
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,800
these seemingly simple things and he refuses to do them, he might not care about you in

330
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
the same way you care about him or he might not know what it means to care.

331
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
Because if you're saying, like, rinse out your bowl and he goes, doesn't go, OK, sweetie,

332
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,680
don't worry about it.

333
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,240
I got that.

334
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,080
Like, yeah, I think that a good compromise, maybe if you don't want to ditch the relationship

335
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,880
entirely, maybe don't live together.

336
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,240
I mean, if you're does it sound like they're living together now?

337
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,760
No, no, no, no.

338
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
Why is he eating spaghetti over at your place?

339
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,400
Go home and eat spaghetti.

340
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,240
Yeah, don't eat that here.

341
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
I got to say, a couple of months is not long enough for you to make the spaghetti jump.

342
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,240
No, no, you should not be cooking spaghetti for him at that point.

343
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
That's a sin.

344
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
It's a sin.

345
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,000
So I would just let him know that it's not that you're trying to change who he is or

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,480
anything.

347
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,160
You're just saying, hey, these are things that are kind of bugging me.

348
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,440
And if we want this to work out, I would really like it if you would, you know.

349
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,280
I think treat my shit better.

350
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,800
I think the definition of maturity in relationships is when you get to the point where you realize

351
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,040
that the whole point of being in one is so that someone can tell you how to live your

352
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,540
life.

353
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,000
I got to that point where I don't know what I'm doing.

354
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
Maybe someone else has it figured out.

355
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Because every so often Teresa will tell me something like, you know, you should hang

356
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,880
up your towel before you throw it in the dirty clothes.

357
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
And I'm like, wait, but it's dirty.

358
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
And she's like, yeah, but let it dry out and then it won't mildew.

359
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,960
And I'm like, it's like I've just learned some kind of, you know, like mathematical

360
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,360
property about the stars.

361
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,160
It's amazing.

362
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
Thank you for making me better.

363
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,720
How pants on head stupid do you have to be to walk through a flower bed?

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,280
Like that's like that's like the tantamount to like walking through a sandbox full of

365
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,920
light bulbs.

366
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,800
Like you don't do that.

367
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,680
They're delicate things.

368
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,960
It's something a five year old.

369
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
It's something that a toddler does.

370
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,280
A toddler.

371
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
Are you dating a toddler?

372
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
Are you dating a Chandler?

373
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,280
Cut him loose.

374
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,920
He's too tiny.

375
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
Let that salmon grow and then harvest him.

376
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
Chandler, I will smack that smirk right off of your face.

377
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,760
Clean that spaghetti out.

378
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Chandler come get your spaghetti ball you left in the flowers again, you pumpkin.

379
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,800
You're goofy.

380
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,400
You're a big goof.

381
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,960
I love you.

382
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,440
I'm sorry.

383
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,000
I love you.

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,960
Hey, Yahoo Answers.

385
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah.

386
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,800
This one.

387
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
So we learned it.

388
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,120
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

389
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,160
Thank you, Gali.

390
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marco, who asks girlfriend wants a lock of hair.

391
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,160
Where to get one?

392
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
I need a birthday gift for my girlfriend by January.

393
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,760
And she says that she will dump me if I can't find her a lock of Justin Bieber hair.

394
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,960
It costs $40,000 at auction.

395
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,360
And my only option to get a lock of the gold hair is to get a lock of the gold hair.

396
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:32,560
Is either to steal it from a museum, cut it off Justin Bieber, also risking serious legal

397
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,060
trouble.

398
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,560
Is there any way I can acquire that golden hair so that I can appease my girlfriend so

399
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,360
she doesn't dump me?

400
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:50,400
How about cut it off a Yorkshire Terrier and then say this is genuine Bieber fur or cut

401
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,680
off some of genuine's hair. What's he doing?

402
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,040
I was almost about to create another retraction for us where I would name an R&B song that

403
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,360
I'm positive genuine didn't sing.

404
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,200
And then we have a whole other situation on our hands.

406
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
What about this?

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,120
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

408
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,320
I thought you said Justin Long.

409
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,520
This is embarrassing. You're a PC and I'm embarrassed.

410
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,320
I think she's going to know, right?

411
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,960
She's going to know if you try to pull a fakie on her.

412
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,480
You got to get the real deal.

413
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
She knows what his hair smells like.

414
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,480
How can you?

415
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,520
I just watched a few weeks back the documentary Never Say Never, which no joke is a goddamn

416
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,240
revelation.

417
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,040
If you haven't seen it, Netflix it, do whatever you need to do to get your eyes on this movie

418
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,160
because it will make you look at this young ingenue in a whole new light.

419
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,560
But how do we get that hair off that sweet head?

420
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,400
Maybe just ask him.

421
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,120
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.

422
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,280
Did you was there a point of that digression other than you wanting to pimp Justin Bieber's

423
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
movies on our show?

424
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,920
I mean, I saw I saw.

425
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
You should check this shit.

426
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,760
This is a preface.

427
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
This is a preface to.

428
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
Sidebar.

429
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm saying he seems like a very nice young boy, and I think he likes to just pail around

430
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,600
with his friends.

431
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
He likes to run.

432
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
Oh, that's your that's your in.

433
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,200
You got to go to Manitoba or whatever Canadian province he lives in and you got to become

434
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,720
his bud and you got to like shoot hoops with him and like bro out.

435
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,160
Hey, Justin, who's this 36 year old do you're hanging out with?

436
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,560
I don't know.

437
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
He just wanted to shoot hoops and then he cut my hair.

438
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,560
I yeah, I hope this 36 year old man isn't dating somebody who wants a lock of Justin

439
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Bieber hair because that either means that she's an insane person or she's 14.

440
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,000
You realize that like that's how his like fan base works.

441
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,440
It jumps from like 16 year old to like 46 year old.

442
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,800
No, no, no, no, no.

443
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah.

444
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,040
The last Griffin 16 year old, 46 year old and Griffin.

445
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,800
About half of Justin Bieber's fan base, the last person they obsessed ever was Jonathan

446
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,680
Brandes from SeaQuest.

447
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,920
There's a big gap there.

448
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,080
He's the next best thing since River Phoenix.

449
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,560
He's like, he's like today's Rob Lowe.

450
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,520
No, I'm just kidding, ladies.

451
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,680
Rob Lowe is today's Rob Lowe.

452
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,080
Yeah, will he ever age?

453
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,400
Nope.

454
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,920
God, some of us are trying to live out here, Rob.

455
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,560
How do you expect us to be what we be when you're around?

456
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,880
How can we do what we do with Rob Lowe?

457
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,800
He's just out there fucking the curve up.

458
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
He makes it so hard.

459
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
In the documentary, it goes around a few concerts.

460
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Listen, I'm the one that's best fucking suited to answer this question.

461
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,200
So if you want to hate on me because I'm so well informed, then that's fine.

462
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,840
I can take it.

463
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,600
Every show he does, he brings on that special someone during his song.

464
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
I believe it's somebody to love.

465
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm not sure, but he brings a sweet, a special lady on stage.

466
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,200
And that special lady gets to sit in a chair while he dances around her and gives her flowers.

467
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,160
So you're going to have to find a lady that can get up on stage because that's the closest

468
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,760
you can get to Justin Bieber without like five layers of security guards between you.

469
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
It's a shame that he does it during that song,

470
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,600
as opposed to girl, hold these scissors while I stand real still.

471
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
Can you imagine if you leaned in to like snip off a lock of his hair

472
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,600
and he shook his head at an opportune time and he just blinded Justin Bieber?

473
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,880
Tragedy struck today.

474
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
Justin Bieber's new album is so edgy.

475
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
It's probably because of the iPads.

476
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,800
It's probably because of his Cybertronic eye.

477
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,560
What if you cut his hair and all of a sudden he starts singing like Carol Channing?

478
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,000
Turned out the whole time Samson like this part

479
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,280
and belt out those sweet melodies was up there the whole time.

480
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,040
I could see that.

481
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,880
And then the devil appears and says,

482
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
We had a deal, Bieber.

483
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
Now pull some up and drag him to hell.

484
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,600
And he's just dragged into like, you know, the cave of wonders and he's gone.

485
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,480
Make a deal with the devil for some of Justin Bieber's hair.

486
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
Like I feel like we're giving this guy so many options.

487
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,800
How much are we charging him?

488
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,840
You're saying he enters into a contract with Beelzebub?

489
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,520
You're saying he sells his soul?

490
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
It's important.

491
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,200
This is only if he accidentally cuts Justin Bieber's hair,

492
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,240
thereby nullifying the deal Justin Bieber made with the devil for his singing talent

493
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,480
and forcing the devil to drag Justin Bieber to hell.

494
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,880
At that point, Justin Bieber will be under the possession of Beelzebub.

495
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
So he can trade for Bieber's hair.

496
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
I mean, as long as we're shooting for the stars,

497
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,920
why isn't he trying to find like a being John Malkovich sized door

498
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,240
and climb into Justin Bieber's hair and mail some hair to himself?

499
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Plus his own hair off and mail- Travis, yes.

500
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,520
Come on.

501
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,080
I mean, come on.

502
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
Let's just jump the shark here and go for it.

503
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,960
We need to take-

504
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,840
That's a perfect idea.

505
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,200
We need to fucking occupy Justin Bieber.

506
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,760
Have you guys heard about that new protest?

507
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,120
Occupy Justin Bieber?

508
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
Yeah, it's all about just getting right in him.

509
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,560
You know, 99% of Justin Bieber is controlled by one Justin Bieber.

510
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,720
Yeah.

511
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,360
You know, the problem with the Justin Bieber door is that it's actually in Justin Bieber's house.

512
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
So good luck.

513
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,280
I mean, I watched the documentary.

514
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,640
I know where his house is.

515
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
Oh, we're doing this again?

516
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,000
Cool.

517
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,680
Let's just backtrack to talk about his film.

518
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,520
Are you guys pretending like you haven't seen it?

519
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
How many stars would you give it?

520
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,320
Out of how many stars?

521
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,600
Bieber.

522
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,880
On a scale of zero stars to Bieber, I would give it two Jonas Brothers.

523
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh.

524
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,720
Sounds fair.

525
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Yeah.

526
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,160
So not perfect, but not bad either.

527
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,840
It's informative as fuck.

528
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,240
And it's in 3D, which is great because they really don't take much time to-

529
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
They really don't pay much attention to the 3D aspect of the film,

530
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,120
except at the end when he does the song, never say never,

531
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,800
he does this whole pump up speech about how he came from nothing

532
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,440
and now he's this big, big star and anyone can do it and follow your dreams

533
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,000
and make sure that you never say never and the words never say never appear

534
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,280
like they fly into the screen in three dimensions.

535
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm so sad right now.

536
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,000
It's fucking incredible.

537
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
What's your favorite Justin Bieber song, Travis?

538
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
Shut up, Griffin.

539
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,440
What is it?

540
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
I don't know anything about Justin Bieber.

541
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
You don't know any of his songs?

542
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,280
No.

543
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,080
I feel like you're being-

544
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,960
He did Baby, right?

545
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,200
Yep.

546
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,680
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

547
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,120
Yeah, there are other words in it.

548
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,600
Just in-

549
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,000
What?

550
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
There are other words in it than that one, Justin?

551
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
Yes.

552
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,760
The only song I know is, I know that because it was on a commercial

553
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,720
about a Justin Bieber doll with real hair.

554
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,040
There it is.

555
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,400
Next best thing.

556
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,440
Yep.

557
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,040
Is this a real product or are you-

558
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,360
It is.

559
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,480
That is a real product.

560
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
It's a Justin Bieber doll and it's got real hair on it.

561
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,920
It can't be a real Justin Bieber.

562
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,560
I don't think it's real Justin Bieber hair, but it's like real hair from somebody.

563
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,920
Can you imagine Justin Bieber?

564
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,720
He's like got to take a month off his tour to become a hair farm.

565
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,240
I don't, I like cage free Bieber hair is what I prefer, I think.

566
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
He drinks freckle juice and it just all goes crazy.

567
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,640
Yeah.

568
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
He's got hair everywhere.

569
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Oh God, what a reference.

570
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,040
I know, be good.

571
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,120
Justin, what's your favorite Justin Bieber song?

572
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
My favorite Justin Bieber song?

573
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,700
Mm-hmm.

574
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,800
Don't say Baby because Travis already said that one.

575
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
No, I didn't say it was my favorite.

576
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
I said it was the only one I knew.

577
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,160
So your favorite then?

578
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,680
I think Pussy Control.

579
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,160
Okay.

580
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,680
His cover of Pussy Control.

581
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,400
Yeah, well, he wrote it, cover it with Prince.

582
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,600
I didn't know that.

583
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,660
Yeah.

584
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
I don't think Justin Bieber knows what a pussy is yet.

585
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,560
Have you seen his haircut?

586
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm pretty sure he's an expert on being a pussy.

587
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Oh Justin.

588
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,280
That wasn't on the show, right?

589
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,240
That's just rapping.

590
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm going to need, I'm going to need to form my brother, my brother and me, Justin Bieber

591
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,920
defense force.

592
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,320
Okay, that's cool.

593
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
We'll finally get some Travis here.

594
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
We'll finally get some Travis on Google.

595
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,040
Okay.

596
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,540
Hooray!

597
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,880
Finally get some Travis.

598
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Can we become the official Beebcast?

599
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Yeah, there's probably no other online resources dedicated to him preserving his memory.

600
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,040
He's pretty underground at this point.

601
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,240
I want to be the go-to internet destination for Justin Bieber goofs.

602
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:24,000
Can you create a groundswell grassroots Bieber fan club to support him so you can basically

603
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,240
be on, he's going to fall off in popularity and then there will be an inevitable resurgence.

604
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,640
Can you be the underground groundswell grassroots fan club for his inevitable resurgence?

605
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,360
Can you-

606
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,960
Let's start when, as soon as we're done with this episode, I will start the Occupy Bieber

607
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,520
hashtag.

608
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,360
I actually already used the Occupy Justin Bieber hashtag earlier in the week, so.

609
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,280
Under what pretense?

610
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,400
That if they wanted the Occupy Wall Street thing to call, to trend on Twitter, they should

611
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,680
call Occupy Justin Bieber.

612
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,640
Did you really say that?

613
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,920
Yeah.

614
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,640
That's crazy.

615
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,560
Yeah, check the hashtag.

616
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,520
It's crazy.

617
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,840
Hey, do you have any advice for coping with stress, how to make sure your relationship

618
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,920
stays strong during stressful times?

619
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,320
I just started law school and my girlfriend is in her last semester of undergrad, works

620
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
two jobs and is preparing for graduate school.

621
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,640
As should be playing, we both have lots of stress in our lives and sometimes it seems

622
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,200
overwhelming.

623
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,920
Haven't had a romantic date night in over a month.

624
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,000
Do you guys have any wisdom for keeping the spark alive during these rough times?

625
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,760
Stressed student in St. Louis.

626
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,680
I personally feel like the most important thing is to remember that they are not an

627
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,200
outlet for your stress.

628
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,080
They can be a sounding board for when you're having a bad day, but they are not the cause

629
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
of your stress and therefore you shouldn't unload it on them.

630
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,040
Or how do they get rid of it then?

631
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,680
How do they get through that?

632
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,840
You can talk to them about it, but I'm saying talking about it is different from snapping

633
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
at them and taking it out on them.

634
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,880
You know what I mean?

635
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,000
In my experience, my limited experience, the most important thing is boundaries.

636
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,480
When you're with the person, be with them 100%.

637
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
Because you could be surprised, even if you don't have time for a romantic date night,

638
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:20,960
you would be surprised at how much you can connect in a half hour of just exclusively

639
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,720
looking at each other, talking, not about work or anything else.

640
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,240
Not even eating.

641
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
Just doing exactly that.

642
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
Just mindless staring.

643
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,280
Yeah, just staring at each other.

644
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,880
Slack jawed.

645
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,760
Yeah, so when you're doing that, be doing that.

646
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
Don't try to be doing a bunch of other things.

647
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Put the phones away and just do that for a few minutes.

648
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,320
I would suggest that whenever you two do have free time to spend together, you relax and

649
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,640
just hang out together in a room with some good buds.

650
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Wink at the microphone.

651
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,120
Do you mean some of their friends?

652
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,160
I mean, if you're trying to get rid of some stress, maybe you should hang out with some

653
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,480
good buds.

654
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
Are you saying like their friend, Mary Jane?

655
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm saying like their friend, Toker Grace.

656
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm so confused.

657
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,880
Reefer Sutherland.

658
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,880
Okay, wait.

659
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm talking about that dank herb.

660
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,960
All right.

661
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm talking about that kind, that kind ganj.

662
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,520
You mean some of that Ashton Koosh.

663
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,200
Don't do that, though.

664
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,320
Wheat, marijuana, is that what you're talking about?

665
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
But don't do it.

666
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Don't do that.

667
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Don't do that.

668
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I said that.

669
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Maybe just get really drunk.

670
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I said that in remembrance of Goose.

671
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Hey, find some.

672
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,320
Just let me know where to buy it.

673
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Because I'm 30.

674
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I don't know.

675
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
And we are not cops.

676
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
We are not cops.

677
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
We're brothers.

678
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
We're brothers.

679
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,560
Because I am Johnny Cash over here.

680
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,320
I need some, I need some of that kind, kind herb.

681
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,520
I am George Joneson.

682
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,960
Shut up.

683
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,160
Hey, you know, if I'm going to buy all this weed,

684
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,120
I'm going to need some money.

685
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:34,880
Travis, who is this message for?

686
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,200
This message is for Rob Starbin.

687
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,600
All right, Rob Starbin.

688
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
Who is it from?

689
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,640
It's from Allegra, Alexis, Paige, Wes, and Brub.

690
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
You guys are excited.

691
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,120
Hey, happy 32nd birthday, Rob.

692
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,880
There's 10 exclamation points.

693
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,720
That's how it sounds.

694
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,160
Griffin, real quick, give me the highlights of Rob.

695
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
What's Rob into?

696
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
What's Rob all about?

697
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,160
I hear Rob's into video games and board games,

698
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,120
all kinds of games.

699
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,680
He's into cats, his cats specifically.

700
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,160
He likes the Mets.

701
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,160
He likes the Gamers with Jobs podcast and website.

702
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,760
It's a website too, right?

703
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,840
Sure, yeah.

704
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,280
He likes 80s music and, of course, my brother, my brother,

705
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,780
and me.

706
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,040
Thank you, Rob.

707
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,120
Rob sounds like a down guy.

708
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,000
You know what I like about Rob?

709
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,720
The many, many pronunciations you

710
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,800
can apply to his last name.

711
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,320
Yeah.

712
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,820
Starobin.

713
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,280
Starobin.

714
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
Starobin.

715
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
There's just so many options.

716
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
There's a lot of options.

717
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
Happy birthday, Rob.

718
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,560
I got to tell you guys, different ways

719
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,680
of pronouncing Starobin is going to be one of our classic bits.

720
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,600
Put it on the sample.

721
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,960
I think that's one people are really going to treasure.

722
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,080
It's like they're going to forget all about peepum stuff

723
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,120
and crocuswine.

724
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,160
Forget that or that.

725
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,760
Crocuswine.

726
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,960
And there was this one part where he said Starobin.

727
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,460
Ah!

728
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,520
It was awesome.

729
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,400
Rob Strusel, happy birthday, my friend.

730
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,120
Happy birthday, Sturmy.

731
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,240
If you want us to make fun of your last name,

732
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
get on the Jumbotron.

733
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,800
It's maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

734
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,880
Give us some money, and we'll give you some fame.

735
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,480
You know, I was a special present to Rob.

736
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
I wrote him a little something.

737
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,520
Fuck.

738
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,240
Really?

739
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
Are you doing this again?

740
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,320
I've written a madman for the people.

741
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,800
Oh, fuck.

742
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,640
No.

743
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:30,960
No.

744
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,480
Everybody seemed to like it so much last time.

745
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,760
Yeah.

746
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,240
Guess what?

747
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,120
I'm going to edit it right out of the show.

748
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
But I wanted to give the people what they want.

749
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
Is this what the people want?

750
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,280
Can we put up a fucking straw poll?

751
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,240
I feel like this is what the people, they crave.

752
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
They crave that crazy crunch.

753
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,840
I feel like people out there crave me and Griffin

754
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,320
being angry at you.

755
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,600
That's also possibly true.

756
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,400
Travis, the last time you did this, after I read the last one,

757
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,680
it was so bad that I almost got bone cancer.

758
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,640
That's bad.

759
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,200
He would have had to go get some of Bieber's marrow to cure him.

760
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,560
Is that what you want?

761
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,640
Sort of.

762
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,400
OK.

763
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,920
All right.

764
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, Travis, I'm not reading your stupid thing.

765
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,040
If it makes you guys feel better, I will read this one.

766
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,880
You're going to read it like a dummy, though.

767
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,960
No, I'm going to read it so good.

768
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
Do a good job.

769
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,000
You have a reading voice that makes you sound so precious.

770
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,160
Oh, thank you.

771
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,920
Like the movie?

772
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,600
OK, here we go.

773
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,120
Take it away, Gabriel.

774
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
It was a moist and stormy dongle.

775
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
The bulky maid was in the conservatory

776
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,160
with the thunderful botanist, playing the savory flugelhorn.

777
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,840
Suddenly, the cacophony was interrupted by the hullabaloo

778
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,040
of a chocolate wazoo.

779
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Corporal Buffalo, recently returned from his voluptuous tour

780
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,840
of the lumpy Madagascar, was flabbergasted.

781
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,920
He swung his girth around the unfathomable piano,

782
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,920
only to find that the rat king had been crunchetized.

783
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,600
Fiddlesticks yelled the corporal.

784
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,440
What humperdink has snogged my bountiful rat king?

785
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,480
Cool your paella, ricocheted Professor Pumbanickle.

786
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,760
Your hubris could outweigh Fraggle Rock.

787
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,800
Now stop being such a harbinger, and come

788
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,840
try these totes delicious crepes.

789
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,320
Excelsior decreed Madame Jambalaya,

790
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,120
and a moist time was had by all.

791
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
God damn it.

792
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,960
God damn it.

793
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,920
It's like watching a man die in front of me.

794
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,760
It's like watching a man bleed out.

795
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,360
It's like watching the last Native American bleed out

796
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,200
in front of me.

797
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,400
The last of his people, it's like watching

798
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
them die in front of me.

799
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,400
That's the level of sadness that your Mad Libs bring me.

800
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,520
God damn it.

801
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,320
Everybody else seemed to like it.

802
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
No, they didn't, Travis.

803
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,800
Stay.

804
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,000
No, they didn't.

805
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Travis, there's maybe this bit might

806
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,200
make the show friendly to four-year-olds

807
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,560
who find words like pumpernickel still amusing.

808
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
Travis, if those cheese eaters knew

809
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
what should be in a podcast, they'd

810
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
be making our goddamn podcast.

811
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,200
I don't know what should be in it.

812
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,600
I've read rat king, and Fraggle Rock, and crunchetized.

813
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
It makes the people happy.

814
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,320
Don't you say those fucking words again,

815
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,560
where I'm outlawing every word you just

816
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
said for this podcast forever.

817
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,120
You kill those words for me.

818
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,640
I can't say it was a moistened storm in the ongoing game.

819
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,720
Travis, I fucking, I will hang up on you.

820
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,200
There's nothing funny about it.

821
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,840
There's nothing funny about it.

822
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,640
You love it.

823
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,840
You love it so much.

824
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,280
It's the opposite of comedy.

825
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,880
I can feel my bones throbbing with cancer.

826
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,760
You know, it was a wise man who once

827
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,040
said that comedy is Mad Libs plus time.

828
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,200
So in like three weeks, you'll go back and listen to this,

829
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,800
and you will be laughing your balls off.

830
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,880
It's Mad Libs minus Mad Libs plus dick jokes.

831
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,400
Can we get back to our core competency?

832
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Yeah.

833
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,440
Sorry that we ruined your birthday, Rob.

834
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,920
Hey, Rob.

835
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,160
Happy birthday.

836
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,680
Happy unbirthday.

837
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,920
Happy birthday, Mr. Sterebe.

838
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm a mid-20s guy.

839
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,920
And lately, I've been thinking about getting manicured.

840
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,320
I keep hearing people talk about how relaxing they are

841
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
and how good they feel.

842
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,200
I know that some guys get them, but I just

843
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,240
can't quite bring myself to get one.

844
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,360
Is it worth the certain ridicule for my friends

845
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
to give this a shot?

846
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
Or will my man card be permanently in jeopardy

847
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,240
if I go through with it?

848
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,840
Man curious in the Midwest.

849
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,600
It's man.

850
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,440
I feel like let's make sure that we're not manicurious.

851
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,360
Not manicurious.

852
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,920
I say you do it.

853
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,400
Do it.

854
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,240
Go for it.

855
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,880
Treat yourself.

856
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,680
Hands up.

857
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
Hands up.

858
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,440
Who on this podcast has gotten a manicure before?

859
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:27,960
Hands up.

860
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,000
I have.

861
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,360
I have.

862
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,920
It's glorious.

863
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
It feels great, right?

864
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,960
It's like a massage for your cuticles.

865
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,160
Are you two fucking with me right now?

866
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,680
No.

867
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,080
Here's the thing about it.

868
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,160
I think that society needs to swing back to the 50s,

869
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,360
like this idea of when dudes were like suits and hats

870
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,240
all the time, classy as shit, and we

871
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,400
have turned into this grungy asshole world.

872
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,360
And I want to get back to you when

873
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,640
it was more respected that you took care of yourself.

874
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,800
Justin, have you ever known the thrill of having shiny

875
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,560
fingernails?

876
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,640
It's fucking exhilarating.

877
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,320
You feel like a new man.

878
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,600
It's a confidence builder.

879
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,720
You're like, yeah, I'm better than you because

880
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
of this thing I've done.

881
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,920
I don't think that's true.

882
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I don't have a problem with it if you guys want to do it.

883
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,200
I live in West Virginia.

884
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,760
I can't have shiny fingernails.

885
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,400
I'll be run out of town on a rail.

886
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,600
Shiny fingernails are like a flag that says,

887
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,280
I've risen above the rabble.

888
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,600
It is like shiny finger armor.

889
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,120
It is.

890
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,160
It's like shiny finger armor.

891
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,080
Nobody.

892
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,240
That keeps away the bad feelings.

893
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,680
I feel like if everyone got manicures,

894
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,920
then there wouldn't be such a there wouldn't be class warfare

895
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,680
going on right now.

896
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,280
Everyone would be upper class.

897
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, because we'd all be rich because we

898
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,080
could afford someone to walk.

899
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,640
That being said, really nails will make a really awkward

900
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,240
conversation is on the job site.

901
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Be like, hey, Frank, would you bring for lunch?

902
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,680
That's cool.

903
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,280
Cool.

904
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,360
Can I just say your fingernails look fabulous, delectable?

905
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,320
It feels great.

906
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,440
It looks great.

907
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,040
Do it.

908
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,520
Get it done.

909
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,600
Yeah, and if your friends give you shit,

910
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,840
just be like, hey, it's because I'm classier than you.

911
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Yeah, don't be jealous of my class.

912
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,440
There is something cool about a guy that can own that look.

913
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,040
Get a manicure and just own it.

914
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,880
Can I ask you guys seriously, what does a person

915
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,160
pay for something like that?

916
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,200
I got it done by a friend.

917
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,160
What does that pay?

918
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,680
What?

919
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,760
I got it done by a friend.

920
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,120
It wasn't a license to manicure it.

921
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,880
$30, $35.

922
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Fuck you.

923
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:23,880
What?

924
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
Yeah, but you get it done once.

925
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,520
And if you're going really nice,

926
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,720
you can get it done for like $20.

927
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,800
It's a luxury.

928
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,640
Yeah.

929
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,000
It's not something you get done like every day.

930
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,880
Do you get your shoes shined?

931
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,120
Do you get massages every day?

932
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
No, it's a luxury item.

933
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,280
Travis, have you ever turned a homeless person down

934
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,480
when they ask you for money?

935
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
Well, yeah, all the time.

936
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,880
OK, so next time you do that, I want

937
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,640
you to look them dead in the eye and say, sorry, bro.

938
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,400
Gotta have the shine.

939
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,440
Can you give that person $20 to rub a rough pad

940
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,680
over your fingernails until the grime comes off?

941
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
So you're saying that we need to mobilize our homeless

942
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
and make them like a manicure army.

943
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,680
That's exactly what I'm saying.

944
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,520
A mobile army of manicurists.

945
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,600
A mani-pedi.

946
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,440
Don't be afraid to be who you are.

947
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,760
If you're the kind of person that

948
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,400
wants to have beautiful, pristine fucking Geena Davis

949
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,240
hands, then you shouldn't be afraid to get those Geena Davis

950
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,040
hands.

951
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,080
You know what, Griffin?

952
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,000
I think you've reminded me of something.

953
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,720
It's a debate I've gone through with myself

954
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,800
for a long time about getting a motorcycle.

955
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
And I would love to be the type of person that

956
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,080
rides a motorcycle, but I often have to think,

957
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,600
am I the type of person that would like to ride a motorcycle,

958
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,920
or am I the type of person that should ride a motorcycle?

959
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,480
That's stupid.

960
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,960
I think, well, I think that's what you have to ask yourself

961
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,760
is, am I the type of person that thinks it might be fun

962
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,080
and weird, or am I the type of person that is a manicure

963
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,600
person?

964
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,440
Because if you are a manicure person,

965
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,600
your friends aren't going to give you shit about it.

966
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,080
If it is incongruous with your personality,

967
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,600
you're going to get shit about it.

968
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,080
Yeah, that's a fair point.

969
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,800
Have you built up enough of a persona

970
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,880
that you could carry that you could pull that off?

971
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,960
I think that's horse app.

972
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,200
I think you need to reinvent yourself as frequently

973
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,720
as you possibly can.

974
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,480
I think, guess what?

975
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,240
If you go get a medicare, if you go get a manicure,

976
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,880
and you love how it feels, and you say,

977
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,360
I'm going to keep doing this, then guess what?

978
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,080
You're the type of person who gets a manicure.

979
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,520
Don't be so insincere about it.

980
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm not saying not to do it.

981
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,200
I am saying that that is what makes people respond

982
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,800
to it in a mocking way, is that it's incongruous with you

983
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,920
or the image of you they have in their head.

984
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,720
Yeah, but that means that that person never

985
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,600
gets to do any new stuff if they're going to live

986
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,720
in fear of that perception.

987
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,920
No, I'm just saying be braced for that.

988
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,000
And that's why they're mocking you.

989
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,520
Well, yeah, I could tell this dude, if you go get a manicure,

990
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
people are going to make fun of you.

991
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,520
Yeah, for sure.

992
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,280
But what I'm saying is not because there's

993
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,360
anything wrong with it, but because they're

994
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,480
surprised by it.

995
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,360
It's like how some guys can wear a hat.

996
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,160
You're a hat guy or a manicure guy.

997
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,920
I get that.

998
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,400
I'm not sure you're right, but I certainly

999
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,320
understand what you're saying.

1000
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,880
I'm almost positive I'm right.

1001
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,120
Homework assignment for Justin.

1002
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,400
I want you to go get a manicure sometime this week.

1003
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,680
Yeah.

1004
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,920
I'm serious.

1005
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
I want you to know what it feels like.

1006
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,600
I'm going to do it because I have paint in my cuticles

1007
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,120
that I just cannot get out.

1008
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,080
Can I be honest with you?

1009
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,800
I'm kind of afraid that they'll make fun of the finger

1010
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
that the TV fell on.

1011
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,920
Oh.

1012
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,080
Don't worry about it.

1013
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,800
That's so weird.

1014
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,920
That's your special finger.

1015
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,160
That's your special spatula finger.

1016
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,040
OK, well, I'm just afraid they'll make fun of my deformity.

1017
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,080
Sweetheart, that's my favorite finger.

1018
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,680
I've been living my life with a handicapped for 20 years.

1019
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,000
Let me see it.

1020
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,520
Aw.

1021
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Here.

1022
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,360
Shut up.

1023
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,240
That's your lucky finger.

1024
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,120
It looks really bad.

1025
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,840
It looks stupid.

1026
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,520
No, it doesn't.

1027
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,080
It's just a little flat.

1028
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
They're going to hate it.

1029
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,200
No.

1030
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,640
No, that's your flat, Stanley finger.

1031
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,000
That's your flat, Stanley finger.

1032
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,880
I hate my finger.

1033
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,280
Then I hate them.

1034
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,200
It only has half a nail, and it has a big scar on the back.

1035
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,160
Who's my special guy?

1036
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,880
Terrible finger.

1037
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,520
That's why I can't play guitar very well.

1038
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,480
Who's my special guy?

1039
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,560
I guess I am.

1040
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,520
It's you.

1041
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,320
Griffin, will you read Yahoo and cheer me on?

1042
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,640
Manhole cover finger.

1043
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,720
OK.

1044
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,760
This Yahoo answer was also sent in by Galiayali.

1045
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,040
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Patrick, who asks,

1046
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,480
I have tiny nipples.

1047
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,840
How can I improve their size?

1048
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,280
He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.

1049
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,120
You go obvious.

1050
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,160
Tattoo.

1051
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
I get made fun of at school for the size of my nipples.

1052
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,640
Please help.

1053
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,160
Wait, what?

1054
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah.

1055
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,400
How often are you setting yourself up for that?

1056
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,880
Yeah.

1057
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,720
What's up, Skittle Nips?

1058
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,360
Yeah, does that happen like every day?

1059
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,960
I mean, where'd your nipples go?

1060
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,440
Sweet.

1061
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,960
Nice, bro.

1062
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,280
High five.

1063
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,760
To make it big, I mean, tattoo, there's the, the, uh.

1064
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,320
Are you saying tattoo bigger nipples on your nipples?

1065
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,960
Tattoo bigger nipples on your nipples.

1066
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,680
It won't fill them.

1067
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,600
Oh, that's my second areola.

1068
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,720
I have rings.

1069
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,280
What if you just went old fashioned

1070
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,240
and just went for, like, tassels?

1071
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,360
Oh, that's not bad.

1072
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,400
I like pasties, maybe.

1073
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,900
Yeah.

1074
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,000
Pasty, fake.

1075
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,120
Where do you buy, where do you buy fake nipple pasties at?

1076
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,400
Pasties that look like bigger nipples than the nipples you

1077
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,960
have.

1078
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,880
What about the, uh.

1079
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,760
Spencer's gifts?

1080
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,280
Always the junior contingency.

1081
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
Just get pregnant.

1082
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:06,980
Yeah.

1083
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,280
Does that make your, does that make your nipples bigger?

1084
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
Yeah, when you nurse.

1085
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,000
Makes them bigger.

1086
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,640
And from what I've heard, purple, so.

1087
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,800
Oh, man.

1088
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,480
I know.

1089
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,600
Yeah, it just ruins them.

1090
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,400
That whole situation's effed up.

1091
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,520
Yeah, it looks like a Coca-Cola faucet in there.

1092
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,120
It's disgusting.

1093
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,080
What does that even mean?

1094
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,880
Maybe just constantly give yourself purple nurples.

1095
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,120
Get someone to nurse on you, but you

1096
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,160
don't have to be pregnant.

1097
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,680
Can that just be a thing?

1098
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,160
Oh, so you're talking about nipple hickeys.

1099
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,660
Yeah.

1100
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,240
Oh, man.

1101
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,760
Are you sad now?

1102
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,680
I was sad before.

1103
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,960
Who's born this way, baby?

1104
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,560
Can we put these nipples in some sort of rack?

1105
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,920
Stretch them right out?

1106
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,080
So you're not talking about, like, size.

1107
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
You're talking about length.

1108
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,520
No, no, no, I'm saying side to side.

1109
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,400
Uh-huh.

1110
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,960
OK.

1111
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,200
Like a taffy-pulling machine.

1112
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,880
Yeah, some sort of taffy machine.

1113
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,380
Yeah.

1114
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,880
Yeah.

1115
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,380
Yeah.

1116
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,880
Sure.

1117
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,380
Yeah.

1118
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,800
Yeah, that's the one.

1119
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
That's the ticket?

1120
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,240
A taffy machine.

1121
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,800
How do you?

1122
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,960
This has to be an issue, right?

1123
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,680
Because this is not all nipples are made equal.

1124
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Some are weird.

1125
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,080
And it sounds like these are.

1126
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,520
If they're so small that people are making fun of them,

1127
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,800
we're talking about fucking dimes.

1128
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,920
We're talking about some miniscule nippies.

1129
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,760
What about just, like, the power of positive thinking?

1130
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,800
Mind over matter.

1131
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,080
Have you read The Secret?

1132
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,280
The Secret to Big Nipples.

1133
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,560
The Secret to Dilating Those Nips.

1134
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,020
There have to be some sort of drops

1135
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,100
you can put on there, right?

1136
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Some sort of salve.

1137
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,640
Yeah.

1138
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,360
Uh-huh.

1139
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,040
Yeah.

1140
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,280
Or salvia.

1141
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,600
Yeah.

1142
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,400
That smoke in that will make your nipples bigger.

1143
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,600
Scientifically proven.

1144
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:59,280
Hey, is it OK to bring reading material into a group restroom?

1145
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,040
Is it OK to bring a Kindle into any restroom, especially

1146
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,000
a group one?

1147
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,480
That's from Bored in the Bathroom.

1148
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,280
There's so many.

1149
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,080
Oh, that's easy.

1150
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,360
No and no.

1151
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,640
Well, there's so many questions here.

1152
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,560
The first being, what isn't a group restroom?

1153
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,040
Yeah.

1154
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,480
God, I would love a private restroom.

1155
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,160
This is Jeremy's bathroom.

1156
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,000
No one can come in here but Jeremy.

1157
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,040
You got a, like, fingerprint lock to get in?

1158
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,760
Yeah.

1159
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,120
Man, that would be fucking great, though, wouldn't it?

1160
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,760
That would be so good.

1161
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,440
I would also like to posit to go true to the name

1162
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,720
and have an actual group restroom.

1163
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,960
And I'm just like, everybody goes in at the same time.

1164
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,800
It's like, let's do this.

1165
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,160
Well, they-

1166
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,800
What are you reading?

1167
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,080
They have those, Travis.

1168
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,720
They have those.

1169
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,520
They're called restroom.

1170
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,360
No, I'm saying like, get rid of the walls and everything.

1171
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:47,920
Oh, you're talking-

1172
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,640
OK, you're a kind of open planet.

1173
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,440
That's just the worst thing I've ever heard.

1174
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Like, done by Frank Lloyd Wright, you know?

1175
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,760
This is my bathroom falling off.

1176
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,400
Frank Lloyd Wright was fucking nasty.

1177
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,360
Ba dum chh.

1178
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,160
I'm making some falling water over here.

1179
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,360
That was a Frank Lloyd Wright joke.

1180
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,880
You know, he actually built a house

1181
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,760
like that that was, like, based on a desert.

1182
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,680
And there were no walls and nothing separating,

1183
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,280
like, the kitchen and bedroom and bathroom.

1184
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,760
Yeah.

1185
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,120
Like, just wherever you were in the house,

1186
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,560
you could see every other part of the house.

1187
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,440
And I think that's gross.

1188
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,160
And the toilet was right in the middle of the living room

1189
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,480
because he was so fucking nasty.

1190
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,360
Mm-hmm.

1191
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,680
Frank Lloyd Wright, you dirty boy.

1192
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,280
Frank Lloyd Wright, you're wrong.

1193
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,000
Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy sounds like a pretty good hip hop name.

1194
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,440
Is there, like, Soulja Boy talent?

1195
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,640
Frank Lloyd Dirty Boy.

1196
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,720
It's got a good cadence to it.

1197
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,040
I'm not sure.

1198
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,200
I don't think there's a big problem with it.

1199
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,480
I think that if you are carrying a mag- like,

1200
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,560
let's say a magazine.

1201
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,080
If you're carrying a magazine, I think

1202
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,400
it's OK to have one in the bathroom.

1203
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,400
I don't think it's OK to be spotted carrying one

1204
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,800
to the bathroom.

1205
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,720
Yeah, I think it says too much, like, hey,

1206
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,760
I'm going to go settle in for a while.

1207
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,520
I'm getting cozy.

1208
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah.

1209
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah.

1210
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,320
If you need me for, like, the next 20 minutes,

1211
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,240
you know where I'll be.

1212
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,080
A Kindle, absolutely not.

1213
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,960
Because if you drop that between your legs,

1214
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,560
it electrifies the water, and the water might splash up

1215
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,200
and shock your gooch.

1216
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,080
Yeah.

1217
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,880
That's science.

1218
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,440
Science.

1219
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,600
That's scientific dispiration of electricity

1220
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,560
immersed in water splashed on gooch.

1221
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,640
The reason I would never use a Kindle in the bathroom

1222
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,960
is because you're paying a lot of money for that

1223
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,280
and for that service.

1224
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,800
And then that's always going to be your poop Kindle.

1225
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,760
I like to leave my iPhone 4 outside of the restroom

1226
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,000
whenever I use it.

1227
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You stay right here.

1228
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,200
I'll be right back.

1229
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,520
I don't let anybody steal you.

1230
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,120
Make sure you scream.

1231
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,600
Do not wander off.

1232
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,160
I don't know.

1233
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,040
I think that it's fine to bring material in, but I don't do.

1234
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,000
How much time are you spending in this bathroom?

1235
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,840
I don't do anything in the restroom.

1236
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,440
And let's try and keep this as not gross as possible.

1237
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,800
When I'm in the restroom, I'm doing restroom stuff,

1238
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,040
and I'm out.

1239
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,920
I don't bring my game boy in there.

1240
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,920
I don't bring my game boy.

1241
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,400
I don't have a Big John's bathroom buddy,

1242
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,560
or whatever it's called.

1243
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,320
I just get in there.

1244
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,880
I get it done, and then I leave, and I go do other things.

1245
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,560
Justin's laughing because Justin fucking posts up,

1246
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,760
like brings the TV in.

1247
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,080
Barricades the door.

1248
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,680
He's like, I'm watching Man Vs. Food.

1249
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,120
I can't leave, Middle Ep.

1250
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,760
I'm halfway through this through.

1251
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,080
What am I supposed to do?

1252
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,240
Man Vs. Food would be an ironic choice,

1253
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,960
because you're always just losing it at that point.

1254
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,640
God bless it.

1255
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,200
There should be a show called, Seriously, Man Vs. Food.

1256
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,400
That's just him on the restroom after he just

1257
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,680
ate 36 chili dogs.

1258
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,480
That's the thing.

1259
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,760
They never tell you about Man Vs. Food.

1260
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,960
In the end, the food always escapes the fight.

1261
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,360
And when it doesn't, God help us all.

1262
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,280
Can that show just be called, Food Vs. Man?

1263
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,160
Food strikes back.

1264
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,400
In other news, TV personality, Adam, what's his face,

1265
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,360
has died today.

1266
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,640
And in the challenge of Man Vs. Food, food is won.

1267
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,240
Yeah.

1268
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,360
He tried to eat all the spaghetti,

1269
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,200
and then on the terlet, he just died from it.

1270
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,880
I feel like, if I don't bring something into the bathroom,

1271
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,400
what I'm saying is, I really want

1272
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,680
to focus on what I'm doing.

1273
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,480
Yeah, you should.

1274
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,680
I'm going to focus on the sin.

1275
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,600
Yeah.

1276
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,160
How are you not like, buckling down, and just turning?

1277
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Get in, get out.

1278
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,880
What kind of dirty boys are you?

1279
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,040
I like to distract myself from that evil,

1280
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,560
and you guys like to really like, kick me with a pin.

1281
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,360
I run my bathroom time like a fucking pit crew.

1282
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,320
I am in and out.

1283
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,720
I got a stopwatch going, zzz, zzz, zzz, and I'm out.

1284
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,040
What happens down there?

1285
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,680
I don't know what kind of situation you have.

1286
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,120
It just doesn't happen, you know?

1287
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,720
You got to make it happen, and I can't.

1288
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,560
I feel like magazines are the epidurals of the bowel movement

1289
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,440
process.

1290
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,400
You need to make sure you're dilated comfortably.

1291
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,880
Right, exactly.

1292
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,460
You guys both work from home, though,

1293
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,680
so what you don't get is that moment when somebody walks

1294
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,880
up and grabs the doorknob.

1295
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,880
Oh, Travis, listen, we're on the same team here.

1296
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,120
Don't try and change my allegiance.

1297
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,200
I live in constant fear of that, even

1298
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,640
when I'm at home by myself.

1299
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,600
You know what the worst word in the English language

1300
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,600
is to say out loud?

1301
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,080
Occupied?

1302
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,000
Occupied, yeah.

1303
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,600
Because it always is said in fear.

1304
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,280
Please, no, my penis is out of everything.

1305
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,800
You would see everything if you came in here.

1306
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,360
And now you know that I was making deuce.

1307
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,240
Everything.

1308
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,160
And the worst is when that happens,

1309
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,440
and then they stay outside the door waiting for you

1310
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,840
to come out.

1311
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,320
And you have to quietly open the door and say.

1312
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,840
Can we agree that the proper etiquette, if you try a knob,

1313
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,640
and it is locked.

1314
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,960
You run away as fast as you can.

1315
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,560
I feel like it is your social responsibility,

1316
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,120
social contract, to not be in that person's field of view.

1317
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,000
They have to think it was a ghost or the wind.

1318
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
They cannot something must have fallen against the doorknob.

1319
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,960
I will sometimes go 30 feet away,

1320
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,880
wait till I hear the door open, and then re-approach.

1321
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,280
Just to say, I don't know.

1322
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,800
You flank it.

1323
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,880
You come in from the left.

1324
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,640
There was some real dickhead over here grabbing doorknobs.

1325
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,240
He ran away, twisting his mustache.

1326
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,680
You know, there was a moment when

1327
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,040
we were in Chicago for Griffin's birthday

1328
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,760
and doing the live show last year,

1329
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,840
where we went to that brunch place,

1330
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,000
and the men's restroom was occupied.

1331
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,680
And one of the hostesses was like,

1332
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,360
oh, you can just use the women's.

1333
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,440
And I was like, OK, because I felt pressured to do it.

1334
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,120
So I'm in the women's, and I'm using the bathroom.

1335
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,520
And somebody does the knob when I'm in the women's restroom.

1336
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,920
And so then I come out, and there

1337
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,000
is a lady standing there waiting to use the restroom.

1338
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,360
Travis, do you know where your folly was in there?

1339
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,840
When you went in the fucking women's restroom, what?

1340
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,520
The hostess told me to do it.

1341
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,960
Yeah, you should say, oh, thanks for the advice, hostess,

1342
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,760
fuck right off.

1343
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,240
I have my own restroom that I'm supposed to use.

1344
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,840
There are labels on these doors for a reason.

1345
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,920
What I find funny is that we live in fear of that,

1346
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,000
when the worst that will happen if somebody opens.

1347
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,960
If you somehow, if they get past the lock, which,

1348
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,480
let's be honest, sometimes they do.

1349
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,880
Sometimes you're dealing with a Danny Ocean out there

1350
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,160
that can get in the restroom.

1351
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,760
The worst that's going to happen is they look in.

1352
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,380
They see that you're in the restroom.

1353
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,220
They probably don't even hang out long enough

1354
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,720
to see your thighs.

1355
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,440
Oh, no, they close that door so quick, it's amazing.

1356
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,320
But it's like I live in fear of the fact

1357
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,920
that somebody's going to come in and be like,

1358
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,400
let me see your butthole.

1359
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,880
Spread your cheeks.

1360
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,320
Let me see everything.

1361
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,920
That's not, show your world to me.

1362
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,560
That's not going to, that just won't happen.

1363
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Get out of here, Dave Matthews.

1364
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,880
Let's be honest, though.

1365
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,200
Let's get real frank here.

1366
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,840
On those rare occasions when you do open the door on somebody

1367
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,200
using the bathroom because they forgot to shut it,

1368
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,920
isn't the thought that goes through your head, gotcha.

1369
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,360
Hey, gotcha.

1370
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,180
Seen it all.

1371
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,720
My thought is, well, now it's sad

1372
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,080
that I'll never be able to acknowledge

1373
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,120
their existence again.

1374
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,960
Yeah, well, we had a good run,

1375
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,360
but I can never see you again.

1376
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,120
Well, guess I got to quit this job.

1377
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,160
Bye, everybody.

1378
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,200
Bye, everybody.

1379
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,120
Ask Tom.

1380
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,920
Put me in my number two weeks notice.

1381
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,960
I want to hear Kevin's last question.

1382
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,160
But first, some quick housekeeping.

1383
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,280
We have forums.

1384
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,800
They're Maximumfun.org.

1385
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,120
You can contact us, M-B-M-B-A-M at Maximumfun.org.

1386
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,400
If you have a question, something you need advice on,

1387
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,000
we are there for you.

1388
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,680
We usually record Sunday mornings.

1389
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,480
So, you know, send them before that if that's when you need advice.

1390
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,080
We are talking about the Jumbotron, Maximumfun.org.

1391
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,880
We've got shirts there at Maximumfunstore.com.

1392
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,080
And if you keep an eye on that store,

1393
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,000
I heard here the next week or so,

1394
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,240
there may be a new M-B-M-B-A, I'm sure, for you to buy and enjoy.

1395
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,560
Ooh, that sounds nice.

1396
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,560
Maybe something related to America's favorite

1397
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,280
chicle based product.

1398
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,600
I don't know what you mean.

1399
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,760
Like chicle?

1400
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,640
Like chicle.

1401
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,680
Un chicle?

1402
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,880
Yeah, we got live show announcements coming soon.

1403
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,000
We're in the planning stages of four all across this great country of ours.

1404
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,920
So hopefully those will all come to fruition.

1405
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,040
We're talking about four shows before,

1406
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,040
but basically within the next nine months to a year.

1407
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:56,040
So we'll have some announcements about those soon.

1408
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,800
And Travis, you were talking about our thousandth tweet is coming up.

1409
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,240
Yeah, I think what it's going to be is we're going to keep an eye

1410
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,480
on the M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag

1411
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,560
and whoever can dig up the most obscure, funny quote

1412
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,000
that makes us really happy.

1413
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,800
You're going to be our one thousandth tweet.

1414
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,600
So we'll make sure to pimp your shit on our thousandth tweet.

1415
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,880
So start talking on Twitter as much as you can.

1416
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,000
We won't talk. Put it like that.

1417
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,520
No, yes.

1418
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,840
Yeah. And don't put it at us

1419
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,640
because then only people who listen see it.

1420
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,960
Share it. Share with the world.

1421
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,160
Just put that M-B-M-B-A-M hashtag in there.

1422
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,520
Speaking of, I want to give a big shout out to DuckLips513

1423
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,120
because basically everything she says is apparently about us or to us

1424
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,600
or like includes us as a thought.

1425
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,200
Everybody on the show that has been everybody on Twitter

1426
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,480
has been super generous as all radstronomical,

1427
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,920
miscrabble, ham doctors, ham doctors, box the stars.

1428
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,560
Daniel Huffman, of course, real Chase Fisher,

1429
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,720
who has been who has been working very hard

1430
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,080
for his particular shout out.

1431
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,800
And Croco Swine.

1432
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,800
Oh, my God. So much. So much Croco Swine art.

1433
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,920
An embarrassment of Croco Swine art.

1434
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
I love it all so much.

1435
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,080
Yeah, thank you to everybody who.

1436
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,720
I feel like he has what it takes to be the new mascot for something.

1437
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,120
Something.

1438
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,600
How about at corporate America?

1439
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
How about it?

1440
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,720
He's the 99 percent. Here's our first man.

1441
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,720
I want to thank.

1442
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,720
Croco Swine is your mascot.

1443
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,640
I want to thank Nick and Nicole, the hosts of Epic Bros Podcast

1444
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,960
for for having me on as a guest.

1445
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,240
I think that episode will be on Wednesday.

1446
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,960
If you want to hear me talk to Nick and Nicole, Epic Bros.

1447
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,000
Did it go good or was it weird?

1448
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,680
I mean, it was pretty weird.

1449
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,800
They asked me about like my sex, like my sex.

1450
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,760
Yeah, they asked me about the sex, how much I do.

1451
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,680
And it's like, guys, I don't I don't know you.

1452
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,120
So they're dirty birds over there that they are.

1453
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,320
Oh, Frank Lloyd Dirty Boys.

1454
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,240
I also want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinners

1455
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,760
for the use of our theme song.

1456
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,680
It's a departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1457
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,960
I got like 10 more people on Twitter today or this week who are like,

1458
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,040
man, I just started listening to Longwinners.

1459
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,640
It's so good. Yeah, guys, it's super good.

1460
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,280
No shit. No shit.

1461
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,920
Just listen to all their albums.

1462
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,520
It's fucking great.

1463
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
It's fucking great.

1464
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,440
Griffin, speaking of fucking great,

1465
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,200
I'm ready for that big last question. Sure.

1466
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,240
Thanks, everybody.

1467
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,280
This final question is sent in by Jacob Locker.

1468
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,480
Thanks, Jacob.

00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,040
It's by Yahoo!

1470
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,960
Instagram user Scroodle, who asks,

1471
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,320
How can we request a white waitress without offending anyone?

1472
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
I'm Justin McElroy.

1473
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,600

Griffin McElroy.

1475
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,760
You've been my brother, my brother and me.

1476
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,840
Kiss your dad.

1477
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,640
Who we're on the left.

1478
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,360
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1479
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,360
Keep your heart.

1480
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,520
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

1481
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
Keep your heart.

1482
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

These girls are smart.

1484

Play your part.
