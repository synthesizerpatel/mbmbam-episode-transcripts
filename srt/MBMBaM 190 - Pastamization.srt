1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm your babiest baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Look at all the stars!

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,880
Look at the stars! Look at the stars! The stars and the red carpet. In fact, this year,

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:12,400
the red carpet's in Biastin. Come on down to Biastin. Sorry, Biastin? For Oscars 2014 edition,

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:23,760
boy. Yeah, so it's Oscars time for the awards. Movies, let's celebrate them. Come on, movies

11
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,840
and their makers and the people who do them. I felt these dream weavers, these dream weavers,

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,000
magic makers, warlocks of celluloid. No one knows how movies are made. They squish it. They press,

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,720
the actors press up against the celluloid in the positions that they are supposed to be in,

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,880
and that's what a director does. How many of the Academy Award nominated pictures have you guys

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,000
seen and enjoyed? Okay, important real question. How many things is Thor 2 nominated for? Because

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,960
that was the only movie I saw in theaters this year. Wow, that bumps me out to a huge degree.

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,360
Listen, when you're talking about award shows, you get into a lot of opinion. So I think in order to

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,520
make our way through this conversation, we should start with just the facts. So for instance,

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,600
I'll start with Gravity's the only good movie that came out last year. Hachi-machi. Was it better

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,000
than Thor 2? It edged it out just barely. Oh, it was so close. Go down the list of all the other

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,360
films, and 12 Years a Slave, I don't know, some of those shots went on a little long.

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
Filomena, they don't explain what the title means ever in the movie.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,520
Wolf of Wall Street, ate too many breasts in that film.

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,720
He ate too many breasts? How many breasts did he eat? That's the thing, he goes mad with money

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
power. And he's just eating the breasts off women because he's a wolf. The Werewolf of Wall Street.

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Wait guys, hold on. This is going to be a thing. The weird thing about that movie is it didn't

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,240
have any wolves in it. And I think that's probably my biggest disappointment. I have my favorite

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,480
t-shirt that has a wolf on it. I was wearing it and I was ready. I told Sydney before, I thought

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,240
it was so funny. I said, I think this is going to be a howling good time. Then there was no wolves

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,240
and I was like, oh, okay. Kind of misleading. How long do we have to wait before we can do a remake?

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,200
With a wolf in it? Yeah. A wolf in a suit? We have to wait just long enough for wolves to evolve

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,800
where they will listen and do anything we say. Anything at all. Just do what we tell you to do,

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Wolf. Just fucking come on. White Fang. That was the only one and he wasn't even a wolf, was he?

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,240
No, he was like a husky, I think. Balto. That was an animated feature, wasn't it? Also not a wolf.

35
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Iron Will. Iron Fang? No, I think Iron Tooth. Okay. Snow Dogs. Snow Dogs. Okay. Snow Dogs

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:13,520
passed over again for any awards, any recognition. It's actually up for best makeup. Oh, okay. Good.

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,320
I thought. Well, they did a great job making that one dog look like Cooper Gooding Jr.

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,560
I thought Andy Serkis was so good as those wolves. As all the wolves. Movie Fever. We've got it.

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,520
Oscars coming up. Make sure you get your picks in to us when you're listening to this, which is the

40
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160
day after the Oscars. Just send us- So you should have a real advantage. Send 10 bucks in with your

41
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,320
ballot and we will have that. We'll just have it after that. We'll have that $10 and perfect.

42
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Thus completes the transaction. Thank you for the money in advance and to hold up our end of

43
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:02,560
the bargain, we're going to help you with some advice. I started attending marital arts classes.

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,720
How does it work? Grab your wife by the ankles and dip her head in paint. How does one wife?

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
I started attending martial arts classes for the first time a couple of years ago. I love it.

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,360
And in the last few months, I have finally started to feel as though I can really identify

47
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,120
as a martial artist. My problem is that it seems weird to talk about this hobby that involves

48
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,040
hurting people and or throwing them to the ground. Brothers, when, if ever, is it socially acceptable

49
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,680
to talk about martial arts? That's from White Belt in the Bible Belt, which is-

50
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
When you're getting mugged.

51
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,400
When you're good. Before you get mugged, preferably.

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,040
Well, how do you- Okay. The mugging interaction begins when somebody like pulls a knife or gun

53
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,720
or a sharp pocket. When you see someone that looks like a mugger.

54
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
Oh, great. This is great. So go ahead and list off-

55
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,720
You say sir or madam, because we're not sexist here.

56
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Travis, Justin, I want you to start listing off some characteristics of what muggers look like.

57
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,040
Begin.

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
A flat cap.

59
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
Begin and don't stop until I tell you to stop.

60
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay. They have a flat cap.

61
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,360
Terrific.

62
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,640
They have a grisly sort of like half beard. They have scars. They're holding a lead pipe.

63
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,400
They are very large, very rotund.

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
You could have just described like a construction worker or plumber.

65
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,640
They're kind of like a construction worker or plumber, but they have a

66
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,200
cigar stub and they call you Mac. They say, hey Mac.

67
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
You are just going down the line of-

68
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
Wait, are you talking about a mugger or someone who's trying to intimidate me for the mob?

69
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
Yeah, a little bit of- Yeah, it's all the same thing.

70
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,360
Okay.

71
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,560
But yeah, that's what a mugger looks like.

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,520
Wow. Okay.

73
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,240
My perfect mugger wears a black mask.

74
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,640
He's got a black and white striped shirt and maybe he's holding a gun

75
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
and like a bag with a money sign on it.

76
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,040
And he's got the ball and chain like around his ankle, right?

77
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Uh-huh. That's my ideal mugger.

78
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,200
And maybe he's like in the process of like running away, but he's frozen in place and

79
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,760
there's a little dust cloud coming out from behind him.

80
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,920
Yeah. Griffin, who's your ideal mugger?

81
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,120
I would just, I would have to say Bradley Whitford.

82
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
Yeah. It seems like you could talk to him, you know?

83
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah.

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,320
And you know he's just doing it to like support his family?

85
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,680
Sure. No, he has his reasons.

86
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
There's probably a stigma about adults just getting into martial arts.

87
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,320
Like don't get me wrong, if you are like an adult who is already sick at martial arts,

88
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,880
that's pretty fucking cool. Tony Jaa, what's up Tony Jaa?

89
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,600
I don't think that it is just relegated to martial arts.

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Cause I think that's true of like, if you were an adult who was just getting into skateboarding,

91
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,040
like if you're Tony Hawk, you're awesome. If you're like 35 year old dude who's like,

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm going to try skateboarding for the first time.

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,360
Sure.

94
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
You're going to have to do that in private for a while.

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,240
Or if you're like, I'm going to take up break dancing. You know what I mean?

96
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
Have we had this conversation before? I'm getting the weirdest deja vu right now.

97
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,920
No, it's because Travis and I had to talk you out of beginning to take Muay Thai classes.

98
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Uh, I, well, I, I, I saw the raid and I really want to get into Indonesian martial arts.

99
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
I don't think that that's so wrong.

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
Why wouldn't you?

101
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
It's a weird scene because I have,

102
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,200
I have a lot of questions about how adults start getting into martial arts.

103
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,120
And question number one, is there an adults only martial arts class?

104
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,240
Because if not, that's not especially fair. Like, come here, you 12 year old little sweaty fuck.

105
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,760
It seems like it would really give you an overinflated sense of your abilities.

106
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
Yeah. Yeah. Except for three ninjas. Hi. That exists.

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,280
Shit. You're right.

108
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,200
So I don't think it's that big of an advantage.

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
Three ninjas versus three Tony Jaws. Go.

110
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
Tony Jaws because he's a robot.

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
He's yeah. He's the strongest man on earth.

112
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
So was the youngest three ninja.

113
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,080
That's damn it. You're right.

114
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,960
They don't make his, they don't make his that cute. I mean, they do make them.

115
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,040
They manufacture them in Hollywood.

116
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,160
What do you guys think that Rocky Colt and Tom Tom are doing at this moment?

117
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,660
Yeah.

118
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
Searching Wikipedia for the names of the three ninjas, I would assume.

119
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
No, I knew that off the top of my head.

120
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:22,240
I think that it's not that it's weird so much as I don't think anybody gives a shit.

121
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,560
And it's not just martial arts. I just don't think that anybody wants to know about like,

122
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,240
you don't, nobody wants to hear about what's going on in your life.

123
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
They want to talk about themselves.

124
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,760
No, the appropriate time to answer the question,

125
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,720
the appropriate time to bring it up is when someone asks.

126
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Yeah. Or in conversation, if someone starts talking about martial arts,

127
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,360
then I think it's okay to lean into it there.

128
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
But how often does that, that guy's going to be like, oh my God, thank God.

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
Oh man, I've been wanting to talk to you about this for a while.

130
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,960
Holding his breath for the last like five minutes

131
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,200
as they slowly started talking about hobbies.

132
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
I mean, does anyone kick for a hobby?

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
I mean, if you're doing it so you can tell people that you're doing it,

134
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,280
then you're doing it for the wrong reasons.

135
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,560
I think you're doing it for yourself.

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,440
So to bring yourself peace of mind and maybe a little physical fitness.

137
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,400
And in that context, you know, you can keep it to yourself.

138
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
It doesn't need to be anybody else's.

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
But Justin, let me counterpoint. I'm sorry to interrupt,

140
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,720
but if it's something that he's just started doing and he's really excited about,

141
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
of course he wants to share it with people

142
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
because it's something new and exciting in his life.

143
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
I don't think he's necessarily doing it to tell people about it

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,080
so much as it is an awesome new thing that he's like,

145
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,640
guys, I'm doing this and it makes me totally happy.

146
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
Moreover, Justin, let's go down the line of all the hobbies

147
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,960
that I know that you have picked up in the past year.

148
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Fuchigi, juicing.

149
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Correct.

150
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,520
Amateur beer brewing.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Gone on that for a bit.

152
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,560
Now Griffin-

153
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
Where was geocaching in there?

154
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,480
Geocaching.

155
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Geocaching.

156
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
Now let me twist this back around on you, right?

157
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
If I had not talked about that, would you have had that list to throw in my face?

158
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
I believe my point is made.

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm saying the only point I'm trying to make is that there is definitely a stigma to adults

160
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,480
just getting into-

161
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,520
If next time we're all three in town and dad's like,

162
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,120
oh boys, I meant to tell you that I'm a brown belt in Taekwondo.

163
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
We would be like, hey pops, that's fucking crazy.

164
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,280
And then he would throw us across the room.

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,880
Yeah, he would use our own weight against us, like water.

166
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Our dad is like water.

167
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,960
He's the water, water avatar.

168
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,360
What's the, what's they call them in water avatar?

169
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
An avatar is a water man.

170
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,840
He uses a water and he bends it.

171
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
You guys want Yahoo?

172
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,240
Yes.

173
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,640
I don't think you really do.

174
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,680
I do.

175
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,360
I do, I do.

176
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,480
This Yahoo was sent in by Joe Smith.

177
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
Thanks Joe, it's by Yahoo answers user poncho crook who asks,

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,240
how long will the people at Olive Garden grate your cheese or ground your pepper?

179
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
They say, say when, if you want them to stop grinding your pepper,

180
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
what happens if you never say when?

181
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,560
You own them.

182
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,440
You own the Olive Garden?

183
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
They have to just stay with you the whole time in your life.

184
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,400
It's a life bond.

185
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,680
You just carry the bowl with you.

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,800
I mean, they'll run out-

187
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,080
It's a life debt?

188
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,480
Yeah.

189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,080
It's not infinite cheese, right?

190
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
As much as that, don't get me wrong, that's the dream.

191
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,120
Well, you have to tell them to do it super slowly.

192
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,200
Not so fast.

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
What's your rush?

194
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,040
How will I know when to say when?

195
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
Where's the fire?

196
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,560
Hey Daniel, where's the fire?

197
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,640
And occasionally you gotta say, you're doing a great job.

198
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
One flake at a time, my man.

199
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,840
Does anybody else get super stressed out in this situation?

200
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Yeah.

201
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,720
You're worried about how much cheese and or pepper is gonna optimize this pasta for me?

202
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Cause I'm all about pasta optimization.

203
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,160
But also how much is too much pasta-mization that the Olive Garden employee,

204
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,800
I just call it the garden, that this garden cheese jockey is gonna be like,

205
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,800
oh Jesus dude, like save some for the future.

206
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,240
I think you're always, in my mind, I'm always weighing my desire for parm

207
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
versus the judgment of the cheese jockey.

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So in my head, I mean, I may look calm, collected, ready to get into some Alfredo,

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
but in my head I'm thinking, no whammies, no whammies, no whammies, stop.

210
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
But what if you say stop too soon?

211
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
He's like, oh, that's it, huh?

212
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,960
Well, that's not gonna optimize the pasta, but okay, bye forever.

213
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,480
I mean, the dream is always that when you say when,

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,720
lights start flashing and balloons fall from the ceiling and come out like, you've done it.

215
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,280
You did it.

216
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,840
You were the first person to solve the pasta.

217
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,080
To the nanosecond.

218
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,040
You got it right.

219
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,520
That is a weird-

220
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,800
You are the chosen one.

221
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
That is a weird point, right?

222
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,840
At some point during the Olive Garden experience,

223
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,520
they have decided to pass the reins on to me.

224
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,200
You finished cooking this.

225
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
You have been the pasta expert.

226
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
You've been the midwife of this pasta experience from conception

227
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,760
and now here at the very end, right before delivery, you're asking me to take the reins.

228
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
That's pretty experienced though.

229
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,240
You get to run it in the extra half a yard into the pasta end zone.

230
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,880
I'll go into the flavor end zone.

231
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,200
I'll take it the last few yards.

232
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
Well, they know that you need it.

233
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,040
You haven't got a lot going on right now and you haven't had a lot to celebrate

234
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
and they're like, I'm gonna let him have this.

235
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,200
And maybe you just need to impress your friends.

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,120
Like, oh man, did you see how much pepper Ron put on his pasta?

237
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
That was like to the flake, the perfect amount.

238
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
I wanna blow this out.

239
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,280
I think that they shouldn't stop at cheese.

240
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,520
I think they should basically come to your table

241
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,280
with a pot of stewed tomatoes and pasta uncooked

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,400
and then they walk you through each step of the experience.

243
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,080
Okay, we're getting towards al dente.

244
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,880
You want me to pop that out or just a little bit perfect?

245
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
Like have a carpenter there going, how tall do you want your table?

246
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
Say when, how wide should the chair be?

247
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,600
Say when.

248
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
Can they make a Top Chef season that is just this?

249
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,640
Like for today's quick fire challenge,

250
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,520
we're gonna put some sprinkles on the ice cream.

251
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Go for it.

252
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,400
Too many sprinkles, Danielle.

253
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,120
Nice try.

254
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,880
No.

255
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
I would love it if after you said when,

256
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,280
the waiter just leaned over and quietly but derisively said, you ruined it.

257
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,200
Or helpfully was like, hey man, I'm gonna give you a mulligan,

258
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,080
but you're gonna wanna go like a few seconds richer on this cheese.

259
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,360
I don't wanna tell you how to optimize your cheese game.

260
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,320
I don't think anyone saw you fuck up so bad just now.

261
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
So I'm just gonna lean back and I'm gonna start going again

262
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,040
and we're gonna pretend like this never happened, okay?

263
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,200
I think if I were a cheese jockey,

264
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,280
I would really employ the phrase, are you sure a lot?

265
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,640
When, are you sure?

266
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,640
Is that really all you want?

267
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,880
You want a mound of pepper.

268
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,280
There is a soft mound.

269
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,360
I guarantee there is another Olive Garden vet listening to this

270
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,960
who has had to pull the emergency brake

271
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,400
and just say like, that's enough cheese.

272
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,880
Did you, was that, you were a line cook, right?

273
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,920
That was, yes.

274
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,840
I never made it out to the big show.

275
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,480
You pre-cheese.

276
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,280
You were in charge of the pre-pro on that cheese.

277
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,560
Yeah, I don't know why at some point it got taken away from me,

278
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,640
the professional chef, and got handed over to the waiter.

279
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,920
Like they're gonna kibitz that last bit.

280
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,280
I just don't, I don't appreciate it.

281
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,880
What if that's not like,

282
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
what if the line cook has no idea that that's happening

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
and just somewhere along the lines,

284
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Olive Garden like upper management was like,

285
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
they're not putting enough cheese and pepper on this.

286
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,520
Let's put it in the hands of the waiter.

287
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:53,760
Yeah.

288
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
Don't tell them though.

289
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,920
Don't tell the line cooks.

290
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,120
You're saying that somewhere in the Olive Garden chain,

291
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
there's a line chef that nobody wanted to fuck with.

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Yeah.

293
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
I cannot have another conversation with that man.

294
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,120
Listen, we'll just take care of it afterwards.

295
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,680
We'll post game it.

296
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
It'll be fine.

297
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,680
We'll fix it in post.

298
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,440
I don't think that they would,

299
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
I mean, they would probably,

300
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,480
they would probably stop at some point and sort of force you.

301
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,080
I think the inertia has to go back to them at some point

302
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,360
where they would stop at some place that felt natural

303
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
and then sort of ask you like,

304
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
are you sure?

305
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,000
Like they make you say it.

306
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
Are you fucking with me?

307
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,280
Are you sure?

308
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
This entire restaurant is full of pepper.

309
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,640
Like every square inch of it is pepper now.

310
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,520
Are you sure?

311
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
Your table mates have left.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
Your bowl has broken under the weight of all this pepper.

313
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,440
Are you sure about this?

314
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
How great would it be if while they're grinding the Parmesan,

315
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,760
you open up a little baggie underneath the grinder

316
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,840
to keep going?

317
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,600
This is for Yeater.

318
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,000
Say that.

319
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
This is for Yeater.

320
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,040
Why would you say Yeater?

321
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,720
I want it Yeater.

322
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,440
Okay.

323
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,120
More Parmy peas.

324
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,680
I'll say you're dressed like an adult teen baby.

325
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,880
Oh boy.

326
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
Cheese me peas.

327
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
Next, next question.

328
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,200
Peas.

329
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,440
When he stopped and you look at him

330
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,600
and you say right to his face,

331
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
got any more cheese?

332
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,840
And only then does he realize he was dressed like Steve Urkel.

333
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,200
Oh man.

334
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,800
How embarrassing for him.

335
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
Not for you at all.

336
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,400
Not embarrassing for you at all.

337
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,040
Only for him in that situation.

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,920
Oh boy.

339
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,040
Where's Ashton?

340
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,600
Where is he?

341
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,280
Get out of here.

342
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
He's across the table from me.

343
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
Him and Jaleel White are best friends.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,320
Here's the scenario.

345
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
I'm at a red light.

346
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
It's very late night.

347
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,800
There are no other cars in sight.

348
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,760
I am certain there are no red light cameras

349
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
or police officers around.

350
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,240
Can I just go?

351
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,680
Would I be breaking any kind of driving etiquette?

352
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,200
That's from ANSI in Austin.

353
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,840
I swear to God we've talked about this before.

354
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,160
Really?

355
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm almost certain that we have.

356
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,240
If we have, it's been so long that we've forgotten

357
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
and maybe we've grown and matured.

358
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,040
Maybe, but like I see people quoting shit from three episodes ago

359
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,720
and I'm like, I don't remember that at all.

360
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,120
So I don't think our memory is as unimpeachable.

361
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,000
Do you guys ever do this?

362
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,040
No.

363
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,120
You know why?

364
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
Because I'm not a fucking criminal.

365
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
There is a light that is right next to the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company house

366
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,960
that frequently, I would say like once or twice a week, breaks

367
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,200
and will not turn green for the person trying to turn on to the street.

368
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
I've sat there through seven minutes

369
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,800
and watched the other two lights change green while it stayed red

370
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,640
and it kind of forces you to make that Pete and Pete bus driver decision

371
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
of like, am I gonna do it?

372
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,280
Am I going for it?

373
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,960
I mean, yes.

374
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
If your other option is wait and die of old age or starvation,

375
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,040
then yeah, I guess go ahead and break this law.

376
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,600
But here's the crazy thing about it, Griffin.

377
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,560
It always happens that somebody pulls up behind me

378
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,720
just as I make the decision to go.

379
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,320
So all they see is me running a red light.

380
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,120
Is there anything more exciting than seeing somebody run a red light?

381
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,920
I always assume there's a police chase.

382
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,560
Oh, no, no.

383
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,360
For me, it's like, what's he doing?

384
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Oh, if another car had been coming, oh no, that would have been bad.

385
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,720
Crazy motherfucker.

386
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
Like, it's like I witnessed a bank robbery.

387
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
But there's also a part of you that like is so envious.

388
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,920
Like, man, to have a life where you can just do that,

389
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
to just run it, you know, go for it.

390
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,120
I find that it's completely legal if you say out loud,

391
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm just gonna go.

392
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
I'm like, then it's totally cool.

393
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
And if you get pulled over, you say like, no, I announced it.

394
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
That's pre-crime then, right?

395
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
That's what Minority Report is about.

396
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,040
You announcing that you're about,

397
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm just gonna stab this guy eight times.

398
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay, cool.

399
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,640
You can be sure there are no cars or stoplight cameras,

400
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
but like, what about extremely fast people?

401
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah, you can't see if there's like a really speedy toddler

402
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
chasing like a beautiful butterfly.

403
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
That is a fast toddler.

404
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
Like a really fast toddler.

405
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,920
And even like faster, very directed butterfly.

406
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,440
Like baby Tony Jaa.

407
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,120
Yeah, if baby Tony Jaa,

408
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,960
what if you had prematurely ended the career of baby Tony Jaa

409
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,680
because he sprinted out in front of you chasing a butterfly?

410
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,920
Butterflies, peas.

411
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm gonna kick him with my knee.

412
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,240
That's what he does.

413
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,360
He kicks things with his knees.

414
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
That's like his whole shtick.

415
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
That's his bit.

416
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,040
Hey, it's a good bit, man.

417
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,120
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

418
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,200
I think I've probably done this a couple,

419
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
like if it's late at night and I'm sure there's somebody around.

420
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
You're a little drunk.

421
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
I'll go for it.

422
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
No, like definitely not then.

423
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,840
When I drink and drive is the only time I focus, you know?

424
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
Don't say that.

425
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,360
There are many levels.

426
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,720
The only time I feel alive, you know what I mean?

427
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
Don't say that.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,880
Don't say any of this.

429
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
I don't mean any of it.

430
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,880
I don't drink anymore.

431
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
My wife's 17 weeks pregnant.

432
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,240
She's what?

433
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,160
She's 17 weeks pregnant.

434
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
That's super long, isn't it?

435
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
It thought it was only 12.

436
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,200
Read a book.

437
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,600
Okay, you do need to read a book.

438
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,320
He's right.

439
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
I need your help in being a little mean to someone.

440
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,520
I recently found out that a friend of mine

441
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,320
was kicked out of his dorm suite for getting scarily,

442
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,880
belligerently drunk and threatening his roommates

443
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,480
who are also friends of mine.

444
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
Campus security had to deal with him.

445
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
He seemed normal since then, but I find it seriously creepy.

446
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,160
Can I just ghost it and stop speaking to him?

447
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,000
Or do I have to offer explanation?

448
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,720
That's from not good at confrontation in New York.

449
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,080
I mean, if you ghost it, that's explanation enough.

450
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,360
He knows what he did.

451
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,560
That sucks.

452
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,240
I feel like your only mistake was not immediately ghosting it

453
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
right after that happened.

454
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,080
At the same time, let's go walk this back a little bit.

455
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,640
If you're somebody's friend,

456
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
and I can understand that some people just have,

457
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,320
some people just have that evil inside of them,

458
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
and you can see it, you can sense it, you can feel it,

459
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
but this guy's friend,

460
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
he's obviously got a substance abuse problem.

461
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,840
I think it's worth a convo to at least,

462
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,720
even if you are 100% committed to cutting ties,

463
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,920
at least to say, hey, just so you know,

464
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm not comfortable being around you

465
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,880
until you get your life fixed.

466
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,120
Because one of the things you hear

467
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,560
in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on TV

468
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,920
is that I lost all my friends, blah, blah, blah.

469
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,440
That guy's not gonna be able to say that

470
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,160
if you don't tell him that that's why he lost his friends.

471
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,680
He might just assume that you moved.

472
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm like, I'll cut someone out.

473
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,040
I'll get out the fucking liquid paper

474
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
if it's deserved.

475
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,880
But I think you're right.

476
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,760
I think in this case,

477
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,560
this person probably needs somebody

478
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,040
to tell them how completely,

479
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,440
I mean, they probably know how unacceptable that is,

480
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,160
but they need to know that their actions

481
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,200
have impacted other people on a serious level.

482
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
You know what, I'm going to retroactively agree

483
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,240
with you guys.

484
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,480
Yeah.

485
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,440
I concur.

486
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,960
Speak to the man, if nothing else,

487
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,200
to say this is why it would be difficult to be friends

488
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
with you right now,

489
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,760
but if you deal with it and it ceases to be an issue,

490
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,040
I'd love to hang out with you again.

491
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,480
And you know what?

492
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
Is it gonna be like an easy, comfortable conversation?

493
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,960
No, but these are the kinds of conversations

494
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
that make, if not your friendship,

495
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,360
at least you, stronger.

496
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,240
You have to build up a tolerance for stuff like this

497
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,800
because at some point you're gonna get out of college

498
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,160
and you're gonna get into full-blown adulthood.

499
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,960
And if you don't start having conversations like this,

500
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
it's basically like you're building up warrants,

501
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
emotional warrants,

502
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,280
and you're just gonna be on the lam your whole life,

503
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,240
running from emotional town to emotional town,

504
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
trying to stay one step ahead of the emotional law.

505
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,240
And right now you could just pay your debt

506
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,840
to emotional society.

507
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
You got a little bit lost in that metaphor, didn't you?

508
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
Yeah, well, it got a little ahead of me, yeah.

509
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,040
Yeah, and have the conversation.

510
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,000
You'll be tougher for it.

511
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
You might help this guy out.

512
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,000
And your friendship, if you decide to preserve it,

513
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,640
it's gonna be better.

514
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
That's gonna be tough, man.

515
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,600
I know, but I don't have to fucking do it.

516
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,440
All I have to do is tell him what to do.

517
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
Hey, can I throw something out?

518
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
I think that writing him a letter,

519
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
if you do not feel prepared or ready

520
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
to have a face-to-face conversation,

521
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,480
a letter is the next best option

522
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
as opposed to a text message or an email.

523
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,040
Because a letter says, I cared enough

524
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,440
to put the time in to do this.

525
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,880
And it's something that he can reference back to

526
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,240
should he ever have a tough moment.

527
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,320
I just feel like if somebody's in this situation,

528
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,840
it is probably not a one-sided issue.

529
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,840
I have known very few people who abused alcohol

530
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
where the whole story was, I just love it.

531
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,000
It tastes so good in my mouth.

532
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
It tastes great, and I feel great.

533
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,640
That's very rarely the whole story.

534
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
And if Travis is right,

535
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
if you are completely opposed to having the conversation,

536
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
some sort of written communique would be,

537
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,280
I mean, at the very least, novel.

538
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,760
Better than a Facebook poke.

539
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,000
Certainly, certainly better than that.

540
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
A telling Facebook poke.

541
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,000
And if it helps, it doesn't just have to be like,

542
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
I'm cutting you out because of this,

543
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
deal with it and get back to me.

544
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
It can be like, hey, if you're going through something

545
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,360
and if there's other issues you want to talk about,

546
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm there for you, but I want to support you.

547
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,240
But only via written communication.

548
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,760
If you can employ some sort of Pony Express delivery system.

549
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,040
I've included a self-addressed stamped envelope.

550
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,480
Sorry, so sloppy.

551
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,040
Ralph, can you get that person back in your group after they...

552
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,000
It's not the drinking.

553
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
The belligerently drunk part is obviously not ideal,

554
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,600
but to me, the real sticking point is the threatening

555
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,040
your other friends because that just seems like a long road

556
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,760
to hoe to get...

557
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,560
If one of my friends was like, I'm gonna kick your ass,

558
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,240
I don't know that I would ever be like,

559
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,880
hey, let's go bowling.

560
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,360
I mean, Travis knocked a guy out with a bowling pin once.

561
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
But that was on accident.

562
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,720
Well, you hit him in the head with a bowling pin.

563
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,040
But I accidentally knocked him out.

564
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,320
He was wearing a football helmet.

565
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:52,800
Can we point...

566
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,160
Travis isn't like a mugger.

567
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,920
That was probably our worst college game.

568
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,440
And that beats out our game Lockjaw,

569
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,120
where you kept your fist six inches from somebody's face,

570
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,480
shouted Lockjaw at them so they would lock their jaws

571
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
and then you punch them in the face.

572
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
Now, that was a hit game.

573
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
Does it beat Fireworks Bathroom?

574
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,400
Sorry, remind me about Fireworks Bathroom.

575
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,720
Wasn't Fireworks Bathroom the game

576
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,040
that you used to play over at Jason's?

577
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,160
Where someone was in the bathroom

578
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,760
when you throw a firecracker in there.

579
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,480
No, I thought they cut up a bunch of fireworks

580
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,840
and then emptied it in the sink

581
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,320
and then everyone stood in the bathroom

582
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,160
and then they lit the sink

583
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,600
and then the last person in the bathroom won the game.

584
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
Yeah, the last person to leave the bathroom.

585
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,640
That was a great game.

586
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,760
Another hit one was when we bought a lobster

587
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,360
and made the lobster fight Jason's iguana for its freedom.

588
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,520
And if it won the fight, we wouldn't eat it.

589
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,880
We'd eat the iguana instead.

590
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,560
So of all those games, the worst was probably the one

591
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,080
where one guy would wear a football helmet

592
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,440
and the other guy would hit him in the head

593
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
with a bowling pin.

594
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,040
It's probably showing some level of restraint,

595
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,200
save Travis.

596
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,720
Travis was eager to impress

597
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,720
and he would just clobber the guy.

598
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,160
So yeah, you may have seen this guy on-

599
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,640
That's what we're saying.

600
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,400
We know we just made it sound like a lot of fun

601
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,920
for the past minute and a half, but-

602
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,960
Yeah, so don't drink.

603
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,080
It sounds like fun.

604
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,360
But in Travis's defense, Brandon McCoy,

605
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,440
the guy he hit, ended up on Veep.

606
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,560
So what's up now?

607
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
I guess Travis really helped him out.

608
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:35,840
Travis bashed-

609
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,720
You're welcome, Brandon.

610
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
Travis bashed some acting smarts into his dome.

611
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Should we go to the money sign?

612
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:41,600
We should.

613
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,920
I know you've tried Hulu.com,

614
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,440
literally everyone on earth has,

615
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,640
but HuluPlus.com is way, way better.

616
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,680
It's like Hulu Plus' sexier older brother.

617
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,480
He knows where to buy alcohol

618
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,040
and he is a cool guy that you can hang with

619
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,720
for just $8 a month.

620
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
You're saying it's the Justin of Hulus.

621
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,120
It's the Justin of Hulus.

622
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,960
Yes, and he-

623
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,280
He's taking a philosophy class in college

624
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,120
and he can talk to you all day long

625
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
about the meaning of life and shit.

626
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
He's got a little mustache.

627
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
He knows, he's ready to show you SNL,

628
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,080
Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank and Scandal

629
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,040
over at his house.

630
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
And he'll let you watch every episode.

631
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,960
He'll loan you his copies of Law & Order,

632
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,680
SVU, Doctor Who, Lost and Community.

633
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,880
Let you watch all of them.

634
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,280
You know what?

635
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,040
He's been taking some film classes too

636
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,920
and he's created a couple of original Hulu programs

637
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,400
like The Wrong Man's and Behind the Mask,

638
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,000
which is his new docu-series

639
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,320
that takes you inside the world of sports mascots.

640
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,360
Also, he smells like aged leathers.

641
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,160
He's got access to ad-free movies,

642
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,360
one would hope,

643
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,040
and some kids content,

644
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,080
which is perhaps questionable, but hey.

645
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,760
He's learning and growing.

646
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,720
You know, he works with Big Brother's Little Sisters.

647
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,600
He works with Big Brother's-

648
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
What is that program called?

649
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,400
Sorry, it's not what you said.

650
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,560
And he's gonna hang with you.

651
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,480
The best part is he's gonna hang with you

652
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,800
for two weeks for free

653
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,920
if you go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

654
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,360
Otherwise-

655
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,280
Huluplus.com slash my brother

656
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,200
for an extended free trial.

657
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,160
His usual hang fee is $7.99 a month,

658
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,680
which is already really good

659
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,040
for the amount of stuff you're gonna get,

660
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,040
but you can get it for two weeks free.

661
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,640
Peep it.

662
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,600
Hey guys, don't know if you know,

Is it really?

665
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,480
All that that implies.

666
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,840
Yes.

667
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,160
I'm ready to start some business.

668
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,720
I'm gonna start getting busy.

669
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm gonna start business with you,

670
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,520
start business with that guy.

671
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,160
Get busy.

672
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400

into the referral box at checkout.

681

No big deal.

00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
and can connect you with the right attorney,

687
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,240
but they're not a law firm.

688
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
So go check out LegalZoom.com

689
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,600
and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

690
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,920
It's an incredible deal.

691
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,680
So why wouldn't you do it, stupid?

692
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,440
Go get that free shit, you dumb idiot.

693
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,040
Come on.

694
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,520
I got another message for Justin

695
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,280
and this is coming straight at you from Sarah.

696
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
This is not for me.

697
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,320
It's for another Justin.

698
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
She says, happy first anniversary, Justin.

699
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
Now don't get confused.

700
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
She's talking about this other Justin.

701
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,800
I have been married for over seven years.

702
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm not crazy about this.

703
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,920
I have to go through life ignoring the fact

704
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,720
that Justin Long exists, Justin Timberlake,

705
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,920
and that one's tough for me

706
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,560
because I like his music and I like his acting.

707
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,720
I am a little miffed at you for acknowledging his existence.

708
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,040
I've asked you several times not to do so.

709
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,360
Sarah says of this other Justin who apparently exists,

710
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
I hope hearing it from your favorite podcasters

711
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,800
makes it even more special.

712
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,640
Thanks for being such an amazing husband

713
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,760
and a great dad to our annoying bird, Petey.

714
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,600
Dad was in quotes and I did my best.

715
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,040
I got his butt.

716
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,960
There it is.

717
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,120
Brother, since Justin is a jazz musician,

718
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,920
now to clarify, I myself am not.

719
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,400
This other Justin, it is, plays baritone sax.

720
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,920
Could you do a scat for him?

721
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
She says, thanks.

722
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,960
Love the show.

723
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,280
We are not fucking kids.

724
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm actually, I was actually just practicing

725
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,800
some Pentecostal scat.

726
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,320
That was the divine spirit talking.

727
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,400
Got the holy spirit deep down inside you.

728
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,640
The holiest spirit of the scat man.

729
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,760
Happy anniversary, you two.

730
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,800
I have a message for Jonas and it's from John,

731
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,400
Alexis, Shady, and Sarah who say,

732
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,440
happy birthday, Jonas.

733
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,160
If this message is late, it's because we wanted to see

734
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,840
if you lived through your broke back adventure

735
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,200
to Mount Washington.

736
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,440
Happy birthday and thanks for getting all of us

737
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,920
into the erudite wisdom of the brothers.

738
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,680
Guys, we've said this many times before.

739
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,840
You don't have to take the heat for this stuff.

740
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,400
You don't.

741
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,880
He's gonna be mad at you now and he could be mad at us

742
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,720
and we're never gonna meet Jonas.

743
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,960
We don't give a solitary shit what Jonas thinks of us.

744
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,680
I do.

745
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,360
Okay, well Travis does, we don't.

746
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,000
Travis does.

747
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,480
Two thirds of us don't give a fuck about Jonas.

748
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,760
Don't carry it all.

749
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,640
Jonas, I love you.

750
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,880
Don't carry it all, put it on us.

751
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
He sounds like a nice dude, like happy birthday and shit.

752
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,120
You love mountains and shit, but I don't give a fuck.

753
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,640
Jonas, don't let me in with it, please.

754
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,840
Don't let me in with this, Jonas.

755
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,480
I'm so sorry.

756
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,560
Happy birthday, Jonas.

757
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
Happy birthday, Jonas.

758
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,640
I don't give a shit though.

759
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,320
Justin, what are you doing?

760
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,800
Strapping a chicken in my arm.

761
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,200
Heard there's some plague out west, so I just wanted to get out ahead of it.

762
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,280
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast, Sawbones,

763
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,480
where we talk about everything from trepanation to bloodletting,

764
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,680
you would know that that is a ridiculous idea and it will never work.

765
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,400
Sawbones, I haven't caught it.

766
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,960
Sawbones?

767
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,960
Yes, it's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network

768
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,560
and we record it every Friday.

769
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,840
On the Maximum Fun Network and we record it together.

770
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,320
You a doctor or something?

771
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,360
Yes.

772
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
I hate talking about money.

773
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,960
It makes me uncomfortable to discuss restaurant bills, gas money, etc.

774
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,560
with friends and co-workers.

775
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,200
If an amount less than $20 is owed to me, I would really rather not discuss it.

776
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,080
I would gladly lose out on the money if the cost is not having a conversation about money.

777
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,280
How can I get people to take me seriously when they say,

778
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
how much do I owe you?

779
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
And I say, don't worry about it.

780
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,040
That's a currency coward.

781
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,240
You are the conductor of a train that I have been a passenger on my entire life, my friend.

782
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,880
Wait, are conductors actually on the train or do they just hang out at the station?

783
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah, they hang out at the station and then when they see the train come and they say,

784
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,920
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, bye.

785
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,640
You're doing it.

786
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
You can do it, don't give up, don't give up.

787
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,360
It's such a tricky scenario because I am totally with you.

788
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,440
I fucking hate dealing with this.

789
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,560
But at the same time, you know what I hate more is when a friend is like,

790
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,520
hey, you paid for those movie tickets.

791
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,320
It was $19.

792
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,520
How much do I owe you?

793
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,440
How do I say, oh, don't worry about it without sounding like I'm saying like,

794
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,640
you need this more than I do.

795
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Here's the, I think the misconception here is that when someone says,

796
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,840
how much do I owe you?

797
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,280
It's not about you.

798
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,280
I just always accept that it's them saying,

799
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,840
I feel a burden now because I owe you something.

800
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,720
And I would like to alleviate that burden by just evening it out between us.

801
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,720
And when you go, oh, don't worry about it.

802
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,080
You're lording it over them that you don't need their petty money.

803
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,840
One of my favorite things about adulthood is that we migrate over to a

804
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,600
monetary system that more closely resembles wampum.

805
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,400
In that, like, if someone comes over and you buy them dinner,

806
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,120
you don't have to split the goddamn check.

807
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,480
You just know that someday you're going to go to their place

808
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,920
and they're going to get you dinner.

809
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
Or give you a ride to the airport.

810
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,960
Or house sit your dog, or dog sit your dog.

811
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,920
Or sit on your dog.

812
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,680
Or sit on your dog's house.

813
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,720
When you're younger, though, money is the most valuable thing.

814
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,240
No one has any of it, so it becomes very scarce.

815
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,520
When it becomes easier to procure, when you're not in the adult world,

816
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,080
there are things that are worth more to you than money.

817
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,240
Like, God, please drive me to the airport.

818
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,720
Please.

819
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,360
I love the regi- because I remember in college,

820
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,280
there being retroactive, like, claims where it's like,

821
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,720
um, I would pay you back for this, but do you remember a month ago

822
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,200
I paid for the movie tickets?

823
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,720
I feel like this is pretty balanced now, right?

824
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,920
So I'm going to go.

825
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,680
I also think the how much do I owe you question is a little unfair

826
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,680
unless the, like, unless they have zero idea.

827
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,720
Like, I, because I think that's just invi-

828
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm not going to invoice you.

829
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,080
Like, just give, if you think that I should have some money,

830
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,440
just give me some of it.

831
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,240
Did you guys ever have a friend in college that you were 100% sure

832
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,720
was fucking you on these matters?

833
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
Like, they go out and they're like,

834
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
hey, I'm gonna run out and get some pizzas.

835
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,240
Can you split the cost of being?

836
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,880
You're like, yeah, sure.

837
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,240
And they run out and get two hot and reddies,

838
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,200
and you're like, how much do I owe you?

839
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,000
And they say $8.

840
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,360
And they're like, oh, that's, that's interesting

841
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,240
because I know they're $5 a piece, you piece of shit.

842
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,360
Yes, we, we had, and we, we would also have periods

843
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,560
where we would become suspicious that some people had money.

844
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,320
Hey, listen, I heard that he is getting money from his parents,

845
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
that his parents give him some money.

846
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,880
So he has some money.

847
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,920
He just has it.

848
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,720
I think he just has money that he's not, like,

849
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,240
giving to us or doing anything with.

850
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,360
He just has it.

851
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,040
I always say, I think the sweetest comment

852
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,840
is when you can, like, get a big group of people

853
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,800
and everybody chips in to a point that you end up with boner.

854
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
Like, I'm going to run out and get beer

855
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
and everyone gives you $5.

856
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,680
And so you end up with like 50 bucks

857
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,360
and the beer costs you 40.

858
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,840
Travis, holy shit, you were that guy.

859
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
It's capitalism.

860
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,240
No, that's, that's you fucking your friends.

861
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,280
They need that service.

862
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,080
That's you fucking your friends in they butts

863
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,680
where they wallets is.

864
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,520
No, because the guy who takes money from a lot of people

865
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,480
is going to get burned as many times as he wins out.

866
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,960
That's true.

867
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,800
It's luck of the, it's luck of the draw.

868
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
That money that Travis earned,

869
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,600
he probably lost out on another time.

870
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
Or at a casino.

871
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,920
Well, yeah, but that's a different thing entirely.

872
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,200
Yeah, it's a completely different.

873
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Well, cause here's the thing.

874
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,920
I do look at it as a service at that point,

875
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
because if you're the guy who stayed sober

876
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,720
to go buy beer halfway through the party when you ran out

877
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,080
and so you're able to like drive

878
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,600
and go get it and go to the trouble.

879
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes, I am going to profit off this transaction.

880
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,240
Sure.

881
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,480
Well, no, that sounds totally reasonable.

882
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,880
That's your job.

883
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,600
Thank you.

884
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,040
Griffin, do you have any Yahoo's?

885
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,440
I do.

886
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,080
I feel like one of those would go down really nice right now.

887
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,600
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

888
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,080
Thanks, Drew.

889
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,520
Enroll member.

890
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,240
It's by Yahoo answers user T, T-E-A, who asks,

891
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,000
what should I do to celebrate my rat's birthday?

892
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,320
Hello all.

893
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,760
I currently only have one rat.

894
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,080
Why is that funny to you?

895
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,360
I don't know.

896
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,880
It's the idea of all the people reading the question.

897
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,520
Salutation.

898
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,440
Hello, millions of readers.

899
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,960
I currently only have one rat, Frowny Face,

900
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,000
parentheses, my other one passed away last week

901
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,760
and his name is Blue.

902
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,280
Blue is going to be two on March 2nd this Sunday

903
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,360
and I'm so excited to celebrate.

904
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,760
The rat's name is not named Frowny Face then.

905
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,520
No, no, no, no.

906
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,680
This person is sad that they only have one rat

907
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
because the other one died very recently.

908
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,040
So very fresh corpse.

909
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
Blue's going to be two on March 2nd this Saturday

910
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,360
and I'm so excited to celebrate.

911
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,600
I have a few gifts, paper mache hut, treats, toys,

912
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,520
and dog bones, but I have no cake recipe

913
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,640
or activities planned.

914
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,160
I must make him a cake,

915
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,760
but I want it to be completely homemade.

916
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,600
I have a tiny rat size cake pan.

917
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,400
No, you don't.

918
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,680
So all I need is a recipe for the batter.

919
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,200
I also need some activities

920
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,360
since he is unfortunately by himself.

921
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,920
He won't be able to play any games involving multiple rats.

922
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,800
Instead, I have to plan other stuff for him to do.

923
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,000
Do you guys have any ideas?

924
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
Lastly, how can I make a mini rat pizza?

925
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,720
You can't.

926
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
Oh, and I also almost forgot.

927
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,320
What other homemade toys would you like?

928
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,200
DIY, please.

929
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,840
Thanks, everyone.

930
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,040
Smiley face, T.

931
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,800
This person went through some complex emotions

932
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,520
during this question.

933
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,760
So I know I feel like you could give the rat a bagel bite

934
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,840
and it'd be perfectly happy with that as a rat.

935
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,080
That is a deep ass dish pizza for a rat.

936
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,280
Listen, rats eat fucking garbage every day.

937
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,400
Do you think the rats are gonna be like,

938
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,760
this isn't rat specific?

939
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,640
Not this rat.

940
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,880
This rat's got a dope life.

941
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,680
That's true.

942
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,880
I know what I would give my rat that I owned,

943
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,000
my personal rat.

944
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,360
I would give him a quick ride to ye olde trash can

945
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,960
where he could die outside and not in my home.

946
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,640
And then I'd find the things,

947
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
I'd gather up all the things

948
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,600
that he'd ever touched or looked at and burn them.

949
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,040
Happy birthday, rat.

950
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,360
What was I doing?

951
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,960
Why would I get you if I knew that I hated you?

952
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,640
I hate you so much.

953
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,960
When one of you died, I should have been thrilled

954
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
because then that cut my rat problem

955
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,240
that I haven't had in half.

956
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,560
50%.

957
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,440
Get out of here, you trash eating rat.

958
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,360
Why would you have a rat?

959
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Why would you have a rat cake man?

960
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,320
Do you think the rat is a nickname for a turtle?

961
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,920
Maybe they have a rat because they love them

962
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,520
and they're their friend and they need the companionship.

963
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,440
They definitely do need the companionship.

964
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,400
That is not up for debate.

965
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,440
Holy shit.

966
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
All I'm saying is I don't wanna get a flood of emails

967
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,840
and tweets from rat owners and rat lovers who are like,

968
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,600
oh, you guys so close-minded.

969
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,320
How dare you?

970
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,160
That's such a myth and rats are great

971
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,840
and super sweet and very intelligent.

972
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,360
No, listen, over the years of making this program,

973
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,040
it's gonna be four years next month, okay?

974
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,720
After four years of recording this program,

975
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,040
I've become more culturally sensitive

976
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,360
to so many groups of people.

977
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,440
Rat owners, I'm drawing a line in the sand.

978
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,160
Here's the thing, unless your pet rat

979
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,480
has the power to transmogrify into an incredible wizard

980
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,560
and he's your familiar, you have to stop.

981
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
I love the Family Circus way you say that word.

982
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
What?

983
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,920
Familiar.

984
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Can you do me a favor?

985
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,080
What do you call the pasta that's just like long noodles

986
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,400
and you would put like a puttanesca sauce on top of it

987
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,240
and eat it?

988
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,440
Do you mean biscotti?

989
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,000
There we go.

990
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,240
Why do you have a rat-sized cake pan?

991
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,360
I have a bottle cap and a sense of creativity.

992
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,960
Let's be honest.

993
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,560
Do you think this person's ever showed up to a party like,

994
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,400
hey guys, I brought cake for your birthday.

995
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
Ah, fuck, I made it in a rat pan.

996
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,040
Shit.

997
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,840
Well, this is not gonna be enough for anybody, really.

998
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,680
I made a cracker, so I made.

999
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,760
Also, thanks for inviting me to a party.

1000
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,360
I own rats, so it doesn't happen.

1001
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,040
Oh no, you're dumping pig's blood on me.

1002
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,040
How could this happen?

1003
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,400
Again.

1004
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,280
So that's gonna do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother,

1005
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,520
and Me.

1006
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,440
We hope you had as much fun listening as we had recording.

1007
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,000
Thank you to people who are tweeting about our program.

1008
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,440
Like Patrick Malone had a sweet baby boy named Griffin

1009
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,800
born on Valentine's Day.

1010
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,360
I know.

1011
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,400
It's adorable.

1012
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,640
Wait, I think it's because somebody asked me on Twitter

1013
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,520
like a few months ago if that was cool.

1014
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,560
I named my son after you.

1015
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,800
Yeah.

1016
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,600
Guys, that's lovely.

1017
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,240
That's wonderful.

1018
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,600
This is the first I'm hearing about that

1019
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,040
because I don't read Twitter, I guess.

1020
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
So congratulations, Patrick.

1021
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,480
Thank you to others tweeting about the show like Matt.

1022
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,480
Kate Earlwine, who said that she dreamt she won an NBNBA prize

1023
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,040
package with two raincoats, sparkle bouncy balls, smiley face

1024
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,640
yo-yos, and a space t-shirt.

1025
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,800
So yep, you're welcome.

1026
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,800
Thanks to Joe Smith, Brooke Takkar, BTA, who hasn't listened

1027
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,480
to our show but is thinking about it.

1028
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,840
Come on, BTA.

1029
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:21,440
Marshall Henderson, Jay Dez, Chris Letty, Mark Beatty, Bill

1030
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Humphrey, Lauren, Bad Dad Aura, Root, Matt Warren, so many

1031
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,680
others.

1032
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,480
Thank you so much.

1033
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,920
We sure appreciate it.

1034
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,960
If you want to share, get somebody onto the NBNBAM train,

1035
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,000
send them a link to our sampler.

1036
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,760
It's bit.ly forward slash NBNBAM 2013 or bit.ly forward slash

1037
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,880
It's My Bim Bam.

1038
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,920
I want to thank Travis.

1039
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,120
I want to thank Travis for being here, fighting off the

1040
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,280
plague to record this episode.

1041
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,280
You guys can't hear the sounds of his disease, but they're

1042
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:55,760
there.

1043
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,120
I edited him out and he is a trooper and I'm proud of him.

1044
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,160
Thank you, Travis.

1045
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,680
Now, Travis, if things, I'm sure you're going to get better,

1046
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,960
but if things break bad and they don't go your way, you need

1047
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,080
to be ready.

1048
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,040
So I want to remind you to head to LegalZoom.com.

1049
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,480
It's not a law firm, but it provides self-help services at

1050
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,840
your specific direction.

1051
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,040
You can enter discount code my brother and you're going to

1052
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,920
save some money.

1053
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,120
So get that sorted out before things get worse or better, as

1054
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,080
I'm sure they will.

1055
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,280
But if they don't, but if they don't, I will also probably

1056
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,640
spend some time laying on the couch, checking out Hulu Plus.

1057
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Because Hulu Plus is where you can binge on thousands of

1058
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,320
features anytime, anywhere.

1059
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,880
And I'm going to rock out that free trial of Hulu Plus by

1060
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,200
going to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

1061
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,800
Guys, I have huge, huge ass news.

1062
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,520
This news has the biggest ass.

1063
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,080
The 2014 Max Fund Drive is coming up.

1064
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,680
During the last two weeks of March, you can tune in to

1065
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,160
support your favorite podcast, like, I don't know, us, and I

1066
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,080
don't know, Sawbones, and stop podcasting yourself, and Jordan

1067
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,680
Jesse Go, and Bullseye, and throw in the shade.

1068
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,800
And my brother, my brother, and me.

1069
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,840
My brother, my brother, and me.

1070
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,480
I already did us.

1071
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,120
I know, but I'm repeating it because it's very important that

1072
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,720
they support us above all others.

1073
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,440
Except for Sawbones, definitely Sawbones.

1074
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,840
You can toss them a pity vote here and there, but mostly my

1075
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,400
brother, my brother.

1076
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,440
So starting March 17th, we will be running some of our best

1077
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,840
shows of the year and offering spectacular thank you gifts to

1078
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,440
get you in the giving spirit.

1079
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,000
We usually do pretty extra length, extra size apps.

1080
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,240
And then we have a bonus episode that goes out to donors

1081
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,200
that we've done.

1082
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
Have we done four at this point?

1083
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
Or we've done three, and this will be our fourth, I think.

1084
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,720
I think that's right.

1085
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,080
I think, I don't.

1086
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,760
No, because we wouldn't have done one in 2010.

1087
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,720
We wouldn't have done one in 2010, yeah.

1088
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,360
Well, no, but 11, 12, 13, and this will be our fourth.

1089
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,800
Except we didn't join MaxFun until the middle of-

1090
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,040
We have some bonus episodes.

1091
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,440
We have a number of episodes.

1092
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,120
And if you're a donor, then you get all of them.

1093
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:02,000
So we also have other bonuses that we will talk about once

1094
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,320
the drive starts on the 17th that we give out to donors.

1095
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,800
All three of us are donors, which is kind of weird

1096
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,960
because that money go right back in our pockets.

1097
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,600
No, not really.

1098
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,000
I love what this network does.

1099
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,600
And I spend almost as much time as I do doing anything else

1100
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,560
in my life listening to podcasts on MaxFun.

1101
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,160
So don't miss it.

1102
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,520
MaxFun Drive starts March 17th, and it runs for just two weeks.

1103
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,880
You can listen in.

1104
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,840
You can sign up to support us and catch the best shows

1105
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,720
that we have to offer.

1106
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,840
Holy crap.

1107
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,800
It's happening, you guys.

1108
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,040
I want to thank also John Roderick in the long winters

1109
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,120
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1110
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,280
which is on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1111
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,360
You can find it on iTunes.

1112
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,440
You can find it at stores, but you should get it

1113
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,520
because it's really, really fucking good.

1114
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
Thank you again for listening.

1115
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,320
Griffin, do you have a final question for us to enjoy?

1116
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:56,820
I do.

1117
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,800
This one was sent in by Emerald member, Drew Davenport.

1118
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,080
Thank you, Drew.

1119
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,720
It's by Yahoo!

1120
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,280
It's by Yahoo! answer to user, James, who asks,

1121
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,840
how did Obama get Jay Leno fired?

1122
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,120
I'm Justin McElroy.

1123
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

1124
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1125
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,240
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1126
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,280
Kiss your dad.

1127
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,160
Score.

1128
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:38,160
And the lips.

1129
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,000
Maximumfun.org.

1130
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,040
Comedy and culture.

1131
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,160
Artist owned.

1132
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,200
Listener supported.

1133
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,840
I am so proud to be an American and to be hosting Throwing Shade with you.

1134
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,840
I am proud to have really deep brown eyes.

1135
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,400
Well, this is actually supposed to be, you know,

1136
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,000
this is supposed to be a thing so that people listen to our show.

1137
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,360
I've just been so busy this week.

1138
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,880
But I'm very happy to be here.

1139
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,320
The podcast is called?

1140
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,280
It's called Throwing Shade.

1141
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,160
You're the co-host, yeah.

1142
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,680
So Throwing Shade, we talk about-

1143
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,560
You're the gay co-host.

1144
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,760
I'm the female co-host.

1145
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,400
I always forget.

1146
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,600
We're friends in real life.

1147
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,100
Call me.

1148
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,600
Call me.

1149
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,100
Call me.

1150
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,600
Call me.

1151
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,100
Call me.

1152
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,960
We're friends in real life, kind of.

1153
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,200
And we talk about lady and gay issues.

1154
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:16,680
Yeah.

1155
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,600
And we talk about them in a way that is really disrespectful.

1156
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:20,920
Yeah.

1157
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,000
If you love the world and hate yourself.

1158
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,400
Please listen to Throwing Shade.

1159
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Yeah.
