1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,060
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better with you

8
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,140
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy and me well

10
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,980
I'm your middlest brother big dog woof woof Travis woof woof McElroy woof woof that was I'm Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,940
That's a lot of business. I couldn't remember where the woof woofs went if I'm being yeah

12
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,100
I just throw them in between every word I do it better say sorry. Hey guys guys. Yeah. Yeah guys. Did you hear about the spice?

13
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,380
The spice is nice this this

14
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,140
Small thumb what I was good. It must flow is I don't think at any point in dune do they say spice is nice

15
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,500
That's my rice nice. This is nice

16
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,060
Give me that spice on some shaved ice cuz it's nice. I am spices nice

17
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,140
Y'all y'all have expressed interest in doing a dune based

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,260
Introduction. Yeah, and I must warn you that of my knowledge of

19
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,140
the works

20
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,540
Are not comprehensive and so I might be able to hop in there from time to time and be like those big worms

21
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,940
I bet there's people on the internet

22
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,140
Who that makes?

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,820
horny of them

24
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,180
Which is like about the depths that I will be able to plumb with it

25
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,900
But all those big worms, you know

26
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,440
There's some people to see those and get horny off of them. Here's what I just wanted to say about this one

27
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,060
now I my

28
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,620
sort of

29
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,160
Expertise in dune is that I read the first quarter of the first book

30
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,360
Yeah, and said this isn't for me boring. This bike didn't say boring. I didn't fucking say

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Attive thing a lot of people really loved it

32
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,040
The director of the movie Dennis villain villain you

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,960
Which is like already a little delectable. Yeah, you know what I mean?

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,280
He said he's basically really mad that they're gonna put dune on TV

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,320
Oh, yeah

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,540
When it's also going the movies and I feel like this is a debate that we have not gotten a way in on

37
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Yeah, wait in on this

38
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
Dennis Dennis, I hear you and he doesn't want

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,900
Dennis doesn't want you to watch dune on TV if you show he says it's not just a product. It's church, right?

40
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,220
Oh gross, I don't go to church either Dennis

41
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,420
Movie more than I go to church Dennis Dennis maybe churches the movies, you know, it's not churches movies

42
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,760
He wrote this is what he said to variety

43
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,940
He wrote an open letter about how dunes on TV and he says that AT&T

44
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,040
Hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,620
There's absolutely no love for cinema nor the audience

46
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,100
the what he said is watching a

47
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,180
Film on a TV screen is of lesser value. He said the way it happened. I'm still not happy frankly

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,060
Frankly, so I wasn't angry though frankly to watch dune on a television

49
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,840
The best way I can compare it is to drive a speedboat your bathtub. Whoa, that's awesome

50
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,320
That's what that's Dennis don't make it sound so good. That sounds awesome. Dennis

51
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,120
Dennis the problem with your metaphor there or a simile is that a speedboat in your bathtub would not scale unless

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
You're talking about a Stuart little ask situation

53
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,200
Yeah

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,860
Which the bathtub is scaled down to the bathtub and I'm Stuart little slice because when I put dune on TV

55
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,720
It's not gonna be like super zoomed in on Oscar Isaac's nose, right?

56
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,300
Like I'm gonna be able to see the whole thing, but on the other hand on the other hand

57
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,120
Do not watch it on an IMAX. Here's the thing folks

58
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Dennis made these worms

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,680
To be a specific big size. Yeah, when you watch the worms on your TV or

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,440
Christ forbid it your phone

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,520
Those worms look little they look like little that's like a snake that you could step on and hurt it and you can't do that

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,880
Cuz the worm is too big but on an IMAX screen the people that's

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,360
Way too big the worm is at that point. Yeah, I was no one's gonna believe there's a worm that big

64
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,920
When I watch June on my tablet

65
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm like, why are those borrowers fighting that earthworm because I don't understand scale

66
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,440
Zendaya so small so little so little here's what I'll say to Dennis though that perhaps Dennis isn't considering

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
TVs these days as big

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,900
They are getting bigger pretty big. I said like my TV

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,560
It's pretty big now if this was old school where we had that one tube TV that I think in real life was like a 12

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,520
Inch screen but the box like the the case that it was in was like three feet wide

71
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Then like yeah, I get it Dennis

72
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,880
I don't want to watch fucking Timothy Chalamet's beautiful face on that tiny shitty black mirror

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,920
But on my big TV now, it's getting close in that it's pretty big and I sit super close to it Dennis

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm right up on it. So the aspect ratio is about the same

75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,240
How to hold on if we could pause for 30 seconds. I'm here with celebrity correspondent David Lynch

76
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,000
You just wanted to weigh in on this impossible now if you're playing

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
the movie on a

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,560
Telephone you will never in a trillion years

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,500
Experience the film you'll think you have experienced it

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,280
But you'll be

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,160
Cheated it's a such a sadness that you think you've seen a film on your

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,880
fucking telephone

83
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
Get real

84
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,200
Okay, so that's sort of where Dave's at. Thank you David for coming into the studio with that. I really appreciate it

85
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,760
I'm gonna completely miss the point for a second and say that my favorite moment in there and is when you can hear him start

86
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,000
To think to say billion, but then he's like nah. No, no, no, David, David, David

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Trillius trillion years that'll get the point across

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Timothy Chalamet's not a big dude

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,600
He could get what you could lose him in the action on the phone. I haven't seen the dune film because it's not out yet

90
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
and

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,560
Frankly, I they got it right with the sting vert like they got it in one with sting and fucking aging tale Cooper

92
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Like yeah, you're not gonna beat that but good luck but on a phone to me Chalamet. Where is he?

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,000
He is two pixels tall. I do not see the boy. I do not

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,580
Although it is the most I've ever felt capable that I could take Jason Momoa in a fight

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,080
Like I think I flick him across the table like a football

96
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,080
Angry Birds Angry Birds, Aquaman's ass right out the phone. Get out of here. Get out of here now

97
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,640
You're in the yard. I wish it's true because when you see the old version of dune on screen

98
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
I'm like, oh Patrick Stewart looks gigantic, right?

99
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,320
Oh, look how huge he is, but then I go and I see Jason Momoa's ass in that tiny ass phone. I'm like, oh, yeah

100
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,600
Yeah, no, I could squish that boy. I could squish that man. Look at him. Look at that. Travis could swish

101
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,840
Could swish he can pick Jason Momoa up and swish him nothing but net. Oh, no problem. No problem there

102
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Absolutely, I could don't even get don't even get it started

103
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,800
So don't see if you see dune on TV if you see dune on TV take yourself to jail

104
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Unless you admit yourself to jail unless

105
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,360
Unless you string a bunch of TVs together like in blank check the movie and you can watch it

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,520
That's awesome. Like a big you had a bunch of friends together and lamb

107
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,840
Party your TVs together. That's good. Just watch it

108
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,920
So watch TV is one chunk of Timothée Chalamet's face

109
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,760
Right and and decide ahead of time

110
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,280
Which part of which TV is gonna be the face because you don't want everybody to be like the nose or something

111
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,080
That would be so embarrassing, right? You want to be like, I'm the nose you guys are the eyes

112
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Let's vulture on this shit and get Timothy Chalamet's face up on the big screen like Dennis intended and I'm just gonna say I'm I've been

113
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,880
This is like not relevant to me cuz I've been boycotting the movie

114
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,040
You guys know since they announced that Stellan Skarsgard was gonna play Baron Harkonnen and not Mike Myers like I've been requesting

115
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
So many years

116
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,200
Absolutely. I wanted Mike Myers play all the parts, but but they wouldn't they said he I was just but have you tried saying out loud?

117
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Stellan Skarsgard

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm gonna bring my screaming

119
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,600
Four month old and four year old to the theaters. Everybody's gonna be like, why did you bring these fucking kids to dune?

120
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,960
I'll be like Dennis made me I wanted to watch it at home like like a normal person

121
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,800
But apparently this is a Christ like experience. I just hope there's enough fucking I just hope there's enough

122
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
Stellan in there to satisfy my kids

123
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,840
I don't want it to be another another

124
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,920
Situation like like Jungle Cruise where they got Giamatti right at the beginning and then Giamatti disappears for large swaths

125
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,280
It's only this is yeah, this is what I'll say Justin

126
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm still glad that you brought Jungle Cruise back into it because I watched Jungle Cruise at home and I can't imagine

127
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,440
How much harder I would have cried if I saw it in theaters, you know what I mean? So I'm kind of glad

128
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,560
Yes, then I'm able to sit at home and have a muted emotional experience because God knows sometimes

129
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,280
You know the the waterworks they just open and by the end of it you're dried out like spongebob in the Sun

130
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,880
And I don't want that, you know what I mean?

131
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,760
So like it's nice to be able to mute my emotions in watching say a Jungle Cruise

132
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,160
or a

133
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,720
Dune at home because the spice must flow but so must the tears the tears must also and I like that's the thing about home

134
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,360
Viewing that you're not gonna beat Dennis when I watched Chernobyl now with my kids

135
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and they were like, who's that great guy?

136
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,480
I was like, that's that is Stellan Skarsgard and then like happens in so many movies. He was gone for a long time

137
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,040
He wasn't on the screen. I could fast forward to the next scene. Yeah, and that's in the special feature

138
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:08,960
So you can just watch these guys the sing-along the sing-along Skarsgard cut. Yeah for sure. They call it the scar rated version

139
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,560
Right, it's pretty good that was ten minutes we're free. All right, we did it. Congratulations everybody

140
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,760
We are going to answer your questions now and turn them alchemy like into wisdom. That's what we do. This is our core competency

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,800
Well, it's our it's our it's our USP

142
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
unique selling point

143
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,960
Guys, all right. No other podcast has done it. You know the podcast will ever do it. Okay, because I know he has a fucking gun

144
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,800
Oh, all right. I'm so I'm just really it's been a while you sound amped up. I'm fucking stuck

145
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,040
This is the thing we switched to the morning record. Yeah, now I'm so chised on coffee. Yeah, you know, I mean

146
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,920
who I

147
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,320
work at a local deli that also serves ice cream even that's a

148
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,280
Vodka, yeah, sure a thousand things. I could say all right, you know

149
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Yeah, well, that's that's using a lot like listen to like listen, like, um

150
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,440
You think they have a bologna flavored ice cream over here. Awesome. Come on. I've heard of creamed beef, but this

151
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,020
Come on

You're doing great stuff over there. But you know Justin's on fire. I need to give Justin

153
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
You're right. Get out of the way

154
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,700
Listen when MJ's on fire you give him the basketball or the microphone depending on which MJ

155
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,100
You're talking about you're discussing. Yeah now Justin. Yeah, do you sort of or the gun to shoot zombies if it's me?

156
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,200
Oh, right, right, right, right. Give me one more Justin, but make it more focused on the ice cream and less on the bologna

157
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Okay. Yeah, you know what? I like is a nice

158
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,380
locks and then a schmear of

159
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,580
Neapolitan. Oh, that's smooth. Yeah, that's perfect. Shit. Yeah, fuck. I

160
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,620
Work at a local deli that also serves ice cream. Nice. I was

161
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,120
Helping out behind the ice cream County yesterday and while talking to my co-worker about milkshakes

162
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,660
I mentioned that I'm not the best person to talk to you because I'm lactose intolerant

163
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,900
Without missing a beat. He said yeah, it makes sense. I

164
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:13,300
I of course asked what he meant and he was immediately told me I don't know

165
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,100
You just look like you don't do dairy. Was this an insult? Yes

166
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,780
How do I make myself naturally look like I not only can eat but frequently consume milk?

167
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,160
That's from befuddled in Bellingham. Why would you want that?

168
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,020
Why do you want a milk milk is poisoned on your body?

169
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,340
Why do you want that no Griffin because you see there's some people that have been picking on me

170
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,540
But I've been drinking my milk and pretty soon. I'm gonna be a big tough guy and I'm gonna murder all of them

171
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,420
I don't remember how the commercial goes, but it's basically something like that. It was something like that

172
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,900
Yeah, it was a little boy the milk mustache saying bidet reckoning

173
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,020
You've missed an important sentence in this thing, which is that they are lactose intolerant

174
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,300
So like if I'm at a party and somebody's like cheap Griffin you haven't even looked at the cheese ball

175
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,500
Then I'm gonna have to say well, yeah, because it'll make me fart and shit weird and I'll seem like a total creepazoid

176
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,740
I would rather just avoid that entirely

177
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,440
Assume that about me. You're missing the point. The question asker is not asking

178
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,020
How do I make myself eat this food which is poisoned to my guts?

179
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,620
It is how do I make myself up here to be someone who eats this food?

180
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,900
That is poison in my guts so that I might pass without trace throughout society

181
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,540
So that people you're okay

182
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,340
Travis this is an intractable position that we have found ourselves in because I am saying if you give that off

183
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,020
But you can't if you're writing those checks

184
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,900
People are gonna tell you to cash them and when they tell you to cash them you will have to say I can't because of what?

185
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,860
It does to my stomach and my butt and the toys. Oh my god Griffin. You're missing the most obvious answer

186
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,340
Become an expert at sleight-of-hand

187
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Okay, they make

188
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,820
Newspaper, yes, right the newspaper code and dump it in and then the stuffs but in this case the newspaper cone is your mouth

189
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,060
Okay, when the when the magic's guys

190
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,580
Do the trick where they pour the milk down the newspaper cone, uh-huh, and then it's gone

191
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,340
Yeah, that's making a mess somewhere right in a different dimension

192
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:32,460
Yeah, I mean jokes out of the room. There's no they're not pouring it into a fucking wormhole like they're pouring milk

193
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,260
What a newspaper come let's say let's put it this way

194
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,820
When the magician pour the milk into the newspaper code and then you make it disappear. Yeah, someone

195
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,660
Will be cleaning that up who will not at the end receive applause

196
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,060
When they're doing their stage show there is a techie

197
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,500
There is some kind of feeder professional standing off the wings going don't do the milk. Don't do the milks

198
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,140
I don't want to I hope no one thinks I'm

199
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:14,140
It's like in the prestige when Michael Caine revealed like no we we straight-up murder a bird like every single night

200
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,080
This is that somebody's like damn, where does the milk go though? And you're like

201
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,940
He and you stain on the floor. I'm sweeping up the birds

202
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,600
It's a living I don't I I

203
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,480
I would not want this. I don't I don't know why you want this

204
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,040
It's not most people I feel like aren't doing milk these days, huh?

205
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,520
I think that the problem is is that I think that lactose intolerant makes it seem like a weakness

206
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,080
instead of like saying like, oh no, my body rejects that point like I think it needs a

207
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Rebranding is what it is rather than like I can't drink milk. My body has evolved beyond the need for milk

208
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,000
Right. That's a good way. We need something that makes it more like oh, you're not lactose intolerant. Oh my god. I'm so sorry

209
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,160
It's but it's like this is not a judge about people who are still rocking that dairy life. Go for it

210
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,720
Santa your truth. I'm proud of you, but there's so much stuff you can eat

211
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,600
No one's gonna come up to you and be like you don't eat the cheese and milk and you're like not there's other stuff

212
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,740
There's like lots of stuff that you can eat. There's lots of stuff you can eat. That's a actually a great point graph

213
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,000
Thanks juice, especially at the deli like, you know, I mean, yeah. Yeah. Can we approach the wizard?

214
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,280
Can we approach his humble yourself? I've actually been practicing a little dance for the wizard do your dance

215
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,840
I'm gonna genuflect and let's all appease the wizard of the cloud

216
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,000
Why did you get that tired cuz it was you didn't do that much

217
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm really out of shape different. So I want to tell you all how to get out of a sticky situation

218
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,960
I think we've all been in from time to time too much on

219
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
No, no

220
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:16,720
You're out in the desert. Yeah, and you're riding on your camel. Yeah looking for

221
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:26,380
The mummy's crypt sure sure sure to get the golden treasure. I'm with Brendan Fraser and reach one of the Fraser's there, but then

222
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:34,860
Uh, you know Brent Fraser sees a sees a bad mummy and shoots it with his gun that kills mummies

223
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,620
Oh, okay, and and when that happens, it's loud right and your camel goes fuck this. I'm

224
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,580
Scared. Yeah. Yeah, so I want to read to y'all how to regain control of a spooked camel

225
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,620
Sent this in. Thank you, Holland

226
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,020
Just to quickly like sort of summarize a lot of the things that I'm gonna say here

227
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,780
Be just be chill about it. Yeah, cuz if you're not chill

228
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:06,220
Your camel's gonna know that it can also be not chill and get and get and sort of wild out

229
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,860
Hey Griffin, if I could just ask if you could get to the point. This is actually very timely for me. Oh shit. Okay

230
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,900
Yeah, like this is actually a going concern right now, right?

231
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,220
Okay, camels are very intuitive creatures. If they sense your anxiety or anger, they will get more spooked your anger

232
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
Fuck you camel. Stand still

233
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,220
It's important to manage your emotions, even if you're scared out of your mind. So focus on your breathing

234
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,780
Some people find that breathing in quick quickly and exhaling slowly helps them feel calmer

235
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,300
Huh other people find breathing in and out on counts of three helps that's so you've given me nothing here

236
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,540
Which of those those are two different things. Hey, yeah, but Travis listen remember camels they are calm by nature

237
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
They're not naughty by nature like a lot of

238
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,620
The animals of God's God's domain like a lot of

239
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
ungulates

240
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
ungulate anyway

241
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,260
It it will eventually regain its composure. You just when you're in the shit

242
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,300
Remember, you're not always gonna be in there because the camel wants to calm down, right?

243
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,820
Not this one Reggie is kind of going he's wilding out

244
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,460
He is now Travis, but he wants to be calm. So talk to the camel softly. Don't ever raise your voice at it Reggie

245
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,660
Reggie, you've trampled Reggie. You've trampled my child

246
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,700
Please destroy this bizarre that we found ourselves in if you could just chill out. This is a lot of money

247
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,940
You're going to cost me. I just want to see if there really is water inside of your hump

248
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,060
Yeah, myself really. Oh, that's number four. Don't poke a

249
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,780
Poke a straw into its hump trying to drink it up like a Capri Sun it says right here

250
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,020
Hey, it says that has never worked stop drinking that mountain. Do you co-read Reggie?

251
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,700
Go calm down, buddy. You've got gamer you've got gamer

252
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,940
Energy man, this and you can't get you can't expunge that cuz you can't game

253
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,020
You got don't kick or hurt the camel as an attempt to slow it down. I would never

254
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,700
If you want the camel to trust you he has to look at you like a friend not an enemy

255
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,460
I mean, but I'm writing but here's I don't I need the camera to my friends

256
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,020
I need the camel to respect me like I'm not gonna hurt or kick the camel, but I need the camel to respect me

257
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,660
Or kick the camel, but the idea that I'm its friend like you can't be a friend and a father to your camel

258
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,840
You know what? I mean? Sometimes I arm wrestle Reggie just to remind them

259
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Has to know maintain a firm grip on the reins, but don't pull too hard

260
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,420
just pull the

261
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,800
normal

262
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,420
For camels for camels rain normal amount. They don't give a number how much torque do I need to use?

263
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:43,380
It's so hard to not err on the side of pulling too hard because there's definitely a not too hard amount that I could hold

264
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
It yeah, I'm gonna find myself

265
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,940
negative

266
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,820
Not only that if we're trying to earn this camels respect and I give it a loose like and it's like what was that?

267
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,700
What was that was nothing? Yeah, you got to just be just got to be consistent

268
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,480
Feel like I was thinking about if my camel ran away

269
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,660
It would really there's a level of exotic

270
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
This is that yeah

271
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,520
Exoticity there it is

272
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,520
There's a level of exoticity of an animal where owning that animal

273
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
becomes your

274
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
core define like

275
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Constrictor person or

276
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,120
See I feel like even a boa constrictor is

277
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,600
It's like right on the line of like if someone says you should meet my friend Dan. It would be the first thing

278
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,540
Here's what you got to know about Dan

279
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,880
He owns a camel. I mean I guess probably depending on your locale though because there would be parts where

280
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,800
Yes, he doesn't own a camel and you bet there's a commiserate

281
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:58,000
There's a there's a commiserate level of like there's a animal animal that is exotic

282
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Yeah in camel faring nations as it would be here

283
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you say camel faring or camel fearing? I heard fearing. I heard fearing also, which is like what nation is that?

284
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
That's like

285
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,800
Try to get the camel moving in a circle, all right

286
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,920
You got it. You got a stunt that camel

287
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,240
You've got to let the camel have a little bit of fun by stunting it in a cool circle

288
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,000
How long do you think I don't know how smart camels are

289
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,960
But it gets smart if my camera got away from me

290
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,080
How far do you think it would get before it's like oh shit. I don't know where I'm going

291
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,160
Yeah, I need to go back to Travis. I'm gonna die out here now now while you're stunting in the Sun

292
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,880
Doing doing doughnuts on your camel this next step is pretty important

293
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,280
Try to remain saddled until the camel stops if you get it to circle

294
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,420
You must hang on and let it run and hang on for the fucking right of your life

295
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,420
Why did I do this?

296
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,700
No, not the ramp. You've got to get your center of gravity low and grip it with your legs and just

297
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,500
fucking close your eyes pray to whatever God you believe in and

298
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:13,200
Just just see what happens next. I can't imagine it's that hard though cuz you just put yourself between the two humps

299
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,100
That's exactly what I was about to say Travis

300
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,900
It's so funny you say that cuz I feel like

301
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,420
Camel is them any sort of dromedary would be the most embarrassing to fall off because they have a human divot

302
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,240
It's all right there part of the grand design. Yeah

303
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
perfect perfect

304
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,700
So remain saddled until the camel stops unless consider a quick dismount if all else fails

305
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Sorry, hey your camel just trampled like my family. Yes. Sorry. He was going too fast. Did you pull on it the normal amount?

306
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,740
Yeah, I did. It's the regular not too much right? No. No, that was a trick. I'm just trying to get you with my trick

307
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,500
Damn, that's weird camels are usually so calm. I know that's why I had to jump off

308
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,460
I don't like the vagueness of if all else fails

309
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,500
Because one of the steps was stay saddled

310
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,980
Which then makes me think is that one of the things that would fail at which point someone would be like, hey

311
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,700
I saw you fall off your camel and you go. No, no, no, no

312
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:18,180
Yeah, I jumped off my camel because all else all everything else failed look real quick part to know what to do

313
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,860
Once you've regained control, which is assuming a lot, but you've gotten the camel to chill

314
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,680
You're off the camel and you're not dead one get the camel get off the camel

315
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,240
Once you have it under control once the wild ride is over have the camels it

316
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,900
Yeah steak you and your camels like you fucking bought it

317
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:42,160
And he's out well Charles, that's why you need to do step to keep a safe distance from your camel because and this is a fun fact

318
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Unlike horses camels can kick in all directions

319
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
omni-directional

320
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,480
straight up

321
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,660
Fucking awesome. It could kick straight up. They can kick God

322
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,980
Cloud cloud kickers so cool

323
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:04,660
One of the steps have a calm but like direct discussion with your camel about what the two of you

324
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,200
Could do better next time don't make it all about the camel use a lot of I statements Travis

325
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
You're getting way ahead of me. Fuck me

326
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,660
Yeah

327
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:18,740
Step three is don't run away from the camel because if you turn your back to the camel it may chase after you and kick you

328
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
No matter which which away

329
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,420
There's nowhere you can hide from the camel's mini kicks

330
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,740
That's why I run away to the camel once it's calmed down

331
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:35,760
Like oh the camels calm. It's not wilding out anymore. Bye. You know it's trying to fucking trick you and prank you

332
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,500
Don't make any sharper sudden movements great great great and then step five and this is awesome

333
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:47,900
Try walking in a slow circle around your camel while talking to it calmly. I wish someone would do that to me sometime

334
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,820
I'm gonna ask my therapist next time. I'm like really going

335
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:58,900
Going bonkers in there to just like do a do a lap while giving me some sort of like nice affirmations

336
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,180
That would be that would be very soothing to me a little 360 degree

337
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,740
Since around experience

338
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,060
How about another question yeah, all right? We have time right we do

339
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,060
I just I feel like this is the most helpful thing sometimes

340
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:19,100
I like to end the episode on the most helpful thing and knowing that a camel can kick you no matter where you're at

341
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
even if you're like at home

342
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:30,100
No matter what yeah camels gonna find you I just want to say 360 noscope camel so I can move on with my fucking life

343
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
All right, let's go

344
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:38,420
360 nose all right well can't say I can't I said it just then I realized I already said it mm-hmm

345
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,140
Let's see here my partner, and I have been in the process of buying a house over the past couple months

346
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:50,820
Congratulations, that's a stressful process. No kidding and it hasn't been going too. Well. Oh we recently found out found one

347
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:56,340
That seems perfect for us. It's in our budget. It's nice outside. It's close to both of our jobs the problem

348
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,140
The name of the road it's on is a brown town

349
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,580
Where is this place? Did they say the city? I guess maybe they would know I'm gonna fucking drill down on this

350
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Yeah, I know what are you gonna?

351
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,900
Road no, it's on Brown the name of the road. It's on his brown town

352
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,100
Should I buy this place if I do how can I get over the fact that I live on this street?

353
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,420
This is some rotten realty

354
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,980
Please discuss this while I do a little googling to see if I can find Brown

355
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,640
But we all want to look for Brown town Justin well

356
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,660
We can't some of us have to do podcast Travis so

357
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,340
Just right no bud like right off the top of the the heap here

358
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,780
There's a brown town, Wisconsin brown town, Virginia brown town which is in the Salisbury Township in Ohio

359
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,860
And there's like brown towns all over. There's Chattanooga. There's Battleboro, North Carolina

360
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:52,980
There's Atlanta, Georgia the brown town of Wisconsin has accredited Google Maps. No reviews. So here's one. It's called brown town. That's hilarious

361
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,940
Okay, three stars here's okay

362
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,500
There's a brown town road in Michigan in Pennsylvania in Virginia also in Virginia this so they're all

363
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,660
Okay, we're not gonna doxx this person. There's a lot of brown town roads

364
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:12,060
Here's the problem for me is that there's a part of me that if like one of my friends like if Justin if you were

365
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,060
Like how do I get to my house, and I was like well you just head on down to brown town

366
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,580
That's funny, but then someone goes yeah, I got a package here

367
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,900
Where do I deliver it and then I have to say to that person with my human mouth?

368
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,980
I need you to deliver it to brown town I

369
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,380
That that in that circumstance. I'm going to be embarrassed to tell people where I live

370
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,500
But there will be other moments where I'd be super proud that and I don't know if it balances out

371
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,340
Yeah, I don't think it does I

372
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
What have you just said dookieberg?

373
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,400
Every time you say it to someone. I mean, it's not you will get in here to it

374
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,540
You know what I mean like you'll get in here to it, but then

375
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,340
Eventually like you're you're what you're gonna get tired of is every time you tell someone you're gonna have to stop your entire life

376
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,300
For 15 minutes to unpack yes. No yes. I'm used to it. No it doesn't bother me. Yes. It's really called brown town

377
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,340
No, it's just a regular road

378
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,300
Nothing weird what if you regular stuff happens here? What if you started pronouncing it brone town?

379
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,140
Hmm what about brony town brony town come on the option?

380
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:24,500
Because I don't think brown tone works the same but brone town the housing market being what it is

381
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,120
is if you find a house that you can afford that you like and that you can

382
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,760
Get an offering on and win the house in the game that we call houses

383
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,820
and if it's on a street called

384
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,740
butthole

385
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
like fart Lane

386
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,580
Get it get that house. Yeah, you probably will have an easier time like

387
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,540
Petitioning the city to change just the name of the street on your block

388
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,620
Yeah, well finding another house in in this economy in this economy. Where do you live?

389
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:09,780
I live on 69 shit mouth cul-de-sac all right here. That's a great neighborhood. It's a great neighborhood great school districts and

390
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,580
affordable

391
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,720
Price per square foot we're loving it over here. There is an HOA at the shit mouth cul-de-sac, but

392
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,280
It's you can't you know things are tough. I just bought a new house. Oh, yeah, we're right

393
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,960
Oh, it's on everyone on this street has explosive diarrhea constantly street. Oh

394
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,500
Yeah, yeah, it's hard to send mail cuz you got fitted up in that top little corner there

395
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,800
It's really hard so I had to get a special like labels printed off, but they're lovely they have birds on them

396
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,960
It's nice. Yeah cardinals oh

Oh, that's funny. Let's say take a quick break then we're gonna come back with so much more

398
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
You won't even be able to handle it whoa

399
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360

453
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Want a munch

454
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,240
I want to dance monkeys. I say much you say squat for you. I want a munch

455
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,400
Oh, hey y'all man

456
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,600
This one might be I just I don't know man

457
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,440
No one's making you do this just this one feels like I it is making me do it

458
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,440
But it's like the aura bore like this

459
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:07,000
First off public service announcement. The chacarroni is back Papa John. Thank you. Thank you

460
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,760
Don't get your chacarroni. It's a it's a Jake

461
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,720
Monstrous pepperoni pizza $1 every purchase. It is goes to a charity. It makes me so mad. It's not macaroni

462
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,680
I forgot it was the pizza. Sorry. Go now. It's a chacarroni with cheese. So the chacarroni is back. Baba John's

463
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
No, I want to tell you about

464
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,160
It's just really hard. This is just hard. Take your time. Okay guys Flavortown kitchen, huh?

465
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,520
the partners with lifestyle

466
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,520
brand

467
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,440
middle-class fancy to debut the Rand burger, okay, this is that I I

468
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:54,300
Sadly understand this and it is a fucking wild wild ride. So we're kind of in like, yes. Yes

469
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,520
For sure, yeah, cuz it's like I read it and I I read it several times and my brain couldn't

470
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,080
Put the chunks together. Yeah much the same way as guy. I have no idea what this is. Okay, okay

471
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,940
Can I take a stab? Yeah, take a stab. It's like it's like an Instagram joke account

472
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:23,940
That like makes fun of Guy Fieri sometimes and but now Guy Fieri is like no, let's collab win collab win now

473
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:31,080
Am I close? You're basically got it middle-class fancy is like an Instagram account. You know what I mean?

474
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,800
Where it doesn't mean jokes. Yeah, okay and memes

475
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,480
Are like jokes

476
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:46,760
That's unique remove punchlines and substituted with images. You're familiar with. Yeah, if you need it, that's a meme, right?

477
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,020
So there's all your vocab that you need here the world's most memeable chef

478
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,920
Guy Fieri is taking his Flavortown kitchen a

479
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:02,640
Delivery only restaurant brand powered by virtual dining concepts to heights. What a what a food stew our

480
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,080
Words do to new heights by partnering with the most iconic name in suburban meme culture

481
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,760
Middle-class fancy the partnership not only brings together two brands synonymous with memes

482
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:19,360
But also offers a new menu item the random burger now available for a limited time only

483
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. I know that in this day and age. This is like a really like trite

484
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
observation to make but imagine

485
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,280
taking this press release back in time even just like 30 years and

486
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,880
Handing this to a human being and they would read it and be like what if this is this is what is this?

487
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,840
Did you cut up a bunch of words in a magazine and throw them into the air and this is how they land like none

488
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:55,000
Of this makes sense. I get it for the fact. No, I know listen you get it because you understand

489
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Individually what all these words beam

490
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,960
But without any context whatsoever, you could not put this together

491
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,040
Like sans context clues this these words mean nothing on their own

492
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,720
so

493
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,240
Middle some middle-class fancy is a meme account from Instagram and does seem to credit people for their memes sometimes

494
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,480
I can't really give a definitive answer on that but they do dunk on Guy Fieri and Guy Fieri

495
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,400
I guess loved the dunking so much that he wanted a collab

496
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,040
Millions of followers view middle-class fancies unique perspective on the absurdities of suburban lifestyle from jokes about air fryers to grilling battles

497
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Integrating Guy Fieri's Flavortown kitchen into the middle-class fancy universe led Fieri to naming a burger after their beloved character Rand

498
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,000
Like I in Rand, so this is yeah, so this is like the first burger that is also an inside

499
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Joke, you know what I mean? I

500
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,760
Started middle-class fancy as an exaggerated version of the life. I grew up around coming from a small town in Cedar Town, Georgia

501
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,680
It's a small town in Cedar Town, Georgia. That must be a pretty fucking small town

502
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,040
It's like safety town. It's like safety town

503
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,840
I already had a different meme account where I put I don't care about someone who is

504
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,240
More successful than me because they post memes. I need this. That's a shame. There's a lot of people you've just described

505
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,920
I know I rolled out a lot of people, huh? Sorry, I prefer books by author wait, so people make money from posting

506
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Huge part of middle-class fancy universe

507
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,040
Involves the restaurant experience as well. I'm beyond excited to work with guy and I know my audience

508
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,840
What we love what we have in store for them. It's I mean, it's a burger

509
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,080
Here's here's the here's a quote from Guy Fieri and I know this one isn't funny. I'm really struggling with it

510
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,160
I'm being honest about that and that's worth something. It's vulnerable

511
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,960
Meme or no. Let me do my Guy Fieri voice

512
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,000
Meme or no meme Rand is a real dude and a formidable grill master says Guy Fieri

513
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,720
So in recognition of his true backyard burger badassery

514
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,280
I'm allowing Rand a limited time only trip through flavor town

515
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,640
That your Guy Fieri Justin

516
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,240
Yeah

517
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,520
Scares the shit out of me. What's wrong with him? We can we have time we can sort of zero in do them again

518
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Just say that again

519
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's it's a it's a he wants to fight me yeah, yeah

520
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,680
Yeah, yeah, are the very least challenge my preconceptions

521
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,960
Do you not do you not get the impression that Guy Fieri wants to fight food a lot? Oh fight food. Yeah, that's interesting

522
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:48,580
I don't want to take this ham Sammy out back and kick its balls. Yeah, that's cool that I get

523
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:56,260
That I get if he said I named this burger after I mean the burgers name

524
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:02,940
That's a character on an Instagram meme feed. Yeah, what is happening? Well, it's 2021 and nothing means anything anymore

525
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,380
No, this means something and this means something to me. Does it? Yeah

526
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:14,620
What's it mean to you Griffin? That's funny when one funny thing does a funny thing with another funny thing?

527
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:20,060
That's good shit, man. Well, I mean you can get it if you want it you guys know

528
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:27,420
But you don't even need a restaurant to have a restaurant anymore Guy Fieri that you get the idea like Flavortown kitchen

529
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,820
This is not a rest. This is not a building you can go to

530
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,580
You just tell Uber Eats you want it and Guy Fieri ships it to you or something

531
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:43,380
Some like is there a hook my favorite burger in Huntington? Yeah is the mr. Beast burger, which is delivered

532
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:50,020
Via a YouTube account called mr. Beast and he started a bunch of burger places hundreds

533
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,460
throughout the u.s

534
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,440
It's you that's the best burger in town. It seems from this YouTube guy

535
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,060
I see the one who gives people

536
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:03,900
Bunches of money and you watch mr. Beast and you think like damn this little dude's like a little publishers clearinghouse. Look at this

537
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,060
gentleman

538
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
Yeah, he goes place to place

539
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,300
Sometimes he gets hunted by the FBI and if the FBI catches him he gives him 10 10,000

540
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
100 G's

541
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,480
Well, it's not the whole FBI it's just one guy so and I have to imagine he's like a disgrace

542
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,060
Cuz I can't imagine they let their best people do this

543
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,940
But maybe I don't know. All right, that's that's it. It's like I this is why I'm saying and this is why I'm struggling with

544
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,940
it like I

545
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:42,260
You don't know if it's normal or not. It's not that I know if it's normal. It's like I feel like

546
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,500
the we have crossed some sort of

547
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,740
You to the fighting lot what a tuba con

548
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,580
That's could be it. It's like it. It's like a dividing line where no, it's like more of like a

549
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:04,020
We've broken the memetic seal. So you the thing the fact that it is wild is

550
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,100
Is the point the cruelty is the point, you know?

551
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,900
Yeah, it is why yes, that's right. It is wild and that's why a lot of these products. They're not even like

552
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,600
For sale in a wide-reaching way. It's just like yeah, we did a really stupid thing

553
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,440
Well, you care about it and that pushes you into a well and forces you to tweet about it

554
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,740
This is the thing we have reached a point now

555
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,940
We're like the pendulum is gonna swing back the other way and pretty soon like a big news story

556
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,380
It's gonna be like McDonald's saying like yeah, we're making a new burger and that's it

557
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,940
It's just a new burger and it has ingredients that we thought you would like

558
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:46,300
The only human part of the fast the casual dining industry anymore. The only human part is that there's

559
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,980
Everybody's doing a lot more

560
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:56,380
Plants you can eat a lot this which seems good in my stupid opinion, you know, it seems good. Yeah plants

561
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,580
All right, that was that was a challenging one

562
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,540
It's a challenging one right because I don't know. I don't know. Is that worth reporting?

563
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:12,300
Is that a new story for much squat? I don't know because that it's the point the that is the point, you know

564
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:19,540
It's not an exception anymore. It is the rule that exactly. Yeah, Trav. I mean, yeah, it doesn't require a

565
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,900
Me to do it. Like yeah

566
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,540
Guy did his own munch squad kind of you know what I mean?

567
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,220
It's like I I'll take this from you too

568
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,140
I'll tell you what would be an exciting one squad is if you could find a press release that was like this meme account

569
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,940
Tried to get Guy Fieri to do a burger with him and Guy Fieri said no

570
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,900
I'm not gonna do that. That sounds too silly. I wish I could get I mean

571
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,900
I've been truck we've been trying to get guy on the show for

572
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,260
You got a partner with him

573
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,340
Got a partner with him. Maybe that's it. Maybe if we had a great character, he could do a burger my burger my burger me

574
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,420
All right burgers. Okay. Now you are now you are actually cooking with gas two burgers and yourself

575
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,420
That's it it sounded like I would get three burgers

576
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,220
Me it's my burger my burger me and you have to eat both of them while guy watches

577
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,380
I got an idea for a new hot dog. Oh

578
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,580
Yeah called stink dogs. Get at me guy, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is

579
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:25,020
Oh, unless you make the connection I have a new idea for a hot dog called a not dog

580
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,380
And I'm just gonna tell you what it is. It's an empty bun

581
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,660
All right. Do you get it? That's good. You can put whatever you want in there

582
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:38,980
It's your it's your blue sky, but not a hot dog. No speaking speaking, which I want to tell you guys

583
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:46,660
Yeah, thanks, right and I got hot dogs for dinner and there was an extra hot dog

584
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,340
I think you know, we hit we had the whole nine yards buns the whole thing

585
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,340
We ended up I was cleaning up at the end of the night, right? Yeah, and I I

586
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,760
There's a bag of bun. Yeah, and I went to go store it

587
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,220
My wife, uh-huh

588
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
my wife had

589
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,940
Put the one leftover hot dog we had. Yeah

590
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:16,340
Into the one remaining bun that we have and then wrapped it back up in the hot dog bun bag

591
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:21,460
Cool. And left it on the counter. I like that. Have you ever heard anything more treacherous in your entire life?

592
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,620
I mean, okay if you're at an outdoor picnic and you have to protect it from the elements

593
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,580
But I'm imagining you don't got buzz buzz flies in your kitchen. Where does that fit into the

594
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,660
Like

595
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:41,940
Procedures of food handling we're like now you have this and I didn't know about it. That's just really important

596
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:48,020
Yeah, to me. It's a bun in a bag. There's one bun in the bag left time to store this with buns

597
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,820
That is I think that is the the cat because they've if if it was my wife

598
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,940
my wife, thank you and

599
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:04,140
She put the hot dog in the bun and then loudly announced I'm gonna wrap this up that

600
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,860
Right fine. Let me know but you gotta let you gotta let Justin know you gotta let Justin know

601
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,180
It's the on the counter that also bothers me because I feel the people of this world

602
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:21,420
On on the whole have way too. They're too blase about the old danger zone of

603
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,660
Yeah, and 40 to 140 folks. It's more than four hours

604
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,140
You got a chuck it you just broke it through the danger zone sometimes

605
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:37,900
Sometimes even then I feel personally is pushing it where if I've been at a party and it's been like two hours

606
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,340
I'm like, oh we could just oh, you know, nobody's picking at this anymore

607
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:46,740
Oh if we could just go ahead and put this back in the old refrigerator. Oh

608
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,020
Travis you've actually tied in beautifully to our next question. All right. I have a simple query today

609
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,380
What's the appropriate time to delete someone's contact information?

610
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,180
I have some people from high school in my phone and old work contacts

611
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:06,820
How long without being in touch is it good enough to simply purge my phone of their existence? That's from living on the lam. I

612
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
have

613
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,580
Roughly

614
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:18,380
1500 people. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I have an exact number. Okay, it's only 900 contacts in my contacts

615
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,420
Wow, because at some point iCloud was like hey you want every single person

616
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,700
You've ever received an email from to be added to your contacts, right? And sometimes you click through those contacts

617
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,220
It's like oh, we didn't think you'd actually click on it. We don't know

618
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,460
Yeah, we can't get a hold of these persons off the greatest parts were concerned

619
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,340
Yeah, I have PR or

620
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,140
HR from AOL

621
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:48,180
So if I need to reach out to AOL HR to get something taken care of I can just knock that knock that right out

622
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:54,780
I this weird thing happened at some point between Teresa and I like sharing computers and

623
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,340
Backups of phones and being on like the same AT&T account

624
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:07,300
Somehow our phones have now melded and all of her contacts are mixed with my contacts in my phone and all of my contacts

625
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,300
are mixed with her contacts and her phone and

626
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:14,500
So is created this thing where I'll be searching for a number a name will come up and I'm like who the fuck I?

627
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,700
I don't know this Eric person and Trace is like, oh

628
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,100
That's a guy I went to high school with and I'll look at it and think I should delete that

629
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,260
Then I won't because what if I need to contact air? I I have a I have a

630
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:34,260
Okay, there's an impulse to leave every contact on there. I get that at the same time though

631
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,220
Every day you do that is another day. You run the risk of accidentally pressing the dial, but we've all done

632
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,220
Yep, actually pressing the dial button

633
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,460
I

634
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,300
Think you delete it when you if you were to call that person would have

635
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:55,860
Absolutely, no possible. There are some people that are so removed from me in terms of

636
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:03,100
Be it like actual geographic space or time or life events. Yes, right

637
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,580
Yeah, where a call to them would be

638
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,140
utterly

639
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:13,460
Here's my phone would instantly become a burner. I'd have to put it into a hydraulic press but this is

640
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,300
This is the problem to go back to like the age

641
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,780
We live in right as the issue is that like and maybe this is a very specific problem

642
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,500
But I don't think so because more and more people are turning to internet content creation for a job

643
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,040
Is that you run the risk of a kid you go up went to high school with right who has your same phone number?

644
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,700
like

645
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:37,140
You know following your Instagram account where you post your art or listening your podcast or whatever and texting you like I love the show

646
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,780
And you've deleted it. It's just a random number and you're like

647
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:46,460
Fucking nightmare. Yeah, and they're like no no no we like we're best friends for eight years I

648
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Have rust frushtick in my contact. You can delete four four separate times

649
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,060
What do I need? Why does he have four cell phone?

650
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,280
I have dad in my phone twice and I went to numbers

651
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,980
And I have to remember every time like which was my real dad

652
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:08,340
I have Richard Garriott in my phone for some I can text Richard Garriott right now and be like let me get all up in

653
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,960
Heaven do take me to space take me your wonderful castle rich

654
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,140
I'm trying to think of like what's the weird what's one I could get rid of let's see is that cuz

655
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,860
Well, it's just sometimes. I have numbers saved to my phone for like businesses

656
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,540
Yeah, I don't go to like I don't know where it's just like well

657
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:30,420
I checked this enough times that like it's just I'm just gonna save it and then it's like well

658
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,740
How often am I calling you know the Huntington Museum of Art?

659
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,700
You know I could probably get rid of that one we can do another question, okay?

660
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,100
There's a good one this this was a good one

661
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,140
The local university has obtained a rare corpse flower

662
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:55,340
And I want to sounds like the beginning of a murder mystery go on and I want to go see it because it's a once-in-lifetime

663
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:00,180
Opportunity, but my girlfriend doesn't want to go with me because it will smell bad like a corpse

664
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:06,700
How do I convince her to come experience this nasty blooming flower with me? That's from noxious in Knoxville

665
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:12,340
Oh, is that it's weird to think that there are people in this world that when you're like smell how bad this smells

666
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,260
They're not like okay

667
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,500
Right like yeah, that's me. I was like oh my god. It smells terrible

668
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:26,420
Does it like it's that's see it like I've been at a funeral homes where they had smelling salts, and it's all I wanted

669
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:32,060
Oh, I've hit the smelling salts. Oh, yeah, it does not feel good. It's no you got it

670
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,820
But you got to do it like you got to know what this thing you got to know what that stink is like I?

671
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,700
Don't like the smell of flowers, so this wouldn't really stress me out that much

672
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,340
Smell flowers grosses me out. Why?

673
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,540
Because that makes me because the art because I have at some point

674
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,540
some part of my brain

675
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,140
Connected funerals and flowers, and that's where I'm at now

676
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:00,700
Get out of it. That's where I'm at. That's what my brain if I have fresh good people give me flowers

677
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,340
I want to cry. I hate I can't stand smell flower really don't like them. I don't like them

678
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,920
I'll try this court flower. I guess, but maybe I could just rule the whole category now, but

679
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,300
flower

680
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,960
Maybe that would be what purges your system

681
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,580
Maybe I don't think I I don't think so

682
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:26,620
You know some if somebody doesn't want to go do something stinky. I think you gotta respect it. You know you're that's a very legitimate

683
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,020
We've gotten to where we're at as a species

684
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,020
by

685
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:37,020
Respecting the desire to not smell stinky thing yeah a lot of times

686
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:42,300
That's earth trying to tell you this poison. I would also say that there is a good distance

687
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,820
Along the way of this journey that your girlfriend could accompany you right up to but not including

688
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,100
Smelling the bad bad stinky flower that would make it a day together

689
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,120
Right a yeah

690
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,120
You don't need to share this experience if they don't if if someone said hey Travis

691
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:04,620
There's a flower down at local university that smells like stinky old garbage juice

692
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,860
That's been left out in the Sun come with it with me. I'd be like no no no and they'd be like oh

693
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:14,660
I thought we were friends. Let me augment that though. Just a little bit Travis. There's an

694
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,180
incredibly rare

695
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:23,460
Flower that smells like stinky garbage juice that you will never get the chance again to smell down to university come down

696
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,220
That's you know I do that. I know that's what I'm saying like I want to eat durian fruit

697
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:35,700
And like that's the one thing that like that dude from bizarre foods is like this fucking gross. I hate this shit

698
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,100
I'm like I want to eat that nasty ass fruit. Yeah

699
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:44,580
If Andrew Zimmern hates it. I'll fucking chomp it. I want to be braver than him

700
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:50,900
I want to know that I'm the braver man a ship in harbor is safe. Go smell the fucking flower is awesome

701
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,860
This person already wants to smell the flower they need to convince someone else to smell the flower

702
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,780
Hey, go smell the flower and be like it's kicked ass you got I'm gonna have to disagree with this one

703
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,780
All right

704
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:07,160
because here's the thing if they there is a chance now that that person goes up and smell it and

705
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:13,180
After like question asker has like go to them on and cajole them to do it and then they smell like yeah

706
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:19,280
Oh fucking awful, and I hate that that happened right and now it's that thing and then the next time you're like hey

707
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,100
Go do this thing with me. I'm going to this weird Renaissance Festival

708
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,540
And they're like I don't know that I want to go to that you've lost all bargaining power

709
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:32,380
No, because if you say come smell this stinky ass rotten corpse flower with me

710
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,180
And then you go and they're like that smelled so bad, and you can say like yeah, I

711
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,460
Did say that it's not like you're going to saying like hey?

712
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,380
we're gonna go to the Renaissance Fair and get overcharged for dry turkey and

713
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,140
And we're gonna feel not confident in our costumes, and they'll be like well

714
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:54,700
That's a you were also not selling this very well. I don't know go smell the flower man shipping Harbor

715
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,580
I don't think you should make people smell things. They don't want to smell

716
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:02,180
Okay, shipping her well, but you could have a trade-off and say like you smell this flower

717
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,180
And then I'll smell something you want me to smell

718
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,660
It would be kind of fun to be at a place where you could just loudly say pee you that is true

719
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,180
You know the main thing

720
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:18,660
Pee yeah, and people would be like that's exactly the reaction. We're going for thank you so much while

721
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,980
You're waiting in line to smell it

722
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:27,980
Just be like pee you and people like you can already we're outside the building

723
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:34,220
And you're like yeah, it smells so you guys can't smell that ooh stinky Pee you this is I actually I have a similar feel

724
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:39,700
If somebody was like hey, let's go to that butterfly garden exhibition. I'm like no. Thank you. That's no no

725
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,980

Tsunamis on the other side of the planet you know yes, yes, yes, yes

733
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,100
I've seen the Ashton Kutcher movie butterfly absolutely where he goes to that butterfly

734
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:28,020
Conservatory, and he accidentally eats three butterflies and a volcano erupts and he turns into butterfly man

735
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:31,800
We've all seen the movie that's funny that part's cool. I like his butterfly man

In case you missed out along those same lines Teresa, and I had to cancel the dragon con appearance

742
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,660
It was a lot of factors at play, but uh yeah, so I don't

743
