1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,520
You're not fucking Bono, sit down in the chair.

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,400
That's how Bono starts his shows is he runs up and high fives you.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
I know one thing about Bono.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
I assume Bono doesn't get winded.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
Randy Kraut.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Hi everybody.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Hey guys.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:46,000
I loaded up my computer to get the Yahoo's ready, get the Yahoo oven preheated to 350.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Travis, you want to tell me what popped up as soon as I typed in my password?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,240
That would be Reba McEntire's fancy.

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
That's right.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
It's on Spotify premium.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,280
He knows what you need, he's making the best use of it too.

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,640
I just got super nervous all of a sudden.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,000
Are you guys going to be cool or are you going to be dicks?

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
Are you guys cool?

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
I don't know which one that was.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I don't know.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Yeah.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold on.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Welcome to my brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era.

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm the sweet baby brother.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Oh shit.

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
And we're done.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
And we're done.

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,120
Thanks for listening everybody.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm the sweet baby brother, Griffin.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,920
That'd be a tight stinger.

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
Every time he said dope shit, it'd be like, that was our outro music.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
We'll do a show first and then we'll just try it again.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
We'll come back around.

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
We'll come back around.

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
Don't worry.

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,160
Keep the finger on the button though, because you don't know.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,440
Because if it starts to go bad, we are dipping.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,040
We will fucking eject.

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,680
Let that be a warning to you.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Hello, Los Angeles.

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Hi, Los Angeles.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
Sorry we haven't, we haven't been to you in a while.

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,160
I guess we haven't been to Los Angeles proper like ever.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,800
We've performed a couple of times at Lake Arrowhead, which is LA adjacent, I guess.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Yeah.

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,000
I mean, it's like five hours away, so not like super adjacent.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Depending on fog.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
People here hate Lake Arrowhead?

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who is booing?

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's like the best.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Boo!

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Beautiful artificial lakes on the top of mountains.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, thank you.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's perfect.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Just like I imagined heaven to be.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,480
They give you free, lots of bacon, there's always bacon up there.

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,240
Is anybody else here living in mortal terror of the fact that the Los Angeles Kings just

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,800
won the Stanley Cup and, oh, sorry, spoilers, I guess.

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Were you waiting?

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
No.

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,360
No, I mean, it's not going to be a spoiler.

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,680
You're going to cross the threshold of this building and it's going to be a nuclear wasteland

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
outside.

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
You're like, oh, I guess we won.

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Sweet.

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,240
Except my, you know, my entire neighborhood's destroyed, but everything else is totally

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
sweet.

69
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm not worried as much about hockey fans writing.

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,040
They seem like a polite, kind of chilled out people to me.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
They're just so happy people are paying attention.

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,280
I need my gummy berry juice.

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:12,560
So, between the World Cup happening and the LA Kings winning, somewhere there is a man

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,400
with very specific sports taste who's very happy tonight, who really feels like the superstar.

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Like, finally.

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
You know what?

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,640
This feels like the start of something.

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,040
I think we're finally going to get the attention we deserve.

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,320
So this is, raise your hand, is there anybody here for the first time who's never listened

80
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
to our program?

81
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Never heard the show before.

82
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
That's awesome.

83
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Cool.

84
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Fantastic.

85
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Well, welcome to you.

86
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
You're wearing a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt.

87
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
How did that happen?

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
I'm fucking into that.

89
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
What the fuck is your story?

90
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Poser.

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Poser.

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
We're going to get him up here later and I want to learn some things about that man.

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,960
I want to unfold his story.

94
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,760
I did it when I saw live for the first time, so don't feel bad.

95
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
I got to see that live.

96
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
I wish I had seen live.

97
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
That was bullshit.

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
You know what I was going to say?

99
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,860
I was going to say an actual concert I've been to, which is Dave Matthews' band, but

100
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,600
you know I was into that.

101
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
No lie.

102
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,440
So this is a device show where we take your questions, your queries, and turn them Aquame-like

103
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,560
into wisdom.

104
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,320
We might have some questions from the audience here, so if you want to try to cook something

105
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,280
up in your head that is real and a problem we can fix for you.

106
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
And not a bummer.

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Not a bummer.

108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,640
Not a bummer, so help me God.

109
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,160
We are nice people.

110
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,320
Talk to us about, we'll answer your bummer questions off the air, I guess, fun party.

111
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
But not on the show.

112
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,840
And no, like, tell them how many jokes about poop and stuff.

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
No poop jokes.

114
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
No poop jokes.

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Those are for us.

116
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Those are for us only.

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Not for you.

118
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Those are for adults only.

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,880
Those are for comedy adults only, and they need to be handled carefully with precision.

120
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,280
So you're not ready for that.

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
Trust us.

122
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,320
Travis, how about a question?

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,920
Okay, great.

124
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,520
These were also asked by people here, correct?

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Yeah.

126
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
I believe so.

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Let's see.

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,240
Oh, I won't read the person because it's the tag line.

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,280
I have a lot of vivid weird dreams that more often than not contain people in my day-to-day

130
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
life.

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Naked, and they're like on top of me and cool stuff.

132
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
It's implied, right?

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Okay.

134
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,080
In my day-to-day life, doing something I think is worth mentioning to them.

135
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
My question is this.

136
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Is it socially acceptable to tell people that I've dreamt about them, or say you were in

137
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,880
my dream last night, or will I be giving everyone I know the willies by doing this?

138
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,920
And that's from I've even done it to Justin.

139
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Woof.

140
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Hachi-machi.

141
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,600
You know, we try to keep-

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,760
Do you want to raise your hand if you're here and you did this?

143
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
We try to keep-

144
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
You did this terrible, terrible thing?

145
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
I don't see a hand.

146
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Somewhere in the void.

147
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Can you howl?

148
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
No, no, no.

149
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
It's better this way.

150
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
No, don't do that.

151
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
It's better.

152
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,120
Could you come down and explain your dream about Justin in graphic detail?

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,840
It's way better for the podcast that I have to do than if I don't know what you look like

154
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,720
and I know you're just out there waiting.

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,480
That's super cool for my stress levels.

156
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,000
I appreciate it.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,360
That way, I can look at every face and wonder, is it them?

158
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,360
And then look at some other faces and think, well, maybe it's them.

159
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Very flattering.

160
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
All right.

161
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,320
If there's no level of innocuousness of the subject matter of your dream, it could just

162
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,920
be like, me, you, and Alf eating a hot dog.

163
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,160
And then I would immediately think, and then we had a crazy Alf three-way and it was totally

164
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
awesome.

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,900
That was the part of the dream that you didn't tell me about, but I know that you dreamt

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,120
about fucking me and Alf at the same time.

167
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Yeah.

168
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Because here's the problem.

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,080
As soon as you broached the subject, you were in my dream last night.

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Right.

171
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
The person hears fucking me.

172
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
We had a wobbly age with Alf and it was totally great.

173
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,240
It was a lowercase H. Having sex with Alf.

174
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,560
Two in the snout and one's left out.

175
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Yikes.

176
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,120
Sex with Alf.

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
I want you guys to know there's a joke about eating Alf.

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
Two in the snout and no time to pout.

179
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,520
Have some sex with Alf.

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
That's a new teen trend.

181
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
It's called Shumwaying.

182
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Yikes.

183
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:00,920
No, fucking of course not.

184
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,200
Under no circumstances, no.

185
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,800
There's a reason that dreams only happen in your head and it's because it's for you.

186
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,360
Well, unless you're Travis.

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Travis, you tell a lot.

188
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I love you.

189
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
You're my brother.

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
My dreams are fucking awesome.

191
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Yeah.

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Totally.

193
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Totally.

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Totally.

195
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Yeah.

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Totally.

197
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
No, yeah, totally.

198
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Totally.

199
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Totally.

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Sure.

201
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,400
I remember a lot of them just because of the great stories that go on in there and that

202
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,240
beautiful head of yours, all the great dream stories.

203
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,440
If any of you want to hear my dreams later, just let me know.

204
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
How about a Yahoo answer?

205
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
That's it?

206
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Did we fucking answer that?

207
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
That's fucking it.

208
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Hey, Cooper, keep your shit to yourself.

209
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
I mean, it's not acceptable.

210
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I know it's not creepy.

211
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,440
I know you're not dreaming about having sex with him, but that's what people are going

212
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
to think.

213
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
It implies intimacy.

214
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
No question.

215
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
No, it's inappropriate.

216
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Don't ever do it.

217
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Ever.

218
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Just stop dreaming.

219
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Stop dreaming.

220
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Let your dreams die.

221
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
I'm 33.

222
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
It ain't hard, gang.

223
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Come on.

224
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,000
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport, who is here tonight.

225
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Drew Davenport.

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Come on.

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Get the fuck up here.

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Drew Davenport, stand up and come to the stage.

229
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Fucking keep it going.

231
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I want five uninterrupted minutes of applause.

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come here.

233
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Get the fuck over here.

234
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Drew Davenport, an emerald level Yahoo answer shaman, finally.

235
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

236
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is what it sounds like when doves cry.

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,640
Drew, thank you so much for saving our program time and time again.

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,400
He's a lot taller than I thought he was going to be.

239
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Man, if I was as tall as you, Drew, I would have no time for looking for answers.

240
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I'd be too busy beating ass.

241
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Everybody, give it up for Drew fucking Davenport.

242
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
You're all unnoticed.

243
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Wind beneath my wings.

244
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Drew Davenport.

245
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Drew Davenport.

246
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Drew Davenport.

247
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
If it weren't for Drew Davenport, the pre-show would have been over.

248
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
You're all unnoticed.

249
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
You're all unnoticed.

250
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
You're all unnoticed.

251
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
You're all unnoticed.

252
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You're all unnoticed.

253
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,600
If it weren't for Drew Davenport, the production time that I would put into this show would

254
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,960
be like 20 minutes more a week, but that's a lot.

255
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
That's a lot for me.

256
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Thank you.

257
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,880
If you're listening at home, he was eight feet tall.

258
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,800
Eight feet if he was an inch.

259
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,320
As broad as a bull.

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,560
There's a service called Yahoo Answers and we dig into it.

261
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,240
For you three new people.

262
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,720
No, I'm going to keep talking to them.

263
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,840
I want to win them over.

264
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Your business I have.

265
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,960
I want to win the new business.

266
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,480
We try to answer them to the best of our abilities.

267
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,200
When I say we find them, I mean Drew Davenport.

268
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Almost exclusively.

269
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
Almost exclusively Drew Davenport finds them.

270
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,180
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

271
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,260
This Yahoo Answer was asked by a suspended account.

272
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,000
Why were they suspended, you asked?

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,240
How could I make wee bowling sexy?

274
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,880
So my girlfriend and I have a habit of trying to make simple everyday things into something

275
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
remotely sexy.

276
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,720
So they're not trying super hard.

277
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
No, yeah.

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,760
Our bar is low.

279
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,040
You're making that grilled cheese, why don't you get a bowl out?

280
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Sure.

281
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
My chatbook's looking mighty balanced.

282
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,840
Does anyone have any clue how we can make something like wee bowling sexy?

283
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,480
Also I do realize this is a ridiculous question.

284
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,480
They should just fucking have some sort of script on Yahoo Answers that immediately puts

285
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
that at the bottom of everybody's question.

286
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,280
That's about putting Doritos in your butt, like yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.

287
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
What about this?

288
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I got an answer.

289
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,160
What if you play wee bowling with your balls out?

290
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Don't fucking salt my game, Travis.

291
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,160
You play wee bowling, and while you're playing it.

292
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Put the kids to bed.

293
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,240
Put the kids right in the sleepy town.

294
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
You play wee bowling.

295
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Here comes the sex.

296
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Quiet, quiet.

297
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
While you're playing it.

298
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
What are you doing?

299
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You have a sex.

300
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
That is going to throw off your handicapped.

301
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Yeah.

302
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:12,240
No question about it.

303
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Too hot for TV.

304
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Sorry.

305
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Keep that.

306
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
A bowling handicap?

307
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
It's a thing.

308
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
It's a thing.

309
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I guess.

310
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Like bumpers?

311
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
You're bumping something.

312
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Yeah.

313
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Yeah.

314
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Genitals.

315
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Like your genitals.

316
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Genitals.

317
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Yeah.

318
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Genitals.

319
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Genitals.

320
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Genitals.

321
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Genitals.

322
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
That's what we're doing in New York.

323
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Talking about your genitals.

324
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Yeah.

325
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
You're bumping your genitals.

326
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Ah.

327
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
I saw some rocket loot being tossed around.

328
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
That would probably be integral.

329
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Well, I mean.

330
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
You got to be careful.

331
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
You got to be careful.

332
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Because you'll throw it right out of your hand.

333
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Yeah.

334
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
You'll smash that TV to fucking bits.

335
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
There's nothing sexy about breaking your television.

336
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,520
That'll kill the mood.

337
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
When you're doing that, though, do you use protection?

338
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,560
By which I mean use the Wiimote wrist strap.

339
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
On your wiener?

340
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
No.

341
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,400
On your fucking wrist, Travis.

342
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,120
On your fucking degenerate?

343
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
No.

344
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
No.

345
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Listen.

346
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
I said degenerate.

347
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
But I'm not here to pass judgment.

348
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
No.

349
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Listen.

350
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
If you like them twerked, you like them squeezed, you like them worked, whatever.

351
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
It pleases.

352
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
You like them Wiimoted, I guess.

353
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
You like them.

354
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Okay.

355
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
I guess.

356
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
I'm trying to be really accepting.

357
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,240
It's my new thing for 2014.

358
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Sorry.

359
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
2013.

360
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
No.

361
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Sorry.

362
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
2014?

363
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
20-forward.

364
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
20-forward.

365
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
There we go.

366
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Yeah.

367
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
That was a test to find the true fans.

368
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Yeah.

369
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
That's a motto we've really subscribed to.

370
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Yeah.

371
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Yeah.

372
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Well, we did some live shows this year.

373
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
We've been doing good about that.

374
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
I guess that's true.

375
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Can I give you a sneak preview?

376
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Because I'll forget about it.

377
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Sure.

378
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
And what I was thinking for next year.

379
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah.

380
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
20-spliff-teen.

381
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Sure.

382
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,240
He's so bad.

383
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,000
What won't he say?

384
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Like drugs?

385
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh.

386
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay.

387
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Gotcha.

388
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah.

389
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How about a regular non-Yahoo?

390
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

391
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Great.

392
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That also comes from hopefully someone in the audience.

393
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Can we call these Google questions?

394
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That might be fun.

395
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I mean, they're all Gmail.

396
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry.

397
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Go ahead.

398
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No.

399
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Let's talk more about web platforms.

400
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right.

401
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Spliff-teen.

402
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Got it.

404
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Read the question.

405
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Come on.

406
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How do I prepare myself to be robbed?

407
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Terrific.

408
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,640
We should all actually be thinking about this legitimately.

409
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,960
I have many examples of this, but one time my cousin jumped out of the bushes and saw

410
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
me and scared me.

411
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,360
My knees locked and I fell over like a fainting goat.

412
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
It was very embarrassing.

413
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,040
What if this happens when an assailant tries to jump me with a knife?

414
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,680
I want to stay on my ground and at least seem threatening.

415
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,480
How do I get tougher and less scared of people jumping out and surprising me?

416
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,680
And that's from neither fight nor flight in the fourth round.

417
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Did you actually fucking manage to get in the fourth row?

418
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Nailed it.

419
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
God damn.

420
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Nailed it.

421
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
That's dedication right there.

422
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
That's a called shot.

423
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Sorry.

424
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
What's your name?

425
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
JP.

426
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
JP.

427
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,480
JP.

428
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
No you're fine.

429
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
See how you're fine.

430
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,960
I don't think it's as bad as you thought it was going to be.

431
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,920
Hey everybody, if you see JP later after the show, just give him a little spook.

432
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
That's it.

433
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
We got to toughen you up.

434
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
We're going to toughen you up.

435
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
This is immersion therapy, JP.

436
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
We got to rock the gauntlet.

437
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,800
That's how Daredevil got started.

438
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,960
People just kept spooking him and spooking him and spooking him.

439
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
And then he went blind.

440
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
He did go blind.

441
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
He went blind from the spooks.

442
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Not from...

443
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
No, it was like ass spooking him.

444
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Oh God, I spooked you too hard.

445
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I spooked you too hard.

446
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
You're eyeballing.

447
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I'll be your friend forever.

448
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,520
My name's Foggy Nelson, backstory, origin, one guy, thank you, sir.

449
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,520
In Daredevil's...

450
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
I would throw this out, JP.

451
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
A knife.

452
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
What?

453
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Whoa.

454
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Look out.

455
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,640
Also, I'm going to fucking break you of saying let me throw this out.

456
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Okay.

457
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
It's the last thing I do.

458
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Holy shit.

459
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Thank you.

460
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I can't believe...

461
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Can we like come up with some sort of audience response?

462
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Like some sort of like great chorus?

463
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Does anyone have a can full of pennies you can shake at me when I do it?

464
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
No, no can.

465
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,400
I was taught by my parents, and I assume my brothers were too, that when accosted-

466
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Make yourself small.

467
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,720
By a potential robber, you seem as non-threatening as possible.

468
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Sure.

469
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
You say, yes, of course, sir.

470
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Yes.

471
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Here you go.

472
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Or madam, let's not be sexist.

473
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Yeah.

474
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,400
Sir or madam, who is robbing me at this moment, here are all my belongings.

475
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Thank you very much.

476
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Yeah, please take them.

477
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
And congratulations.

478
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
This is some great stuff.

479
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,920
I hope you enjoy them more than I do.

480
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,880
You have bested me.

481
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,040
Listen, I'll be a good sport in this regard.

482
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,240
You have won this encounter.

483
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,360
And let me also congratulate you on your choice of targets.

484
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
You have couldn't have-

485
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,880
You have done very well.

486
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,120
And then you lay on your back and pee all over yourself to show submission.

487
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,920
Out of curiosity, what could I do better in the future to prevent myself from being such

488
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
an obvious target robber?

489
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm just going to slide this comment card across the table.

490
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,480
If you could fill that out before you leave, I appreciate it.

491
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Have you experienced better?

492
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,320
Was I not robbable, robbable, or very robbable?

493
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:58,840
JP, you've got to get diesel.

494
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,360
There's the only one kind of person that's not afraid of other people.

495
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Drew Davenport.

496
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Okay, there's two.

497
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Drew Davenport.

498
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Drew Davenport.

499
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
And the Lou Ferrigno's of the world.

500
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
These super diesel folks.

501
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,240
I would fold those two categories sort of in together.

502
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Yeah.

503
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
He is Ferrigno in scale.

504
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
You're Drew Ferrigno's.

505
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Drew Ferrigno.

506
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Drew Ferrigno.

507
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
If you get Drew Ferrigno diesel, and then no one will mess with you.

508
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,440
Except for Lou Ferrigno, and then it's just a battle of titans between the two of you.

509
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,840
We actually should, like, if you could not mess up the curve, because we need as many

510
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,720
people sort of like looking like obvious targets for robbery as possible.

511
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Yeah, yeah.

512
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
It helps us to blend in.

513
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I try to look so tough.

514
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,040
I've only been robbed once, and you could do the tactic which I employed, which worked

515
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,480
out like super well for me, which is to lie about the things that you have.

516
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,280
It's a risky gambit, I will be honest.

517
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,800
This is not a goof.

518
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,280
Griffin was working at GameStop when he was younger.

519
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,840
Guy comes in and says, give me all the PS3s you have, points a gun at Griffin.

520
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,360
And me, Mr. Brand loyal to GameStop.

521
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,640
Icy veins, no fucking skin in the game whatsoever says, we don't have any.

522
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:14,440
Also, so you know, the only thing protecting this ruse was a door behind Griffin.

523
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,680
Which in which, behind which was a giant pyramid of PlayStation 3s.

524
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Right.

525
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,420
Oh, those PS3s.

526
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,320
Another fun part of that story is I didn't, I wasn't allowed to open the register without

527
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,800
making a sale because GameStop had never taught me how.

528
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,240
So they said, open the register.

529
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,040
And I said, let me get my manager and expose her to this robbery.

530
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,560
Let me pass along this cool Sunday I'm having and share it with a friend.

531
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,440
Come have a portion of my cool Sunday, manager.

532
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,040
You know what this encounter needs?

533
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Witnesses.

534
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Yes.

535
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
How about another Yahoo?

536
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

537
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Man, I'm glad I'm not dead.

538
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Me too, in a way.

539
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Yeah.

540
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
We never would have been able to do this show.

541
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
We would have.

542
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
It just would have been missing something.

543
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Yeah.

544
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
This Yahoo was sent in by Nat Steinsultz.

545
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Maybe here?

546
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I don't know.

547
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
There's a lot of people who live in Los Angeles.

548
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
No, I guess not.

549
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

550
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

551
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

552
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

553
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers.

554
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:20,120
Thank you, Nat, by Yahoo Answers user Romario, who asks, my manager is a female, and she

555
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:28,640
pees so loud, how do I tell her that's annoying?

556
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
How could that?

557
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
How often does that come up?

558
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How thin are those walls?

559
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
How close are you?

560
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,480
Why don't you dismiss yourself from the region?

561
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,440
Do you work in a food cart?

562
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Maybe that's what's going on.

563
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
You can't get out.

564
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Maybe he's a bathroom attendant.

565
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay, so wait.

566
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Just to be clear, he-

567
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Whoa.

568
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,320
The fiction was so bad that it gave Justin a-

569
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,640
He's a bathroom attendant who has a boss that comes by just to see how the attending-

570
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Justin, check up.

571
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Let me test and see what you did.

572
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Let me ruin your work, Robbie.

573
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Fuck you.

574
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Clean up on me, Robbie.

575
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Listen to how loud-

576
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,080
Listen to how hard I can push this out.

577
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,680
How bad could this possibly be?

578
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Sploosh.

579
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Sploosh.

580
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,360
I mean, bad enough that he says annoying, not like gross or like it makes you go, it's

581
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
annoying.

582
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
There she goes.

583
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
God damn it.

584
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Fuck.

585
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Again?

586
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Maybe the manager has-

587
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Jesus.

588
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,940
Maybe the manager has some sort of cool pee kegels, and she can pee out, listen, stick

589
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
with it.

590
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
Now we're going somewhere.

591
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,920
She can pee out the rhythm to Gangnam Style and it's like, Gangnam Style.

592
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,880
Gangnam Style, really?

593
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,680
It's 2014.

594
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,320
Kegel another song.

595
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,360
I know it's not a jukebox, but you got to teach that thing another song.

596
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,600
She doesn't know where to find another one of those player piano spools.

597
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Travis liked it.

598
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I don't know.

599
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I love that joke.

600
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
That was a good joke.

601
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't know why you guys, Travis likes it.

602
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
That's all I care about.

603
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
I was confused about the physiology, I guess.

604
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,800
I don't understand why you would stay close by.

605
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Just you know what's going to happen.

606
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Maybe it's like looking at a car accident, like he doesn't want to.

607
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
There are a lot of variables.

608
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I've got a timer.

609
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
See how fast you can get done today.

610
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
A lot of variables apply.

611
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Ooh, shaved off three seconds.

612
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Sure.

613
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
We're talking about distance to the turret light.

614
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,920
We're talking about thickness of the walls of the turret light zone.

615
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,540
And we're talking, to be fair, to give this guy the benefit of the doubt, the general loudness

616
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,880
of this manager's team.

617
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Like decibel level.

618
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Like wow.

619
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Like synths around, like holy shit.

620
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,600
I feel like all you have to do, and it would take a bolder man than me, but when she comes

621
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
out, be like, hey.

622
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Hey, are you okay?

623
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Are you okay?

624
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm worried about you.

625
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:57,920
This could be the start of the worst moonlighting style will they won't they I've ever heard.

626
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,840
We've been dancing around this for a while.

627
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
You pee real loud.

628
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
You pee super loud.

629
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
So loud.

630
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,280
Like really loud and really short.

631
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,520
Like it just like, just like it falls out of you.

632
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,680
It sounds like somebody overturning a bucket and I'm worried about you.

633
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,200
And then you come out real wobbly legs.

634
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Yeah.

635
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,400
And you're frowning, but kind of laughing.

636
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,640
And here's the other thing about it.

637
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
I hate it.

638
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
I hate it so much.

639
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,760
I hate when it happens in the bucket and I'm like, darling, I hate it, darling.

640
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,560
You're the worst manager, but this is the best job.

641
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,000
And frankly, I can't fall asleep without that noise anymore.

642
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,520
So I guess, I guess, I guess what I'm saying to answer your question, Reverend, I do.

643
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:56,680
How about a, how about a regular, how about a normie?

644
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
You all right?

645
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
I can read it.

646
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
I'll read it.

647
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:09,240
I just pictured her peeing on the altar.

648
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,200
Goof, goof so hard I broke Travis.

649
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,880
Oh Jesus.

650
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,080
Dear brothers, ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever.

651
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,880
So sorry.

652
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
This is a problem.

653
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
All right.

654
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,400
Ice truck, ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever.

655
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,720
Okay, I heard one outside and I booked it out the door.

656
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,400
He was driving away from me, but I finally caught up with him.

657
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Well done.

658
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Good work.

659
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,980
Those things, those things don't drive especially fast, if I remember correctly, but still kudos

660
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
to you, I suppose.

661
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,200
Faster than human land speed.

662
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
I guess.

663
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,060
You earned your dilly bar.

664
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,120
When I bought my, how old am I?

665
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,280
When I bought my ice cream, the ice cream guy just gave me this incredulous face and

666
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,440
seemed to be annoyed that a 20-ish year old would be so excited about it.

667
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,480
You know your age, right, I'm guessing?

668
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,160
Yeah, but like the ice cream- I was left on a doorstep.

669
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
It's good storytelling.

670
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,920
He's not forcing omnipotence and omniscience onto the ice cream truck driver.

671
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,640
Would be so excited about an ice cream truck.

672
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,520
Am I too old to be excited about ice cream trucks or was the ice cream guy just a downer?

673
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,840
And that's from vexed in Ventura question for you audience.

674
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,080
Vexed in Ventura, are you here?

675
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,480
Hey, welcome.

676
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Hey.

677
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,440
If you're an ice cream driver and it's 2014 and you're in LA, how good is business that

678
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,600
you can fucking get judgy on people?

679
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,240
I don't know.

680
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,480
It feels like you should go, do you want anything else?

681
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Yeah.

682
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Please?

683
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Let's do a quick audience poll.

684
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,600
Also, can you think of anything else cold that I could sell?

685
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Because I'm dying here.

686
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
Time's fucking broke out.

687
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,980
Let's do a quick poll of the audience.

688
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
This is interesting.

689
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,760
In the last, let's say, three months, has anybody seen an ice cream truck that was stationary

690
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,360
and selling its product to anybody?

691
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,000
Just a quick show of hands, stationary.

692
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Okay, more than I thought.

693
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Better question.

694
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Better question.

695
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
No, I'll be the first to admit that I fucked up with my judgment.

696
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
I haven't seen a stationary ice cream.

697
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,800
Every time it's just like slowly crawling at five miles an hour, it's like, anybody?

698
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,880
And I'm not talking, by the way, I want to clarify, I'm not talking about a food truck.

699
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
No, no, no.

700
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
You know what I'm talking about.

701
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Ice cream.

702
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
I'm not talking about our keys and all like, it's got avocados in it.

703
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,600
That's what you sound like, food truck drivers, I guess.

704
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,600
I don't know what the ice cream truck environment is here, but I know what it's like in Cincinnati.

705
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,560
When you see said ice cream trucks, is the paint peeling and the pictures faded and it

706
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,320
looks like they just killed kids?

707
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,820
Sometimes they've got Pikachu on it and it's like, hey guys, let me just call Nintendo

708
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
real quick.

709
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,320
Yeah, you didn't like go through the right fucking channels to get fucking Pikachu to

710
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,360
sell your iced wares?

711
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,480
I would, I would feel uncomfortable and only because I would be so worried that I would

712
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,280
come up from vector A and sort of like in my periphery out of nowhere would be a kid

713
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,900
on vector B and we would arrive at the same time.

714
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,240
And you would force the issue like, I was here first.

715
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
You know, I was here first.

716
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Hold on.

717
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,600
We got, sorry gents, we got one push pop left.

718
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,560
Looks like you're going to have to wrestle for it.

719
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Sweet.

720
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,040
You're really little and I'm really big.

721
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,520
You just want to give it to me?

722
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
I would grab their head and just push it below the window so the guy couldn't see them until

723
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,120
I was done purchasing my novelties.

724
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,280
Have you guys noticed that the only people on fucking earth that call them novelties

725
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,760
at the grocery store, they used to confuse the hell out of me when I was a kid.

726
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
What's a novel?

727
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
It's ice cream shit.

728
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
We all know what you're talking about.

729
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,520
You don't have to get fucking fancy, Kroger.

730
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,800
You sell big K. Don't fuck with me.

731
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Do you want another Yahoo?

732
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
No, I'll buy these.

733
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Do you want another Yahoo question?

734
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
A little Yahoo.

735
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Yahoo Knights mystery.

736
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:05,440
I actually just had something pop up in my head that I wanted to, no, no, no, no, no.

737
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,000
So we were, we were supposed to have some merch and it didn't come.

738
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,860
And so I wrote a little apology and an explanation as to why the merch wasn't here and I would

739
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:29,840
like to read it for you now.

740
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,880
Sorry that there is no merch tonight.

741
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,480
Here's what happened.

742
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,280
We ordered a slushy amount of the jankiest stuff, posters, tote bags, banana hammocks,

743
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,760
boners, frosted nuts, everything.

744
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,960
But the shipment was delayed by a flock of slurping sponges.

745
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,600
Those driving butts got in front of the bodacious penis hat filled with our merch.

746
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,280
Merch that was supposed to go to you, our moist puppies.

747
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:12,760
But from the bottom of our nipples, we apologize, love the pickled McElroy brothers.

748
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Thank you.

749
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,180
You know, the funny, the funny thing about listening to that, A, nothing, B, do you notice

750
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,840
how no one was really like, there was sort of an initial like, this is going to be so

751
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
great.

752
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,480
And then like, fucking nothing from you.

753
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,640
Remember how you didn't laugh at all for the past 45 seconds?

754
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,200
It's not funny.

755
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,240
I will be signing copies of this later.

756
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,760
The one he has and the one I have.

757
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
And others he can scribble out for you.

758
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,120
I did a fun gag where like I like saying my beer like, oh, this makes you so mad, I'm

759
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
gonna say my beer.

760
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,400
I don't know how many beer left when we just started.

761
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Ahem.

762
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Give me some of your angry orchard, Justin.

763
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Okay, sure.

764
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Give me half a pour, maybe.

765
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Yeah, I'll give you half.

766
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Thank you.

767
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
How about Yahoo?

768
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Listen, I can't go on.

769
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
This Yahoo was sent in by Josh Williams.

770
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Josh, are you here?

771
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,960
If anybody wants to bring us another beer, you're welcome.

772
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
No, don't.

773
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I don't want to do that.

774
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
No, but one at a time.

775
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Please.

776
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
No, I'm just kidding.

777
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Don't do that.

778
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Thank you, Josh.

779
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:20,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user supertifster who asks, I need extremely dirty truth or dares.

780
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,360
Every time I pick a Yahoo or rather Josh Williams or Drew Davenport sends a Yahoo to me, I always

781
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
hope, like, is this going to be in the next Warrior Cats?

782
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,840
I think this one might.

783
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,120
We can never think of any help.

784
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
That's fine.

785
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Kind of basic.

786
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Not a lot there.

787
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Listen, we could do a few.

788
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,360
I'm not as interested in that as I am about what the helpful folks on Yahoo Answers...

789
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,840
Oh, that's funny that you say that because Yahoo Answers user bigwavegirl2006 has a few

790
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
helpful suggestions.

791
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,080
It's worth pointing out, this user is definitely, definitely suspended, holy shit, to like the

792
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,280
ninth level of Yahoo hell.

793
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm not making this up.

794
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,480
This is the actual order in which these were sent in.

795
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,440
Number one, truth questions.

796
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,940
Number one, ask a girl if she were a guy which girl in the room she would date.

797
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,440
Do the same to a guy.

798
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Okay?

799
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
All right.

800
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Sure.

801
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,560
Number two, do you swallow or spit?

802
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
That's for girls.

803
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,680
For boys.

804
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,280
What's the fastest you have C-U-M?

805
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
What the fuck?

806
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
This game escalated.

807
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,320
Who would you date in the room to?

808
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
How fast do you cum, Jake?

809
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,840
No, not just how fast.

810
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
What's the fastest?

811
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Not the average.

812
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,560
I don't want to mean...

813
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,720
I don't want a median of cum times.

814
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,440
I want to know the peak of the curve.

815
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,000
What do you clock out at?

816
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,320
I want to know your curve breaking cum times.

817
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,240
That's what I need.

818
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,020
I want to know what's breaking the bell curve of your ejaculate.

819
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,360
And then way over here off the line, 30 seconds.

820
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,800
Interesting.

821
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Is this an outlier?

822
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
I don't know, Malcolm.

823
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Is it?

824
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,800
How fast do you cum?

825
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,040
How about number 17?

826
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Have you ever skinny-dipped?

827
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,080
Okay, good.

828
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,520
Number 25, which guy playing do you think has the longest penis?

829
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Those are actually kind of connected, like, well, let me find out.

830
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Let's do 17.

831
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,200
25 will be answered very quickly.

832
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,480
Number four, which girl do you think would give the best PJ?

833
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Cool big wave girl, cool.

834
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Which girl do you think would give the best PJ?

835
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Seems so like...

836
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm going to go with Susan.

837
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
She's just a hard worker.

838
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,600
Seems like she'd really commit.

839
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
She'd give it her all.

840
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,960
I worked with her on a science project last year and she did not give up until it was

841
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
done.

842
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
I'm going to go with Susan.

843
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Ladies, can I just...

844
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Sorry, Lydia.

845
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,880
Ladies, can I just ask everybody sitting in the circle to just yodel for me?

846
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Okay.

847
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Interesting.

848
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Some surprises here.

849
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm going to have to go to the leaderboard.

850
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
This is a great one.

851
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Let's go to the leaderboard, Moe.

852
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,920
Who gets a piece of that radical rock?

853
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay, guts.

854
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Let's talk about guts.

855
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,120
How about number 11?

856
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:44,200
Who has the biggest ball you've ever seen?

857
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,360
Left or right does not matter.

858
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,920
There's a lot of nuance to number 11 because they add funny since it can be told literally,

859
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
but someone will take it sexually.

860
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,880
I could be talking about a medicine ball.

861
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,800
No, you couldn't.

862
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,960
Not enough a jillion years could you be doing that, but God, how badly do you want to play

863
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,000
through the day with that guy or is that, wait, hold on.

864
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hold on.

865
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Do you need genitals or medicine ball?

866
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Point of order.

867
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Just want to clarify.

868
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Super quick point of order.

869
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,880
Because what if somebody in this circle had one ascended ball and one crazy huge descended

870
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:27,360
ball, like wow, like wowzers, like wow, like an egg yolk in there, like wow, like crazy.

871
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
An egg yolk?

872
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,720
Yeah, because it would be like, you know, you look at an egg yolk and it's just like

873
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,480
one thing sort of suspended it in another thing.

874
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,280
I tried to think of something more organic.

875
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,040
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

876
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,560
That's the good stuff right there.

877
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
What's your name?

878
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,400
Because this is like the fourth drink that you've bought for us.

879
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
What's your name?

880
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Here we go.

881
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Here it comes.

882
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm Jenny and that's John.

883
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Jenny and John.

884
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Famous forever.

885
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
They saved the jokes.

886
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Get the groove juice flowing.

887
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:04,160
What is harder than watching a guy slam a cider?

888
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,800
Nothing.

889
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,120
I would crush this on my head, but it's tall.

890
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
You know what would happen then.

891
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I'd get lacerations.

892
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
You want to jump to dares?

893
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Number 17.

894
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,960
Play one round in your underwear.

895
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Cool.

896
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Number 23.

897
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,720
Stick your finger in your ass and then lick it.

898
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
What in the?

899
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,600
Big wave girl, go fuck yourself.

900
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,680
I would like to go back to truth.

901
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I regret asking.

902
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,880
Stick your finger in your ass and then call your mom and apologize, you terrible person.

903
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,580
We didn't even invite you, Debra.

904
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,080
That seems like how to end a truth or dare game.

905
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,440
I dare you to put your finger in your butt.

906
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,640
God damn it, Steve.

907
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
Are you going to do it?

908
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,160
No, that was me leaving, but now I feel on the spot.

909
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,360
They pay like $25.

910
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
How much would you pay to watch a grown man?

911
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
How much would you pay to not?

912
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Wait, don't.

913
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Don't answer that.

914
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
We're going to hold you, motherfuckers, hostage.

915
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,680
How much would you pay to not let my brother lick his butt?

916
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,440
Guys I'm- Save me for myself.

917
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
He's a broken man.

918
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm going to credit where credit is due.

919
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:27,360
These are fucking extremely dirty.

920
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,560
Number 21, masturbate into a shot glass.

921
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,620
Real thing!

922
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,240
Someone said on Yahoo!

923
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Yahoo!

924
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,560
Masturbate into a shot glass for me.

925
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,640
I don't know much, Griffin, but is there not a second half of that dare?

926
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,840
Number three- Why would you?

927
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Okay.

928
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Nope.

929
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
No, no, no, no, no.

930
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

931
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

932
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Back out.

933
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,980
My issue with the question answer is not that they did not generate some extremely dirty

934
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,580
truth or dares.

935
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,960
It's a question of editing.

936
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,880
Once you've created these masterpieces of dirty truth or dare, how do you leave something

937
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,600
like Who Would You Like to Kiss?

938
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,440
The problem with the great, what separates a good super dirty truth or dare creator from

939
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,840
a great super dirty truth or dare creator is being able to separate your wheat from

940
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,360
your chaff.

941
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:29,760
I dare you to separate your wheat from your chaff and then lick it and let us watch.

942
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
No others?

943
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,200
I mean, there's fucking 60 of them and they keep jumping back and forth to like, kiss

944
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,240
whoever you want in the room to number 30.

945
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,840
This one's a partner dare.

946
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,400
Have a blow job race.

947
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Fuck.

948
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,160
I'm picking the guy who I think is going to come fastest.

949
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,500
Get over here in 30 seconds, Jake.

950
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,360
This is a different game.

951
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,520
This is truth or dare or eyes wide shut.

952
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
We love it.

953
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
We love Ellie.

954
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
We love it.

955
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
It's true.

956
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
It's true.

957
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Oh my God.

958
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Are you okay?

959
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Yeah.

960
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
Oh no.

961
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,880
The mutation started much earlier than we expected.

962
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,080
Hey, hey everyone.

963
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,520
Justin, welcome back to the podcast.

964
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:21,920
This is the first time I've done anything sort of that even resembles work or not work.

965
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,600
What is it contributing to society in other ways than like forming the next great generation

966
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,520
of humanity?

967
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,560
What generation is your baby in?

968
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Is it like, are we up to like omega?

969
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
32 bit.

970
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Epsilon?

971
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Okay.

972
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,600
Your baby, your baby do it and then don't is what you're saying.

973
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,840
That's basically what I'm saying.

974
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,960
You are not ready is what I'm saying.

975
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:47,360
Listen, just because we, uh, I'm not here doesn't mean I don't need money.

976
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,240
I have a mouth to feed and uh, you know what I'm going to be feeding my baby, but that's

977
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
right.

978
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Nature box.

979
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,040
She is not ready for, I'm just saying to the nature box offers a delicious catalog of delicious

980
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,480
healthy food stuffs.

981
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,960
She's probably not ready to chew down on some dark cocoa almonds.

982
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,280
I think you're not ready cause I am.

983
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
I have teeth.

984
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,960
I have human adult teeth.

985
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,600
Oh, but you don't like a lot of sugar and you don't like trans fats and you don't like

986
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
high fructose corn syrup.

987
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's all true.

988
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay.

989
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,480
Then you're ready for nature box.

990
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,480
They've got delicious snacks, uh, that you go on, you pick the ones that look good to

991
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
you.

992
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,680
They have, I mean an insane amount of, of different varietals, varietals of snacks.

993
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,140
Are any of them pre-chewed?

994
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Like don't get me wrong.

995
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,920
Peanut butter nom noms, delicious baked sweet potato fries, fuck yes, but your baby's not

996
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,880
going to be able to enjoy these in the way that they're meant to be enjoyed for another

997
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
like three years or so.

998
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Okay.

999
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,440
I'm going to hit you with a few that they have.

1000
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Okay.

1001
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,680
And you can tell me if it's appropriate for the baby.

1002
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Okay.

1003
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,680
Uh, baked sweet potato fries.

1004
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
No.

1005
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,760
Um, yogurt covered pretzels.

1006
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh, actually that one.

1007
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Yeah.

1008
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Okay.

1009
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
That one's okay.

1010
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
Babies, babies love pretzels.

1011
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Breast milk guzzlers.

1012
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,640
That sounds, actually that sounds all right.

1013
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,980
That one would be okay.

1014
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,000
Can I order those, can I order those or am I going to be put on some sort of watch list?

1015
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,960
Uh, if you go to naturebox.com, you can get 50% off of your first month's box.

1016
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,760
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

1017
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
That is the key thing.

1018
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
You can't get that original address.

1019
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,760
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother, all one word, and you can get 50% off your

1020
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
first month's box.

1021
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Try them.

1022
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,020
A ton of our listeners have, and they've really, really liked them.

1023
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,200
They very much enjoyed them.

1024
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,320
We get emails all the time like, I'm full and healthy.

1025
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm full and healthy, brothers.

1026
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
Thank you.

1027
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,680
Um, once you have managed to get your body-

1028
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,560
It's me, the mole man, your favorite listener.

1029
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,240
I'm Adam Sandler, the mole man.

1030
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,560
I live under the ground.

1031
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,600
I'm the Adam Sandler of the mole man.

1032
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,360
Man, you've just been, it's like falling off a log, isn't it, Juice?

1033
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Comedy is easy.

1034
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,240
Parenthood is hard.

1035
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
That's my new book.

1036
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,320
Me and Irma Baumbacher co-writing it.

1037
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
That's coming out.

1038
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,200
Dave Barry, Justin McElroy presents, comedy is easy, parenthood is hard, and on the front

1039
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,600
it's me in a smoking jacket and he's behind me juggling a baby.

1040
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,440
We are changing our schedule now.

1041
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,520
We are only going to record one episode every nine and a half months.

1042
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,520
You're going to keep having babies, and then we're going to fucking get you on here for

1043
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,600
that prime material, that prime time.

1044
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,840
Here's a joke I wrote about fatherhood last night.

1045
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Okay.

1046
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,880
I don't know why everybody's in such a hurry to teach their kids to talk, because it makes

1047
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,640
it so much harder to frame them for farting.

1048
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
That's pretty good.

1049
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Thanks.

1050
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,120
I'll be honest, that's about exactly what I expected.

1051
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Perfect.

1052
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Okay.

1053
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,660
Well, that's about where I am in my life right now.

1054
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,120
I guess if you want jokes maybe better than that, you can probably find them on Hulu,

1055
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,940
Hulu Plus to be specific.

1056
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,340
It's like the Hulu reviews on your computer, only you can do it anywhere, anytime at your

1057
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,840
whim whenever you don't shackle yourself to your MacBook.

1058
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,200
You can get on your Roku, your Apple TV, your sex box, whatever you want, and just watch

1059
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,680
Hulu on the go.

1060
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,920
They got current season episodes of your favorite shows like Modern Family.

1061
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,640
They got Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

1062
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,640
They have every episode of shows like South Park, which is only available on Hulu Plus.

1063
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,480
You can do it how you like.

1064
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Oh, fuck.

1065
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Justin.

1066
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Griffin.

1067
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,320
I have the best news ever.

1068
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Tell me.

1069
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,800
And it's germane to Hulu Plus, because that is where I enjoy it.

1070
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,000
Okay, tell me about this entertainment you're enjoying.

1071
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,040
You know how the house has seemed very empty lately?

1072
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,960
The house has seemed hollow?

1073
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,800
That's what everybody's saying.

1074
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,880
People are always saying the house seems very hollow, and I think it's just because for

1075
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,360
a few months now, there haven't been any boys in the house.

1076
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,800
Boys in the house.

1077
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,680
It is right back where it needs to be.

1078
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,480
Cycle 21.

1079
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,920
Boys are back in the house for America's Next Top Model.

1080
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,160
Fucking Cory, so tight, he is now a judge, well not a judge, but he's like a host.

1081
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,720
He was this super sweet dude who in the first episode, they were like, boys on one side,

1082
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
girls on the other side.

1083
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Boys pick a girl and walk down the stairs.

1084
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,040
And he walked towards the girls, and he's like, no, this will not do.

1085
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,200
And he turned around, and he got himself a boy.

1086
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
And they walked down the stairs.

1087
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
And you're telling me he's back?

1088
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,520
He's back, and he's a fucking judge, he's not a judge, he's a host.

1089
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,520
So he'll talk to them and be like, aw man, I've been there, you guys look fucking amazing.

1090
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,480
He's like super sweet, super supportive.

1091
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,000
Anyway, boys are back in the house, Cycle 21, check it out, Hulu Plus.

1092
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,560
It's only $7.99 a month.

1093
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,560
That's a great deal.

1094
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,600
It is a good deal, but the better deal is we can get you two weeks free.

1095
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,480
Two week free trial, it's longer than the usual one week free trial.

1096
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,840
We're gonna give you that extra week, just go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother, and you'll

1097
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,920
get that two week free trial, and it's good for us, because they know that we sent you,

1098
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,580
and they will continue to support my brother, my brother, and me.

1099
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
So it's a...

1100
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,960
And my infant daughter.

1101
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,440
And Justin's infant daughter, and my infant niece.

1102
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Same person.

1103
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Same person, it's the same one.

1104
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,960
I wanna give a very happy message to Yohan.

1105
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,140
It comes from Candace, Chris, Noah, Rachel, and Olivia.

1106
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,480
They say, hey Yohan, congratulations on finally being legal.

1107
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,140
We're so proud of you for everything you do in terms of hard work and training, as well

1108
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,000
as being a stellar guy in general.

1109
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,980
This fucking sounds like code.

1110
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,000
This sounds like they're hinting around some secret government skunk works, black ops shit.

1111
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Are they activating Yohan's wet works protocol?

1112
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,960
We honestly couldn't ask for a better friend, and that's in quotation marks, and italics,

1113
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
and underlined, and bolded.

1114
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,940
And there's a bunch of upside down triangles in it.

1115
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,800
So we hope that a special shout- Is that Illuminati?

1116
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,440
It's maybe the Illuminati.

1117
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,640
We hope that a special shout-out from the Brothers Mackerel will make your day.

1118
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,320
Happy 18th birthday.

1119
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
We love you.

1120
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,900
Has anyone ever made a porn called Illuminati, like the word naughty, and it's like a bunch

1121
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:02,760
of people in robes, and maybe some of them are lizards, and then they fuck?

1122
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,560
I would watch the hell out of that.

1123
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Yeah, of course you would.

1124
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,000
From an academic kind of perspective?

1125
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,920
Yeah, and also you're a stonemason.

1126
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,600
Happy birthday, Yohan.

1127
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
We're very proud of you.

1128
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
We're so proud.

1129
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,920
You're living so right.

1130
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,980
Got another birthday for Emily Brunston.

1131
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,200
You have a birthday for her?

1132
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,480
I have a birthday for her, to offer her.

1133
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,920
Please accept this birthday, Emily Brunston.

1134
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,400
It's from Avital and Julien.

1135
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,560
Avital, maybe Avital, it's a lovely name.

1136
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
I'm sure.

1137
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,320
However you interpret it- However you say it, you can't mess that one

1138
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
up.

1139
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Avital.

1140
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
You can't fuck that name up.

1141
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Avital.

1142
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,640
Any way you say it, it's beautiful.

1143
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,920
Happy birthday, Dumbleton's dog, sending this message is cheaper than buying people off

1144
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,640
to ensure that Mad Men ends in a full-blown orgy like you richly deserve.

1145
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,440
Instead of measuring the next year in love, which is weak and filthy, may you measure it

1146
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,480
in delicious dips, corgis, and days at the office without a visit from ProBot, the probing

1147
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,680
robot.

1148
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,040
And I think there was a series of- I would assume in-jokes there?

1149
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,360
I think they're not- No, ProBot's a thing.

1150
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
ProBot's a thing?

1151
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
Yeah, you said- Is that a-

1152
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,000
There's a robot that just like gets in there and like makes sure everything's okay.

1153
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,040
What about corgis?

1154
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,200
Those are fake.

1155
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Those are fake, okay.

1156
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,040
I knew that there was something messed up in there.

1157
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,120
Happy birthday, Emily.

1158
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,600
We hope it's a great one.

1159
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,080
Yeah, we're very, very happy for you.

1160
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
It sounds like you have a pretty sick life.

1161
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Sick in a good way.

1162
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Sick in a good way.

1163
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,440
Should we do some like housekeeping?

1164
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,240
Thank you all for- We got so much amazing feedback for the Adventure Zone, the D&D episode

1165
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,400
we did last week.

1166
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,120
We're gonna figure out a way to continue doing those.

1167
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:52,240
Not I think- I mean, based on what we talked about, not on the Mabim Bam feed, as it were.

1168
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,800
You think this is all safe to talk about?

1169
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,080
Yeah, I think so.

1170
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,440
This is our plans as they stand right now.

1171
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,280
Not a Mabim Bam thing, but maybe a separate thing?

1172
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Maybe.

1173
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Maybe?

1174
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
People seem to like it.

1175
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
We're figuring it out.

1176
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
We're figuring it out.

1177
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,200
So, yeah, thank you all for the feedback.

1178
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,200
There's actually in the Facebook group, which I don't know if you've been on there recently,

1179
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,160
has been like popping off.

1180
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Go check it out.

1181
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,760
We're usually pretty quick about letting people in.

1182
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,000
It's a closed group, so haters can't just hop in.

1183
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Sometimes spammers- Spammers do.

1184
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
They trick me.

1185
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
They trick us to get in and kick them out, though.

1186
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,800
But yeah, there's actually a lot of really good feedback on what we could do better.

1187
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,540
Some good ideas for what a D&D podcast could be.

1188
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,900
So thank you all very, very, very much for that.

1189
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,480
Hope you're enjoying the LA live show.

1190
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,040
It was a hoot.

1191
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,040
We're figuring out our plans for next year.

1192
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,040
We're going to do- Spoiler alert.

1193
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,440
We're going to do a shit ton of live shows in 2015.

1194
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,080
Basically all over this beautiful nation of ours.

1195
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,680
So look forward to that.

1196
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,880
Do you think we'll be back?

1197
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,400
We'll probably be back next week, right?

1198
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
I would imagine.

1199
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Yeah.

1200
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,360
My baby can't hold my attention for that long.

1201
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
That's true.

1202
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,440
Especially with all these fucking dad jokes.

1203
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,920
I am cooking up for you.

1204
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Yeah.

1205
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
I am in heat right now.

1206
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
I am in bad joke heat.

1207
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,920
We can't waste a second of this.

1208
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
All right.

1209
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,800
Well, we're going to get back to the show, but thank you all for being so wonderful.

1210
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,160
And yeah, more episodes, more regular stuff next week.

1211
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
God bless.

1212
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
God bless.

1213
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
Hashtag bless.

1214
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
Hey, Griffin, you could tilt your mic down a little bit.

1215
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
Yeah, I'm really having to get up on it.

1216
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
Just like angle it.

1217
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,160
There we go.

1218
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Oh, if only.

1219
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
Here we go.

1220
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
What?

1221
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Who's laughing?

1222
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Oh, like a dick thing?

1223
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Oh, like a dick thing?

1224
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Oh, like a dick thing?

1225
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Oh, like a dick thing?

1226
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Oh, like a dick thing?

1227
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Oh, like a dick thing?

1228
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
Oh, like a dick thing, guys.

1229
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
It was a dick thing.

1230
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
Great.

1231
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,480
No, it was actually very good.

1232
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
Well done.

1233
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,520
How about another question?

1234
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
When did we start?

1235
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,520
Hey, let's take a question from the audience.

1236
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,520
Yeah, what time did we start?

1237
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Should we?

1238
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Who's got like a great question?

1239
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
Well, hold on.

1240
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
You got to be quicker on the draw.

1241
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Drew Davenport, do you have a question?

1242
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,520
Yeah.

1243
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,520
Sorry, fuck everybody else.

1244
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,520
Drew Davenport, get back up here.

1245
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,520
All right.

1246
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Griffin has a glass.

1247
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,520
He doesn't get to keep the can, too.

1248
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,960
Come on now.

1249
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,960
I need a...

1250
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
We got to conserve our rations.

1251
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
We're in a riot situation.

1252
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,960
Hey, everybody.

1253
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
It's Drew Davenport.

1254
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Woo.

1255
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,960
Yeah, there you go.

1256
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,960
Angle it up, you giant man.

1257
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
Yeah.

1258
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
And turn it a little bit so you can face it.

1259
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
Yeah.

1260
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,960
Look at us now.

1261
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
Now make eye contact with Griffin.

1262
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,960
Look at me now.

1263
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,960
Me only.

1264
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Go ahead.

1265
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,000
Drew, it's just me and you.

1266
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,440
Open your heart and let us climb inside, Drew.

1267
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,960
This is from a conversation I had on the way here with my girlfriend.

1268
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
Terrific.

1269
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,000
Is it okay to put groceries in a truck bed and drive home?

1270
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, no.

1271
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's not.

1272
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No.

1273
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It depends.

1274
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Wait.

1275
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Wait.

1276
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
What groceries?

1277
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Yeah.

1278
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,320
If it's a Lean Cuisine, a Lean Cuisine is a little self-preserved little pocket of amazing

1279
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
food.

1280
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,800
If you put a head of lettuce in there, it's going to be gone by the time you get home.

1281
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,200
Just the microbes in the air will just dissolve it.

1282
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,200
Yeah.

1283
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,840
And rinse food, sack of potatoes.

1284
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,400
Sack of potatoes, that's okay.

1285
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,320
The flowery foods and artichoke.

1286
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,320
Paper towel roll.

1287
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
No, no, no.

1288
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Your towel roll is done.

1289
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,420
Except flowery foods, except flour because if that bursts back there, that's your week.

1290
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,420
That's your whole week at that point.

1291
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,420
That's your week.

1292
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,720
You are no longer driving.

1293
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,800
You are making a rue.

1294
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,520
Do you own a truck?

1295
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
She owns a truck.

1296
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
She owns a truck?

1297
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,520
It's her truck.

1298
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Don't.

1299
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Well, don't.

1300
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,520
I think she gets to call the shots here, Drew.

1301
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,640
Drew, wait.

1302
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,200
Are you pro or against?

1303
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Oh, I'm pro.

1304
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,760
You want to put your food out in... Hold on, just so I'm clear, if I took all the food

1305
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,360
that you have in your house and I somehow held it in my giant arms, and then I ran down

1306
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,480
the street at 55 miles an hour for, I don't know, 45 minutes, and then I came back to

1307
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,600
your house and I said, eat all this now, you would be like, yum, yum, give me some.

1308
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Can we... Wait, hold on.

1309
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
One more again.

1310
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,960
Can we jump back to 30 seconds ago when we loved Drew?

1311
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,880
I love Drew and I want to keep him food safe and food smart.

1312
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,480
Everything in there's got E. coli, it's got bird flu, it's got bird shit on it.

1313
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,600
It's probably got birds.

1314
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,920
It's got live birds in there.

1315
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,120
You got a bad case of birds.

1316
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
You got birds.

1317
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,920
Plastic bags, you tie up.

1318
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,840
That's not... Yeah, Drew, that was our problem the whole time, Drew.

1319
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,960
You really uncorked it.

1320
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,420
Did you see that virus... What we thought of bags.

1321
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,720
That virus movie where Gwyneth Paltrow got fucking wrecked in the first 15 minutes, and

1322
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,520
they were like, guys, don't worry, just get some plastic grocery bags and just wrap that

1323
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,280
around your shit for 15 minutes, and the movie was a half hour long because that fixed it.

1324
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
That did it.

1325
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,360
That was how that movie ended.

1326
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,360
Super quick, don't even think about it.

1327
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,440
Tell me the dirtiest thing you've ever put in your truck bed, go.

1328
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
I don't have a truck.

1329
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,560
Okay, the dirtiest thing that your girlfriend's ever put in her truck bed.

1330
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,560
Help him.

1331
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Dearest.

1332
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
A carcass?

1333
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
An animal carcass?

1334
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
An animal carcass?

1335
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
I just assumed.

1336
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
You a big deer hunter?

1337
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
I'm stigmatizing.

1338
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
Oh, God.

1339
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,560
What?

1340
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,560
That's everything you... Okay.

1341
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,560
Worse than dead deer.

1342
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,560
When was this?

1343
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Give me a rough timeline.

1344
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,560
When was this?

1345
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:09,680
Okay, so for six months, you've been eating couch Craigslist food.

1346
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,240
You've been eating the ass of the person you bought the couch from on Craigslist.

1347
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
Is that okay?

1348
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,880
Imagine the dirtiest person you could think of.

1349
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,520
This salad is crazy.

1350
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,560
It tastes... It's not... Do I detect a hint of Craigslist ass?

1351
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,560
It's not good, but it's not bad.

1352
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,560
It was cheap.

1353
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:36,000
Imagine the dirtiest stranger you ever met reached underneath their couch and retrieved

1354
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
a Hot Pocket.

1355
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah.

1356
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
They then handed that Hot Pocket to you and said, here, stupid.

1357
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,040
Eat this.

1358
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,480
Eat these Craigslist croutons.

1359
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,400
Yeah, absolutely.

1360
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
This is great.

1361
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,400
I'm so excited about eating this that you've retrieved from me.

1362
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,720
That's been six months for you.

1363
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,080
That's six months.

1364
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,240
I fucking hugged you earlier.

1365
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
That was a bond of trust.

1366
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,360
I hugged you, trusting that you didn't have Craigslist mouth.

1367
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,360
That's where we are.

1368
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,360
These are all hypotheticals.

1369
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,360
Yeah.

1370
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,680
Oh, well, then it's totally... Oh, well, then I guess we're fine.

1371
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
I guess we're cool.

1372
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,680
Don't worry.

1373
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,680
Good job, Drew.

1374
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,680
Everybody, Drew Davenport.

1375
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,680
Drew Davenport, fucking savior of the podcast.

1376
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:24,920
Where did that full anger go?

1377
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
Regular question.

1378
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Here we go.

1379
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Pop it back.

1380
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,920
I got a real-ass question.

1381
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
Corinne, are you here?

1382
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Corinne?

1383
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
Can we keep the chatter down in the audience, maybe, for this?

1384
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
It's our show, not yours.

1385
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
We're trying to do a show up here.

1386
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Corinne?

1387
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
Okay.

1388
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
All right.

1389
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Okay, she's here.

1390
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
Raise your hand, Corinne.

1391
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Corinne says, you don't have to come down.

1392
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
You don't have to come down.

1393
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Yeah, she's coming.

1394
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
That's fine.

1395
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
No, okay.

1396
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
You're halfway.

1397
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
No, no, come on out, Corinne.

1398
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
Come on down.

1399
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Stand in the aisle for the whole time.

1400
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,920
No, Corinne.

1401
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,920
No, come here.

1402
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
Come up to the microphone.

1403
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
I'm fucking with you.

1404
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,920
Corinne, this is one of those questions that you did not give us nearly enough details.

1405
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,920
Okay, Travis, go.

1406
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
Well-

1407
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,920
Corinne writes.

1408
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,920
This is perfect because she's like five feet away.

1409
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,920
Yeah.

1410
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,920
Just move your mouth up and down, Corinne.

1411
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,920
Let's try this.

1412
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,920
This will be great.

1413
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,800
I teach in an art school and I hate all my students.

1414
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,920
Let's not say, hey, let's make a pact not to say Corinne's last name.

1415
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Yay.

1416
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
Yay.

1417
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,360
I hate my students.

1418
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,600
Super best, Corinne.

1419
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:23,160
I have to say, Corinne's in a bad situation because if you want to not curry favor with

1420
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,200
me, here's the number one thing you do.

1421
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,000
You give me art and then you ask me what I think of it.

1422
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,560
You know the only art I like?

1423
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,600
Wayne's World, the movie.

1424
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
I haven't liked-

1425
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,440
And Wayne's World, the movie-related art.

1426
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:43,160
If you want to give me a framed cell from the original cut of Wayne's World, I'd be

1427
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
into that.

1428
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,360
Can you give us an age window to imagineer with?

1429
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,880
I teach at a private college.

1430
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,880
Like adult?

1431
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,880
Yes.

1432
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,640
Not like six-year-olds at which point you go, yeah, this is great, there you do that.

1433
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Yeah, it's totally hateful.

1434
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,640
Like adults, you can go, no, shit.

1435
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,360
Can we get some detail on what it is?

1436
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
Is it a-

1437
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Nude class?

1438
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,360
No, come on.

1439
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,360
Actually, I do.

1440
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,360
I do teach life drawing.

1441
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,480
That's one of the classes I teach.

1442
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,800
Is that kind of why you hate them?

1443
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,400
Because there's obviously some dudes getting there with some future jerk material.

1444
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Do they woo?

1445
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Do they woo?

1446
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Do they woo?

1447
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
Like they're on the fucking set of Saved by the Bell?

1448
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,400
I don't think-

1449
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Like, yahoo!

1450
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,760
I'm pretty sure if you yahoo, you are asked to leave.

1451
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,760
Corinne's feelings on you as a person have no-

1452
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,120
There's not a three strike policy.

1453
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,400
No, I'm pretty sure.

1454
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Steve, and you've won sports.

1455
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Neat bush!

1456
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Keep it down.

1457
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,400
I'm sorry.

1458
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,400
I'm sorry, I need this.

1459
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
I just get so excited when I see-

1460
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,720
I get excited when I see a neat bush.

1461
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,720
Are we close?

1462
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,720
I'll be honest.

1463
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
We have many conversations in the beginning of class where I have to tell them, like,

1464
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,720
you know, if there is an erection or a fart or-

1465
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
I'm sorry.

1466
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
No, I just did the thing that you hate probably.

1467
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,720
And then, yahoo.

1468
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,720
Because, you know what I love?

1469
00:53:49,720 --> 00:54:06,240
Is that you said erection, which is like such a proper way, or a fart, and that made me

1470
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,240
so happy.

1471
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:16,080
Corinne, if you can make farts not funny, I'm going to name you the president of magic.

1472
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,080
I will follow you around like fucking-

1473
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,640
And be fishers of men.

1474
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah, right.

1475
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
Exactly.

1476
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,680
I will win people to your cause, because you are a wizard.

1477
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,920
I tell them that farts are funny, and that's okay.

1478
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,000
If you need to laugh, like, just leave the room and laugh, and then come back in.

1479
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Have you ever had any smart ass students that tried to-

1480
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Tried to paint the fart, like, onomatopoetically?

1481
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Braap.

1482
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah.

1483
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,640
You've done really great work on the chest muscles here, Brett.

1484
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,920
You've done- you're really coming along as a student.

1485
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,840
You did make it say fart with five R's in, like-

1486
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,120
But the shading is spectacular.

1487
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:01,080
And the font was, like, a stinky green cloud, and that was- I'm not going to lie, like,

1488
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,680
it was a good stinky green cloud.

1489
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,600
It's just the subject matter of it was troubling Brett.

1490
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,600
Stop.

1491
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
This is my kryptonite.

1492
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,600
You're killing me.

1493
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:21,600
I mean, the most troublesome poses are when the model decides to do, like, Captain Morgan.

1494
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
Oh, okay.

1495
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Yeah, right.

1496
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Like a look-a-matang.

1497
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Yeah.

1498
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Or a-

1499
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,480
Well, it's actually typically women that take that pose.

1500
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,680
Men like to do, like, the drop down, let everything hang.

1501
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,680
The touchdown dance.

1502
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,680
The touchdown dance.

1503
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,680
Yeah.

1504
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
I'd like to do the cover-em-ups.

1505
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,440
Is that a pose that's-

1506
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,520
I like to do the stay in the hallway and refuse to come in the room.

1507
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
I'm scared.

1508
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,520
I changed my mind.

1509
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,520
Is that a pose that's alright?

1510
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
I changed my mind.

1511
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,520
I do the-

1512
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,520
You can keep your $25.

1513
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,040
I do the why can't they just paint my jeans while I'm wearing them also.

1514
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,320
Why don't students need to get good at painting jeans?

1515
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,240
I do the aren't jeans art two.

1516
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,960
I've seen a lot of dong paintings, I haven't seen a lot of good jeans paintings.

1517
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,400
I don't think Van Gogh had a jeans phase.

1518
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,040
Let's tackle that subject next.

1519
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,480
Let's cross boundaries together with these dungarees.

1520
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,960
It's very avant-garde, yeah.

1521
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,960
Yeah.

1522
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,960
It's very avant-garde.

1523
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,960
So is that-

1524
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,440
Okay, we've been talking about dicks for, like, 30 minutes now.

1525
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,760
What is it that you actually don't, aren't so crazy about?

1526
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,000
Is it really dongs and erections and parts of it?

1527
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,760
There's just a lot of, you know, people don't want to be enthusiastic about things, and

1528
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,840
that makes you hate your students as a teacher.

1529
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,320
And I think that crosses all subject matter.

1530
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,040
Real quick, they're paying to be there, right?

1531
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Yeah.

1532
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
They're paying a lot of money to be there.

1533
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,040
Yeah, that's gotta be fresh.

1534
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,040
Good work, everyone.

1535
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Yeah, great job.

1536
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040
Way to go, higher education.

1537
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,520
I could see how that would be frustrating.

1538
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,120
I would say, though, Crim, it might be a case of them just not want...

1539
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:53,160
I would be so terrified to just do it wrong or have people think that I looked at the

1540
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,160
naked person wrong.

1541
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
Yeah.

1542
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,160
Or looked at them too hard.

1543
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,240
Or too hard.

1544
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,840
I would be constantly averting my eyes.

1545
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,520
You would probably get a very disengaged vibe from me, I would think.

1546
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,520
Yeah.

1547
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,320
If I was in your class and you brought in a naked man that I would draw him, I would

1548
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:12,560
make it fleshy and smooth like a Ken doll down there, because I wouldn't know...

1549
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,560
That's a thing.

1550
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
You call that the Ken doll.

1551
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,560
Yeah.

1552
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,160
I would know if I was supposed to draw a dick, and if I did, then you'd be like, Crim, I'm

1553
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,160
very disappointed in you.

1554
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:29,200
Especially if it's just kind of a stick figure man, but a very precise, detailed dick.

1555
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,720
So maybe it's not that your students are...

1556
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
Really dead on.

1557
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,720
Right.

1558
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,720
Maybe it's not that your students...

1559
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
I could pick that out of a lineup.

1560
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,720
Sure.

1561
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Dead eye dick.

1562
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,480
Maybe it's less of a case that your students aren't...

1563
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
Maybe your students aren't...

1564
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,480
Hold on, let me figure out the sentence structure.

1565
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,160
Okay, I think I've got it.

1566
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,160
Maybe your students are enthusiastic, they're just scared that they're gonna paint a dick

1567
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,360
and you'll be very disappointed in them.

1568
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,720
So maybe you need to be very explicitly clear about what it is that they're supposed to

1569
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
draw.

1570
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,720
Like...

1571
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,720
That I expect out of their penises.

1572
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:02,760
Yeah, just say like, if you wanna go like, bathing suit area out, up and down, start

1573
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,760
there.

1574
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,440
If you want to really explore the space and do what feels comfortable to you, if you wanna

1575
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,760
draw a dick, I'm not going to be disappointed in you.

1576
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,880
Griffin, great job.

1577
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
Some teaching tips.

1578
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Thanks.

1579
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
That's the least we could do.

1580
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,880
Give a big hand for Corinne.

1581
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,880
Thank you, Corinne.

1582
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
Thank you.

1583
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,880
Got one of Yahoo Answers?

1584
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
Yeah.

1585
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
I'm into that.

1586
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
This Yahoo Answer was sent in by Alan Black.

1587
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,880
Thank you, Alan Black.

1588
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
A very prolific contributor.

1589
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,880
So this is by Yahoo Answers user, SlickNinja360, who asks...

1590
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,880
Should be good.

1591
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,880
Should be pretty good.

1592
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
Would it be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze for you?

1593
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
Yeah.

1594
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,880
Would it be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze for you?

1595
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,880
Yeah.

1596
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,880
Would it be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze for you?

1597
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:52,880
Yeah.

1598
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
I guess, yeah.

1599
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,880
I guess that's pretty good.

1600
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,880
Upon entry, the entrance would close.

1601
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:01,440
It would have spikes on the wall's tops to keep them from escaping.

1602
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,320
I was also thinking of having booby traps and things like that.

1603
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,440
Once they find the exit, they could leave.

1604
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't know about illegal, but logistically it seems like an issue.

1605
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Yeah.

1606
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah, you're gonna have to have some fucking...

1607
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Is it a motorized gate or like a magical...

1608
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah.

1609
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It grows over when they walk through.

1610
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,200
It's gonna be a fucking pan's labyrinth magic moss.

1611
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:25,740
I will say, if we can't fix gun laws, but we have been thorough enough to figure out

1612
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:31,000
our forest maze laws, I might be very disappointed in our nation.

1613
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah.

1614
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,800
If you own the land, and this is troubling because I'm agreeing with the top Yahoo response

1615
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,800
to this, but if you own the land, you can build a maze wherever the fuck you want.

1616
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,840
I don't know that you can corral people into it.

1617
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,960
That's where you run into...

1618
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,960
You can leave a trail of peppermints.

1619
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,320
There's no guarantee.

1620
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,760
This is the beautiful thing about it, if you force people to do it, highly illegal.

1621
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
Yeah.

1622
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,760
If you offer people the opportunity to do it, highly profitable.

1623
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,760
Yeah.

1624
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,000
It's not like I just bought a house and I feel like I have total agency over it.

1625
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,160
I do not think I can invite friends in and then lock the door and then swallow the key

1626
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,560
and say, I will let you out as soon as you solve my puzzle of flesh.

1627
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,600
And then I would show them my flesh puzzle.

1628
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,080
Here's the funny thing about luring.

1629
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
I would bet...

1630
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,440
Is the flesh puzzle your genitals?

1631
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
That's my balls here.

1632
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
Okay.

1633
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,440
It's your balls.

1634
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,400
I would bet that 80 to 90% of the people in this room, if you stumbled upon what you were

1635
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,320
guaranteed to be a solvable forest maze- That would lock you in and you would fucking

1636
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,760
die if you couldn't solve it.

1637
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,880
If, that's a big if Griffin.

1638
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,880
How many of you would say?

1639
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,880
All right.

1640
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,880
Yeah.

1641
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,880
I'll tackle this bitch.

1642
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,880
This is everything I've ever trained for.

1643
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
Yeah.

1644
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,880
Everybody raise your hand.

1645
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,400
If you stumbled upon a pan's labyrinth, you would not-

1646
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,400
This is serious.

1647
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,400
Okay.

1648
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
There's a lot of people.

1649
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
I'm raising my hand.

1650
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,400
Okay.

1651
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,400
You would risk your life.

1652
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,440
All those years of playing Professor Layton games are finally going to pay off.

1653
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,680
You're going to solve this shit.

1654
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,680
Sherlock Holmes.

1655
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,680
All right.

1656
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
The Goblet of Fire.

1657
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,680
Yeah.

1658
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,680
The Goblet of Fire game.

1659
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,680
It was so good.

1660
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,680
Well, you play it in your head where you go, I would have gone left.

1661
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,680
Yeah.

1662
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
I would have slain the basilisk.

1663
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
That's what you sound like.

1664
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,680
That was in book one, dick.

1665
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,680
Sorry.

1666
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,680
Two.

1667
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,680
Oh, shit.

1668
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,680
Fuck.

1669
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,680
Fuck.

1670
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,320
Keep it to yourselves.

1671
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,880
What would lure you into... Okay.

1672
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,520
What would lure me into a forest maze?

1673
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,840
Doing the opening of a fucking forest maze.

1674
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,600
Right?

1675
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,780
You got to.

1676
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,200
What if it's risking your life, though?

1677
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,480
I don't want... You know what?

1678
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:38,720
The fourth verse of Tim McGraw's Live Like You Were Dying directly references, I went

1679
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,760
into every forest maze I saw, I think.

1680
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:51,640
I heard a pan flute beckoning me in, but there was gold doubloons at the end.

1681
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:57,360
Bite traps weren't scared me wide.

1682
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,640
Have you ever heard that song?

1683
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,200
Have you ever heard the song?

1684
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,700
I'm not great with melodies.

1685
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,200
That's actually... I was singing the harmony.

1686
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,120
I thought someone would join in.

1687
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,120
What else we got?

1688
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,120
Let's do another audience question.

1689
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,120
Yeah.

1690
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,120
How about another... Oh, fuck.

1691
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,120
There's something about people being in the front row.

1692
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,120
It's very intimidating.

1693
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,120
Come on up.

1694
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,120
You're on the front.

1695
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,120
Yeah.

1696
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,120
We'll do a front row.

1697
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,120
Wait.

1698
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,120
You raised your hand.

1699
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,120
You raised your hand.

1700
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,120
You can't say shit when we pick you.

1701
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,120
Shit.

1702
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,120
Me?

1703
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,120
You walked into this forest maze.

1704
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,120
You volunteered.

1705
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Now it's your time to get out.

1706
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,120
What's your name?

1707
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,120
I should volunteer.

1708
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,120
My name is Linda.

1709
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
Linda, no bummers.

1710
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,120
Linda, no bummers.

1711
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,120
No bummers.

1712
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,120
Here we go.

1713
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,120
No bummers.

1714
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,120
Should I have another baby?

1715
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,120
What?

1716
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,120
For dinner?

1717
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,120
Hey.

1718
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,120
Hey.

1719
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Come on.

1720
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,120
Come on.

1721
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
How many are you... How many?

1722
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,120
You popped into my head.

1723
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,120
How many you up to?

1724
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,120
I have two kids and they're nine and 14.

1725
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,120
Boy or girl?

1726
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,120
What?

1727
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,120
Come on.

1728
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,120
You're just gonna fucking chill?

1729
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,120
Hey, everybody.

1730
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,120
You don't know Linda's deal.

1731
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,120
Leave some for the rest of us.

1732
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,120
Linda, boy or girl?

1733
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,120
14-year-old boy.

1734
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
Trying to start a highlight team or something?

1735
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Come on.

1736
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,120
And my new husband doesn't have any.

1737
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Have any.

1738
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,120
See?

1739
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,120
Come out.

1740
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,120
Two people.

1741
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,120
No boo.

1742
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,120
That was you a second ago and now you have this new information.

1743
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,120
You're like, this is a noodle scratcher.

1744
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,120
Is your hubby a gung-ho about it?

1745
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
No.

1746
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,120
No.

1747
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,120
No.

1748
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,120
No.

1749
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
No.

1750
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,120
No.

1751
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,120
No.

1752
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,120
No.

1753
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
No.

1754
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
No.

1755
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
No.

1756
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
No.

1757
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
No.

1758
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,120
No.

1759
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,120
No.

1760
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Does he have a gung-ho about it?

1761
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
Does he want to have a kid?

1762
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,800
He's very pleased to make me happy, but his love is…

1763
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Sure.

1764
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Then you gotta do it.

1765
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,800
Are you into it?

1766
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
No, come on.

1767
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
Stop it.

1768
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
Are you into the idea?

1769
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
I mean, that's ultimately like the only…

1770
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
It's scary, the only…

1771
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
I would love to have the support of a wonderful man…

1772
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
He's a bit nice, though.

1773
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,800
You got the 14-year-old with the baby-sit.

1774
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,800
That's true.

1775
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
I mean…

1776
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
That's built-in.

1777
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,800
That's nice.

1778
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Yeah, that's not a bad point.

1779
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Like, you don't get that.

1780
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:51,320
Like you don't get that like Justin six me three Griffin like three months old. There wasn't like Justin you got this

1781
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:00,100
Don't you're shoving a cold kid cuisine down his throat. Oh, he died a great work six-year-old

1782
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,520
I guess you didn't first time my baby said I was 12 years old and I microwaved a pot

1783
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,040
Because I was trying to make rice pudding from a recipe for book for kids

1784
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:17,960
in my defense a recipe book for kids should have clarified the proper cookware

1785
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,560
It's all say they'll know right? Yeah

1786
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,040
No, it's

1787
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,560
It already went to print

1788
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,200
It's 1992. They'll know right?

1789
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,960
I mean you do you want a pros and cons list like pros like

1790
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,560
that this

1791
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,520
Could be like this super successful kid this one. You might not have had the super successful kid

1792
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,560
You might not have had the the Bill Gates yet. I don't know anything about your other two children

1793
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,700
They might be very bright, but they are they are they are they here?

1794
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,360
Okay, well it feels a little greedy

1795
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,160
What if you're what if the reason once your ender?

1796
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh my god, what if the reason they've been so great so far is because you have exactly enough energy to raise two great kids

1797
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:16,560
What if at this point you're dividing your labors and you're gonna get three our parents had two at one point and they were awesome

1798
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,060
They were going

1799
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,060
Everything was going so well

1800
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:26,880
Hey, if it weren't for me the show we called my brother and me and we'd have some Nickelodeon would be very litigious in that regard

1801
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:34,920
Yeah, you have to have me terrific Linda there is literally

1802
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,480
Not a single piece of information. I need to answer this question that I would feel comfortable asking you

1803
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,000
Literally cannot get any of the facts. I need to solve this problem for you and let and just to clarify

1804
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,880
Once we answer this it is binary. Yeah

1805
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:56,400
We are literally deciding the existence of a human being right now

1806
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,440
Will you name that child after us? Oh shit by which I mean the brothers, okay?

1807
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,240
the baby the baby the movie dot org dot org

1808
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,920
hashtag

1809
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,040
You put the hashtag at the end of the web address, right? That's how that wait

1810
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,360
Do you want to do it?

1811
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:23,200
Look at all three of us in the eyes six eyes six eyes all the stuff Linda. Do you want to do it?

1812
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,320
No, fuck. Come on. I'm not gonna push it out of my body Linda

1813
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:34,080
Yeah, I wish I could for you because I'd love to feel what it's like in the world. Anybody have a coin

1814
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,800
Linda our level involvement with our child will put most deadbeat dads make them look like heroes

1815
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,880
Like we are not going to be involved in the racing of this child. That's why I'm not tying myself to an answer on this show

1816
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,400
Okay, well you ask I'm thinking of a number between one and two

1817
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Guess it

1818
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:58,400
It was two that means you have to have the baby. Congratulations Linda. She's having a baby. I

1819
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:09,680
I feel pretty weird about that one. I just created a human life. I am unto a god

1820
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:17,180
Alright, what else we got guys? How long we've been going we've been going for three and a half hours feels that way

1821
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,180
So do you wanna Yahoo? Yeah. Yeah

1822
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Come on

1823
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
Show

1824
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:33,840
Just created a human life what the fuck else do you want more fart jokes? We just created a person

1825
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,880
You guys need to get your priorities straight this Yahoo was sent in by Charlene. Thank you char or Charlene

1826
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:47,460
It was asked by Yahoo answers user Kayla who asks does this seem like a good PowerPoint to show my parents?

1827
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,680
Convincing them to help me get a horse

1828
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,680
I

1829
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:59,840
Slide one horses are awesome. Click click. Hey, your joke is exactly what's in the bit

1830
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,520
Title what I want most in life. Sure. Yeah

1831
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:11,960
No, what everyone wants most in life really for being honest next slide content. Wait timeout. We talk about horses a lot

1832
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,720
Sorry

1833
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:20,700
Just here when everyone else does I don't think we talk about them more than like

1834
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,500
Anyone should normal people like people normally talk about horses. They're pretty great

1835
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,760
Pretty solid next slide contents asking them to stay silent during the presentation

1836
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:42,560
Mom's dad's mom shit down fucking cell phone off. It's business. I worked on this for a half a fucking hour

1837
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,360
You close Pinterest for us for like a second pause frozen

1838
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,200
Amanda

1839
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,960
close pictures

1840
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,880
Next some photos of horses along with words all caps a horse

1841
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,240
So just fucking laying down the foundation. That's good

1842
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:07,200
The ground the equestrian groundwork in case you were not aware click click exhibit a exhibit a a horse

1843
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:13,080
Or legs hoods. What if that's all it took? Oh, that's a horse. Okay. Oh shit. That's basically the cool

1844
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:19,300
Yeah, you can have they have ever seen five thousand dollars and then five thousand dollars a year. Yeah totes. Totally. Yeah

1845
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,000
Next telling them how I've changed and I'm responsible enough to take care of all I killed the last listen

1846
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I know I fucked up last year

1847
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,440
Bad, I know I fucked up with dad's little dumpling last year

1848
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:37,600
And then I know that I fucked up the year before that with dazzle dumpling jr. Wait

1849
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:43,480
jr. Was predicated upon the fact that this horse was in fact going to die and also

1850
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:48,560
Proceeded it's that it was a time-traveling feature horse

1851
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:58,200
No one's a special horse listen, we had to act fast to buy that special special time-traveling horse

1852
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,480
Forget already daddy's little Dublin

1853
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,160
So much. It's a good name. I've changed though

1854
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,720
And I can do it next supplies and costs. I've done my research

1855
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,480
Check out this Excel spreadsheet. Does this get your blood pumping the next one's my favorite?

1856
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,480
next

1857
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,640
money saving tips and ideas

1858
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,280
Mom dad you've been

1859
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,680
listening

1860
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:30,000
Diane do you need all those clothes? I need a horse real bad for the third time

1861
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,440
We could cut our food budget click click in half that is

1862
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:43,120
Next we're spending so much on oats our oats budget could know that's my mistake. That is not a typographical error

1863
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:50,760
It's budget will drastically increase. I believe it may have been the bottleneck in the last two horse experiments

1864
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,960
Come to think of it in retrospect

1865
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:59,080
Upon further reflection our oats supply was was at issue

1866
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,280
Next this little Dublin jr

1867
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:10,960
Next explaining the benefits to owning a horse many pros and cons chart. I put together. I bet the cons list is pretty fair

1868
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,320
there

1869
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
cons too great

1870
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,440
Too many main too smooth

1871
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:25,240
Will eventually die in six months. Sorry dad. Sorry about this. Our yard is full

1872
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,280
next

1873
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,480
Showing one horse I really want and that would be perfect for me

1874
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,080
then two others that would work great for me and I want so and

1875
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,840
And they'll always know they were second and always horses have a sixth sense for that stuff

1876
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,520
Next a last side note. Well, I guess they'd be their fifth sense because horses don't have thinking. Yeah

1877
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,080
Or taste a some

1878
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,840
Salt what do you want told great? No good choice just salt then

1879
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:07,120
Fantastic. We're excellent selection Tom click. Yeah, perfect. You're just gonna lick a big block of salt. Fantastic

1880
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,820
Do you want that over a potato? No, just the salts great thing. Thanks. I'm good here. Hmm. Just gonna give me running energy

1881
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,640
terrific

1882
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,640
Great work horse

1883
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:21,320
Stupid next get a job get a job horse salt theme

1884
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,920
What's your sodium like next a last side note and telling them I don't want to hear

1885
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,320
Anything about this topic until next week so that they can talk about it with each other and then look at the PowerPoint and think

1886
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,960
And whatnot, you know, yeah, what the fuck?

1887
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,100
Do not rush to judgment mom and dad I'm gonna yeah, I think that's a fucking huge power

1888
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:48,040
That's a shoe last slide. Click click stay silent after shut your fucking mouth

1889
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:53,100
Keep your phone silent and also keep your fucking mouth shut not until next Tuesday

1890
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah, we'll be horse to me click click for a week. Good night

1891
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:02,520
You say that and we laugh at that that's gonna be just enough time for that sweet idea to firm it

1892
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,920
Well, cuz what night one is like, can you believe she can you believe she did that shit for the third fucking time?

1893
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:12,080
Like we would even do that. I think you were right. We should have another kid. This one's a bus. This one sucks

1894
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,600
Then maybe three days later, it's like, you know what I'm thinking about it

1895
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,200
We had some good times at that horse and then the next day it's like no

1896
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,160
It died and then the other one died like super fast

1897
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:28,600
What are we thinking right and then by the seventh day, that's when God rested. What were you talking about?

1898
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,760
This seems foolproof to me

1899
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,040
It's pretty solid if you have a foolproof plan for getting a horse and you've been sitting on for this long

1900
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,040
I'm very upset with both of you

1901
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,120
You gotta let me in on that stuff. Have another answer Travis question

1902
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,960
Mm-hmm. How's the show go? Should we do one more from the audience? Yes. Yeah

1903
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,120
Somebody far back cuz I want

1904
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:59,460
Nobody back there has their hand up. That's fine. Anybody else? No, I see you. Yes

1905
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,160
Yes, come on down far this back person we could see

1906
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:12,520
Oh, no, we'll give J. Oh JP, I'm sorry

1907
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,320
Hello, thanks

1908
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:26,320
My name is Jeannie and my question is so I have a cat who pees terrific we all do

1909
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,160
Hold the fucking phone one second

1910
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:43,840
Yeah, it's great it's like a big long chair Jeannie was it was it Jeannie I

1911
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:49,520
I would like to have a couch someday not a dream. You should announce in public. Yeah, I

1912
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:54,120
Would like to have a kind of the perfect sitting platform

1913
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,200
I'd like to solve this whole couch thing one day

1914
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:03,760
Have you thought about finding a cheap couch that you can buy a wholesale that you can treat like a burner?

1915
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:10,640
And you can have a burner couch that will last you for a month until the smell starts to overtake your your boot

1916
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,880
Yeah buying a box your cat could be in yeah

1917
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,920
Let's workshop this I want to hear the endgame of Griffin's plan where you have a couch

1918
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,960
Designated for your cat to be in basically well

1919
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,900
No, you would also do a little bit of sitting in it from time to time

1920
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,680
Maybe a bit of lounging

1921
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,440
Who gets stuck sitting in the bait cow?

1922
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,360
What you know you have to take put a lot of tape down the middle say cat that have is your that's your

1923
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,800
Be cool

1924
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,840
When you watch orange is the new black. What do you even fucking do?

1925
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,560
Do you stand up and look at the TV like you're saluting it?

1926
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,080
That's what you're shaking your head. Yes. I stand up and look at the TV. What's your gym?

1927
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,080
I should just lays down on the hardwood floor

1928
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,520
Yeah, yoga ball. What's your sitting game like?

1929
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:05,720
It's so wait. Oh my god. Okay, so your cat won't pee in a chair. It needs a lot of room to express itself

1930
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,160
Is it like an inflatable plastic chair? I wish I had one. I

1931
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,980
Considered it. Yeah, I said again like a plastic inflatable chair

1932
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,480
Couch, this is such a nice furniture set. Yes from Spencer's gifts

1933
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,160
It came with the plasma ball. It looks super great

1934
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,360
It came with all the novelty greeting cards with bikini babes on

1935
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,400
Jeannie how old is your cat?

1936
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,400
Oh

1937
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,480
Ornery pee cats. Yeah

1938
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,960
Jeannie I got bad news who is real young. Yeah, that's a lot

1939
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,360
13 I would have said stick it out take it out and then Travis. That's a bummer

1940
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:52,440
So, I mean, I'm just saying you got like another 13 years of peace. Oh couch. Yeah

1941
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,860
Maybe it's time for more permanent solution. Let the cat explore the world. Yeah, maybe that's an outdoor cat from now on

1942
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:03,560
Cats cats can't talk and the only way they can ask for freedom is by peeing on your couch

1943
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,920
Maybe that cat saying I think I can do this on my own. I

1944
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,440
Caught a homer bound on Cinemax last week and that seems like something I could super get into

1945
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:19,720
Please open the door or I'm going to keep peeing. What's your favorite thing? Cuz I guess it was couch

1946
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,720
I

1947
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,600
Read your journal about wanting a couch someday and I want out

1948
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,080
You made me feel guilty cuz I have two couches

1949
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:36,640
I have three couches in my house and you made me feel like I'm living some sort of life of extreme luxury that I don't

1950
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,320
Does it not use the litter box what's going on with your cat's whole deal

1951
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:52,560
Is she mad at you? Maybe she's mad that you don't have a couch. Get a dog cuz those never pee anyway. Yeah

1952
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,040
That's isn't that why you haven't neutered

1953
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:02,240
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. Do you want this water spot? Nah, I'm cool

1954
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:08,080
I got neutered so I don't even need fluids in my whole body. No, so I miss folks super neutered. Yeah

1955
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:15,040
I just get in there take it all just get in there with an ice cream scoop and really just like

1956
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:24,320
Why is your cat crying oh she's not super super super neutered

1957
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:33,960
It's basically eyes longs firm and that's about it. That's about all that's going on in there. She's very agile though

1958
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,200
So that's I guess the best

1959
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,720
I don't know what else to tell you buy a couch and just yeah

1960
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:48,320
It's no I mean it is definitely your probably a couch in every room and you will have at least a while where she hasn't found

1961
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,280
One yeah, she'll probably get into the jam of peeing on one and maybe you can put that in the bubble

1962
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Do you have any bubbles?

1963
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,880
Can you put like I asked you a question whether or not you have bubbles

1964
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:05,240
What about a tarp? Okay, you need you don't have a lot of things you yeah

1965
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:09,440
Jeannie you have a lot of super achievable life goals, and I'm into that I

01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,840
