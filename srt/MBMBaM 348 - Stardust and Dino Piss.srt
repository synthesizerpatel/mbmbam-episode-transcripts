1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,160
I'm your oldest brother Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis Patrick McElroy.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm your sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary Patrick Davis Tyler Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,040
Right before we started like literally a half a second before Justin went in he whispered

9
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,920
trust me into the microphone and I do but I am scared as hell I think a little bit don't be

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,840
scared don't be scared it's just I haven't I can't I couldn't tell you guys about the intro

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,880
okay without spoiling the intro all right give it because then we'll miss the the I don't know

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,000
how I've managed to sit on it this long but here it comes the best thing it happened yesterday I

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
was flying after visiting my brother and his beautiful new baby oh yeah I forgot to text

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,520
but did you get home all right yeah I'm fine um I don't know why we do that we all text each

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,640
other after we get home from a fight like hey I got home all right as if like what's the what's

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
the opposite I mean I guess there is an opposite right but it's so powerful because you were so

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,840
worried about me all day until well I mean that doesn't hold up in this one because you defo

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,200
didn't text or anything but I just always assumed that we as macarons just have no object permanence

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
and like that's why we need people because as soon as they leave our sides like they're gone

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,120
they're going forever until we get the text that's like I'm okay I'm fine thank god you're

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
more you're more likely to get in a car accident than a plane accident so like should I text you

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,880
guys like got back from Arby's it's all good don't worry about it you don't do that I don't

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,600
for a long it was a long way away Arby's if it was a destination Arby's hmm all Arby's are

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,520
destination Arby's just sorry what was the greatest thing you ever saw in the airport

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:41,200
thank you jeebus uh so I went through Houston and I had to take a little tram uh on the way back

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,200
from front to from terminal terminal Houston's a buckwild airport by the way Houston looked at how

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
every other airport was doing it and was like nah we're gonna try a whole other thing you gotta take

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,360
a tram to all the terminals and all and our gates board like 10 10 in a group and you gotta wait to

29
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,120
go down to them it's bizarre it's a weird airport uh but I'm navigating this bizarre system and who

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:19,920
should I see on the tram next to me but mister Craig T. Nelson I got a Craig T. Nelson sighting

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,920
fresh uh brown leather jacket of course approximately eight feet tall wearing a very

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:37,440
large ring in Texas the prime primo Craig T. Nelson what was his security detail wearing

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,960
uh it was uh Louie and Philip which is his nicknames for his biceps because he's Craig T.

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,760
Nelson is he towned he's 72 years old he looks fucking fantastic yeah I there is no way this

35
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,520
human man is 72 years old he looked like a demigod yeah he looks amazing which is you

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,880
wouldn't think I think Craig T. Nelson has had some times where um I mean I don't think he was

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:12,000
as toned as cut in uh poltergeist for example um but I guess like I guess as he reached his silver

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,040
years he was just like it's time to get serious about my health and so Craig T. Nelson got really

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,280
um diesel got really yoked I'm into this I'm so jealous just and I'd love a Craig sighting oh it

40
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,880
was like such a good Craig sighting and the best part of this Craig sighting um is that we were

41
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,360
going to the same gate so like not the same gate but the same because the way they do it there

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
it's like 10 in a group so like we're going to the same area I guess you made me think for a

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
second that he was going to the same gate as you and he was getting on a plane to Huntington with

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,320
you to go see what Huntington was all about no y'all would know about that um it was kind of

45
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,400
weird that went like I did okay this is embarrassing I did have a moment where I was like

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:10,320
I got a tv show I could go say hi to no abort abort you can't hey uh fellow tv star um it's me

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,840
hoops remember my show I uh anyway we're going the same area so I got to just observe Craig

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,280
in his day-to-day um perfect gentleman obviously um Houston is an absolute nightmare in terms of

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,480
shopping it's more restaurants and shopping than gates I walked past three burger places

50
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,680
to get to my gate we take care we take care of you here in Texas um but any I did see I only saw

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,880
one person sort of like make the connection because they felt like they had to and uh I heard

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,520
the person like he's walking this way and the person's walking towards me and this person just

53
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,160
goes I love your work that's good and I think that's code for I forgot what coach was called

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,000
I forgot the show coach I forgot your name I forgot the name of the show coach your work

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
your work sports teacher my one shot um I did learn from the swirls later that he's uh or was

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,360
on Parenthood yeah he was all over Parenthood um also on Grace and Frankie I mean either but

57
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,400
that's the problem I mean and I just kind of reiterate Craig's he wants to look fucking

58
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:31,040
great great yeah if I looked like Craig T. Nelson looks now and you knew my age you would be like

59
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,040
he's a really that looks that's a good looking 36 like yeah I would be I would swat bodies with

60
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,840
Craig T. Nelson Justin let me ask you a question because this is a calculation I do anytime I

61
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,200
see like a recognizable um celebrity I do a calculation in my head of is this is this the

62
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,960
type of celebrity are they at a place down their career are they the type of person that if I walk

63
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,400
up to them and talk to them they will be happy that someone came up to them or will they be like

64
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,720
uh again I'm just trying to walk almost never will they oh good an interruption my favorite

65
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,040
I'm gonna disagree Griffin because I think there's two ends of the bell curve we're like over here

66
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,680
where we are we're happy when people come up and talk to us yes over here we're like

67
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,840
the kid from Jerry Maguire is he's probably happy when people come up and talk to him

68
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,200
you know what I mean but what about in the middle if I had if I had a fucking walk on roll on coach

69
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,320
where I had four lines in one episode where I was sort of a tertiary character you could not talk

70
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,400
to me you could not approach me you know why because I had hung out with Craig T. Nelson and

71
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,800
I'd gotten some of that stardust on me and then that makes me unapproachable so um yes as as of

72
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,400
right now I am to approach me come on come at me but if they ever reboot coach and I'm on it even

73
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,640
a little bit that's it you missed your window uh Craig T. Nelson does not tweet a lot in case

74
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:08,320
your I almost tweeted at him and uh his last tweet was in 2011 oh well can you read it um word for

75
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,160
word please I've got a lot of requests to weigh in on the PSU scandal as a former coach I think

76
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,480
we need to protect our kids at abc news yeah I mean that's not a not a bad take yeah this is

77
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,200
very important his first tweet was the man only did seven tweets got in got out did his art got

78
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,640
out you didn't overstay his welcome his first one said my personal assistant told me I should be on

79
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,760
twitter I'm still not convinced this is a good idea and it seems like he never quite bought the

80
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,880
bought the company in line there I have a very sorry Joe good I have a very important question

81
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,560
okay when he says a former coach was he actually a coach in real life at some point

82
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,840
how do you mean as a former coach capital c like as one might like David Tennant might say as a

83
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,200
former doctor that doesn't mean he was a doctor in real life at least Craig T. Nelson saying that

84
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,480
as someone who has embodied the role of coach I have a lot of thoughts on this Craig had a lot

85
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,000
of pretty good tweets in this time it is it is wild um it is wild three-month dalliance with

86
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
twitter all of which came in 2011 let's go through his whole body of work then why not

87
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,120
let's buy the whole thing so there were there were a couple of applause and I'm so I'm not gonna

88
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,560
uh okay no actually I'm gonna read all of his tweets this is the entire uh tweet

98

108
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,880
of cranking out that's that's seriously the seven tweets you meet in heaven that's the only seven

109
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,000
tweets you need is what's up I don't want to be on here but here I am yeah I was on coach I found

112
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,000
I think the PSU scandal is really is really really uh bad it's really bad what happened over there

113
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,800
coach out but I I tweeted all I could tweet there's nothing I've hit I oh see that's the

114
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,800
thing you got to spread out your seven subjects of tweet over like several years and he used all

115
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,600
seven twitter subjects up yeah and what Larry Dablemont Larry Dablemont part two and a scandal

116
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,840
he like he hit all the bullets crushed it crushed it I should mention two things the first one is

117
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,040
that is not a verified account oh god there's every chance that might not there is no it is

118
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,000
the best it is the best evidence of Craig T Nelson's twitter presence because I was going to

119
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,520
tweet out and be like Houston what's up check out the whataburger it's dope as hell um but I didn't

120
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,040
do that because he had been off for so long and I thought that would have been a little bit pitiful

121
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,640
secondly welcome to max fun drive week part two uh sorry about spending 13 of your minutes I have

122
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,080
one last thing one last thing one last thing do you think the t in his name stands for twitter

123
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,560
because he's so good at it and then one actual last thing is the answer that question is no

124
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,800
nobody knows what the t stands for because once somebody speaks that out loud he's banished

125
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,560
from this realm can I also say just one I also just want to say I'm sorry for saying that Jonathan

145
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,080
our program because of the extended extended period of time we spent talking about Craig

146
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,720
Twitter Nelson uh here comes our first question I've been dating this guy for a few weeks and

147
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,360
I went to his apartment recently I found out that he lives with two other people but zero tables

148
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,160
there's not even a kitchen table their kitchen area is just a pile of groceries

149
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,840
it's bothering me that my boyfriend doesn't own a table anywhere in his apartment oh my god

150
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:05,680
how do I buy a table for another person without it being weird that's from tabletop troubles in

151
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,400
Topeka well first of all congratulations to these folks doing it in the Japanese style that's really

152
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,160
cool this is not the Japanese style it's important that everybody they definitely got tables the

153
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,080
tables are maybe a little bit lower than you're used to but they are elevated off the ground

154
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,080
this is an this is an incredible opportunity for you yeah because it's like you're gonna give

155
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,120
them a transformative gift something yeah what if they just don't know yeah what is this what

156
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,880
what is this four-legged high floor what the high floor do you mean the table that I bought you

157
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,760
the up floor um I'm more okay what's more upsetting the lack of tables or

158
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,880
or their kitchen area is just a pile of groceries yeah I'm confused by that like

159
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
do they not have a refrigerator either do they live on paper street like they don't have cabinets

160
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,520
they don't have counters how the crap it are we talking here are they in some kind of Frank Lloyd

161
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,480
Wright house where everything is the same level there's no couches there's no counters this is

162
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,320
my new house nasty kitchen and what I've done here is there's no furniture so you just keep all your

163
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,920
your eggs and stuff right on the floor right it's called flat town call it yucky flat town

164
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:36,400
um I don't I think you should get start off small start off small with like an end table

165
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,960
that you put in the middle slowly a nightstand perhaps um I was gonna suggest actually maybe a

166
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:51,040
card table because what that does is like I want you to try out this life but if you don't like it

167
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,600
then you can just throw it away or put it in a closet or something let it fold fold it up and

168
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,160
and put it away and then you don't have to ever think about it again so it's not like a you have

169
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,400
to live with this forever kind of situation you only need one really good table right

170
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,200
mm-hmm oh we have a we have a coffee table and a dining room table and like a kitchen counter

171
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,920
and really the coffee table is the only one we really use so you just need the one good table

172
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,600
like what do you play your board games on you just set it down on the floor and hunch over it

173
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,960
that's not good for you or your back you know maybe this is like a life whatever the life-changing

174
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,560
joy of tidying up or whatever the book's called where life's actually think life-changing magic

175
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,560
of tidying up I think yeah when they walk up to their tables they put their hands on it and they

176
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,800
thought does this bring me joy and they thought no this is just a flat surface I hate this actually

177
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:53,200
guys I got an outside the box one for you does this table bring any of you joy and it's like

178
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,760
you know what kind of thick no all we we just throw our bills on there and then we they piles

179
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,600
up it looks terrible let's not table yeah let's not does this guy does this bring you guys joy

180
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,960
all it does is it sits in this little compartment we never look at it are you talking about the hot

181
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,280
water heater yeah fuck that thing get the fuck out of here I hate you hot water heater it's just

182
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,080
taking up space it's just taking up space and we never see it oh boy my shower is so cold now but

183
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,680
fuck that hot water heater I'm too proud to go back also my metabolism is raging I feel amazing

184
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:31,360
it's wild my skin is clean and clear and under control um does this bring you joy no it stinks

185
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,840
all the time get rid of it this is the trash can you wanted to get rid of the trash can where's

186
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,480
the trash go all over we did we sort of dissipate the stink by hiding it all over the house

187
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,120
no I can't see what food we have yeah but it's the refrigerator yeah but it hides the food away

188
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,920
I want to see the food it's gone get out of here you joyless cube does this bring me joy it's hard

189
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,280
and I fall on it oh that's the floor now you've gotten rid of the floor it doesn't bring you joy

190
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,560
but I do think it is important to be around for sure now just taking up space no wasting everybody's

191
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,960
time um get them a table you need a fucking table now I'm turning I'm starting to get kind of

192
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,760
frustrated now get them a table is it maybe the apartment's like cramped or something and so

193
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,080
they don't have a lot of table room but it's such an essential you gotta have a table it's

194
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,880
the table's a chair's best friend here's here's my theory this is my working theory on why they

195
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,960
don't have a table when Teresa and I moved from Cincinnati to Los Angeles we got rid of our old

196
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,880
microwave and said we'll just get a new microwave when we get there okay then we got there and did

197
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,480
not immediately buy a microwave and then time began to pass and the momentum of not having a

198
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,920
microwave built up and built up to the point where in the entire two years we lived in Los

199
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,280
Angeles we never bought a microwave because after a while like it there was just no pressure to do

200
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,200
it because it like it already been six months we just hadn't bought one yet and then when we moved

201
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,680
back to Cincinnati the house we moved into had a microwave uh in it already like attached to the

202
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,840
oven and like we remembered oh fuck yeah microwaves are incredible how did we go two years without

203
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,720
one so my theory is these people moved into this place none of them had a table and they said oh

204
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,880
we'll go get one of those and then like they just didn't for a while and now like just time has passed

205
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,400
and they've begun living their lives without a table and they have forgotten how fucking efficient

206
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,240
having a section of the floor raised up to a reachable level is the up floor it's wild um can

207
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
you read this next question because i was going to do a yahoo but this next question is funnier

208
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,320
than any yahoo could ever dream to be i just found out the guy i'm dating puts his belt on his pants

209
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:56,880
before he puts the pants on his body all time am i good or do i need to end things now before i

210
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:07,040
realize he's actually an alien that's from dating et in boston that's the wildest literally a million

211
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,280
roaches living inside of vincent d'anofrio alien yes yes yes sugar water sugar water sugar water

212
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,000
for sure definitely definitely definitely 100 a bunch of d'anofrio roaches you need to get out of

213
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,400
the house swat maneuvers slice the pie don't let him see you he's a bunch of roaches in his skin

214
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,840
man you have to go you have to go go go go go quick the cab's outside i called it for you already get

215
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,640
in there he's a bunch of roaches in an alien skin suit i think she should probably alert the

216
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,720
authorities oh yeah first because you don't want him to run this grift on some other unsuspecting

217
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,120
earthling person i mean there are some specific authorities you need to call and they are the men

218
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,400
in black because i mean it's it's it's i don't know how you get in touch with the men in black

219
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,480
i don't know what like no what if she calls the men in black the men in black are gonna come and

220
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,920
they're gonna like do the flashy thing to us and all of our listeners and erase this episode they're

221
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,960
gonna erase the episode they've definitely done it before too don't you think yeah that's what

222
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,520
happened to the portland audio from our last live show from our last live show um too close to the

223
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,280
truth we got too close so we did get into some next level shit well they only flashed travis

224
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:24,800
because we only lost his audio how could a person do this to me how could a person do this to me

225
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,640
i've been trying to run through my head like sometimes we get questions like this and you

226
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,080
think like okay i can see one factor where maybe this is why they do it because this would be but

227
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,240
i cannot imagine an element of this where this system is better where you'd rather have floppy

228
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,960
like just a denim mess that you're trying to thread your yeah your leather friend through

229
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,000
like do you want to start do you want to start your day with some needlepoint like i would rather

230
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,320
i would rather not i would rather just go ahead and put on my pants if that's okay with you

231
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,440
it's it's it would be so much harder to do it's very difficult to get it in your floppy loose

232
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,840
loose trousers and it's so weird to do it's not good i don't understand especially when

233
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,960
you picture this person just sitting there in you know they're i was gonna say me undies but

234
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,160
probably not me undies but that me undies seems above the level of this part they're just sitting

235
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:27,200
there and like you know their um briefs just like calmly silently threading a belt through their

236
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,840
pants now i devil's advocate and i'm using that term literally because it's possible this person

237
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,040
is actually the devil um sometimes it can be hard to get it in that back loop that you can't see so

238
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,200
good that's right under your sacrum or whatever and so maybe this is this person's maybe they're

239
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,720
on some next level shit right like we always got to give them the benefit of the doubt maybe they're

240
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,920
on some next level shit i have some trouble getting in that loop not a lot of trouble that

241
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:58,160
has led me to institute some pretty major life changes like this person has but maybe they just

242
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,080
like tried to get into that back loop one too many times it was like fuck this i'm doing it off my

243
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,080
body from now on i'm done missing loops i'm done with the whole thing but but missing loops is one

244
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,440
of the top 10 reasons that you have an so like you get into relationships so that you have someone

245
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,320
else in your life to say like hey you missed a loop you missed a loop stupid um all right i'm

246
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,040
gonna don't can i read a yahoo now or is do we have more things to just drag this person for

247
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,400
i just don't i'm trying i feel like okay i feel like our specific brand of comedy is two things

248
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:38,160
one so random just really like like family guy used to be yeah but the other thing about it is

249
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:44,560
that it's positive i want it's like travis said i want to come up with something before i want to

250
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,040
leave some sliver of light so this person is just not like we've just banished their beloved to

251
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,680
some sort of extra realm and i really would like to come with some sliver of light that might

252
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,480
give them like just let them sleep because this is a comedy podcast and they're not going to act

253
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
on any of this but they do have to sleep next to this person i want to give them something to cling

254
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,720
to here's what you should do here's what you need to do once again i think just like the table

255
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,680
scenario tell this person like hey have you ever thought about putting your belt on after you put

256
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,960
your pants on and then watch the light come over their face as they're like yeah this is another

257
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,480
it's another opportunity to change this person's life maybe um i have a changing joy of putting

258
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,880
on your pants and then putting the belt on putting on putting your pants on normal like a person

259
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,280
marie khan marie says you should um touch all the articles of clothing and let them sort of tell you

260
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,600
what they want that you should thank them after like if you wear your shoes all day you should

261
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,080
thank your shoes and um sorry who's this saying who's saying these wild things marie kondo for

262
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,120
of the author of the life changing magic of tidying up okay um which traps and i both

263
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,120

264
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,760

285
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,080
time i was nine when i seen the movie and when i got introduced to him again when i watched

286
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,640
mississippi burning i had this dream about him i was laying in my bed and closed my eyes and the

287
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,000
next thing you know it's black i can't see a thing then suddenly willam defoe pops into my dream from

288
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,040
nowhere he's smiling at me and so focused he mouthed something to me that is hard to see

289
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
he mouthed something to me that is hard to see it was like he was saying thank you to me what does

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:17,040
this mean um there's only one answer to this lala yahoo answers user lala uh gave the answer a new

291
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,000
change in your life and the asker actually rated this answer and gave it two out of five stars

292
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,840
so they were not satisfied with this so i'm hoping maybe we can do a little bit better than mala

293
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,920
um before we get into it i have a quick quick uh question there's a kind of would you rather like

294
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,920
we always do on the show every week would you rather have willam defoe smile at you

295
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:47,040
or like frown at you scowl at you i can't decide which one is better or worse either way it's a

296
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,960
it's a story um this if willam defoe comes into your dream though and mouths something that you

297
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,920
can't quite hear because you're in the upside down what's what's what's that what does that even

298
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,680
what does that mean is that really willam defoe's like consciousness that he sends out he's a dream

299
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:11,040
walker okay now we're getting somewhere um i want to i want you all to hop in the time machine with

300
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,440
me we're gonna head back to may 4th 2015 uh episode 250 of my brother my brother invest in the biz

301
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,560
and now i thought this question sounded familiar to me but i was only partially right this is a

302
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,840
question from episode 250 for no reason i've been crying over willam defoe i was in my room watching

303
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,000
one of his interviews and when it finished i turned over to watch tv a few days later i burst

304
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
out in tears and i don't know if it was me thinking about willam or it was something else

305
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,840
i haven't been paying attention to him as much as i used to uh i have been doing it for a few days

306
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,160
my boyfriend knows the reason for my crying he's comforted me about it my friend maggie told me to

307
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,360
stop crying and to shut up about willam defoe i've looked up to him since i was nine years old

308
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
i'm 17 now though my boyfriend said just remember i'm here for you if you need anything or if you

309
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,000
want to talk about things like celebrities then i'm here for you if you guys are gonna say it's

310
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,800
your hormones it's not i can tell you this isn't going on for days i go outside a lot so don't

311
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,840
say it's that either could someone please help me is crying over a celebrity normal what is willam

312
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:23,040
defoe okay doing i mean what is he doing he's definitely projecting himself into like some

313
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,440
sort of midnight channel-esque sort of shadow world where he can walk between our consciousness

314
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,000
when it's raining at midnight willam defoe pops up on the tv and tells you um the day you'll die

315
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,560
and the name of your true love so he gives he gives and he takes and also what time spider-man

316
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,920
one is going to be on tbs the answer is always always always always always tbs we've got spider-man

317
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,600
one that's that's their fucking motto um so i don't i don't want to be mean to willam defoe

318
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,440
but i think he's i think he does i think he's you know a shadow that walks between

319
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,160
our collective subconscious you know what i mean yeah i don't think that's mean yeah i mean if you

320
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:13,280
think about it have you ever you've seen william defoe a lot right i mean not in person exactly

321
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,240
yeah we've never seen william defoe in person isn't that interesting isn't that curious now

322
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,960
just suggesting that anytime william defoe is in a movie he's been uh portrayed in motion capture

323
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,720
by andy circus no i'm saying that he is only lives in movies and tv oh and in our dreams

324
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,720
apparently apparently he's apparently tv movies aren't enough for him anymore and he's just

325
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,160
started to come into our minds directly when alexander graham bell discovered the electronic

326
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,520
transmission he sent a recording of what happy birthday or mary had a little lamb and it was like

327
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:56,720
mary mary had a little eris fleece was white as snow and then it was like hello daniel daniel

328
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,120
it's me you've set me free it's william defoe i exist here in the midnight channel and ever since

329
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,360
then just everything fucking dallas watch dallas look in the background there he is yeah it's him

330
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:16,080
he's just looking for a door looking for the door out steve guttenberg opens his printing press he's

331
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,080
so stoked he finally cracked it he stole that wine press technology from the italians and he

332
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,480
made it his own and turned it into a printing press he's so stoked and he lifts it up after

333
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,080
typesetting the first page of the bible and what's there is it the first page of the bible

334
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:37,200
it is not is the face of william defoe staring him back it made in like ascii art of this guttenberg

335
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,240
press exactly i thought you were gonna say in the in the is it three men and a baby that scene where

336
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,600
there's the shadow behind the curtains that like nobody knew what it was and everybody thinks it's

337
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,160
a ghost no that's william just looking for looking for the looking for his starring role in the

338
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,720
picture he's a good actor though yeah all right work he's a good actor for sure i mean i'm just

339
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:04,880
saying like have you ever seen him be bad in something never never he's just so consistent

340
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,040
spider-man for sure definitely was not good in that no he was sorry justin he was very good in

341
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,320
that um okay agree to disagree that's fine i mean i think it's a little overblown he played the

342
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,800
green goblin did you want like a reserved quiet performance no my problems with his performance

343
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,320
were probably sam raimi centric to me yeah let's uh let's let's take a moment to talk about the max

408
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,880
once again made the first kind of like four questions on a theme of people doing things

409
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,360
that are inexplicable i didn't mean to but we've just been getting so many questions lately

410
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,720
that i think like subconsciously i've started building thematic episodes interesting yeah

411
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,600
um so let's continue with our theme hey brothers so my dad doesn't own a cell phone claiming he

412
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,760
doesn't need one cool instead he'll use the phone at work to call us and tell us when he's coming

413
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,600
home if my dad is anywhere else though and needs to contact us he will either ask a stranger to

414
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,920
borrow their cell phone or ask an employee to use their phone just recently my dad called me and the

415
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,880
caller id said it was mcdonald's i don't want my dad to inconvenience these people any longer

416
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,360
how do i convince my dad to finally get a cell phone and that's from secondhand anxiety in florida

417
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:53,680
i'm getting thirdhand anxiety from this obviously we recoil from this but is there not a part of you

418
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:02,640
that thinks like boy that that might be nice yeah it would be nice to be the sort of person that

419
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,840
you could look around and say well everyone else has cell phones i don't think i need one someone

420
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,760
there will have one literally everybody else has them so i think i'm okay there'll be somebody else

421
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,360
around that i can use their cell phone i can't imagine living that i really i can't imagine it

422
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:27,520
now i have i have thought many times about like you know you go into a movie and like you you know

423
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,960
you silence or turn off your cell phone you should turn it off and i have like a little panic every

424
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,240
time i do of like what if somebody needs to get a hold of me during this hour and 45 minutes and

425
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,160
like i think about what if i just didn't have a phone ever right and i could just like go to dinner

426
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,920
without worrying about oh i felt a buzz in my pocket what if it's important i better check it

427
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,840
because there was a time in our lifetimes where like if you weren't home people would just call

428
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,440
your house and leave a message and maybe you heard it like five hours later and that was fine and

429
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,320
everybody was just okay with that that's cool i like that kind of like wouldn't it be nice to

430
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,680
just have the freedom to not do this for a while but to do that but then also be like hey can i

431
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,320
borrow your your phone this thing that you're doing there's the rub this is our shock at this

432
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,480
is a very privileged like position to take right like cell phones are fucking expensive and like

433
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,040
of course not everybody has one that's kind of a um kind of a whack assumption at at the same time

434
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:36,240
though like um if i get a call and the call is from mcdonald's that's gonna be maybe the

435
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,240
worst moment of my life because i'm going to i i don't know that i will answer i probably won't

436
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,400
answer that call sorry dad or maybe i will if i expect like oh boy a car from a call from frish's

437
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,920
big boy well this is my dad um that one's gonna be my dad because one time you're gonna answer

438
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,120
your dad what would that call for mcdonald's be like hey did you have some nugs last week yeah

439
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,760
oh boy if you answered there's gonna be one of those though right trav where you answer you're

440
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,440
like dad will you please get a fucking cell phone and it's like hi we're doing a customer

441
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:13,520
service about the shamrock shake and i'm sorry it's it's it's that part to me is un untenable

442
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,520
your dad is pulling a power play here because think about it think through it if he needs a

443
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:27,440
cell phone he can get one if you need your dad that's tough nuggies oh you can't get this man

444
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:34,400
this man is saying to you like no you can't have me i'm i'm elusive i want it to be special when

445
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,240
you nail me when you when you when you manage to to corral me into talking to you it should feel

446
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,560
like an event because it's your dad is holding himself hostage from you exactly yeah exactly

447
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,880
but he's also valuing himself higher so that when you do manage to get a call from your dad it's

448
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,920
like seeing craig t nelson at the airport it's that level of excitement got my dad found him

449
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,560
all right he's at mcdonald's go move move swat team go activate here i here's what you should

450
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,720
do i thought i think i have an answer okay you should tell your dad that you've been getting uh

451
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,960
like some uh like uh telemarketers and some you know kind of scam calls and you're not answering

452
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,800
calls from unknown numbers anymore but i mean that doesn't work that doesn't work the caller

453
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,000
id tells you that it's from mcdonald's then that's all the answer if you call me from that mcdonald's

454
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,560
because it's a number i know and they use the code word ducktales then i'll know and i'll

455
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:43,040
code word ducktales then i'll know um i think you should pay someone to to to tag your dad oh

456
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,120
i think you should get someone like graffitium no i think you should get someone to tranquilize

457
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:55,680
it up on my dad tranquilize your dad okay well that's very expensive what griffin is suggesting

458
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,680
is a tale i don't think a dad tale is necessary i don't think every time poor um oscar the dad

459
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,320
looks at his rear view mirror and sees like a white camaro the same white camaro that's always

460
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,520
there i don't think he needs that in his life that seems like a lot what i was suggesting was mark

461
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,880
echoes get up on my dad get up on my dad and put your art up on my dad your spray that i'm suggesting

462
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:27,840
that you tranquilize him and you give him like an uh a gps tag geocaching so geocache your dad and

463
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,840
then call then you can just like call the nearest phone to your dad wherever if you need him you

464
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:39,120
just see what phones are around there yeah and call and say like hey can you yell the name oscar

465
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,640
very loud to try to get oscar the dad over here so i may speak with him about whether or not he

466
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,560
wants to go see rogue one this afternoon please if you have a moment um i have a very related

467
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,160
yahoo that i'm i would be delighted if you all would let me read okay i was sent in by Amelia

468
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,280
Burger thank you Amelia it's by yahoo answers user derk and it's it's a similar vein of like

469
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,520
how to how did folks get in touch without phones right but the wording of this question is maybe

470
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:36,880
the best derk asks how did people know when to meet back in vampire times i know

471
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,360
i know that they wrote more letters you gotta let me get through it i know that they wrote

472
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,520
more letters and stuff but back in vampire times how did you make plans with friends

473
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,080
did they just wait around all day and hope that they ran into each other

474
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,240
you could make all the plans you want the vampires are gonna ruin them

475
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,640
i mean you could write a letter it's like meet me at ye olde arby's this afternoon but a vampire

476
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,880
is just gonna be waiting there to to harangue you hey meet me there at 2 p.m can't do that

477
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:19,680
can we make it 2 a.m the sun the sun is an issue the sun is bad for vampires so i mean this is

478
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,960
before i'm gonna set that let's set the let's set the stage it's vampire times there's no

479
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,960
there's no electronic communication which of course means william defoe is still trapped

480
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,360
in that that uh that that you know spectral cage somewhere before alexander graham bell let him out

481
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:43,440
um and i want to get in touch with you uh i want to get in touch with dad to go see rogue one

482
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,920
do i just like go to the theater and just like hope he like do i just yell out my window like

483
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,560
dad dad dad rogue one rogue one and just like hope that he like falls under the thrall of my

484
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:01,440
voice somewhere or is it do i do i like uh fucking the end of uh christmas carol just

485
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,480
like pay a boy just be like go find my dad and invite him to the theater to see a live

486
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,120
performance of rogue one you have to send your familiar you gotta send your renfield

487
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,760
right your renfield goes and like delivers the message to your vampire dad and then vampire dad

488
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,160
like gives him i guess some bugs to eat or something and then renfield returns to you and

489
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,680
then actually can i tell you something it was actually a much more efficient system than we

490
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:33,520
have now i suppose so um in many ways in many ways it wasn't but in many ways it was if you

491
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,840
think about it but like in vampire times how did folks know to meet up though it's a good question

492
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,520
i mean that's why we had public how like public houses right was that a thing i've heard that

493
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,720
term before are those just houses where people could be at and yeah you've been up there for a

494
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,160
bite maybe this is what maybe this is what town criers were doing this is what john criers were

495
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,560
up to where you would go and you'd be like hey town crier can you holler for my dad and just

496
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:08,720
tell him meet the theater live performance of of rogue one um at at 4 p.m and then we're gonna

497
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,080
run the fuck home before sunset because we don't have movies yet so we're just reading the script

498
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:19,440
yeah it's a rogue one out loud um and we're gonna get the fuck home before the sun sets

499
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:28,000
because it's gonna get choppy out here say say you're in your amazing like dave is at pinkberry

500
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,960
everyone dave's at pinkberry like that's what the town crier does he just

501
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,360
broadly announces your locale he's just flipping through index cards just like

502
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,920
greg is at jamba juice susan is at j crew and she's waiting for michelle

503
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:52,400
well tyler's at orange julius a lot of juice stores back in vampire times

504
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,600
really gentrified here timothy has been killed by a vampire michael has been killed by a vampire

505
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,680
okay i have i have an actual question for you if a vampire was stalking and trying to kill a

506
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:19,760
specific person okay would it be easier for the vampire to track and kill this person back then

507
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,480
when you there was a limited number of places you could be and you probably should tell somebody

508
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,800
where you're gonna be or else it's gonna be like a whole thing or now when we have like technology

509
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,680
and twitter and everything and like foursquare and what have you when would be an easier time

510
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:48,080
for a vampire to find find people um here's what i'll say i've got in my house which i i just don't

511
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:54,720
i don't leave this house because i food is sent to me by blue apron and then i stay inside the

512
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:01,520
house all day and hang out with my wife and my baby and i play zelda non-stop uh and persona

513
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,240
non-stop and so i just don't leave the house and vampos can't come in here without permission which

514
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,680
i am not going to hand out lightly to a vampo thank you so but i think back in the day it'd

515
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,280
be like time to go outside to the well chomp dead okay you know that's a good point because the

516
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,000
follow-up question i have justin along those same lines is do you think it was easier back

517
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,600
in vampire times for a vampire to gain permission to enter your house because everyone was like so

518
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:33,040
dumb and trusting and now everyone just hates every other human being and it's a lot harder to

519
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,840
get somebody to let you into their house like if somebody came to my door now not only would i not

520
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,760
let them in i probably wouldn't even go to the door like they'll leave if they have something

521
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,520
for me they'll just leave it there like if they haven't told me they're coming over i'm not letting

522
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:52,160
them in i always kind of assumed that the vampire has to be invited in thing is something that

523
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,080
vampires made up and spread around because it's so fucking funny can you imagine nothing like it

524
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:05,920
would be a nightly hilarious event for you to like see some dumb human standing in the window

525
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,240
like neither neither neither you just like pounce through the window and eat them like that's gotta

526
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:16,080
be the funniest shit yeah um man what happened all the vampos then though because it's not

527
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:24,320
vampo times now where did they go i bet they're on wall street and that topical because they're

528
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:30,400
bleeding us dry am i right because they're bleeding us dry yeah man on wall street i bet

529
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:39,280
they're all bankers money never sleeps suck because they suck blood i guarantee that's

530
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,880
that's got to be a tagline for a movie somewhere right vampire bankers these interest rates suck

531
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:54,800
something like that something along those lines trading stocks and biting knocks do you mean necks

532
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,640
that's a bad rhyme having having having sex and biting necks and now it's like sexy

533
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:10,240
like wall street like powerful power mr big mr big up at the top turns out he's a vampire the

534
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,440
whole time and he's the one who wants to be with you um i have a friend that i frequently hold on

535
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,280
i think rachel locked herself out one second there's joe's witnesses right outside my window

536
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,080
so i'm gonna be down here for a little bit okay what are they doing griffin are you okay

537
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,680
they won't leave they keep knocking this is this is literally germane to the

538
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,360
conversation we were just having about not wanting to open the door for strangers

539
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,160
are you okay i mean i'm good i just don't i don't want them to know i'm in here you don't

540
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:49,600
have to talk to other human beings yeah we're good we're good though let's just move on i bet

541
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:55,920
jehovah's witnesses by the way would not be so fucking cavalier if we're still in vampire time

542
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,680
absolutely not i i think justin you would find that most people wouldn't be yeah not just yeah

543
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,920
that's a good point let's go ahead and move on to keep do you just take the real

544
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,680
deep do you just take the reins for a little bit i'm riding this one out

545
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,720
i have a friend that i frequently communicate uh via text formats i am twitter text messages

546
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,920
and this friend frequently as a way of expressing playfulness or a joke sincerely

547
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:33,120
uses the winky emoticon semicolon close parentheses yeah we i know what it is it gives

548
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:39,920
me the absolute heebie jeebies it makes me feel bad to look at every single time what's a cool

549
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,840
way to get my friend to stop being a text grosso and that is from skeeved by semicolons

550
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,920
i think i don't know people have quirks anymore can't people just have a quark

551
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:01,360
a fun quark you have to sand the edges off of everyone oscar doesn't want a phone he's a dad

552
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,000
that's his law he could just live it why can't he just live it why can't this person just use

553
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,600
a similar emoticon if they want to sexy wall street vampire just wants to trade stocks and

554
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,280
biting the ox why can't we just let them do that and be them it is murder so that's actually yeah

555
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,160
that one's a crime that was what this isn't fighting the knock doesn't have to be murder

556
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,280
you can stop shy of draining the person that's true let me get a smack a roll of that good good

557
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:35,840
neck honey um so this do they do this irl and that's another sort of emoticon that means

558
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,640
in the in the flesh world um do they winkle a lot you know do they wink a lot

559
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:50,240
does it make you lol or does it make you you which stands for uncomfortable um can i oh you've just

560
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,240
remind me i've never i've never had an opportunity to share this story and i really want to it was

561
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:01,360
very brief anecdote i was listening to uh npr and they did like an ad read for i guess a play that

562
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:08,160
was going on locally about like you know text and the internet and stuff and the announcer said um

563
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:15,680
with plenty of jokes uh it'll give you lots of laugh out louds and i just i assume that the text

564
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,240
said lols and they just went ahead and said the whole thing it's one of my favorite things i've

565
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,880
ever heard in my whole life that's so good excuse me laugh out louds that's my if you could review

566
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:31,200
our podcast and just say that it gave me laugh out louds i would appreciate it um it's it's it's this

567
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,640
is this is this is some this is an easy fix this is a one sentence fix hey that thing that you do

568
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,960
it's like not how you're supposed to use the thing so just think about it like google that

569
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,400
emoticon and its proper usage and then like maybe you could stop doing it because it's inherently

570
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,720
like sexy playful when you wink like we've got a lot of winking questions i'm so old i don't know

571
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,440
what the problem is what's the problem i need like i needed that you should probably see this

572
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,400
question is still buffering because they they could probably handle it that is an excellent

573
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,520
i don't i don't actually know is it bad let me pitch this justin all right two scenarios

574
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:15,280
had a great time hanging out last night like colon parentheses smiley face oh they had a great time

575
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:23,600
had a great time hanging out last night winky emoticon yeah it's it's it's it's different

576
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:30,800
for sure there's a different vibe i texted i just texted you two boys okay yeah

577
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,800
this is innocuous enough i just texted having a great time recording with y'all

578
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,160
and then a winky emoticon the wink makes it seem like there's an underlying secret like having a

579
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,800
great time recording with you all and my balls are with my balls like hanging out in my pants

580
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:57,440
um i i um i once did a business dealing of a lar like a house transaction with uh a couple

581
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:05,440
and listen a wall street vampire over here one of the people in the house transaction uh use ellipses

582
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:13,920
at the end of every text oh man like every single text there was an ellipses so and we were talking

583
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:21,520
a lot about like house stuff like we'll have someone look at the wiring dot dot dot so are

584
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,680
you mad about it yeah are you really not gonna do it i don't understand that's like the most loaded

585
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,520
yeah uh three periods you can put in anything there's no room for furtive disappointment when

586
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:39,200
you're dealing when you're spending a bunch of money on a house i guess i always i always think

587
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,960
of the ellipses in that scenario is like the thing that people do in like really tense horror movies

588
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,920
where it's like we haven't seen him in weeks dot dot dot yeah exactly old man at the gas station

589
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:59,920
that's like you don't want to go up to that cabin um winky smiley winky wink oops i did the wrong one

590
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:08,640
but you want to fog eggplant peach eggplant peach that's my wiener that's your whatever

591
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:16,320
taster's choice um how about another yahoo yeah um this one was sent in by ah shit there's a

592
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,560
lot of really good ones how about this one from irham wisessa thank you irham is by yahoo answers

593
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:30,800
user charmista asks does adding flavor to water makes it juice well i want to drink more water

594
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,480
and only way i think i'd enjoy it is if i add flavor but would that change the water

595
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:44,000
into juice and not give me the same benefits as plain water i like this you get that you get the

596
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,400
commercials for that's the you know smart water turbo drops or whatever and it's like add this

597
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,320
to make your water less boring this is this isn't your dad's water this is turbo drop cool water

598
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:00,480
and it turns blue and i guess it has a flavor to it does it stop at that point does it stop

599
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,400
being water and now it's like well it doesn't make sense to drink what you're supposed to drink eight

600
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:11,760
cups of water a day um you can't eat you can't drink eight cups of juice a day right we're gonna

601
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,160
make a lot of jokes here folks but i want to be honest this is travis pulling back the curtain

602
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,200
for a second i don't know yeah i know a lot of the times we don't know we sort of figure it out

603
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,240
by just sort of bouncing off each other just being a couple goofballs here's a here's a question

604
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,520
right okay so like if i get a diet coke with lemon which is the only way that i get diet coke

605
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:39,120
if i get a diet i know if i get a diet coke with lemon and i put some in it it's diet coke with

606
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:47,280
lemon if i do that with water i'm i'm hurtling towards lemonade i'm like yeah there is a very

607
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:55,040
thin line of deviance from water before it loses the label i feel like this is true because every

608
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:01,360
morning i take eight cups of water and i put some ground up shit in it and now it's coffee

609
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,280
it's not water anymore that's it you guys just unlocked it you guys just unlocked the fucking

610
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,840
secret and i was hoping we would get here but this is like i'm like morpheus right now like

611
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:15,440
welcome to the next level boys because every drink is just water with some stuff in it every

612
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,720
drink in the world is just you go to one of those fucking make your own flavor adventure soda

613
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,040
machines and what do you think happens in there you're like i want a orange fanta with a cherry

614
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,200
splash and a little bit of mountain dew in it that's just they're adding syrups to carbon to

615
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,600
water that has been added bubbles to it and it's all water folks just with different stuff in it

616
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,280
you know what i mean that wine wine is just grape water that grapes ate and then they got old and

617
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,720
squeezed and then that water that took a different form is grape stuff came out and now it's wet ain't

618
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,440
it it's wet and red and it tastes weird but that's water in there sorta um here's a yahoo i have a

619
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:03,520
yahoo answer from oh there not it's not on here i don't know where you would see it i've never read

620
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:12,880
one is every drink made out of water yeah that is the question here um and the only this divergence

621
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,640
from that is pretty much everything you could want to drink contains some water there are potable

622
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,360
liquids such as glycerin that you could drink even though they are a hydrous which i guess means don't

623
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:32,960
hydrate you then it's not a liquid i'm sorry liquid means water plus something it's all

624
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,720
remixed if you drink fucking beer that's just remixed water does somebody put their fun spin

625
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:47,760
on what about milk no it's just water with uh cow leave with cow stuff in it yeah cows drink the

626
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,640
water and that help if a cow doesn't drink water they die straight up that's what's that's what's

627
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,840
up and a lot of people won't tell you that i'll tell you that's your face cows die if they don't

628
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,080
drink water they drink that water it nourishes them and it goes down in their teats and it

629
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,760
mix up with the cow stuff and it juices out and then i drink it and i get very sick what about

630
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,320
clearly canadian that might actually damn that might be the exception no it's just water they

631
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:17,120
added bubbles to and distinct canadian flavors and it's exciting canadian water next what about

632
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:26,320
lacroix lacroix is water with like the most faint a droplet uh i actually think that lacroix doesn't

633
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:32,000
have flavoring in it and it's all fucking like psychosomatic like you see a green new clothes

634
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,600
yeah you see a green can you're like this tastes like lime and you drink it and it's like no it's

635
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,720
just kind of like bubbly water but you're like mm lime yummy yummy yum no it tastes like green

636
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:47,440
can because that's what your brain sees next um i have some i i have something that might be

637
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,560
germane to this and it's like think something to think about along these lines every uh basically

638
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:59,920
every molecule of what we of course we have the same you know most of the same water molecules

639
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:06,480
here on earth as it will have been on earth did you realize that pretty much every water molecule

640
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,320
that you drink was at one time peed out by a dinosaur i think about it all the time justin

641
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,120
that's a pretty i think that's very empowering i think it's a pretty rock and roll thing to be

642
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:24,640
able to start your day with a big glass of dinosaur piss we are all made of star stuff and dino pee

643
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,880
we're you're like i'm how are you gonna start your day you fucking amazing creature well i

644
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,480
think i'm gonna drink some dinosaur piss and fucking kick ass all day long like yeah that

645
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,440
sounds pretty rocking that's actually a really good idea most water molecules haven't been

646
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,960
drunk by people before you're not drinking second-hand water from people you're drinking

647
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,160
from dinosaurs yeah you're infinite and powerful think about that the next time you're in a pool

648
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,920
and somebody says something like oh don't pee in the pool you're like oh fucking t-rex already

649
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,000
pissed in here shut up dennis dennis you dick pissed it all out did you guys know that the

650
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,600
original name for josta was dino piss but it didn't test well so they changed it to justa

651
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:14,800

656
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,480
you can afford so we talked about we talked about the five dollar level and the ten dollar level and

657
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,680
the twenty dollar level i would like to tell you about the thirty five dollar level it is one of

658
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:54,080
my favorites i know and here's the thing all the rewards stack so at thirty five dollars you get

659
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,960
the bonus content that you get at five dollars the pen that you get at ten dollars the cuban

660
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:05,280
touch kit that you get at twenty dollars but you also get a set of engraved beer mugs with the max

661
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,800
fun rocket logo right on there now i say beer mugs you can use these for any beverage you want

662
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:16,880
it's all gonna be water-based so some kind of water-based beverage in there no glycerin um

663
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:24,160
and it's going to make just a stunning addition to any glassware collection that you might have um

664
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:29,200
and then at a hundred dollars you get all that stuff plus you get entered into the monthly

665
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,720
culture club and what this is is every month a max fun producer or max fun host someone that

666
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:41,040
works with max fun is going to pick some form of media maybe it's an album or a movie or a book

667
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,160
something that means a lot to them and you're going to get sent that along with a note as to

668
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,600
why they picked it so it's like everybody is enjoying the same media that month binding you

669
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,440
all together cosmically then at two hundred dollars a month which listen i realize two hundred

670
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:05,200
dollars a month is is a pretty uh not insubstantial sum but it goes a long way to support the artist

671
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:10,000
an artist that you love and for two hundred dollars a month you get all that stuff plus

672

685
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:25,280
it i just like it so much we'll save it for next time no i griffin please please let me say it

686
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:31,920
all right please please an exterminator just came to my apartment he was throwing little blue things

687
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,720
under my kitchen counter and i asked what they were he said that they were calcium packets because

688
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:41,840
when mice eat calcium it goes straight to their hearts and they have a little mouse heart attack

689
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:49,040
his words why does it go straight to their heart because quote mice have no bones just a skeleton

690
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:56,720
end quote my exterminator said mice have no bones just a skeleton and then proceeded to explain

691
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:03,440
that rats have an exoskeleton he did this while spraying my home with chemicals am i good and

692
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:12,320
that's from skeletal head scratcher get out of the house right now you have to he then proceeded to

693
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,880
put his belt on his pants on the floor before strapping them onto his body my belt's come a

694
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:25,840
little loose uh if you'll excuse me from the room on my planet bortelotron 6 mice have an exoskeleton

695

now please allow me to belt my pants juice would you be more into justin's definitely afraid of

696
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:39,360
mice would you be more into them if they had an exoskeleton more because then i feel like
