1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother My Brother being the advice show for the

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm that sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Just want to do a quick review. First off,

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,240
congratulations to our friend, the person we I feel like we inspire every day,

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,600
Lin-Manuel Miranda. He was on Saturday Night Live, and I was just thinking we could talk about some

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,440
of the best. I mean, here's the thing. He's a he's a he's a friend and an inspiree by us,

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,600
and so there's I feel like but if we're going to like you, I would say if we're if we're reviewing

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,280
the product, I'm I've got to be impartial. I've got to be ethical about it. It should be easy

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,440
to be impartial because we are recording this Saturday afternoon long before the episode is

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,120
aired, so I feel like that will make it really easy to be impartial, to remain impartial as far

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,520
as judging the episode goes. I feel like we don't go into his house and write musicals.

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,200
You know what I mean? But he's coming into goof tavern. He's drinking our goof ale. He's

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,440
maybe eating up all the goof pretzels on the counter, leaving none for anyone else.

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,200
What were some of your guys' favorite sketches that Lin did? Because I got to tell you,

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,200
when he brought back that classic Chris Kattan character, Mango, and it was like I could not

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,400
believe he dropped Mango on us. He did that. He did Wayne's World. I thought Mango was actually

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,000
as a tribute to me. I was really touched. In fact, I wept a little bit. What I didn't like

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,480
very much is how they had Chris Kattan in old age makeup, and he came back as like an elderly Mango,

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
and Lin was like new Mango. I really didn't understand why that was necessary.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,080
Justin, I don't want to disillusion you. We haven't seen Chris Kattan in a while.

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm not certain that was makeup.

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,760
I didn't like the part where old Mango and Lin as young Mango fought each other,

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:51,520
but because what got weird is that it seemed like it was not scripted to be like that,

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,720
and it was just like our friend Lin Manuel Miranda was having a very real,

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,080
very live fight with Chris Kattan on the stage with real punches and blows, and I was like,

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
is this supposed to be happening right now?

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
Are we supposed to be watching this?

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,880
Because there was a point where Chris Kattan was just screaming,

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,920
how could you do this to me, Lin? This was mine. This was my baby. You took this from me, Lin.

34
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,240
I do Mango, he said, over and over again.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
He just kept screaming, I do Mango.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,040
I am Mango. Let me pivot just real quick. I got to bring it up. Coneheads.

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,800
Oh boy, that's great.

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Did not see that coming.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
And the fact that they combined the Coneheads with the Spartan Cheerleaders, which honestly-

40
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
Was a strange one.

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
Brilliant. I thought it was brilliant. I get it. I get what they're-

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,840
I think it's about the current political climate was kind of what they were satirizing there,

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
and I thought it was great.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,840
I didn't understand why he came out as Cube Boy during the Conehead set.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,520
And again, it was one of those things where all of the actors on stage just stopped,

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
and they're like, Lin, what are you doing?

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
Why are you trying to create this new character Cube Boy?

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
This is not how we did it in dress rehearsals.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
And Lin's thing was definitely funnier, but it was just, again, just kind of a weird energy.

50
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,120
One thing that was weird to me was also that he brought Fire Marshall Bill back.

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
That's a Mad TV character that James K did.

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,960
And I don't even know why he would be Fire Marshall. He called it Bob.

53
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,480
And I don't know if he forgot what he was originally called or what,

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,360
but he did the whole, let me try to get something, that whole thing.

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,800
He did that character.

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,960
You know what, Justin, now that you mention it, I also thought it was weird

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,480
when he came on as Baggins, Sagan, Barry, Keenan Thompson's character from All That.

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,440
That was really weird.

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,600
Why did he make Keenan stand outside a window on the set and watch the whole scene?

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
That was so strange.

61
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,120
I thought it was weird when they just sort of stopped

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,440
and then Lin did a scene word for word from Martin

63
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,720
where he played every role in the TV show Martin.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
I remember that.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,160
I remember.

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
Is this even Saturday Night Live anymore?

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,840
It was like a multimedia experience.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
And don't get me wrong, I loved it, A+, yes, absolutely, it was amazing.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
But it was like, it doesn't seem like he told anybody he was going to do it.

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,720
Remember how they got the motorized armchair from the DAB from Roundhouse

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
and Lin drove it around on stage for 20 minutes in silence?

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And he just kept saying, look at me.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
Don't look away.

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
Just watch it.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
I do think he brought it home when he brought out the record player

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
and he lip-synced to Mighty Mouse,

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,400
but he just did the part, here I come to save the day.

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,160
That was so unique and new and no one's ever done anything like that before.

79
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
It was a really good episode, though.

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
It was so good.

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
You know who was great?

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,160
You know who I really liked was 25 pilots?

83
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,600
No, they lost four.

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
They lost four, they're down to 21.

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,880
Damn.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,000
I know, it's a real shame.

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,760
But you know, in this economy, you just can't afford all those pilots.

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,000
Back in my day, you could smoke on a plane while 21 pilots had to watch you.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
And what are they doing?

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
There were 21 joysticks on the plane.

91
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
What are you doing?

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
You could get 25 pilots for a nickel.

93
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,880
Yeah.

94
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,200
And movies were better.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,120
This is an advice show, really.

96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
If you think about it.

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,760
If you think about it, this is an advice show.

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,840
We don't need to advise Lin.

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,240
He already just like crushed it on Snull.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
So I'm ready to just do our thing now.

101
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,760
Yeah, let's get wild.

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,240
Let's do it.

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
Let's really get back in our wheelhouse.

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,080
We're back.

105
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
I love my big brother to death.

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,880
Oh, no.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
That was a weird accent.

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,080
I shouldn't have done that.

109
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah.

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,160
I love my big brother to death.

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
We're very good friends and often go to social gatherings together.

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,160
He's probably the nicest guy I know, which is generally a good thing,

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
but has some unfortunate side effects.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,160
He sometimes takes up to 30 to 40 minutes to leave a place

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,280
because he has to say individual and personalized goodbyes to everyone,

116
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,520
which leaves me waiting by the door awkwardly more times than I'd like to admit.

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
Although I know it comes from a very good place.

118
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
I'm pretty irritated by this.

119
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,560
Am I good?

120
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
Should I say something?

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,200
If I do, how do I do it without hurting his feelings?

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,760
That's from Tardy and Tired in Tel Aviv.

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,960
Oh, that's a really good one.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
This is you shouldn't.

125
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,160
You can't change your brother.

126
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
You can change your travel arrangements to things.

127
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,200
I think that's what you got to do because I love this person.

128
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,040
It makes you feel so special.

129
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,520
Oh, sure.

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,360
When I take off, my move is I thank whoever hosted the party

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,880
and anybody I see on my way to the door and then I turn and I say,

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
bye everybody, see you later.

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,840
I walk out and do a quick little shout cast and then I scoot my way on out

134
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,320
because I also don't want to take 40 minutes to leave.

135
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,640
See my move, I just bounce like a gummy bear.

136
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,560
I just sit there and I think like, I'm done and I walk out the door.

137
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,280
Well, that's oftentimes that's just how impulsive I am.

138
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,960
That's the energy I bring to a party.

139
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm sitting there having a great time and mid sentence,

140
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,320
it just clicks on my head like my time here is done

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,160
and I just walk out the front door.

142
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
Yeah, it's very random.

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,400
Sometimes I'll be talking to you and you'll just start screaming

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
and trying to kick me and it's like, what?

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
And it's like, I love that random energy that Travis brings.

146
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,040
And then I'm running out the door

147
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,880
and I'm going to the next adventure.

148
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,480
I really liked at my wedding when you just weren't there anymore.

149
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,880
And it was like, well, how random, how funny?

150
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
What would you guys think if he,

151
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,760
if you just showed up 30 to 40 minutes later than your brother?

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,760
So what I'm suggesting here is if you show up later,

153
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,840
then you'll be ready to go at the exact moment that he is.

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,040
You know what I mean?

155
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,080
Maybe he's like, I love my brother,

156
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,280
but he always shows up 30 to 40 minutes too early

157
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,640
to every social gathering.

158
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,840
Like I'm saying, if you came later, maybe it would balance out.

159
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,120
You'd be on the same schedule.

160
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,960
Or you could just like look at your brother and say,

161
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,920
hey, in 30 or 40 minutes, I'm going to be ready to leave.

162
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
So start doing the goodbyes.

163
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,200
Now, I will also say that I appreciate your concern,

164
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
but I doubt very much that if you said,

165
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,680
I doubt your brother is unaware of the fact

166
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,240
that you were often waiting by the door

167
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
as he says his goodbyes.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,440
Like, I think that's probably something,

169
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,280
if this has happened more than twice,

170
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,960
he's probably picked up on the fact,

171
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,600
but he just sees it as like, I love my brother,

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
but why is he so rude and doesn't say goodbye to anybody?

173
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
That's the real stitch, isn't it?

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,400
Is that your brother's doing these beautiful goodbyes,

175
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,720
never leaves a party without putting some tears

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
in those eyeballs.

177
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,560
Yeah, and you aren't doing that

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,400
unless you are just sort of catching his,

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,520
unless you're drafting, as they say in racing terminology,

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,520
you're probably not doing that.

181
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,440
So you just sit there and wait for your brother to say

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
all the goodbyes and then you probably do what I do,

183
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
which is the shout blast.

184
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,120
And then you seem probably like a dick

185
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
and so like, I know Derek so well.

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,000
His brother, Jason, I don't know him from Adam,

187
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
his other brother.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,520
Who's also very friendly.

189
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,800
Who's also extremely friendly.

190
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,120
It's just, fuck Jason, really.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
So I'm saying like, let your brother know

192
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,000
because maybe you can meet in the middle somewhere

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and arrange it more of like,

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,520
hey, I'm gonna be ready to go in like an hour.

195
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's start making our way to the door,

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
that kind of thing,

197
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360
rather than you just like standing by the door

198
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,520
and you know, because here's the thing,

199
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,120
especially if this is a recurring thing,

200
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
no matter how hard you try to hide it,

201
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,960
you're probably reading as impatient.

202
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,040
And so like-

203
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,520
And also let me clarify something.

204
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,920
I've been a brother for almost 33 years now.

205
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
He is trolling you.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,960
Like 100%, if he sees you standing by the door,

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,120
he is going to make those goodbyes last

208
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
as long as humanly possible.

209
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
100% guaranteed.

210
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,600
Bye, Dave.

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Wait, you know what, Dave?

212
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,200
Before I go, remind me, how did we meet?

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
What's the etymology of the name Dave?

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Hey, Dave, let's talk about some of our other famous Daves.

215
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
What are some of your favorite Daves, Dave?

216
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
Dave, will you for me recap in synopsis

217
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,200
the entire plot of the television show Entourage?

218
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Everyone, everyone gather around.

219
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,480
Dave is going to regale us with the plot-

220
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
The plantarage.

221
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,040
You know, the plot of Entourage.

222
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
Sit down, Jason.

223
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,360
Listen to Dave.

224
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,280
Dave, what's your favorite epic poem?

225
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,040
Remember the other day when you were recounting

226
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,640
Gilgamesh for me, Dave?

227
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,600
Do it once more.

228
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
Dave, sit with me and read all of the menu items

229
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,520
and calorie counts for every item at Taco Bell.

230
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,680
This is the problem.

231
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
This is why we shouldn't have parties anymore.

232
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,080
Parties made sense in agrarian societies

233
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,320
because at some point everybody would be like,

234
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,640
fuck, I gotta wake up early to farm.

235
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,920
I can't be here anymore.

236
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,280
Everybody agree on the time-

237
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
The first time there was an invitation printed

238
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,080
with a question mark on it, we should have retired parties

239
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,640
because we need agrarian responsibilities

240
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
to be able to get us out of parties.

241
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,560
Unless you have agrarian responsibilities,

242
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
you are not going to be able to leave any party.

243
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
This is actually why I super love being in my 30s now

244
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
because I like, Teresa and I get so excited when a party starts

245
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
at like 2 p.m. when it's like, ah, shit, yeah,

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
it's in between lunch and dinner and it will be done by six.

247
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
This is awesome.

248
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,480
God, I don't know ever when I turn 30.

249
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
I love it when it just gets lit.

250
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,920
When it gets sun up, sun down.

251
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,400
I'll raise a fucking bar for 16 hours.

252
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,120
I don't give a shit.

253
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,960
The amount of predicted discomfort required for me

254
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,560
to insist that I drive separately to an event

255
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,720
is so small, so minor, so insignificant.

256
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Ah, man, I really want to be home by 10.

257
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,960
Oh, I was thinking about staying out till about 10.15.

258
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,560
Ooh, sounds like we should drive separate then

259
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,680
because let's drive and it's 100 miles

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
and it'll take us two hours to get there,

261
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,200
but I am going to stop at one gas station on the way.

262
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Ooh, I don't know about that.

263
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,840
I should probably drive separate.

264
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

265
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, sure.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
How about this one from Level 9000 YajurJurJur Davenport?

267
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,880
Thank you, Drew.

268
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,240
It's by Yajur Answers User.

269
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,160
Question mark.

270
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,600
Who asks?

271
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,840
Why can't joggers run around in a circle?

272
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
Why do they have to run where they can pose

273
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
and flex in front of everyone?

274
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
As an extremely-

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
What?

276
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,440
Why can't joggers run around in a circle?

277
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Why do they have to run where they can pose and flex

278
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,480
in front of everyone?

279
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
As an extremely lazy person,

280
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,880
I would rather not see someone else getting fit.

281
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
I really don't need any more guilt.

282
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, wait, hold on.

283
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,520
Why can't they just run in a small circle

284
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,400
in their front yard?

285
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,640
Travis McElroy, I'm an extremely lazy person.

286
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,080
I rarely find joggers come-

287
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
As evidenced by your pronunciation

288
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
of every word in that sentence.

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,240
I rarely find joggers coming to me.

290
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
Yeah.

291
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
Like, I rarely am forced to look at joggers

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
from inside my home.

293
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
So is this lazy person, like, going to the park

294
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,600
and then they're like,

295
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
what's the deal with all these joggers?

296
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
I just came here to be lazy.

297
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,240
I tell you what I hate, though,

298
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,160
is when you do encounter one

299
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
and then they stop and they turn towards you

300
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
just glistening and they're just like,

301
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,960
oh, yes, it's me.

302
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,640
Can you believe it?

303
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,600
It's me.

304
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,100
Oh!

305
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
Drink it in!

306
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,320
Drink me up.

307
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,880
It's me.

308
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Wonderful.

309
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
How wonderful you've seen me.

310
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,640
Remember this.

311
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Tell your grandchildren's children

312
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
about the day that you met me.

313
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,240
It's why I can't go to the gym.

314
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,160
It's because it's too loud in there.

315
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
Just everybody's just like,

316
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
yes, it's me, yes.

317
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
How long would you be able to run in a circle

318
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,200
in your front yard

319
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,080
and not get arrested?

320
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,580
Yes.

321
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,520
Because I feel like if you did it for more than 15 minutes,

322
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,720
the police would come and say,

323
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,920
I don't know why,

324
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
but we're pretty sure we have to arrest you.

325
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
This is untenable.

326
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,360
If I ran around in a circle for 15 seconds in my front yard,

327
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,240
the police would have to arrest me for projectile vomiting.

328
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,740
Yeah.

329
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,320
Sir, we're arresting you for attempted suicide.

330
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,820
Thank you.

331
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,840
Save me from myself.

332
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,340
Blah!

333
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,840
Blah!

334
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,300
This is...

335
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,540
This is good fitness though, right?

336
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,380
Just do it in a circle.

337
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,180
Why not?

338
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,700
Because it would get too tiring.

339
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Yeah, dog, exercise.

340
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,020
Well, the real worry is that what ends up happening

341
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,660
is just like in DuckTales,

342
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,420
if you go in a circle too many times,

343
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,660
you're gonna wear a circle into the ground.

344
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,580
What are you talking about?

345
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,420
What the fuck are you talking about?

346
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,620
That makes perfect sense.

347
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,460
If you run in a circle for a long...

348
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,500
Think about it, Griffin.

349
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,180
Really think for once.

350
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,220
If you run in a circle in your yard for a very long time,

351
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
eventually you're going to start to dig a ditch,

352
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,620
a circle-shaped ditch.

353
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,980
First, the grass will die.

354
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,860
Very embarrassing.

355
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,140
Crop circles in my yard?

356
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,260
No, thank you.

357
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,540
And then after the grass is dead,

358
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,140
you're just gonna start digging down in the dirt,

359
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,300
and eventually you'll have a very ugly,

360
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,420
irredeemable circle from jogging in your yard.

361
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:00,920
Exactly.

362
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,820
I'm sorry, guys.

363
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,540
On this Yahoo page, there's an ad that says,

364
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,340
Melissa McCarthy says her goodbyes at 45.

365
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
No, it's not.

366
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,300
She didn't.

367
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,700
Why are you an ad on Yahoo Answers right now?

368
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,180
Why would she say her goodbyes?

369
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,180
I clicked through, and it's E Online.

370
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,380
Hey, E Online.

371
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,180
Why are you...

372
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,680
Why?

373
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:22,900
Okay.

374
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,420
Does it mean something different?

375
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,820
I saw it.

376
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,780
We were having a good time recording this podcast.

377
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,900
She was leaving a party, and it took a long time.

378
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,260
We're having a good time recording this podcast,

379
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,580
and my eyes dart to the right on the Yahoo Answers page.

380
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,100
It's like, yo, Melissa McCarthy died.

381
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,980
It's like, what?

382
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,620
Click it.

383
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,100
Just kidding.

384
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,220
Thanks for reading E Online.

385
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,340
This is an advertisement.

386
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,860
Stupid.

387
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,900
She's fine.

388
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,460
She's fine.

389
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
Is Melissa McCarthy okay?

390
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,380
No, she's good.

391
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,420
I haven't told anybody this story.

392
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,940
I've certainly never said it on the air,

393
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,620
because what if she listens?

394
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,340
And I don't know.

395
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,780
This story is not about Melissa McCarthy.

396
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,580
I know it sounds...

397
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,700
Sorry, bad transition.

398
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,780
But one day, Rachel and I were at home.

399
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,500
We were having dinner.

400
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,260
We're watching Walking Dead, I think.

401
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,180
And we get a knock at the door,

402
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,420
and it was a woman who was out for a run,

403
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,460
and she looked really bad off,

404
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
and she explained that she was very, very sick,

405
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,900
and she had just gotten very, very sick

406
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,700
while she was out on the road,

407
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,220
and she asked if she could use our bathroom.

408
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,900
And in like the kindest act maybe we've ever done,

409
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,740
we said, yeah, okay, go fuck it up.

410
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,260
Just like, I know it's gonna get really, really wild in there,

411
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,620
and please do that,

412
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,260
because the alternative is really, I guess, horrible.

413
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,580
We can't let that happen to a fellow human being.

414
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,460
And then we had to drive her home,

415
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,740
because she was very, very sick after that.

416
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
And that is like, that, guys,

417
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,660
that's why I don't want to go out jogging.

418
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,260
I'll jog in a circle in my front yard,

419
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,180
because then if I get hit,

420
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,060
and my dookie box just gets really, really crazy,

421
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,260
then I have like, I know exactly where to go.

422
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,620
What if I get lost out there,

423
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,540
and it gets wild in my dookie box,

424
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,340
because I, I don't know,

425
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,940
ate a weird salad yesterday or something.

426
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,780
See, this is why there should be on like people's front porches,

427
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,060
like on columns or something,

428
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,140
some kind of marking to let you know

429
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,540
that that's a safe house to use the bathroom at

430
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,700
if you're out jogging and you have an emergency.

431
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,380
Jogger is welcome to wreck our shop, come on in.

432
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,300
Also like, they'll give you a plate of biscuits

433
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,060
for painting the fence, that kind of thing.

434
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,460
I do want to say, it was not that bad.

435
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,940
I could, I'm glad it wasn't that bad.

436
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,220
I will admit to, I started jogging a couple months ago,

437
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,060
and, but I've mainly just been jogging

438
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,100
in the neighborhood around my house.

439
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,660
And I started doing it at the park,

440
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,780
just for a change of scenery.

441
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,860
And this is very embarrassing.

442
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,060
I had a moment when I was basically halfway

443
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,220
around the track from my car,

444
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,180
and I had this little bit of panic where I thought,

445
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,060
if I get tired of running,

446
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,180
I don't have a way back to my car other than that.

447
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,420
Like the decision to stop perambulating

448
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,020
has been robbed from me,

449
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,420
because I will have to do that to get back to my car.

450
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,140
You know what I mean?

451
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,700
I know exactly what you mean, Justin.

452
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,980
When I still lived in Los Angeles,

453
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,820
I went down to Venice Beach,

454
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,860
and I walked the dog along the Venice Beach boardwalk,

455
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,140
and I walked for a mile, and I was very proud of myself.

456
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,620
And then I realized that my car was still back

457
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,940
at the other end of that mile.

458
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,020
And I was so defeated in that moment

459
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,020
that I thought about calling a Lyft

460
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,540
to take me back to my car.

461
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,780
You don't psychically prepare for that.

462
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,220
Like you gotta be ready.

463
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,900
I'm in desperate need of some advice.

464
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,500
I was helping Lyft a table at the office,

465
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,420
and I ripped a hole in my suit pants

466
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,020
from zipper to top of belt.

467
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,260
Wait, what?

468
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,540
From zipper to top of belt?

469
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,980
Oh, probably from the bottom of zipper.

470
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,220
Bottom of zipper to top of belt on the back.

471
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,660
Oh my God.

472
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,940
That's quite a rip.

473
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,820
I've been sitting here for some time at my desk.

474
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,180
What are my next steps, brothers?

475
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,820
And that's from assless slacks.

476
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,740
This probably came in a few days ago, right?

477
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,220
So like, it has been some time.

478
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,500
I hope they got someone bringing in water and stuff.

479
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,380
I mean, it's a real 127 hour situation.

480
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,180
In the short term,

481
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,580
you're gonna have to be the last one in the office.

482
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,400
Yes.

483
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,820
Like people are gonna have to look at you

484
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,420
and be like, hey, oh, we're,

485
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,180
and you're like, yeah, just try to figure out,

486
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,260
finish up the big Robertson report.

487
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,500
Just, hey, working hard or hardly working?

488
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,380
Bill, Bill, please.

489
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,660
Please go.

490
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,340
Please just go, Bill.

491
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,780
I'm having kind of a late one too.

492
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,820
Got a big project.

493
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,900
Thought I might stay here all weekend.

494
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,700
Bill, Bill, please, God, please.

495
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,140
I'm begging you just this once, Bill.

496
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,020
You know what?

497
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,220
Let's make this an all nighter.

498
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,340
Just you and I, huh?

499
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,940
We'll work on projects together.

500
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,460
Maybe order some pizzas,

501
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,380
crack open some beers after everyone's gone.

502
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,020
How's it sound?

503
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,900
You know how you've been talking about

504
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,820
how you want to start playing D&D?

505
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,260
Well, let's do it.

506
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,780
I've got some D20s.

507
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,420
Let's go.

508
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,900
First off, stand, first off, stand up for me.

509
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,820
Bill, what?

510
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,740
Stand up for me right now in front of everyone.

511
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,700
Bill, no, I don't, I don't want to.

512
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,820
Take a bow.

513
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,380
No, no, Bill, please don't make me do this.

514
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,020
I'm calling in my favor.

515
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,940
Do me a favor and just to stand up

516
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,140
and spread your butt cheeks out.

517
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,900
Bill, no, it shouldn't be a problem

518
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,260
if your pants are good.

519
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,020
Bill, how?

520
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,820
Bill, why?

521
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,380
Bill, why?

522
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,260
Part the cheeks.

523
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,760
Bill.

524
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,620
Hey, do you remember that one time

525
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,580
that you ate my sandwich?

526
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,620
I don't know what you're talking about, Bill.

527
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,220
I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.

528
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,020
Stand up.

529
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,660
Let's see that cheek.

530
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,140
Stand up.

531
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,100
Hey guys, check this out.

532
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,420
Okay.

533
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,700
Bomb threat.

534
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,300
No, don't, no, no, no, no, no.

535
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,900
That's, that's an FBI crime.

536
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,460
The big one.

537
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,220
Okay, that's not gonna work.

538
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,980
First of all, staples I think can do this.

539
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,980
Oh, but you're gonna have to be so careful.

540
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,420
You have to take the pants off first.

541
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,100
So wait, you take your pants to staples

542
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,460
and then what, just say like,

543
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,580
hey listen, I need new pants.

544
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,740
Listen, staples is the number one office solution.

545
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,940
I think if you go in the door

546
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,500
and your asshole's showing-

547
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,580
This is an office and you need a solution.

548
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,420
Right, your asshole's showing in the office.

549
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,420
You're like, yo dog, this is,

550
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,060
now this is, now it's in your court.

551
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,940
Fix this.

552
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,220
We've got another one.

553
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,780
Debbie, get the emergency kit.

554
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,100
I'm just saying that staples

555
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,700
probably takes care of this all the time.

556
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,940
Yes.

557
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,900
Call Papa John's.

558
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,060
Call Papa John's and say,

559
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,220
I need a hot and fresh pizza delivery

560
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,580
and media mente.

561
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,660
And then as soon as the pizza gets there,

562
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,660
they stretch it out on the table,

563
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,940
the one pizza table,

564
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,380
and they put out all the pizza

565
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,620
and everybody's like, oh, grub time.

566
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,460
When everybody gets up to grub,

567
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,660
you make your exit.

568
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,860
Hello, perfect plan.

569
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,620
Except for one thing, Justin.

570
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,580
There's no flaws.

571
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,700
There's no flaws.

572
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,540
Travis, whatever you say is gonna be a fucking lie.

573
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,420
So, but go ahead.

574
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,940
Bill's on a diet.

575
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,740
Dammit, that's actually foolproof.

576
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,700
That's very good.

577
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,500
Mm-hmm.

578
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,180
Bill's getting that gluten free.

579
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,540
He brought a salad from home.

580
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,740
He ate it at 11 30

581
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,540
because he got hungry.

582
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,020
What if you just,

583
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,380
hey, what if you just fucking own it?

584
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,300
Yeah, welcome to the boss's office.

585
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,660
Like, hey, I want to raise.

586
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,020
And before you say anything,

587
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
check out this, this hole.

588
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,500
I want to raise.

589
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,620
No butts about it.

590
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,020
And then like, show them your butthole.

591
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,260
Set your pants on fire.

592
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,820
Listen.

593
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,140
Yeah.

594
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,940
If you do that,

595
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,580
everybody will be like very moved by your plight

596
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
and everybody will be very worried about you.

597
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,020
You have to very quickly get the pant fire under control.

598
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,460
And I'm seriously,

599
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,860
you probably shouldn't even let it get out of control.

600
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,620
It should be a very isolated,

601
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,460
controlled burn of your pants.

602
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,620
And in the side-

603
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,140
That's good, Justin.

604
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,300
That's good because then your pants will grow back

605
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,820
stronger and lusher than ever.

606
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,220
This is a fun little farce that you've put together.

607
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,620
A fun little Family Matters-esque romp

608
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,740
that you've built for us.

609
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,660
Maybe get your pants stuck in the shredder.

610
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,020
That's actually not bad.

611
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,260
What I'm saying is if you set your pants on fire

612
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,460
and then can get them out,

613
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,180
no one's going to question next steps.

614
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,700
I think you're going home.

615
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,540
Like, you get the rest of the day off.

616
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,540
You're going to have to figure out a way

617
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,980
to get someone stodgier than you for their pants to rip.

618
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,340
Just be grateful that it ripped the way it did.

619
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,740
And you didn't get the Kravitz gap.

620
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,260
You didn't get a full-blown Kravitz.

621
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,020
You didn't get a full-blown

622
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,500
Lenny Kravitz fault line situation.

623
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,420
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

624
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,900
Another one?

625
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,580
Sure, yeah.

626
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,100
This one was sent in by Aaron Keese.

627
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,640
The-

628
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,460
Keese Blade.

629
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,780
Nope, you've tried that one before.

630
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,060
Oh, I have.

631
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,100
Here are the keys to the kingdom.

632
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,420
The keys to the city.

633
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,060
Here's the keys.

634
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,260
Thank you, Aaron.

635
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,740
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Wesley, who asks,

636
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,940
how to make your parents think you found a lizard

637
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,780
even though you bought it online.

638
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,660
There's so many-

639
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,380
There's a lot of answers here,

640
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,900
and I'd like to just read a couple

641
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,260
just to like sort of set the tone

642
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,540
because the top answer is there's no point in lying.

643
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,500
Just tell them the truth.

644
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,140
Otherwise, the consequences will be much worse.

645
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,380
At worst, if you manage to tell them

646
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,580
it's a lizard you found outside

647
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,860
and they didn't want a lizard in the house,

648
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,820
they'll make you release it.

649
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,860
That's not a bad point.

650
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,700
I think you could just say,

651
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,260
I bought this lizard, so it lives here now.

652
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,780
They can't just be like,

653
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,580
well, no, put it outside where it doesn't belong.

654
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,780
Yeah, where are these parents

655
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,420
that would be upset if you bought a lizard?

656
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,820
But if you just like found a trash lizard outside,

657
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,180
they'd be like, oh, dunk.

658
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,540
I guess it's fate.

659
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,100
You're gonna have to say you rescued the lizard

660
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,140
from an owner that was maybe terrible.

661
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,900
Some kind of elaborate like lizard heist

662
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,980
to get a lizard out of a bad situation.

663
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,220
This is not a bad idea.

664
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,940
I tell you though, when my boy,

665
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,260
he's gonna be a real scamp, I know it.

666
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,580
When he brings the lizard into this home,

667
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,140
if he says, I found this trash lizard outside

668
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,820
and it's a bad, dirty lizard,

669
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,060
and it's gross because it lived in the dirt for a long time

670
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,260
and now it lives in the house

671
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,980
and it's gonna bring dirt into the house and be awful,

672
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,700
I will say, no, that's no good.

673
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,020
If my little scamp boy says,

674
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,580
I bought this lizard on Amazon

675
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,020
and it was four and a half stars

676
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,940
and it was Amazon Prime, so it was free shipping.

677
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,420
I'd be like, hell yes, sick purchase.

678
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,380
What's the lizard's name?

679
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,460
Beautiful, beautiful lizard, excellent.

680
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,980
I can see why it's so highly rated.

681
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,380
This is an excellent lizard.

682
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,780
How long after clicking confirm purchase

683
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,740
do you think that this person posted this on Yahoo Answers?

684
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,100
Like, ooh, shit, oh, that's right.

685
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,860
Okay, but okay, let's help this person.

686
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,620
I guess plan an inverse heist.

687
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,940
What you're gonna have to do,

688
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,660
you're gonna have to tell your parents

689
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,740
you found the lizard in the house

690
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,460
and then maybe you can angle

691
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,460
like it would never survive outside.

692
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,020
This is a house lizard and you know what?

693
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,300
Maybe it was here before us.

694
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,860
Maybe it found us in its house.

695
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
That's a power play, but if you can make it work.

696
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,620
Okay, how about this?

697
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,100
How about you find a bear and kill it

698
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,340
and kill the bear and put it in the living room.

699
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,620
Listen, hear me out.

700
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,220
Kill the bear, put the bear in the living room,

701
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,780
put the lizard on top of the bear

702
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,180
and put a little bear blood around its mouth

703
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,780
and then call on your parents really quick.

704
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,140
Like, oh my God, guys, quick, hear a lizard.

705
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,740
We saved us.

706
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,020
We got a hero on our hands.

707
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,660
Everybody quick, get in here to see this heroic lizard.

708
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,740
It has to be something like this

709
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,660
where you have to make the parents fall in love

710
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,020
with the lizard and make it seem like

711
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,420
you had nothing to do with the lizard's arrival.

712
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,740
So I'm imagining, oh, I've got it.

713
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,500
What if you put the lizard in their bedroom

714
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,900
and they walk in and they're like,

715
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,180
ah, a lizard, but then they look up

716
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,220
and what do they see?

717
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,620
It's a lizard web and in it, it says like,

718
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,980
Dan's new best friend.

719
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,060
So good.

720
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,380
And it's like a beautiful glistening web

721
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,740
and maybe there's a diamond necklace

722
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,060
hanging from the web and the lizard winks.

723
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,060
Perfect.

724
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,740
Could you try to convince them

725
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,420
that it is a reincarnated deceased family member?

726
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,740
Could you try to ask it things

727
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,020
that only Unky Phil would know?

728
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,660
And just trivia about Unky Phil,

729
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,740
put it in some of his favorite shirts, that kind of thing.

730
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,980
So it could be like, oh, if this is Unky Phil,

731
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,140
not Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince of Bel Air,

732
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,900
but Unky Phil, a wholly different entity,

733
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,300
then what I want you to do, lizard,

734
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,540
is stand really still for a long time

735
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,940
and then just like dart somewhere all crazy like

736
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,220
and kind of scary.

737
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,420
Oh, he did it.

738
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,220
Oh, he darted just like Unky Phil used to dart.

739
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,780
He sat very still for a long time though

740
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,940
and was very boring and a bad pet also.

741
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,980
Also not a great pet.

742
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,180
Were you buying lizards online

743
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,780
and getting them shipped to your home?

744
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,020
How is that a service that's being offered?

745
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,260
That's a good question, actually.

746
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,140
I have a solution.

747
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,940
This is good.

748
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,900
I think this could work.

749
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
What you need to do is you're gonna like,

750
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,700
whatever your surreptitious ordering is,

751
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,540
you're gonna have to order all the stuff for the lizard too.

752
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,340
You know, the terrarium, the equipment, all that stuff.

753
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,340
Then you're just gonna have to put the lizard in your room

754
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:20,980
in that terrarium.

755
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,620
Don't hide it.

756
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,900
And then your parents will at some point

757
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,420
walk by the room and go,

758
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,700
when did you get a lizard?

759
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,940
And you're going to say, what do you mean?

760
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,340
I've had that lizard forever for like years.

761
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,100
And then if your parents continue to confront you about it,

762
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,860
now you turn it on them and say,

763
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,500
do you not take any interest in my life whatsoever?

764
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,340
Has it really taken you this long

765
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,900
to figure I have a lizard and now they're guilty

766
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,260
and they'll buy you a second lizard?

767
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,420
To put on top of that one.

768
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,420
Yes, so that your lizard need not to be lonely.

769
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,220
It's gonna make a Rango joke,

770
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,580
but there's just nothing there.

771
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,300
Maybe make your parents watch Rango,

772
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,540
have them fall in love with lizards like you have.

773
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,180
How to make your parents think you found a DVD of Rango,

774
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,700
even though you bought Rango online.

775
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,300
Yeah, I just found it, it's floating in the creek.

776
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,380
Oh no, it might be a haunted Rango.

777
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,420
Don't watch that.

778
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,980
Seven days later, Rango will actually come to your house.

779
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,860
Hi, Rango.

780
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,300
I love you very much.

781
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,180
I bet the hardest kind of person to connect with

782
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,100
is a person that has just bought a lizard online

783
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,940
that has not yet arrived.

784
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,620
Cause you know there's nothing

785
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,940
they're gonna wanna talk about other than the fact

786
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,940
that they've got a lizard on the way

787
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,700
and making some plans for that lizard.

788
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,740
There will also be no getting them out of the house

789
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,980
lest they miss the delivery.

790
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,460
That's a good point.

791
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,620
That's actually a very sincere problem

792
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,700
because I don't think lizard care is high

793
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,500
on UPS standard practices.

794
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,140
Yeah, I mean the plans that you're going to be talking about

795
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,420
when waiting for your lizard delivery is,

796
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,780
I mean just one plan and it is a lizard funeral

797
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,860
because that won't survive that.

798
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,140
There's no way.

799
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,940
Unless it's being hand delivered by a guy

800
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,460
from the lizard store.

801
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,340
That's the only other way

802
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,500
cause otherwise if this thing's going through FedEx,

803
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,860
first of all, I don't want it to touch

804
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,700
all of the other packages in FedEx.

805
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,460
Sorry guys, we had to return everything to sender

806
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,900
cause it might've gotten touched by a lizard.

807
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,780
So throw it right in the garbage when it gets back.

808
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,100
Not only that, when the lizard store ships it to you,

809
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,580
they don't know what kind of wonderful twists and turns

810
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,020
the package is gonna take on its way.

811
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,580
It's just like, okay, we need to put 11 crickets in here

812
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,860
or whatever the fuck.

813
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,740
It's not a good idea.

814
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,180
Don't order lizards, folks.

815
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,300
Don't order a lizard.

816
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,140
There's plenty of farm fresh lizards

817
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,660
just waiting to be adopted.

818
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,460
Let's get the money's done.

819
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,740
And buy our own lizards.

820
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,300
Hell yes.

821
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:52,020
You know, I had two lizards growing up.

822
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,940
And for the life of me, I can't remember how I got them.

823
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,420
You did have two lizards.

824
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:56,660
Yeah.

825
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,780
Or where did they go?

826
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,180
I don't remember.

827
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,940
Well, I mean, they eventually died,

828
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,700
but I had them for like four years.

829
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,900
Of lizard-itis.

830
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,340
And I think that some kid just like gave me a shoe box

831
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
and was like, hey, do you want these lizards?

832
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,780
And I was like, yeah.

833
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,220
And as a credit to mom and dad,

834
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,780
they were like, I guess we're just a family

835
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,460
that has lizards now.

836
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,420
In fairness, they thought you'd kill them much, much quicker.

837
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,380
That is true.

838
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,380
I don't think they anticipated having to deal

839
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,780
with the idea of having lizards for quite so long.

840
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,700
So you were in middle school, right?

841
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,540
I believe so, yes.

842
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,540
So they were probably named Zanth and-

843
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,980
Maybe, actually.

844
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,580
That's quite possible, Griffin.

845
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,420
Hey guys, tell me about Trunk Club.

846
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,820
Trunk Club is a service which will,

847
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,140
you're gonna get a personal stylist, right?

848
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,020
Let me walk you through it.

849
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,820
You get a personal stylist.

850
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,460
What's their name?

851
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,940
You're gonna tell them, Durmbum.

852
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,460
And you're gonna tell them-

853
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,020
Take it again.

854
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,500
Kronzlum.

855
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,140
Take a third.

856
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,020
French Allure.

857
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,980
Take a fourth.

858
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,940
What's wrong with you?

859
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,780
Pinsky.

860
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,780
That's the best one yet.

861
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,500
Dan.

862
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,220
Pinsky Dan.

863
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,980
So you're gonna get a call from a stylist and you're gonna-

864
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,140
Hello, this is Pinsky Dan.

865
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,100
What kind of pants do you like?

866
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,060
Kronzlor, do we have slacks?

867
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:25,300
You're gonna get a call from a stylist.

868
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,140
They're gonna ask you what size everything is down there.

869
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,500
And the dick?

870
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,220
The dick?

871
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,420
Excellent, excellent.

872
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,300
Kronzlor, you'll never believe what he said about the dick.

873
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,380
What's your measurement around the town?

874
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,900
All kinds of measurements to them, both real and fictional.

875
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,500
And they're gonna send you some garments that you're going to love.

876
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,820
They're gonna ask you, what are you doing out in the town?

877
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,020
Professional, casual, fun, flirty?

878
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,820
What's your look?

879
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,060
They're gonna ask you your loin weight.

880
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,500
They're gonna send you a box of clothes and you're gonna try them on.

881
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,860
And the stuff you like, you keep.

882
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,020
The stuff you don't like, you ship right back to them in the aforementioned titular trunk.

883
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,260
And here's the thing.

884
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,660
If you live in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, DC, or Charleston,

885
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:23,220
you can just stop by one of their clubhouses and try stuff on and get pampered and feel real cool.

886
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,380
And you don't have to wait for them to ship stuff to you.

887
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,500
If you're not in there though, you can get started today at trunkclub.com slash my brother.

888
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,980
This isn't a subscription service.

889
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,460
You get clothes whenever you like them from your personal stylist.

890
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,180
And then you take five days to try everything on.

891
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,620
Returns are always free.

892
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,940
It could not be less stressful.

893
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,540
This is shopping without having to leave your home.

894
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,140
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother and give it a shot today.

895
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,300
That's trunkclub.com slash my brother.

896
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,940
I would like to tell you about Bowl and Branch.

897
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,460
Just fucking do it then.

898
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,820
It's a new way to sheet.

899
00:34:59,540 --> 00:34:59,780
Okay.

900
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,180
That's the slogan I'm going with for this.

901
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,780
We sleep on Bowl and Branch sheets and we also use Bowl and Branch bath towels.

902
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,620
And they've got like a whole other slew of stuff.

903
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,660
They got like duvet covers and blankets and that kind of thing.

904
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,780
And it's just, and no exaggeration, the most like comfortable,

905
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,740
softest sheets I've ever slept on, towels I've ever used.

906
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,660
When Teresa and I moved across the country, we had the sheets shipped to us

907
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,260
so we could use them right away.

908
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,420
And, you know, here's the thing.

909
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,460
They don't worry about thread count because thread count is a myth.

910
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,860
They just focus on having like a really great product

911
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,180
and using really wonderful materials.

912
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,660
There's no huge markup because they don't like do retail space or anything like that.

913
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,140
You get it at the right cost for the, you know, the right fit for you,

914
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,500
right price, all that stuff.

915
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,700
You can try them risk-free for 30 nights.

916
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,900
If you don't love them, send them back, get a refund, nothing to lose.

917
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,260
And for right now, right now, listeners of My Brother, My Brother and Me

918
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,620

921
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:20,660
I want to tell you about Metal Energy, that's M-E-T-T-L-E, energy.

922
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,300
I want you to visit metalenergy.com and use the coupon code MYBROTHER

923
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,940
for 25% off your entire order.

924
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,140
What is Metal Energy?

925
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,980
Well, they sell energy drink mixes that cost as little as 45 cents each

926
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,460
and they come in flavors like sour blue raspberry, green apple and tropical cooler.

927
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,180
If you drink energy drinks or shots and don't buy these,

928
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,100
then you are overpaying on the reg.

929
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,140
That's dumb.

930
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,820
Don't be a dumb idiot with a stupid face.

931
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,420
I'm sorry to come at you so aggressive like this,

932
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,300
but this is the literal ad copy, which is what you are

933
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,660
if you don't treat your energy drink habit at metalenergy.com.

934
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,020
You're going to drink these energy drinks.

935
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,420
You're going to jump higher.

936
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,700
You're going to jump more.

937
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,380
You will be jumping more often than you do now.

938
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,220
I've tried these.

939
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,460
Have you?

940
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,420
Yeah, they sent some to me too.

941
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,460
They're great.

942
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,060
They taste really good actually.

943
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,620
Where's mine?

944
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,900
I didn't get any go-go juice.

945
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,540
What the fuck?

946
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,180
You should have taken some with you when you were at the house.

947
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,500
They know that I have my own natural energy, which is cocaine.

948
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,700
This message is for Justin, Travis and Griffin.

949
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,740
It's from Isaac and Isaac asks us,

950
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,900
how's that hundo treating you?

951
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,500
I'm assuming he's talking about the money that he paid for this Jumbotron

952
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,340
and to which I will say we don't get all of that

953
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,700
and then we split it three ways.

954
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,380
So I will buy some Arby's with it later.

955
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,300
Thank you for the Arby's, Isaac.

956
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,500
I appreciate that.

957
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,260
Thank you so much, Isaac, for your consideration and for not.

958
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,460
I mean, you know, folks, I can't tell you this enough.

959
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,500
It's your hundo.

960
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:50,740
Yeah.

961
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,780
Do whatever you want with it.

962
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,420
You know what I mean?

963
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,060
This is a good way to do it.

964
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,340
Just like, I like this.

965
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,540
This is essentially just like a bank transaction.

966
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,060
Hi everybody.

967
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,500
Hi Griffin, Justin and Travis.

968
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,620
My name is Isaac.

969
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,300
I have given you a hundred dollars.

970
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,340
This is, that is all.

971
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,700
Well, I like this because it's also, it's both generosity

972
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,140
and just a little susan of throwing it in our face.

973
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,100
Yeah.

974
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,620
Like here, take my money.

975
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,660
How's that treat you?

976
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,500
It treats me good.

977
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,300
Thank you, Isaac.

978
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,260
Thank you for your money.

979
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,420
I'm Jesse Thorne and I'm curious about Jonathan Van Ness

980
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,020
and his show, Getting Curious.

981
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,420
What were you most excited to learn something about?

982
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,660
I was really excited about the Romanoffs.

983
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,700
I was really excited.

984
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,980
Why were you so excited about the Romanoffs?

985
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
Well, because I've been obsessed with things listening to the episode.

986
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,620
I'm just kidding.

987
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,420
I'm just kidding.

988
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,140
Because I've been obsessed with them since I was 11

989
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,340
from the movie Anastasia.

990
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,260
Jonathan, what's a baby brain?

991
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,980
It's a brain that's finally ready to explore.

992
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,100
Getting Curious, a show for your baby brain.

993
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,700
Download it wherever you get podcasts.

994
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,740
I have another question.

995
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,300
Sorry, some prankster is leaf blowing right outside my house

996
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,780
and it's like pretty good prank.

997
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,580
What a jokester.

998
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,420
Let me look.

999
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,540
It's Jamie Kennedy.

1000
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,140
Oh man.

1001
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,500
Blowing my yard.

1002
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,580
So Trap, how do you think the episode is going so far?

1003
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,180
You know, so far, so good, Justin.

1004
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,540
I want a munch.

1005
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,380
Squad, sorry.

1006
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,700
Jamie Kennedy is just-

1007
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,780
No, I'm not gonna do it when you set me up to be interrupted.

1008
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,140
You don't get my squad.

1009
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,220
Okay, well, Griffin, how you think the show is going so far?

1010
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:22,980
Fuck you.

1011
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,420
I want a munch.

1012
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:24,980
Squad.

1013
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,540
I want too much.

1014
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,020
Squad.

1015
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:36,820
Squad, Jack in the Box is making its first appearance here

1016
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,860
on the Munch Squad.

1017
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,740
That's amazing because they sell like tacos and spaghetti

1018
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,540
in the same box.

1019
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,580
Well, things are about to get even more confusing

1020
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,740
because today we're not the Munch Squad.

1021
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,940
We're not just the Munch Squad.

1022
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,220
We're still the Munch Squad.

1023
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,740
We're also the Brunch Squad.

1024
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,620
Oh God.

1025
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,500
Because Jack in the Box is launching a new level of

1026
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,380
craveability with Brunch Fest.

1027
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,420
Okay.

1028
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,620
Now I know what you're saying.

1029
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,580
No, fuck off.

1030
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,300
You can't just-

1031
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,580
It's Brunchner.

1032
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,020
It's all the meals and you just get it shot into your face.

1033
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,900
It ain't that far off.

1034
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,020
Oh God.

1035
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,780
But Jack in the Box has always served breakfast all day.

1036
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,980
Not only that, fucking brunch already is the words.

1037
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,100
Breakfast and lunch.

1038
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,860
You don't need to get a fucking reprise there at the end

1039
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,780
coming at you with the epilogue.

1040
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,620
Okay, 1969 is the year.

1041
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,940
A man named Jack introduces the very first breakfast sandwich.

1042
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,900
And in 2013, they introduced Jack's Munchie Meals,

1043
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,780
which is something else at late times.

1044
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,980
I'm sorry, are you reading?

1045
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,380
Are you, this is the worst press release I've ever heard.

1046
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,180
Are you making this up?

1047
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,420
Brunch Fest, Mary, what is Brunch Fest?

1048
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,940
I know you're confused.

1049
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,660
This is a first in the industry, according to the press release.

1050
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,180
A first in the industry.

1051
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,740
Brunch Fest, Mary, is the unique flavors of brunch

1052
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,980
with the convenience and anytime availability

1053
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,180
that guests can always expect from Jack in the Box.

1054
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,620
What?

1055
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,780
Then why, I am fucking furious right now.

1056
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,340
Jack's Brunch Fest menu features items

1057
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,740
that make brunch an everyday occasion.

1058
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,380
What?

1059
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,740
Guests can choose from three entrees,

1060
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,340
including the bacon, egg and chicken sandwich.

1061
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,300
What you got there is a toasted English muffin

1062
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,740
with crispy chicken filet.

1063
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,620
And then it's got bacon and cheese and bacon mayo

1064
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,940
and a freshly cracked fried egg.

1065
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,260
Hey, freshly cracked is a crazy way

1066
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,700
of just making a fried egg sound delicious, excuse me.

1067
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,180
Yeah, freshly cracked.

1068
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,100
Mm, good, very good.

1069
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,740
Good, I guess.

1070
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,900
What's the alternative, sorry?

1071
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,620
Yeah, we squeezed these down about a week ago.

1072
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,540
Freshly unzipped from an individual Ziploc bag.

1073
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,020
The brunch burger is a buttery croissant

1074
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,860
topped with a juicy beef patty

1075
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,420
and a freshly cracked fried egg.

1076
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,380
Yeah, okay.

1077
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,460
So you guys put egg on shit.

1078
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,220
I have, go ahead and read the third option

1079
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,900
and then I'm gonna yell and yell and yell

1080
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,860
until I fall asleep.

1081
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,220
Well, you got a Southwest scrambler plate.

1082
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,700
That's scrambled eggs with roasted peppers,

1083
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,500
diced green chilies, pepper jack cheese

1084
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,140
and then served with homestyle potatoes.

1085
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,380
Okay.

1086
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,180
Hickory smoked bacon or sausage

1087
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,620
and a buttery croissant.

1088
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,780
I have excellent news for Jack in the Box.

1089
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,380
I'm giving you a one out of three.

1090
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,460
You barely skated by without getting a zero

1091
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,300
because that is brunch, what you've just described.

1092
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,540
It has breakfast and lunch elements in it.

1093
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,460
When you put an egg on a burger,

1094
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,860
it doesn't make it a breakfast time.

1095
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,100
It shouldn't even be around breakfast time.

1096
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,780
It's a fucking burger.

1097
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,060
And it's certainly not deserving of having the word breakfast

1098
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,660
in the name of the meal twice.

1099
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,940
At the very least, what you've made is Le Brunch Unch

1100
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,540
which is double lunch in the word, you big dumb animal.

1101
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,500
That's fair because I don't know, maybe there exists

1102
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,740
but brunch is like a thing now

1103
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,140
with like a defined set of parameters.

1104
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,620
It's not just putting an egg on something.

1105
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,340
Like you can't be like, I made a catfish

1106
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,220
and I put a freshly cracked egg on it.

1107
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,020
It's brunch now.

1108
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,140
You can't pour gravy on Captain Crunch

1109
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,660
and say, look, I did a brunch.

1110
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,260
You didn't really do a brunch.

1111
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,740
What you did was a crime sin.

1112
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,420
But what does it matter to us?

1113
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,740
We are not industry professionals

1114
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,020
like Iwona Alter, Jack of the Box's vice president

1115
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,500
of product marketing who says, and I quote,

1116
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,380
brunch enthusiasts no longer have to wait

1117
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,340
until the weekend to satisfy their brunch cravings.

1118
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,260
Thank God.

1119
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,580
With Brunchfest, we're giving our guests 24 seven access

1120
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,540
to the distinct craveable flavors of brunch

1121
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,500
whenever they want it and wherever the hunger strikes.

1122
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,940
Hey, you motherfuckers.

1123
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,260
If you eat brunch at any time other than brunch time,

1124
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,300
it's breakfast or lunch.

1125
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,500
It's one of the other meals.

1126
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,940
You can't have brunch at 7 p.m.

1127
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,300
Who are these people that are living such lives

1128
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,500
of desperation where they say to themselves,

1129
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,260
I would fucking kill for brunch food right now

1130
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,180
but I don't know how to obtain it.

1131
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,260
I need someone to deliver that to me

1132
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,380
because I don't know how to get that experience at home.

1133
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,180
I need someone to save me.

1134
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,980
Justin, take it one step further.

1135
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,460
They're then so desperate that they're just glad

1136
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,260
there's an option like Jack of the Box

1137
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
to fulfill their brunch craving.

1138
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,420
That's, they just need it so bad.

1139
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,820
Justin just sent a photo and I don't want to know.

1140
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,500
I'm afraid.

1141
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,140
You should look at it

1142
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,740
because it's insane.

1143
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:50,580
It looks like somebody stacked a meal on top of another meal.

1144
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,020
It's like, yeah, the first time you hear the word brunch

1145
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,740
when you are a child and your brain can't understand

1146
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,100
how like ideas can compound into a bigger single idea

1147
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,940
and you think like, yeah, we're gonna have brunch.

1148
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,580
What does that mean?

1149
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,260
You're gonna put like cereal on a burger?

1150
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,020
It's like, no, no, you dumb idiot.

1151
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,620
It's a whole different thing.

1152
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,900
Jack of the Box has realized that childlike vision

1153
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,700
of two meals that have combined in the worst possible way.

1154
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,620
It's like if you were about to sit down

1155
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,140
and enjoy a normal human breakfast

1156
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,500
and then an all powerful toddler came into the room and said,

1157
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,340
I wanna put my lunch in it.

1158
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:26,660
Yes.

1159
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,700
Like just, I wanna store my lunch in your breakfast.

1160
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,580
And the thing about-

1161
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,740
What these sandwiches look like to me

1162
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,700
is like you wanted to make a sausage egg and cheese

1163
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,180
and bacon sandwich, but you ran out of sausage.

1164
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,900
So you just like grabbed a frozen hamburger patty

1165
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,140
and you were like, now I'm a great chef

1166
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,660
and I've invented a new food.

1167
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,180
This is food that a very drunk person makes at 1 a.m.

1168
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,180
If anything, it's dinner fist, a combination of dinner

1169
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,260
and then wrapping all the way around a breakfast.

1170
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,900
This is fourth meal, which is already another thing.

1171
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,420
No, this is fifth meal, Griffin.

1172
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,460
This is fifth meal?

1173
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,460
This is something you have at four o'clock in the morning

1174
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,340
and you don't remember you had and you eat breakfast again.

1175
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,620
This is last meal.

1176
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,580
Like let's be honest.

1177
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,540
This is not, this is not, this is not the action

1178
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,020
of a person who continues their existence.

1179
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,740
This is not a meal you eat on purpose.

1180
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,820
Brunch, there is no such thing as brunch food, right?

1181
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,180
There are things that you eat at brunch

1182
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,380
but you could also just eat that stuff at lunch or breakfast.

1183
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,820
The reason brunch exists is because people like to have mimosas

1184
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,660
and they like to have a good excuse for it.

1185
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,780
If you are eating, you shouldn't eat brunch on a weekday.

1186
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,820
You shouldn't.

1187
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,780
I don't think you should be eating lunch on a brunch on a weekday.

1188
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,060
It doesn't make sense.

1189
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,860
You should be doing something else at 11 a.m.

1190
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,820
Brunch is a way of telling your body like,

1191
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,740
listen, you need a little extra sleep.

1192
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,220
Here, here, big fellow, let me put you back down.

1193
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,060
Here, let me fill you up with food

1194
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,900
and now I'm gonna put some mimosas in you.

1195
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,900
Oh, look in that warm sun, isn't that nice?

1196
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,420
Oh, that hammock looks inviting.

1197
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,300
Boom, you're out.

1198
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,500
See you on Monday.

1199
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,180
These are not the actions.

1200
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,940
That's not a midday break.

1201
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,300
You can't recover from brunch and go back to work.

1202
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,940
I spent so much time looking at this picture you sent,

1203
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,380
looking at the bad food on it

1204
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,340
and I just looked at the top part of it

1205
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,500
where it has the word brunch fist written out

1206
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,580
and I'm just fucking angry again

1207
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,540
because who the fuck do you think you are?

1208
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,780
It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

1209
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,220
But it's craveable and it's 24.

1210
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,140
No, it's not even a little bit craveable.

1211
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,060
It's highly craveable.

1212
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,500
They wouldn't lie, they can't lie about it.

1213
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,180
I'm gonna, there's a jag in the box around the corner.

1214
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,980
It is sadly the like nearest fast food place to me.

1215
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,940
Sometimes when I'm desperate,

1216
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,620
I'll go there and get one of their fajita wraps

1217
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,340
or whatever, it's okay.

1218
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,820
I wanna go and I wanna buy these

1219
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,500
and then I wanna take the cashier with me

1220
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,540
who hands me the things

1221
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,060
and go with them into the bathroom

1222
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,300
and make him watch me put it in the toilet.

1223
00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:00,980
I'm a little, I mean, maybe I'm just feel differently

1224
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,140
about this because I don't have a jack in the box

1225
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,180
anywhere near me.

1226
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,060
So maybe it like exotic fruits.

1227
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,300
Yeah, I can't, I'd have to go to Cincinnati,

1228
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,180
I think to get into one.

1229
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,100
I have a Yahoo here, can I read it?

1230
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,660
Yeah, please.

1231
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,300
It was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Roseng.

1232
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,860
Thank you, Rachel.

1233
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,220
It's by Yahoo answers user.

1234
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,380
It's just guys, the name is just smoke weed.

1235
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:23,880
Cool.

1236
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,940
They say, can't get into TV series slash movies

1237
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,620
because I know they are just acting.

1238
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,980
Anytime I watch an interesting TV series,

1239
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,980
I may get into it for about a couple of minutes

1240
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,860
before the thought of them just memorizing some script

1241
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,020
and standing in front of a camera pops into my head,

1242
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,860
especially during those scenes

1243
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,260
where a character is not supposed to know

1244
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,020
the other characters stole something of theirs

1245
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,900
or something like that.

1246
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,500
And they act like they don't know.

1247
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,820
But since they are acting, they really do.

1248
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,820
Is anyone else like this?

1249
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,340
Is there any way to avoid this?

1250
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,500
Well, now I am.

1251
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,260
Damn it, you've poisoned the well.

1252
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,140
Everybody was talking like,

1253
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,980
oh, you gotta watch Westworld, Westworld's so tight.

1254
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,620
You gotta watch it.

1255
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,740
And I was like, I turned it on

1256
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,340
and I watched it and for a few minutes,

1257
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,620
I was like, okay, okay, okay.

1258
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,980
But then after a while, I was just like,

1259
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,220
that's just Anthony Hopkins.

1260
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,060
That's just Anthony Hopkins.

1261
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,740
Nice try.

1262
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,940
And somebody's like, the robots are getting all shitty

1263
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:20,500
out there.

1264
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,780
And he was like, oh, no, I can't believe it.

1265
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,420
And it's like, you did know it, Anthony.

1266
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,740
You read the script for this, I bet.

1267
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,060
Not only that, it's one step further for me, Gervan,

1268
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,100
because I look and I see it,

1269
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,460
it's Anthony Hopkins acting on the screen.

1270
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,540
But then I think, you know, like 10 feet

1271
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,900
right in front of Anthony Hopkins,

1272
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,100
just behind the camera,

1273
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,540
there's some dude like eating a bagel at craft services.

1274
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,460
They're not in Westworld at all.

1275
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,340
No, they're not.

1276
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,100
They're just in some building

1277
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,220
where they make TV shows.

1278
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,100
And like, upstairs from that,

1279
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
there's a guy taking a 10-2,

1280
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
and he had a bagel sandwich earlier.

1281
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,700
And then like down the hall from that,

1282
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,900
there's just like a woman,

1283
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,700
like just doing the accounting for the show.

1284
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,020
Yeah.

1285
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,500
I wish I was a director in Westworld,

1286
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,940
because I would love to like,

1287
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,180
yell cut after Anthony Hopkins finishes acting.

1288
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,820
It just would be like, mm, good acting.

1289
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,940
Like just really tell him like,

1290
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,500
man, you acted so good in that one.

1291
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,660
I thought you were that person for like a second.

1292
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,100
Well, yes, thank you.

1293
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,700
But then I didn't, of course,

1294
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,140
because you're Anthony Hopkins,

1295
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,980
and you're just reading.

1296
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,900
But like, sorry, Anthony,

1297
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,180
that was pretty good acting.

1298
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,420
I'm just gonna go ahead and lay it out there.

1299
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,140
Thank you for doing that so good on my TV show.

1300
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,380
This is now an all-encompassing thing for me.

1301
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,780
I watched the new Mission Impossible,

1302
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,580
and I watch it,

1303
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,540
and I'm not enthrilled by like a story of spy work and intrigue.

1304
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,740
I'm just thinking like,

1305
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,100
this seems dangerous for Tom.

1306
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,100
I don't want Tom to be doing this.

1307
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,860
I want to see him in the cocktails too.

1308
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,260
I don't want him to be in-

1309
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,300
That's actually a fair point,

1310
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,660
because Tom does a lot of his own stuff.

1311
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,860
Tom does most of his own stuff,

1312
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,060
and it's like, no, no, no, I don't.

1313
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,820
I can't even watch a Jackie Chan movie anymore,

1314
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,620
because it's like, I'm cool cop, cool too,

1315
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,900
and I have a magic tuxedo.

1316
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,100
It's like, you're not, you're Jackie Chan,

1317
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,460
and please, you're like 60, don't.

1318
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,660
Please don't hurt, you're so brittle.

1319
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,540
Don't.

1320
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,460
You know, I watched the new Star Trek movie,

1321
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,500
and I just thought the whole time,

1322
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,780
they're not even in space.

1323
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,540
This isn't real.

1324
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,700
They don't have laser guns,

1325
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,780
and I screamed that the whole time.

1326
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,060
I was asked to leave.

1327
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,020
That's why you're gonna,

1328
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,740
you're all really gonna like the My Brother, My Brother Me show,

1329
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,380
because everything that happened on it, happened.

1330
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:25,780
Yeah.

1331
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,820
It all happened.

1332
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,340
It's all real.

1333
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,260
It's realer than like any reality TV show that's ever been,

1334
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,220
because I was there for all of it, and it all happened.

1335
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,780
Yeah, no movie magic.

1336
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,340
Guys, I'm on Yahoo.

1337
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,260
Different ad.

1338
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,580
McCarthy's gone.

1339
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,740
The real reason Mike and Molly was canceled,

1340
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,260
and then a picture of Mike and Molly.

1341
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,140
What the fuck's, click through.

1342
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,980
It's E Online again, same thing.

1343
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,620
What the fuck are you guys, what's your ad campaign

1344
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,180
about the death of Melissa McCarthy?

1345
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,700
Because it sucks.

1346
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,300
It is a different, discreet, dead Melissa McCarthy ad.

1347
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,580
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1348
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,300
Why does E Online hate Melissa McCarthy so much?

1349
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,580
And why is Yahoo like, another good ad, bring them on in.

1350
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,740
Melissa McCarthy's mom is on Yahoo.

1351
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,260
How do you think that feels for her?

1352
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,700
She's just trying to figure out like,

1353
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,940
how to get a frog out of her butt,

1354
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,420
or whatever people on Yahoo answers are doing.

1355
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,820
And then she sees that her daughter died?

1356
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,060
Yeah.

1357
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,820
Griffin, what kind of things have you been searching?

1358
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,860
What kind of cookies do you have that like algorithms are like-

1359
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,020
Just like the usual stuff.

1360
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,820
Like the cast of Mike and Molly, comma, but dead.

1361
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,180
Oh, that was, what the fuck, dog?

1362
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,380
I bet if you buy a lizard on Amazon,

1363
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,220
your cookies are irredeemable.

1364
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,380
You're not gonna know what to do with those cookies.

1365
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:49,860
Yeah, for sure.

1366
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,620
I can't watch Mike and Molly,

1367
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,140
because it's like, these two people are in love.

1368
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,900
But I can't, because they aren't.

1369
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:06,180
Because it's Melissa McCarthy and whoever Mike is.

1370
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,540
And they're not, I know they're not.

1371
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,380
What I like to do,

1372
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,220
is I like to suspend my disbelief so very hard,

1373
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,220
that then I start to worry that the show

1374
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,740
will come to a crashing halt,

1375
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,860
when they realize someone has planted a camera in their kitchen,

1376
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,100
to watch them like have hilarious banter.

1377
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,500
Oh shit.

1378
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,820
And they'll see the camera and become horrified,

1379
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,460
like someone's been watching us the whole time, Debra.

1380
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,260
Oh my god.

1381
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,500
And it would go, like it would get so terrifyingly real.

1382
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,580
What if in the last season of Mike and Molly,

1383
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,660
they realized it was a TV show,

1384
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,500
and that their lives were a TV show,

1385
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,220
and the whole last season is just about them,

1386
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,620
like truman showing the whole thing out.

1387
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,300
God, that's fucking good, please.

1388
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,780
I've never wanted to watch Mike and Molly,

1389
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:50,100
even with 1% of my being.

1390
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,820
Melissa McCarthy has the juice to get that done.

1391
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,140
She has got like, I'll come back for one more,

1392
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,980
but strap in, because it's getting weird.

1393
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,140
It's gonna get fucking Roseanne weird in here.

1394
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,380
We're gonna Roseanne the shit out of this, you guys.

1395
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,820
Let me ask you guys a question.

1396
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:14,740
Do you think there's ever been a TV show or movies that was real?

1397
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,940
Do you mean like it was...

1398
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,860
I mean, I get that it's all like,

1399
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,060
that's Anthony Hopkins up there,

1400
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:32,820
and he's reading words that the HBO writer gave him to say,

1401
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,860
and he says them really, really cool,

1402
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,860
and he says them like, sometimes he says them really sad,

1403
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,660
he is having the feelings that the words,

1404
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,580
the person who in the story would be saying the words,

1405
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,340
but it's Anthony Hopkins just reading the words

1406
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,700
in a specific way, right?

1407
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,220
I'm not fooled by Westworld,

1408
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:54,260
but maybe one of the shows is a real show, or a movie.

1409
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,260
If there was one show, Griffin, that you thought,

1410
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,180
what's the most likely suspect?

1411
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,940
I mean, probably one where it's a thing that really does it,

1412
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,380
like Law and Order.

1413
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,940
There really are cops and judges and stuff out there,

1414
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,300
but I don't know.

1415
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,820
What about Seinfeld?

1416
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,460
Seinfeld, I think, was probably...

1417
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,180
Well, again, it's hard to say,

1418
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,060
because a lot of that was...

1419
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,820
I would say I was down with that,

1420
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,180
but then there would be the segments of Seinfeld

1421
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,380
where he was doing stand-up comedy,

1422
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,300
and it's like, but he really does do that.

1423
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,340
That one gets too confusing.

1424
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,940
I can't even start to unpack that.

1425
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,100
Here's what I'd like to pause it.

1426
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,260
I think the NCIS New Orleans,

1427
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,900
starring Scott Bakula, is probably real,

1428
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,300
because let me lay it out for you.

1429
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,340
You're Scott Bakula.

1430
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,580
You're a true professional, right?

1431
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,820
You won't be on our podcast or on our TV show,

1432
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,780
but you're a professional.

1433
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,940
That only proves you're a true professional.

1434
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,220
See above, true professional.

1435
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,460
And you wanna learn about cop work, right?

1436
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,940
So you're like, well, I better learn what a NCIS does

1437
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:50,900
or what that's about.

1438
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,820
I think it's something with crime

1439
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,020
or the military.

1440
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,220
New cops in the city.

1441
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,860
New cops in the city with an S.

1442
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,980
And so you're gonna learn all that cop shit, right?

1443
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,460
Yeah.

1444
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,380
You would probably occur to you that like,

1445
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,180
if we're gonna be doing cop things already,

1446
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,060
chasing perps, tracking down clues,

1447
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,420
hunting up the leads,

1448
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,820
if we're gonna be doing all this cop shit already, right?

1449
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,820
Let's do it to real crime.

1450
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,140
Yeah.

1451
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,420
Let's just do it.

1452
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,860
You're filming it already,

1453
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,700
and I already am gonna learn how to do it,

1454
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,620
cause I'm a consummate professional.

1455
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,020
Like let's just do the crime and bust them.

1456
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,540
Let's bust the perps.

1457
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,820
I don't see why not.

1458
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,700
I don't see why not.

1459
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,740
There's too much crime in this city.

1460
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,420
Let's just start busting it a little bit.

1461
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,580
That's just like on cops.

1462
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,180
I'm sure the inverse happened where they're like,

1463
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,380
this is supposed to be real.

1464
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,900
There are no crimes tonight.

1465
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,300
Can we all pretend to do a crime, please?

1466
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,740
Hey, can you call your cousin?

1467
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,700
They would just make a PA get like really drunk

1468
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,100
and take their pants off and walk down the street

1469
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,540
and then film them arresting him.

1470
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,900
I have a theory for a show that is real

1471
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,700
and I'm still formulating the logistics of it.

1472
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,460
Sounds like it's still percolating.

1473
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,740
It's still percolating,

1474
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,980
cause you can tell when I take pauses

1475
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,580
in my sentences like this,

1476
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,500
that's where I think my little thoughts

1477
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,780
to get it together.

1478
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,660
But I think the TV show that I know now,

1479
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,420
cause I finished the thought is real,

1480
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,020
is Dinosaurs.

1481
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,520
Okay.

1482
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,020
Okay.

1483
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,360
Cause here's a list of reasons.

1484
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,280
First of all, as far as I know,

1485
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,160
there's no actors.

1486
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,840
Only dinosaurs.

1487
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,320
Sure, found footage.

1488
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,720
The things that happened in Dinosaurs,

1489
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,880
we weren't there, right?

1490
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,040
Like people weren't there.

1491
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,120
So it could have been happening.

1492
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,920
And then at the end of the show,

1493
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,680
the ice age happens and that is,

1494
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,600
sorry guys, but read a history book.

1495
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,320
That's how it happened.

1496
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,080
They deleted it,

1497
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,640
but every episode on the original broadcast,

1498
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,280
if you remember,

1499
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,360
everyone used to begin

1500
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,600
with a very official looking scientist

1501
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,320
who said I have been setting dinosaur fossils

1502
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,080
for my entire life.

1503
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,520
And as near as I can tell,

1504
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,360
this is how it went.

1505
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,360
As near as I can put together from fossils,

1506
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,840
it will look something like this.

1507
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,600
Hi, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.

1508
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:14,920
No, see-

1509
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,920
I've put together all the information

1510
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,440
I could about Dinosaurs.

1511
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,480
Please do enjoy.

1512
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,160
If there was a character on Dinosaurs

1513
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,240
who is just like a caveman

1514
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,600
played by Greg Kinnear,

1515
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,320
I would see that and be like,

1516
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,840
well, this is bullshit.

1517
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,120
This is bullshit.

1518
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,320
That's just Greg Kinnear.

1519
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,440
And he's got a beard on,

1520
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,760
but he's just reading what they told him to say.

1521
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,600
Dinosaurs didn't have that.

1522
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,920
It was all just Dinosaurs without actors.

1523
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,640
So like without that,

1524
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,160
who knows?

1525
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,240
That's all I'm saying.

1526
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,040
Do you want to know a true- this is a shocking but true fact.

1527
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,680
Okay.

1528
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,520
Family Matters is, of course, not real.

1529
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,000
It's the many actors performing.

1530
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,040
No, that's Reginald Val Johnson.

1531
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,400
He was in the Die Hard movie.

1532
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:53,960
Exactly.

1533
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,240
But Griffin, did you know

1534
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,280
that what it is is a shot for shot remake

1535
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,800
of the Winslow family home videos.

1536
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,680
So while it's not the real footage,

1537
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,080
they just made a TV show based off of it,

1538
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,520
but it is shot for shot,

1539
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,040
line for line, exactly the same.

1540
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,560
Of the Winslow family.

1541
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,600
Yeah, but they just had actors portray the Winslow family.

1542
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,960
I just went to IMDb to search for dinosaurs

1543
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,320
to find the names of the dinosaurs

1544
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,000
that played them in Our Real Dinosaurs.

1545
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,120
And the lead story on IMDb is

1546
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,320
the Stranger Things cast in and out of costume.

1547
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,720
Hey, IMDb, that's disgusting.

1548
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,960
These are children.

1549
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,760
Let's wrap up.

1550
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,320
What do you think?

1551
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,520
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

1552
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,240
I really wanted to take some more time

1553
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,800
exploring Travis's theory that Family Matters

1554
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,280
is based on the home videos of a real family

1555
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,520
living in Chicago named the Winslows.

1556
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,760
We'll let the message words fill all that in, Griffin.

1557
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,800
Excuse me.

1558
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,720
Did you realize that the mom on Dinosaurs

1559
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,640
was played by Jessica Walter

1560
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,000
of fucking Arrested Development and Archer fame?

1561
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,760
You just fucking ruined it for me then

1562
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,480
because she's not, wait, and what do you mean?

1563
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,800
And what do you mean she played the dinosaur?

1564
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,760
What I'm saying is that

1565
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,480
she's been a dinosaur this whole time.

1566
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,640
I don't, that's mean, I think, to say

1567
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,920
about she's absolutely perfect and wonderful.

1568
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,200
I don't think it's cool to say she's-

1569
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,880
She's been a human looking dinosaur

1570
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,960
I think that's actually kind of a busted thing to say.

1571
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,280
Maybe don't, maybe we shouldn't espouse that.

1572
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:27,820
What?

1573
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,360
Okay, so where did they go?

1574
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,200
That's a good question.

1575
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,480
Hmm, huh, guess I turned it around on you.

1576
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,960
Where did dinosaurs go?

1577
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,400
No, Justin, that's a great point.

1578
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,640
Where did the dinosaurs from Dinosaurs go?

1579
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,840
Where'd they go?

1580
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,560
Why aren't they doing more stuff?

1581
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,400
I saw Jurassic World and there's that one scene

1582
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,160
and you can just barely see fat dad dinosaur in the background

1583
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,360
and he's got his little briefcase.

1584
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:56,920
I love it.

1585
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,100
Flannel?

1586
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,840
Flannel dad, yeah.

1587
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,640
Yeah, I bet those dinosaurs every day

1588
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,480
like just cross their talons and hope

1589
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,200
for like a new Flintstones live action movie.

1590
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,600
I did see on BuzzFeed you won't believe

1591
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,480
what the baby from Dinosaurs looks like today

1592
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,960
and he had like the goatee and what all.

1593
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,720
Yeah, I remember that.

1594
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,440
The real shame was when Spikey had done dinosaur

1595
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,280
when he robbed that liquor store and he went to dino jail.

1596
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,520
Yeah, where I guess he is-

1597
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,000
He's out now, he's totally clean.

1598
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,160
Good.

1599
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,280
It's worth noting that that's what Travis calls museums.

1600
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,880
This has been our show, my brother and me.

1601
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,800
We hope you've enjoyed yourself and had a great time.

1602
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,680
This has been an hour of us pretending,

1603
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,320
just doing make believe television talk

1604
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,480
for literally 62 minutes.

1605
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,040
Hey, I've got a fun thing for you tomorrow.

1606
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,120
So if you are a owner of the PlayStation 4 console,

1607
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,280
we're in a video game.

1608
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,720
There's a game coming out on PSN tomorrow

1609
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,160
called 100 Foot Robot Golf.

1610
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,480
It is not just a VR game,

1611
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,000
although you can play with PlayStation VR

1612
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,360
is also a regular ass PS4 game.

1613
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,200
And it's a golf game with giant robots

1614
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,000
and we're the commentators in the game.

1615
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,840
So if you wanna play golf,

1616
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:27,320
but you wanna have us saying somewhat related things

1617
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,000
to the golf action on the screen-

1618
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,480
Sometimes.

1619
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,360
Then that would be the one that you should get.

1620
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,880
Not any others, that's the one.

1621
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,040
It's also really, really fun.

1622
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,360
I got to play a little demo version of it.

1623
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,280
Super fun, along with golf,

1624
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,680
your robot just like destroys a bunch of shit

1625
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,880
and has special moves and it's ridiculously fun.

1626
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,760
I love it very much.

1627
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,760
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1628
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,560
for the use of our theme song.

1629
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,800
Is it a partial off the album, Putting the Days to Bed?

1630
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,600
It's a really, really great song and a really good album.

1631
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,800
I've been putting together a Spotify playlist

1632
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,200
of like all the tunes I was bumping in college.

1633
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,120
I was feeling nostalgic for it.

1634
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,720
And just like, it's basically I just added

1635
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,040
three Long Winters albums to a Spotify playlist

1636
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,000
and that's about it.

1637
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,880
It's a really good band.

1638
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,120
I hope everybody's tried listening to it already.

1639
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,320

Thank you, Christine.

1656
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Cone who asks,

1657
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,160
can you please just admit

1658
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,160
that George Washington didn't exist?

1659
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,480
My name is Justin McElroy.

1660
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,600
I'm Travis McElroy.

1661
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1662
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,080
My brother, my brother, me.

1663
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:17,880
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1664
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,360
And woke.

1665
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,880
Or maybe you find yourself

1666
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,960
constantly explaining terms like these

1667
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,160
and you need a place to vent.

1668
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,760
Do you have a love for all things pop culture,

1669
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,000
social commentary, and politics?

1670
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,120
Sounds like you need Minority Corner.

1671
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,280
Where you can learn, laugh, and play.

1672
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,560
Sounds like blues clues.

1673
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,920
Only it's more black, gay, and ladylike.

1674
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,920
James and Anika will happily administer

1675
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,600

1678
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,520
Minority Corner.

1679
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,320
With a K.

1680
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:33,240
Cause the C was taken.
