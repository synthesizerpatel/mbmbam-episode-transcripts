1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,160
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,020

You're not gonna do that every time now I tried that I did not feel

12
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,380
That was real bad, but I'll figure it out I'll find it

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,500

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Have very exciting news

20
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,940
Alright, and I was inspired by of course our year theme 20 rendezvous fantasy tape flight

21
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,020
Yeah, and so I I already had this and

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,620
So I pulled a few strings and I got it for you guys as well as you know

23
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,340
I'm very well connected. I'm sending it to you right now. Oh

24
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,220
Oh cool. I'm emailing it to you right now. Is it a cameo from the from the president?

25
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,220
No, no, no. No, do you know Joe Biden's up there Joe Biden's in there? It's like $75. It's he's not busy with

26
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,160
What a steal? He's got a lot of stuff going on right now that you get a part. Could you get a part in that way?

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Oh, I like you trick him

28
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,420
Or or some kind of appointment that way like

29
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Oh

30
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,360
Travis what have you done? We just got this email bud. Yeah. Well, do you want to tell everybody?

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,420
I'm it's it seems to me that Travis has purchased us some some land

32
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Why some land travel I said one square foot each. Yeah, your Lord's now. Oh

33
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,580
Really? Yeah. Yeah, I was already one. Oh

34
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,900
Oh

35
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,020
Congratulations, and then I saw that this this place was offering a buy one get one free sale

36
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,540
This is this is how everyone does it I'm pretty sure this is how everyone does it

37
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,060
And so I went ahead and took advantage of that great deal now

38
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,340
I will say they were offering three different levels one square foot five square feet and ten square feet

39
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,820
Well, I didn't know what you guys would do with five square feet that you wouldn't do with one square, right?

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,300
Yeah, that's a good make you five times the lower like does it up? Are you a duke at that point?

41
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,180
I have I they didn't seem to compound in any way

42
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,220
It seemed to just be like you could like have room for a picnic. Oh, yeah, get married, right? You can get married

43
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,220
You lop off

44
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:27,220
This is this is a classic pub challenge you lie diagonally in the box right and then you fit you got a light

45
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,980
I ain't wait a minute. This is a sucker's bet burn me bury me in the one bow. There you go

46
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,460
Chop me up. It's square feet right so you can dig of like what I'm five ten

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,260
We'll give them a few inches in case there's some like topsoil loss degradation

48
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,220
Oh, that's it six foot two and the top of my head will be four inches under the surface

49
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,220
If you just stand me right up in there

50
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,300
Maybe we could say like can you arrange it?

51
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,080
So are each of our one square plots of land are next to each other now

52
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,580
We got three in a row right so three feet long one foot wide

53
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,200
Right stack us up guys. This is how has nobody thought of this yet?

54
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,580
Cemetery space is at like a premium now and it's because they're laying our dead asses horizontal

55
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,300
That's dumb. That is such a waste of space straight up and down baby straight up and down stack

56
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:31,500
Me like like Ikea furniture. This is insane. You know what I mean. Yeah, global global warming and everything stack me up

57
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,700
Go boy, you know what as far as I'm concerned use me as a fuel source. I don't care dead

58
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,200
All right, get to real Travis. Thank you for this gift

59
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,100
Yeah, it does feel a bit like the International Star Registry thing now

60
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,460
This is legit Griffin because I paid money for it and they ran as you can see in the form

61
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,980
It was witnessed by someone. Yeah, and it is really my it is written in sort of a fancy

62
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Kurt like pseudo cursive

63
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
Foul digital cursive. Yeah

64
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,460
Hey, but do I have too much power now because I I do have a star named after me. Thanks noni big up

65
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,380
You're the Star Lord now. Oh

66
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,060
shit, yeah

67
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,540
That's dope. Yeah, that's very cool. I get to kick it with like so what do I do?

68
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,500
Oh, yeah, good question. I have to go it might gonna have to solve a cozy murder

69
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,540
Here's what I'll say Justin if anyone ever accidentally wanders through your one square foot

70
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,140
Then you then are responsible for their well-being, but they're also responsible for like your happiness now

71
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,460
Here's what I'll say. This is the trick that nobody tells you but I know this hack

72
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,660
They don't know I know this hack once you buy the plot of land, right?

73
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,900
That's one square foot around but it goes all the way into space baby, right?

74
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,740
Oh, that's all the way up. It never stops above it, right?

75
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,980
So a plane going through it spaceship going through it a comet going through it

76
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,820
It's all yours for for the second. It's in there. Yeah, that's so you're welcome guys

77
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,760
Hey, Rachel edit this next part out, but or beep it Travis. How much money did you spend on these?

78
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,120
bucks

79
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,180
Okay, and it was buy one get one free. Like I said, it's a good deal. That's very good deal

80
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,140
Okay, the number you ever said was not a tremendous amount of money. Not at all that beeped out

81
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,380
Okay. Now here's my question. This is something I I debated over in my own heart

82
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,980
Does it seem more like a scam if it had cost more or more legit if it costs more? Wow

83
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,100
Because at the amount I paid there's partners like that can't be enough

84
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,720
There's a typo there's there's there's six zeros missing from this from this number

85
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,760
Well, I feel fancier already. Yeah, I think fight, baby

86
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:54,240
That just has have you all done other than purchasing lordships for us? How is y'all's fanciness journey gone?

87
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,440
What have I done an increase in either?

88
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Quality of life

89
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,000
status or

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,180
Whimsy, I was already pretty fancy to begin with. Yeah. Sure, man

91
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,820
I wore a robe after I got out of the shower yesterday. Oh hell. Yeah, can I say something?

92
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,100
I fucking get robes now. Oh, yeah

93
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,740
Yeah, now sometimes you don't have the juice to get from naked to clothed, you know

94
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,540
Yeah, you need a little robe is a nice way of saying like I'm building to it

95
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,980
Just calm down a little bit there. There's not enough transitional clothes. I would say like robe is basically it

96
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,980
There's not a lot of like well, I I don't want to wear the clothes

97
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,260
I've been wearing all day anymore, but I know if I put in pajamas, I'm going to sleep

98
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,700
And then it's robe. Like this is the thing is there's very few. I think robe is the only

99
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,220
Transitional like piece of clothing I can think of when Harry wakes up in the middle of the night

100
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,480
Because he got scared from one of his incredible mind visions

101
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,460
I'm you know, I looked at by the way take him to professor X or something, dude

102
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,020
Yeah, and they're what's weird is that they always come true. Yeah. Anyway, I don't have time

103
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,140
They always contain spider-man. Yeah, he's always in there

104
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:17,200
And anyway, I don't have time to like get fully dressed while my son is screaming about how?

105
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,760
Fucking huggy-wuggy tried to eat our whole family

106
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,780
And so just the robe is like I'm like a fucking firefighter

107
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,060
Like I just throw the robe on and I'm like up there like don't worry son. Huggy-wuggy is not real

108
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,620
Yeah, I throw on my robe and my long winter cap and then I go and I'm like, hey, what's up?

109
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,140
Can I say something? Can I say something to YouTube real quick? Hey YouTube. What's up? Love your stuff

110
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,100
Hello, great fun. Hi YouTube. I love your stuff for kids pancake contests and

111
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
recreating Spongebob

112
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,700
Clips, it's funny and I love it

113
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,060
If you can stop putting horrible monsters in every third video that are scary to me a grown-up

114
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,260
That would be fucking radical. Thank you so much. Thank you so much

115
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,080
No more huggy-wuggy. No more siren head get those shits out of my household

116
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:16,280
I do not need them. You maybe should be policing your your kids. I am watching it, but there's just I'm not kidding

117
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,580
It's like hey, what's up? It's the pancake boys

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,040
Today we're gonna have silly fun with slime. I'm like, yes. Yes. Yes, and the next one like this big clown will kill you

119
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Don't let the big clown kill you

120
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,160
You're aware that this is happening Griffin. Why don't you turn it off the big clown that will kill you because um, you know

121
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
If I'm you know, you're invested

122
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,440
yeah, well, I'm watching sports on a TV that I got a lot of money on and I don't always have the sort of like I

123
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Can't split my attention right? Oh, yeah. No, no, no Bengals are out there make a pop of those stacks of bread

124
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Anyway, I'm a good dad

125
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,800
Yeah, all right, I'm not here to argue that that seems true now

126
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Your children are lordlings. Oh, that's true

127
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm so excited to get started and this is an advice show you wish you've certainly guessed by now. Certainly a right

128
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,720
Yes, present a question to your lord

129
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,480
Oh, maybe I could be the middle is Lord Travis McElroy. Maybe that I don't think that that's a great vibe

130
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,620
Honestly, I'm your lord and savior Travis McElroy. What's wrong? That's better. Yeah Christmas this year. My roommate bought me a new tea kettle

131
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,880
Pink and very cute. By already have a tea kettle. Oh, no, and I love my tea kettle. It's powder blue

132
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,680
I've had it for years. I don't want to stop using it

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,640
However, my roommate and I obviously live in the same house and she will notice if I don't use the new tea kettle

134
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,260
We are not close. Oh my god. What it's what? Oh, sorry finish the

135
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,940
Name, how do I handle this tea kettle for two? That is a

136
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,420
Brutal way to end this message. It's a real leg sweep. Isn't it? We are not close. We are well, it does it

137
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,700
Colors it don't oh, it's a hugely important piece of information for sure

138
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,140
It's the kind of context that like I wish our year theme had been about

139
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,260
Context because I feel like that is it is that is my big push for this year is please give us the essential tools

140
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,900
We need to advise you right and what I love about this context, too, is it's not just like a like, you know

141
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,580
It's a two-bedroom house. It's not a physical piece of context

142
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,300
It's not it is much more emotional context of this person saying just FYI

143
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,060
This problem isn't really that bad for me

144
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,300
Like I I want you to know that I've thought about this but at the end of the day and we're not close

145
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,340
It's fine. I I still have in my house a like yellow stoneware tea kettle that I

146
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,140
I think brought with me all the way from like Cincinnati, which was I've been looking for that

147
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,620
12 yeah

148
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,420
Over a decade ago and I used to use it a lot

149
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,740
I used to I got into tea for a little bit. I would have some oatmeal

150
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,620
I would neti pot all these things require a good tea kettle

151
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,460
You and neti pot with the same

152
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,580
tea kettle

153
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,300
You had a neti pot, right? You had a neti pot, right? You weren't using the tea kettle, right?

154
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
No, Travis

155
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,540
Travis this show people spend the minutes they have in their life and their day on this show

156
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,980
And I feel like in 2022

157
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,700
We don't need to stop and take up that time to say things like did you put the tea kettle in your in your nose?

158
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I was obviously

159
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,840
We're all adults now the holes too big. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Well, I don't know maybe no no stretches

160
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:37,960
Anyway, I don't fuck with it anymore because it got pretty like weirdly burnt and gnarly and calcified on the inside

161
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,080
Oh, so maybe you should start using the new tea kettle because here's the thing

162
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,160
I know you like yours and you've had it for years

163
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,160
But it's a tea kettle. It does a thing where it makes the water hot and it goes

164
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
It doesn't beep. I can't whistle

165
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,200
Um, and I bet you this new one does that shit too. Pretty good. Yeah, but it's not emotionally invested

166
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Great, like when you're talking about cozy shit like a teapot. That's like saying like that blanket

167
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,040
I've had the same I've had a blanket with yeah

168
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,640
It's red white and black and green with Scotty dogs on it that I got when I was like 10 years

169
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,160
Oh shit, you still you still fuck with that blanket. I still got that shit

170
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,360
I have taken excellent care of it

171
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,440
It is still comfy cozy and it is as wonderful as the day I got it, right?

172
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,680
Does Teresa know you like slept with that in like middle school in the bad years?

173
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,920
Let's call them the dark ages. Yes. Yes. Yes in in the pubes. Yes, of course, of course. I

174
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:50,440
I wish that Scotty blanket were granted the ability to speak for one day

175
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
What the hell out

176
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:11,160
Oh you motherfuckers the things I want a little

177
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,640
No, you do not oh you stay away from that monster I'm gonna look for an open furnace

178
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,200
Leave me outside so that the birds may tear me a pieces and I may be free

179
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,680
Okay. Anyway Travis. Do you need to get the fuck rid of that blanket? My friend is still great, but I've taken wonderful care of it

180
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,200
But I would also argue there was a period of your life where you took whatever the opposite of carries you took hurt to it

181
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,120
You took hurt of it. Anyways, my point being there's an emotional investment in things

182
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,160
You don't want to have a tea kettle from someone that let's face it

183
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,040
You're not close with and then like four years someone says that's a great tea kettle

184
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Where'd you get it? And you're like, uh, it was from my roommate. Their name was uh, oh, what was it?

185
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,080
That's not it is if this though is a situation where you don't have beef with your roommate

186
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,680
It's just you guys have never really clicked. I would say that's fertile ground for a friendship to blossom, right?

187
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,640
I'm not gonna project that onto you if you're not interested in it

188
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,960
That's that's one thing but if it's just like a weird situation where it's like, yeah, we never like hung out and got to be friends

189
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I think this is a foot in the door

190
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,880
Where you say like this is a Bartlett Charlie moment where you're like, ah, thanks for this new teapot

191
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,140
You know, I've been saving this teapot for the right roommate

192
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,800
I think that's you and now you're gonna pass on your emotional powder blue teapot. No new best friend

193
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,320
And you say like and yeah, you see that stamp on the bottom that's right. This was made by Paul Revere

194
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:48,000
This was Spiro Agnew's teapot. It's been in my family for 300 years

195
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,280
Don't run the math on that don't think it's a gift

196
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,440
Yeah, I think I think go for it. I think it's a new it's new hot shit and it's not gonna be you

197
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
What if it boils water better?

198
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,680
What if the whistle is more pleasant listen if you've never had like a sick-ass tea kettle that you love

199
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,800
Like I don't I don't know if you right now listener brothers are imagining

200
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,960
Your special hot boy. Oh, yeah

201
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,400
Yeah, like I wouldn't I wouldn't I couldn't be apart from my kettle anymore

202
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
It's got a little knob that lets me set the temperature

203
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,000
Come on. What I got a water boiler. What what you're thinking of like a water heater

204
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,360
You're thinking of like the the thing that heats the water Justin

205
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,740
I have that that makes the hot water and then I have an adorable little lime green round boy

206
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,760
That then I like pour the water into to make the tea. Okay

207
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,880
Just get tea kettle go paleo on it. Do it like the ancestors did it

208
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,840
But then I need that for like all the other hot stuff. This is a fancy teapot fancy take flight, right?

209
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,560
so I got my hot water maker and then I've got like this is for like a tea party because I have

210
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,480
Fancy doesn't mean unbridled consumer is it's not

211
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,280
Justin my wife and I like to have afternoon tea and I want to have the teapot sitting there and a whole set with it

212
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,960
Okay, I'm I feel like can I say hey Griff? Can we talk first? Yeah. Yeah. I'll go over here

213
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm a little worried that the selection of our year theme is going to become something of a an albatross around our necks

214
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,240
It's specifically in regards to the middle brother. Yeah use it as a sort of like like I

215
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,200
Feel like we've given Travis permission to make terrible choices in fiction. Yeah

216
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,720
Yeah with his actual money and his actual life

217
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,880
But in like it's all part of the bit

218
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,560
What were you guys talking about? I got distracted. I was ordering pinky rings in bulk

219
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,480
What we're trying to figure out with the new mission of possibles coming out because a lot I thought it was I thought it was March

220
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,600
And I thought it was Travis stop buying things

221
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
March can I

222
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,340
Do okay talk talk. Can I call the wizard he got pissed he got guys

223
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,680
I got a fucking angry email from him for not calling him last week. I was like, dude, it's our

224
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Annual year naming one like we don't do content. It's like an easy one for us to kind of chill out on

225
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah, so I got somebody over here. That was actually lined up to

226
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,560
Be on last week's show and he was really disappointed that that he couldn't get off what I what a bone-chilling bit of

227
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,680
At this point one of two people and both of them I believe kill just like in like that

228
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,200
Wouldn't you if you have me fucking pinned down like that? No, I'm pretty you'd love that

229
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Wouldn't you if you thought you had this beautiful mine palace all mapped out with a little brochure?

230
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,920
You can hand out to the the tourists that come by like here's the different rooms that are here. I know them all

231
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,280
Hey Justin, am I wrong? That's one of one of two people. How do you know you're talking to Justin right now? Oh my god

232
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,160
I look on about it

233
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,920
Anyway, I made the wizard angry. He shot a thunderbolt in my wiener and I was like, okay fine

234
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,080
I'll get you on the next one. So this one's a kind of loved it. No, man. It was hotter than the Sun

235
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,560
Randy sent this one in. Thanks Randy Randy

236
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,800
All right, and it's it's just give a shout out sure how to sneak your cat into work

237
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,080
Thank you

238
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,040
If you're how if your kitty and booth is giving you the sour face every time you leave for work every day consider bringing him

239
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,760
To work your boss doesn't have to know with a few sneaky tools the right cat temperament and a little ingenuity

240
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,840
Your kitty can be sitting in the middle though, huh?

241
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,800
Successfully smuggling your cat into the office does require a good deal of preparation and strategy though

242
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,800
In addition, you'll have to plan your activities at the office very carefully. I like that. It's like cat temper. I'm like, okay, mr

243
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,960
Boots, I know that normally you're kind of a piece of shit. Yeah, we're at the office. I need you on your best behavior

244
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,800
Okay, do you understand me? Do you understand me little man?

245
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,560
I know you you cannot understand things like the economy, but that yummy wet stink food that you eat

246
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,720
I acquire with the resources from work that I do for work. I trade my labor for

247
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,440
Just you know, what are you saying for your piss and that you piss in?

248
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
anyway, number one

249
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,040
Consider the options

250
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Okay, I feel like no

251
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,520
Person should be able to get past this step where it's like one of my options take my cat to work or don't take my

252
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,720
Cat to work. Wow, that second one sounds way better way way better

253
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,360
That seems like that should be like the first line in every wiki. It should say like keep your grades up

254
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Yeah, keep your grades up. Maybe don't do this. Maybe don't like hey, what what's the best step in planning a heist?

255
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Maybe don't oh that would be

256
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,520
Assess your cat's personality to decide if he's the sort of cat that could be happy and quiet at work

257
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,560
If you have really not he's giving you a stink face while you leave

258
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,320
Yeah

259
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,220
That maybe the cat just doesn't like you and wants to spend less time with you

260
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,840
If your cat's a proud and independent roamer who has activities you don't even have a clue about for most of the day or night

261
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,760
Is a bad one

262
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Alternatively if your cat is quiet and often comfortable sitting near you for long periods of time

263
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,080
He may be the ideal stealth cat for the office

264
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,160
If your cat loves the sound of you clicking and making idle conversation with Susan from accounts payable

265
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,280
This cat's ready to ride

266
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,880
Cat loves the sound of like kind of a muffled radio

267
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,220
But it's still a little bit too loud and everything kind of smells a little bit like farts. Oh, have we got the idea for you?

268
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Let's see here we got

269
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,800
Hey Griffin, sit here quick. Any way here. Does it say to consider like what your business does before taking the cat in?

270
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,840
No, that's a good point. If you are like a sandwich artist at Subway

271
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,720
I'll argue this is maybe a bad way a bad career for you if you work on like a

272
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,800
Big industrial production line with like huge gears and stuff

273
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:11,400
That's probably also a bad time or like if you work for like a mouse breeding company or a cat food factory

274
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,200
This is that bad. You don't want to do this consider the way you get to work

275
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,960
Does he mind car or public transportation travel? Are you strong enough to carry him on your bike or by foot?

276
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,800
Are you strong enough to carry your own cat? Are you strong enough to be his man?

277
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:32,200
Are you strong enough to be your cat's man? Well, it's a 45 minute commute by car. I guess I could walk in there

278
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Margaret you're you're five and a half hours late. Yeah, I know what was that? Nothing. What stop?

279
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,040
How about check the weather? Is it too hot too cold too wet or too windy to be carrying your cat around?

280
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,280
I don't like this because now like if it rains does that mean you don't bring your precious or you don't bring home?

281
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,720
Your fuzzy coat. Yeah, it started raining. Sorry. Hey, listen

282
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,880
It's gonna be like a night at the museum situation. You do need to stay here

283
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,100
If you could work on my TPS reports, no, that's ridiculous. Don't worry about it. Just don't die. Bye

284
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,160
Choose a day that isn't heavenly mired in away from desk obligations

285
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,600
It'd be cool to know a lot of factors at play here, huh? Yeah, okay

286
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,360
So this is where we get to the fun stuff part to make preparations

287
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
Be absolutely certain of where your boss and other other co-workers will be throughout the day

288
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, that's that's cool. They've drawn a very crude map here of the office

289
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,400
With the boss's room, and of course the boss's room is like six times bigger than the other one. Cool. Cool. Cool

290
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,320
Boss gets a dollar I get a dime. That's why I bring cats in on the company time

291
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,120
So know where your boss is at all times with a map

292
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,000
I guess you need to have a map for that information. You could get a GPS tracker on that bad boy

293
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah

294
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,400
Review any obstacles or hurdles you might face tracker. Yeah, make your boss out of the boss

295
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,360
Make your boss and your cat both eat GPS trackers. So you can make

296
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,120
They short out you could have a freaky Friday situation

297
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Okay

298
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,040
Boss cat everybody stay with me here. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on though

299
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,480
If you could convince everybody in the office to act like the cat is the boss

300
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,280
Yeah, so when the boss comes in he's like at first he's like, all right guys, it's very funny

301
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,720
And then as the day goes on he's like women. Oh, yeah. Oh this cat this cat came down from corporate

302
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,160
They need to make some cuts. So best behavior. Mr. Jones. Don't be careful. Don't give him an excuse

303
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,120
Give him an excuse. He said he's he said he's got his eye on you and he might just be playing with his food

304
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
You know what? I mean? So like be careful

305
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,160
Review any obstacles or hurdles you might face such as a meeting or your lunch plans. Hey dogs in the office

306
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,040
Or it's big stinky fish day where everybody brings in the fish they caught

307
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,400
So, okay now we get in to prepare the cat's necessities by or find a ventilated bag

308
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,760
Preferably one that will conceal your animal and allow you to bring cat food treats quiet toys or a soft blanket and even a travel

309
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
litter box

310
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,920
You can you can ventilate any bag just take a bag and cut it up. You don't need to pay fans

311
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,280
This is a life hack folks. Yeah, you can cut up any bag to make it cat appropriate

312
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,000
Make sure the bag is not a designated cat or animal carrier. No, that would be

313
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,640
Too good for the cat

314
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,320
It actually if you want to help you could stencil on business bag and then all that's good

315
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,400
Anybody hears like from it and they're like, what's that? And you're like, that's my business

316
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,760
You what you do is you come in the day before and you're like my mom got me the worst fucking briefcase

317
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,760
Wait till you guys see this thing. You're gonna be like goddess

318
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,960
Terrific, it's useless and there's something in it

319
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,720
I don't know if it needs oiled or what but it sounds like a cat that wants to get out of a bag

320
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:56,240
Yeah, maybe write something in like French on it. And so like people like oh damn

321
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,320
That's a fancy new European briefcase from the future. Definitely not the kind of briefcase. You'd put a cat in. Oh

322
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,920
that's

323
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,320
that's that's

324
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,960
Villain and it's the new cat briefcase that has pictures of cats on it, but it is for files

325
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Do not do not trip on that

326
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,960
Start bringing the bag into work at least one to two weeks prior to sneaking the animal into the office

327
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,360
That's pretty good though. What is do you have a fucking cat in there? No

328
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,600
I've got a little ocean here for me a human lunch. Nice try though

329
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Purchase a cat harness and a leash sure

330
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,920
And then pack everything you need into the bag to determine if you can fit all items inside

331
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,560
Well fuck I can get everything in here, but the cat

332
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,520
I got I got a real chicken bag of grain and fox scenario

333
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,480
That's actually hard because if you start with the cat that's bad, too

334
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, you're piling your fucking documents and blueprints on your cat

335
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
That's uncomfortable, but then again if you get caught if you bring in a bag full of cat stuff

336
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,840
But no cat and get caught then that's gonna raise some strange questions, right?

337
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,600
We're just like hey, Doug. Why you got like a litter box and cat harness and shit in here

338
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,480
What's that for?

339
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,720
My cat you have a cat here. No, no, huh?

340
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,680
In my head. I was thinking does it make sense for you to get in the bag and for your cat to bring you in?

341
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,120
Mm-hmm, but I couldn't even figure out a justification for that

342
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,840
You know even then someone could say look what the cat dragged in and everyone would laugh really hard. Yeah

343
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,080
If the cat doesn't fit or seems cramped reconfigure how you packed your travel bag probably didn't need a wiki how tip for that

344
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,280
You probably you probably could assume that I'm not gonna keep jamming stuff into this this

345
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,320
The basket that you have tasked me with sneaking into the office until the cat begins to push through it like a Play-Doh mold

346
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,260
I probably wouldn't figure out on my own that I should try and fucking fix it instead of hurting my cat with squishing

347
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,140
For a smooth transition from home to office prepare your cat back a few days

348
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Before you plan to sneak your cat into work

349
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,440
Okay

350
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,000
In case there's a fire in your apartment building and you have to go straight to work from it have your go your go bag

351
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,600
You should have a go bag ready to go. I mean just yeah for your cat. Okay, toady mckinney on the day

352
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,120
It's time for the crime feed your cat. Can I just say I've been looking forward to this?

353
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,920
This is like the moment and like oceans 11 where we've seen everything like all the prep and now here comes the big twist

354
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,760
That we are never like the moment in the walk when Philip petite has organized

355
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,700
You can't talk about this justice his crew for the coup and he's ready to walk ze line

356
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,460
Okay from one of the beautiful towers and then we're supposed to root for this guy Justin. We are supposed to root for this person

357
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,260
This is my great dream

358
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,260
to walk across the void

359
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:49,620
He's a bad guy in this movie and no one sees that we're watching his movie like he's the hero. No, he's not

360
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,180
He's making a lot of people very nervous

361
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,440
Listen, I love talking about Roberts Mex's fly at the line. Yeah as much as anybody

362
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,600
It's weird that he had to do a CGI of his wife. No, it's the wire

363
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,920
Yeah, the wire is a different thing woke up this morning

364
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:16,400
Bought myself. That's the Sopranos. We're really off. Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah. All right feature cat breakfast. You should be doing that anyway

365
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
No, we gotta keep you hungry for the

366
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,000
Encourage the way you get sales encourage your cat to use the litter box. I would love to know how a person does that?

367
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Go go. Yeah, come on. Come on. Get that little hiney in that. That's thing. I found just to keep it fresh

368
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah, that's true. That's your cats love spoiling stuff. Don't they? Oh, this is all new and clean. Oh, is it?

369
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:45,320
Oh, let's see about that. It's business. Give your cat lots of affection and attention before you place in a bag. I love you. I

370
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Love you. Get it

371
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,720
Instead of transferring the cat to the bag while you get ready for work make the transfer the last thing you do before you leave

372
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,120
The house again. Yeah, don't do it before you go shower and brush your teeth and eat an egg

373
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,560
To be fair. I thought it was going to say like instead of transferring the cat to the bag transfer the bag to the cat

374
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,880
Yeah, just slam it right down on top of him and yell jam in the office with the kitty be confident. Oh, yeah. Yeah

375
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
In general, I think that must be good

376
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:21,460
After all, it's not really the first thing co-workers imagine different about Smith. He deserves a promotion

377
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,360
He's confident like a man with a cat in the bag. Yeah

378
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,040
After all, it's really it's not really the first thing co-workers imagine when another co-worker arrives at work

379
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Oh Alice must have a cat in her bag

380
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,260
Yeah, I don't know if it smells like piss and you hear I would be like, hey Alice

381
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,800
Is that a fucking cat in your bag?

382
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,080
This is one thing for me to say but even wilder for you to do

383
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Is that a cat in your bag look around the office to see if anyone's around your office or desk?

384
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,200
um

385
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
But confidently, I guess

386
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,420
Get away get away get away turn on your computer get set up for the day time for normal work for me

387
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,760
Clickety-clackety-clickety-clackety clicky-clack-clack business reports

388
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,280
And then decide whether having your cat let out of the bag is a sensible option

389
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:17,960
Are you fucking kidding me after ice? That's gone after I spent $300 to create of what is a pretty chill zone a pretty

390
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,560
Nice CZ for mr. Whiskers and I'm just gonna let him out into the general public

391
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,620
That care was done one time. I flew with my cat when we were moving back to Cincinnati

392
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
I flew with the cat and

393
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,080
When we were going through security and I don't know if this is a standard procedure or what?

394
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,080
we had to take the cat out of the bag and carry the cat through the scanner and put the bag through the thing and

395
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,120
All I could think like if I let go of this cat for a second. She's gone forever

396
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,400
Yeah, yeah, she'll board a flight to New York City. It'll be like a home alone to situation. Absolutely

397
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,400
Then like is there's a bunch of tips that's like put some food and water out

398
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,240
Yes

399
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,040
Anticipate his needs by setting up the litter box after an hour of being out of the bag

400
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,460
Margaret didn't I do didn't anticipate the need of it not wanting to be in the bag

401
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,600
Like I need to not be in this bag. You didn't anticipate that need

402
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
Why are you gonna think about the cat's knees now?

403
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,680
You're only thinking about your own and I just say you guys we listen

404
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:21,580
We have a lot of fun here and we talk a lot about wizard of the cloud and stuff this I'm uncertain

405
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,720
What the end goal of that?

406
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,760
Like what is the you brought your cat to work to fix what problem you think the cat's happier?

407
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,600
Are you happier? It's like you said? Well, the cat doesn't seem to like that. I go to work

408
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,480
How can I make both the cat's life and my workday a thousand times more stressful to convince the cat?

409
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
It never wants to go to work with me again

410
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,400
Um

411
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Let's talk about end of the day

412
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,280
Target to go home kick back. Have a beer with your cat

413
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,320
Go to happy hour with the cat but ask it to please be quiet

414
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,520
Target to go home or not to drink because it's driving. Yep. This will allow you to escape crowds or peak hour traffic

415
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,400
All things that could potentially cause kitty stress. Yeah. Hey boss. I'm taking off. It's 130. Yeah

416
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:15,040
Yep, it's yeah, it's it gets crowded out there. You know, I came in at 430 though, so

417
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
It's fine

418
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,360
Place your cat's items back in the bag, of course shut down your computer, etc. A mission accomplished

419
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,000
Like finish clean up your desk any crumbs on there? Why were you eating lunch your dress? Come on, man

420
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,200
Take some time for yourself. Don't work through the lunch break and then it says mission accomplished

421
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,860
You've successfully sneaked your cat into the work for a day

422
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:43,140
but get ready like go ahead and start getting the bag ready for tomorrow because now this is it this is your life you love

423
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,260
this now

424
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,300
Some quick Q&A. Why would you bring a cat to work in the first place answer? Why not?

425
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,700
Here's the problem once you get you got to set goals for

426
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,220
Once you get used to the thrill of taking your cat to work

427
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,700
You're gonna have to start chasing like bigger and better highs, right?

428
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,980
You're gonna have to be to start bringing other things to work. Yeah, I brought my cat to work

429
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,660
I'm gonna bring my car into work, right? Like what are you like? You're just gonna have to keep moving up until eventually

430
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Your house is at work

431
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:17,340
Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I wanted to see your boss walk into your office and you're a little in your cubicle

432
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,460
But you also have a Honda Civic in there. What no, this is a new computer. This is a new client boss

433
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,500
You're embarrassing me this good. Well, I'm trying to close the Honda deal

434
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,380
Is it better to leave the cat at home? Yes

435
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,060
There's no logical reason to bring your cat to work if your cat gets lonely or bored

436
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,060
You could pay a neighbor to come and pets it

437
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:43,620
Okay. Well you just wasted my time. That's like saying like Danny Oceans gonna rob the casino. Well, he could just get a job

438
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,860
It's way easier. No fucking duh. No, that's not the point

439
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,380
Should I should I ask my boss if I'm allowed to bring a pet? Yes

440
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,900
It's better to ask your boss so you don't get caught and risk losing your job. Hey boss

441
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,960
Can I bring my cat to work? No, okay fucking idiot. All right. I already did

442
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:06,500
I definitely will Sally did look around you. It's all cats it. Wait a minute. Wait accounting cats

443
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:13,740
What HR cats? It's all cats. You're everywhere. It's everywhere. No, you can't bring your pet your cat to work. Okay

444
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
What's that sound comes from your briefcase

445
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,420
It's funny sound

446
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:28,980
Machine of cat getting sick in bag. It's a joke briefcase. I got from Spencer give

447
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:35,460
Did you call it Spencer gift? Yeah. Yeah, they only had one left. They have one is the only one they made

448
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,620
Anyway, well, I feel like really I'm ready to take my cats at work. Yeah

449
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:50,620
Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, let's take let's take cats to the to the money zone. All right, let's go

450
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,220
Are we all waiting for the other ones to start it always kind of feels like that now with the money zone

451
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,980
Is that we're just in like a reservoir dog standoff to see who's going to be the first one to start talking

452
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,060
Well, the problem is is that there's only two ads and there's three of us. So it's always yeah

453
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,020
Right. So somebody gets a sweet look. Yeah

454
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,860
We don't work, but right

455
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,700
Why don't we start things off then and I'll do a fake ad for a fake company that doesn't exist

456
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,460
So the other two companies can't get mad at me because it's like not you know what I mean? Yeah. Yes

457
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,980
Do you guys ever do you guys ever worry about?

458
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,460
About hornets coming out of your house and

459
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,020
Attacking you and your family while you sleep

460
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:43,900
Well, I don't know I actively worry about that all the time. Well, I want to tell you about buzzer boys and

461
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,980
This is a new sir an online service

462
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,100
you can get the app on your phone and if you use our promo code you get one extra buzzer boy for free and

463
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
these are

464
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,740
Children

465
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:03,300
From your neighborhood and it's good for them too because they can spend this money on beyblade and

466
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:10,720
And what it is is the app lets you find children in your neighborhood to chase the hornets around inside your house

467
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
until they get so tired that

468
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
both the boys and the

469
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,120
Hornets that they just kind of stop

470
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,120
They just leave after a while or they sting the buzzer boys and then again

471
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,760
It's not your problem anymore because that's the one day and don't worry. All our buzzer boys are

472
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,320
Guaranteed not allergic to hornets. We have a very really

473
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,320
My girl and you're like no no way. We're not gonna get caught like that again. So we do definite tests

474
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,880
And they are accredited and they are gonna make you feel comfortable as they run around your house yelling while you are asleep

475
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,800
Which is not if you can ask you a question. I don't want to step on your yeah

476
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,520
Yeah, do you have a website yet for your for buzzer boys? They don't have like a phone number

477
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,100
No, they don't have either of those because if you wanted to get that going I would don't do it

478
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,960
Recommend Squarespace. Oh, wait, hold on wait buzzer boys gonna be fucking pissed off if you interrupt their ad to do another

479
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I know you were but you were gonna do that

480
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,640
You know what now?

481
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,400
Now fucking twist in the wind. Okay, so buzzer boys, they're cool. They're clean boys

482
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,340
None of these chocolate, you know stained

483
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,980
shirts

484
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
No smudging's

485
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:35,740
They smell great. And they're definitely fresh boys. These are fresh buzzer boys and they're don't help them

486
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,980
They're not a scare. They don't get us scared of these of these flying menaces

487
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,180
And they don't kill the bugs either. That's important to say they would never do that

488
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,980
They just chase them out of the house really awkward

489
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,020
But like I don't feel comfortable advertising for buzzer boys because I actually I use buzzer beaters

490
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,600
Which they do they do kill the big deal out of like we kill the hornets from well

491
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,920
It says here it says here unlike some other child based

492
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,820
Hornet services we do not kill the hornets. We are this is a this is a very ethical operation

493
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,660
So anyway, it seems like such a short-term solution. We're buzzer beaters

494
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,080
So anyway, if you will beat the bugs

495
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,140
So anyway, if you want to get on board with buzzer boys

496
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,520
We have a special offer for you two buzzer boys for the price of one buzzer boy. All you have to do is go to

497
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,120
Your local community center or rec center and look at the billboard there

498
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,540
But the bulletin board and if it says something about buzzer boys on it, you're good to go

499
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,240
It's only in a few cities now. So wait, there's these come when you need them

500
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,400
You don't need to like call or anything. We are seeking ten and a half million dollars in startup funding

501
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,360
Yeah

502
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,260
If you know anyone who works on Shark Tank

503
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,800
Go to your community center find us find us and God these fucking hornets are getting so big guys

504
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
They're getting so big

505
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,640
The end there's less of them but they're bigger there's less of them but they're huge

506
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,520
For extra money we can get you a third buzzer boy that will collect the hornets wonderful, honey

507
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,280
And you don't have that fresh you can have that fresh in your smoothie and it'll help you not be allergic to stuff anymore

508
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,740
They do kill the hornets for that though

509
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,140
They squeeze them over a over a big jar

510
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,700
Now that's actually good to hear because the one problem I have with buzzer beaters is I feel like all that honey is going

511
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,040
To waste it's going to waste it ends up all over the honey service, but my

512
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,680
But the buzzer boy number three goes crazy on them and will just squish fistfuls of these guys over jars

513
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,680
Until you wake up and you drink what comes out of them and get strong. What if I ask him to stop will he stop?

514
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,120
Actually once you have signed a contract to get the third buzzer boy in there

515
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
He cannot stop

516
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:14,480
He'll tell you when he's ready to stop this is so important Griffin because this is an issue I have with buzzer beaters

517
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Oh, yeah, actually they'll leave, right

518
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Once they've had their fill. Yeah, sure

519
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Once they've had their fill of honey or had their fill of chasing hornets

520
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,220
There's actually a special fee that you have to pay to make the boys leave

521
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,680
And it is so much more money than what you pay to get them into your house

522
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,040
Okay. All right. So can I just keep the boys there if I decide like what the hornets might come back?

523
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,440
All right, so Squarespace is a great way to make a website

524
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,300
Yeah, our shows sponsored in part by Squarespace who?

525
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,560
Probably won't get as much ad time as buzzer boys, but still let's make it count

526
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,800
And if you want to make your dream count, you need a website

527
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920

You I'm John Moe my show depressed mode is all about mental health and this week

560
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,080
I talked with Amanda Knox. She spent four years in an Italian prison for a murder

561
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,920
She didn't commit that's a lot of trauma and she's okay talking about it

562
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,880
If I touch on something that you'd rather not get into just say so we'll cut the whole exchange out

563
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,380
But it also seems like you're pretty open open about a lot of things. Yeah. Yeah

564
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,880
I am having trouble imagining anything that you could talk about that. I know what are we gonna throw a man tonight?

565
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,060
Depressed mode with John Moe only on maximum fun

00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Was that a drumroll or a doorknock

574
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,680
It sounds like a doorknock, but there's no door like we're miles away from Justin

575
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,000
Hello

576
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,120
Hi, boy. Okay. Hey Richard. Hi. How's it going? It's your first episode, right?

577
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:11,520
Oh first one of winter every season I appear then there, you know, there's no need to fear

578
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,880
You know, you say that Richard, but you have been appearing more and more you're ready to have a good think

579
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,060
Prepare yourself for Richard's thing

580
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,920
Wrote my own. Now. Wait, what is it about you that sort of?

581
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,880
Tickles the cerebellum and really really challenges

582
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,760
Challenges think about fragrance think about your life and how you sting for most of it

583
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,160
Think about how you have no fragrance and thus no memory. No one will remember you when you leave

584
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,280
Hey Richard, you are probably the closest thing. I have to an expert that I can ask this question

585
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,320
Okay in the movie in canto when Camilo changes into

586
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,520
Does he smell not doing does he smell like the person? I

587
00:47:53,240 --> 00:48:00,180
Need everyone to listen to me. It's the first regular episode of winter. I can only come once a season

588
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:07,080
This is the law set forth, but I am Richard's think I am a fragrance expert and the follower of the one Christ child

589
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:13,640
So happy to be back with you guys. It's a big show and I've been working on different jokes

590
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
Oh, you got jokes now

591
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,780
I've been working on jokes do it

592
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:27,080
Well, it's I don't really I'm not I'm not right jokes it's more like in the oh it's contextual so funny you bust out

593
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:33,160
Oh, yeah, Richard. I want you to know I've been using that imaginary authors set. You got me a lot more

599
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,380
Yeah, I don't feel like playing anymore in the space right now. They text they text me

600
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,220
Why you know you smell great, but I just a joke I do this joke sometimes to keep people on their toes

601
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,700
This is one of the jokes. I worked on. Okay, but one of my jokes

602
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,180
I wrote the first one I have on my notepad here

603
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:21,980
If you can see off I'll hold up my notepad to the microphone so you can see the first joke I have is your wife

604
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,500
hate the way you smell

605
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:29,940
Yeah, that's I guess it's kind of a lie though. If it's not true and Jesus doesn't like what are you doing here, Richard?

606
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,000
That's a good question. I know what the fuck you're doing here. Richard's the same

607
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,700
Are you doing anything different than you usually do here Richard? Yeah, very different man. Is it different smells?

608

Difference. No. Yeah, I'm talking about new fragrances because it's winter. We got to get you ready

To warm warm

611
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:57,580

And you think I would love to smell like this person and now you can't with the power of celebrity fragrance

617
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:26,960
Sure, what poets I wonder are all up in this industry right now. I never read the poem. I don't know

618
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,860
I just mean Johnny Sun did a book right? I would smell like Johnny Sun

619
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,420

00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,380
So now so now you can smell like all your favorite different people and I'm so excited to talk to you guys about

621
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,700
I

622
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,540
The thing is that I should mention. I don't know much about like America celebrity

623
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:51,660
Okay, so I don't know like how cool or not cool these people are but I love the way they smell

624
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:57,460
Yeah, I mean if they have a fragrance, they're probably pretty fucking cool Clive Barker. He's like a master of horror

625
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,820
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, he's got he's got Clive Barker's The Forbidden

626
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,380
that does sound like a

627
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:12,140
Scary movie Clive Barker might make though. It's a line right? There's three of them. So the first one we're gonna get you into is

628
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,420
Foolish and vacuous perfume oil what that's what it's it's called

629
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:23,100
Foolish and vacuous perfume oil. This is from black Phoenix

630
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:29,300
Alchemy lab foolish and vacuous perfume oil. Here is the description, right? There's no notes

631
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:36,900
It just says a scent with no depth a light Reedy almost vapid take on a classic

632
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:44,700
Men's for jail. Oh, I actually I'll take that. Yeah, no, that sounds like he's saying this perfume sucks shit

633
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,820
Yeah, it's not that

634
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:53,180
It smells like water some chips smells like pine water the day burned white

635
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:59,380
The day burned white this smells like plaster and spray paint modeled with buttermilk

636
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,620
Wait, what the fuck is Clive Barker making perfume or is he having a vision?

637
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:12,340
Plaster and spray paint modeled with buttermilk sweet chalky and edging on sickly

638
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,340
Fuck off!

639
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,340
White and golden amber beams of daylight pour through the belly of the scent

640
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:24,580
We had we had some serious contract work being done on our

641
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:29,060
Desiccated bathroom for most of last year very few times

642
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:35,820
Did I walk into that room when it had been freshly drywalled or painted and said I'd love to smell like this all the time

643
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:40,780
Well, you were missing the buttermilk Griffin. That's maybe the buttermilk sets it sets it right off

644
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:46,060
Do you want to smell like Tim McGraw's love? No, wait, what was the third one from Clive Barker?

645
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,020
It's a collaboration with Tim McGraw

646
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,820
Sweet to the sweet

647
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:58,460
Sugar upon sugar honey upon honey white cane sugar and honey. Absolute. That will bring in the hornets for sure. No

648
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Did he make Candyman?

649
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,100
He is the Candyman. I think he did. This next one

650
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,580
I don't know this celebrity, but I think you guys would be maybe you guys have come walk me through it

651
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,300
His name is a grumpy cat. Oh

652
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,580
Oh, yeah, this is a cat everyone

653
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:23,380
Liked so much because he looked pretty pretty peoed most of the time. Unlike most cats. I do think he passed away

654
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,100
But it's cool that he's still getting that cheddar

655
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,860
Well, he's not

656
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:35,980
His descendant so he's a grumpy cat is that the cat it says on the tin? Yeah

657
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,420
Is he dead? I think I don't know. I'm thinking might have hit that rainbow bridge pretty hard

658
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,700
So this is from the meter there cuz a lot of fragrances. I really like actually they've

659
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,060
Petrichor, which is a smell after a rain. Yeah, come on. Yeah, but but grumpy cat

660
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,820
This one's called kitten fur and it's a smell a

661
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,660
wonderful kitten smell from that spot right behind the kittens neck and

662
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,260
It's wonderful feelings. There's nothing no breakdown. It just smells like cat from the grumpy cat

663
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,900
I don't love the idea of someone knowing

664
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,900
Where the best smelling part of their cat is that's it just a level of

665
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,380
Intimacy that I don't I don't I don't much agree with

666
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,740
Would you like to smell like the love of Tim McGraw? Yeah, this one

667
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,220
soul to soul

668
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:36,260
Tim McGraw two-piece set a two-piece sets much like Tim McGraw and faith Hill whose love everlasting love is

669
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:39,740
is captured finally in a great juice a

670
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:47,020
Spray juice as we call it in the industry. This is inspired by faith healing Tim McGraw's classic

671
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,120
American love story soul to soul is a number

672
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,860
So it's kind of oh that is cool

673
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,540
Tim McGraw captures

674
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,660
Soul to soul Tim McGraw captures Tim's modern confidence

675
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:08,220
Balanced with the classic romance Tim and faith represent his his modern competence as a lover

676
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,780
It's a lover the fragrance opens with sensual spices

677
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:18,420
Balanced with a brandy accord. That's the foreplay baby a brandy accord

678
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:26,660
The heart is a classic blend of woods with hints of exotic herbs that lead to a sexy yet rugged

679
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:32,380
That's the fucking and then the cool down, okay, yeah you get that pumping

680
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,700
Tim's got everything for you this fragrance that him and

681
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:44,220
Faith Hill shared together with their love. It smells like the room after they've seen it. Does that

682
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:50,580
Particular spray juice come with a cowboy hat shaped lid because some of his earlier ones did

683
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,260
This one is a little more upscale. Okay, okay. I

684
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:01,460
Got them. I got this next one. I got to just show you guys. Well, okay, that's gonna be tough

685
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,260
I show it that's in the computer. Hold on

686
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:11,360
Don't start it just oh, yeah, I'm gonna play the audio and we'll watch it together, right?

687
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,460
Don't say anything cuz I'm gonna unmute

688
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:24,460
Ready? Ready? Three, two, one go

689
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,460
Oh

690
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,620
Philippine

691
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,300
Limits the fragrance for the loaded

692
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:08,020
So that's a Philip line. I've never felt dumber

693
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:13,860
Asking the question. I'm about to ask who is that? Yeah, he's a he's a German

694
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:21,420
German fashion designer. It's like a lifestyle buddy. Well, he's also my he's also my best man

695
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,380
If I ever get to marry Philip and I agree we go be each other's best man

696
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:34,300
If we don't have anybody if we've not found anybody to love by the time we're 27 we get married to each other

697
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:38,060
This is the deal now the deal that we made. Wait, how old are you?

698
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:45,100
24. Okay, I got three years and I you know, I do I end up married to Philip. It's not so bad

699
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:51,100
It's a beautiful house and a great lifestyle that seems to really respect women in a major way. Yeah, sure

700
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,940
that that ad seems to

701
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:02,580
Put a lot of stock and people being excited about it being Philip plying and there were some things obviously the the thesis of that

702
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,740
That video and I suppose the smell itself is this is

703
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,460
Cologne for people with a lot of money

704
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,580
Is a fragrance for the load, right?

705
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:16,780
But there were also things that people were doing with money in that video that I don't think anyone

706
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:24,660
Especially wealthy people do with money like at one point a woman was just rubbing money on a car and I don't yeah

707
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,660
I don't know like to clean it clean

708
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,300
Notoriously dirty

709
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,900
Yeah, also the the fragrance it looks like a credit card. Yeah, that's true

710
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,180
Yeah

711
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:42,540
That part of it is definitely badass do super rich people often carry their money around and those guns that shoot money out

712
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,420
Is that like a normal rich person thing? Hey, how much was that? Yeah, you got it

713
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:54,620
There you go, man. That's four hundo right there. Enjoy. I guess it's how you pay for it. Listen. Hey, hey Richard

714
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,140
What do you think just quick question?

715
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:02,020
Do you think that 2022 will be the year that my brother my brother to me answers more than one question per episode?

716
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,020
Or do you think that that's just gonna remain?

717
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,860
Just to remain like a normal

718
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,900
trajectory for us

719
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:14,900
What don't worry about it. Don't worry about it Richard. Hey, listen, I got one more to tell you about this one

720
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,100
You're gonna have to search it out on the bay on the bay

721
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:25,340
A bay. Oh, okay. Why it's a auction site. What cuz it listen

722
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:30,780
This one's like you didn't hear about this from me. Oh, this is like dark stink

723
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:37,860
Yeah, this is like other grounds think this is traded this fragrance is traded because it's a league

724
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:42,140
Oh, it's like a cryptic smell. Yeah, so right. So the year is

725
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:48,580
2004 it is Jessica Simpson is burning. It's a story man

726

Come on, Jesus. Forgive me Jesus. I am so sorry for taking your name in vain. You're my blessed Savior apologies

727
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,880
So so it's 2004, right?

728
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:06,260
Jessica Simpson is burning up the charts and burning down our hearts with a great reality show with Nick Lachey and

729
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,460
probably

730
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:12,780
Look of hazard. Yeah. Yeah, that was probably around then so then

731
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,380
Jessica Simpson launched desert beauty

732
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,740
Right desert. It's a lot. No, listen, this is the thing about it. Okay

748
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:43,240
Then just decision she started getting sued a lot. Yeah, and apparently a lot of people don't think it's good to eat your make

749
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,020
Lot of bombers maybe

750
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,900
Well a lot of stinkers. I bet it was Nick

751
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,740
And a lot of people got kind of sick

752
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,980
Based based on dessert beauty. Well, no one could have seen that coming

753
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:06,060
You know what I mean? Like that could have happened to anyone eating perfume makes you sick couldn't who knew who knew?

754
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:12,460
So there's this I'm gonna read to you this story from days digital which recaps an episode member newlyweds

755
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,260
Oh, yeah, he's a shawl right with Nick and Jessica

756
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:21,420
So 2004 there's this episode where I'm just gonna read to you

757
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,260
Simpson is shooting the campaign to launch dessert beauty

758
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:31,220
Simpson is being shown some of the products from the range clearly for the first time and has no idea about any of them

759
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:38,100
Upon being shown the whipped body cream and told it's a moisturizer Simpson responds. So it moisturizes, huh?

760
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,740
Then we watch Simpson post seductively with a cupcake

761
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:49,220
progressively being forced to eat more and more icing until she feels so ill she ends up crouched on the bathroom floor eating crackers her mother

762
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:54,540
Brought her and then she throws up for three hours. It's a poison. She's

763
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:07,140
To everyone and then she gets sued and if you can't get it anymore, but here's the thing about this shit

764
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:12,720
It smells so good. That's it. That's a problem about deliciously kissable belly button

765
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,540
Fragrance it smells so good

766
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:23,700
That a lot of people think it's creamy and yummy warm vanilla berry. No, don't eat it. Oh, wait a minute to which

767
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,380
Sense, is it creamy?

768
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,780
It's just like regular creamy shit one reviewer

769
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:36,860
Wrote on makeup alley.com 17 years ago yet another product

770
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:44,020
I wasted my money on the smell is faint and which is a good self-burn. You did it again user

771
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,340
Shaq the cat

772
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:53,540
Shaq the cat you wasted more money. The smell is faint lasts only a few minutes and who would want to lick a belly button?

773
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,060
Can I say though it sounds like shitty perfume but

774
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:03,940
I'm glad that the smell is faint if I'm eating it, you know what I mean?

775
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,780
Like I can't eat you can't eat perfume

776
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:12,060
So they that certain certain compromises had to be made but it also makes you sick though

777
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,060
So they didn't compromise that much. It doesn't make you pretty sick. I

778
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,060
Received juicy in a sample size and the smell was nice and sweet

779
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:26,820
It only stayed on me for about one minute and then faded while I got the leftover sticky mess on my wrist and neck not to

780
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,660
Mention I was followed everywhere by me man. Do not purchase this

781
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:36,740
So yes, this is no longer on the market and I kid about Jessica seems in poisoning people is clear

782
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:42,620
She has no idea what these products and it seems like she's having something of a renaissance. So I'm

783
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:48,980
Listen, no shade Jessica. Anyway, that's some different fragrances you can choose from for winter

784
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,260

I was just gonna tell people to take what they've learned out into the world and but that's fine

798
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:58,700
Hey, if you want to go to macro emerge calm, we've got a lot of great stuff there

799
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,700
There's a pin of the month
