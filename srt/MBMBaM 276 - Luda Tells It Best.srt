00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,920
Hello everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,240
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm the baby, I almost said middlest, but I'm not a middlest. You're not.

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm not the middlest. Copyright infringement.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,160
We're back with another episode of our advice podcast. It's a little late. It's been

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,120
a kind of, it's been a day. It's been a few days.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,120
What happened?

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,880
It's been a harrowing five days.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Okay, so let me give you my story real quick. Saturday morning is the day before my birthday,

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,840
and oh my God, my baby is puking every hour on the hour. And babies are rad when they puke,

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,480
because like human beings, adult human beings, if they got puked, you see that look in their eyes

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,040
like, oh God, oh God, not now.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,080
It's happening again.

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,840
It's happening again. They make this run for the bathroom. Babies are just like sitting,

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,480
watching little Einsteins chilling, and then they're just puking on your chair,

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,400
and you, and everything. And they don't really see that like bent out of shape about it.

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,440
How rough and raw is baby puke? Cause they're pretty little.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,200
Is it like in Son of the Mask when I think a baby pukes one time and it like comes out

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
real fast and hard and Jamie Kennedy is just like wearing it.

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,200
It's weird because you really have to help babies out. You know, like you hear the thing about,

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
you know, a real friend is somebody who holds your hair back while you puke.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
For babies, you just like upend them over the tub or something. It's like you're holding their whole

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
body up so they could just get it all out. And then afterwards, instantly, so cool. Who's got

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,600
milk? Who wants to chill? I'm so good right now.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,440
I just want to step in here and say that if somebody comes in to like my zone while I'm

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,080
yard sing, that is, that is no friend of mine. My wife, my wife got real concerned about me

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,520
because spoiler alert, I also had the yards this past weekend. Oh my God, in the worst way.

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,360
And she like came in to check on me. I'm like, what are you, what are you doing? This is,

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
I don't want anybody to share. It's a private thing.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,680
If it were up to me, if I, if I were, if I were yerbing real hard, I wouldn't,

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
I would want my wife to like go outside the house, maybe like go down the block

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,880
and like pretend like it never happened and she never knew it.

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,840
And she came back in and I was in a tux, like drinking a martini.

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,240
The next day, uh, was my actual birthday and Sydney got this thing and then Charlie evolved

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,160
to stage two of this disorder in, in which she just had like tactical nuclear shits.

41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,200
Just like absolute abominations of poop that were not constrained by diapers.

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,080
Do not try to hold these in. It's just like a, a, a dump site. And I was, there was a moment where,

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,720
um, uh, is this story about to get like, it's a little rippled.

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,600
Sydney ran in the bathroom to puke in that exact moment.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,320
Charlie took an Omega dump all over me and I couldn't take her into the bathroom because

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,600
Sydney was in there puking. So I had to hold my shitty baby close to me as we went down the stairs.

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,240
And then I just climbed into the shower with her so we could wash the excrement off of both of us.

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,640
And it's just like, happy birthday to me. This is 35. This is why I can be president now

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,720
because I've done this. This is, this is why I'm qualified to lead the land.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,280
You know, on my birthday, which is the same day, I, um, we put a mattress down on our foldout

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,560
couch and I played oblivion all day while we watched 30 Rock and Parks and Rec on the computer.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,400
And Teresa just took a big dump on me.

53
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,280
She took a big dump on me. And I made steaks and bacon and chicken sausages for breakfast,

54
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,200
lunch and dinner. Oh, Jesus. It was a good day. Um, I, I just wanted to interject here before

55
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,280
people were worried that all of us had problems. I didn't have no problems. You did great. Friday,

56
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
I got the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life. And then I think I just like took that,

57
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,720
put a little envelope and overnighted it to my main girl, Chuck,

58
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
and made sure that she sort of spread that whole thing around that whole concept.

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
And Justin, why didn't we record yesterday?

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:01,920
Because then it was time for part three when I, when I, I, I ate, like, I had a terrible day on

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,920
my birthday and I was trying to console myself with a few slices of reheated za, uh, from my

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,240
birthday party the night before. And, uh, boy, hachi-machi. Body did not like that. It woke me

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,760
up at one in the morning and was like, good news. I've been saving all of the things you've consumed

64
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,280
today for one last curtain call. Everybody, come on out. Gatorade, flat sprite, sausage,

65
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
pepperoni, onion pizza. Everybody come out and take your curtain call. Come take your vow. You've

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,320
earned it, kids. This is your moment to shine. By which I mean be ejected into the bathroom at

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,440
terminal velocity. Um, so yeah, I did that yesterday. That was me yesterday.

68
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
I just, and, and we tell all of you this and that's not to yuck you out. We're not one of

69
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,200
those yucky podcasts that like gets off on grossome ups, but we got a lot of tweets yesterday

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,680
from people were like, huh? Can't help but notice you guys skip a day. The day that fallout four

71
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,240
comes out. I promise you my dudes. It was not that. No, I actually, I peeled myself away from

72
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,160
fallout four to record this very episode. You're welcome. Yeah. I couldn't even play fallout four.

73
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,400
That's how sick I was. Oh, same Z's. I was, I was curled up in bed and I was watching like crazy,

74
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,560
crazy, crazy old. We have, we have like, we don't have cable. We have like an antenna.

75
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,840
And for some reason that antenna, one of like 12 channels we get, um, includes his channel called

76
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,280
buzzer. And it's all like super old, super shitty game shows. And they're really bad. And I didn't

77
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,240
like watching them, but like, it was just nice to nice to have them there. Here's how sick I was

78
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,440
yesterday. I got to, I had a moment yesterday where this is how sick I was. It's pretty bad

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,120
while I was laying there and just like on Netflix chilling. And I thought, you know what,

80
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,520
maybe I should check out supernatural. Like that's how sick I was. Yeah. Like that was,

81
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,640
it was that level of sick. It's really good. Maybe I should dip into supernatural. I don't know.

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,640
It's very good. I'm free now. I'm free of this disease. Now I just have a fever

83
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,520
and can't eat anything without having Omega shits. Well, better than nothing, better than nothing. I

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,360
think you're in a pretty good head space to produce some comedy. I'm I'm, I think I'm tired

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,040
of hearing about our gastrointestinal distress. You know what I'm tired of hearing about? A

86
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,240
fucking Chilean miners movie. Yes. I know. We are aware of it. We are aware of it. I know everybody

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440
has good intentions. It just tends to pile up when I get 30 tweets in one day. Like, have you

88
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,160
seen this trailer? I don't even want to see a film about that. This is like our state of the union

89
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,840
address. We all have really bad diarrhea and thank you all for your enthusiasm about the 33. Um,

90
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,480
we share it in varying degrees, but we don't need minute to minute updates, text message,

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Amber alerts about the 33. Did y'all hear the ANTM might be coming back? Yes. Okay. That's another,

92
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,120
yes. I just want to go ahead and get that one out there. Just get that one out there. I know

93
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,280
ANTM might be coming back, but I'll, the proof is going to be in the pudding you guys. And the

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,520
pudding is UCI. Yeah. UCI is my, UCI is my pudding. And if he's not involved with the project, let me

95
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,120
say this, let me go out on a limb. You guys ready for a big old nuclear bomb? Yeah. Uh, for real

96
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
though, fuck Tyra. You can't be like, I think it's time. I think it's time we pull the plug. Oh,

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,760
is it time we pull the plug after three seasons? Yeah. Three seasons. Like it seems like a good

98
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,080
time after letting boys in the house for a scant three seasons. Let's pull the plug. Let's got to

99
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
take them off life support. Are you sure? Cause they're a baby. They were just born, but yeah,

100
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,840
let's go ahead and take them off life support. I guess this newborn healthy baby that's like

101
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,600
running around and jumping and doing stunts and stuff. Let's go ahead and unplug the machines and

102
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,240
stuff from this healthy three-year-old baby. Good plan, Tyra. You can't be like that. And then be

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,360
like, actually, let's see if, uh, let's see if we can get a streaming. No Tyra, you can't get

104
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,880
a streaming. It's not your project anymore. It's UCI's project. You've lost all rights because

105
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
you've lost all rights to the project. You've fucked me one too many times, Tyra. Have all

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,480
your makeup back. They let boys in the house. Imagine if you let boys in the house via the

107
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
process of adoption. You let boys into your house, your own house. And then after three years,

108
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,800
you decided you would kill the boys. That's a crime. Hi. Maybe I'm just in the different America

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,360
from you all. That's a crime. Yeah. It's not my America. And you certainly can't be like boys,

110
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,680
three years, great years, lots of jumps and stunts. And I like how great you all modeled and you added

111
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,120
a really weird and profound sexual energy to the show, to the house, I mean, but anyway,

112
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,840
I have to kill you now. Oh wait, hold up. What's that? Hold up. What's that? Oh no, nevermind. I'm

113
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,040
not going to kill you. I'm going to see if I can get you on streaming. I might kill you in the

114
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,320
morning. Those boys ain't gonna look at you the same way. Let's do a question. Let's do a question.

115
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,280
This is definitely, definitely going off the rails. The other day I was picking up my slider.

116
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,080
Can we just not do any fucking food questions? I didn't even think about that. You can do it. This

117
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,040
one's not about food. Okay. That was not Justin's mouth. That was a stomach flange. The other day I

118
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,840
was picking up sliders from one of my favorite takeout places. The total was 7.99, which meant

119
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,640
that I got a penny back to pay $8 cash for my meal. I stood there for a minute, not knowing

120
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,720
if I should keep the penny or throw it in the tip jar on the counter. I felt like either action was

121
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,320
cheap and chintzy, but it's one better than the other. Brothers, help me. What would you do? That's

122
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,520
from a penny saved or a penny spurned, which is a pretty good name. I think we can all agree.

123
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,960
I think we can all get down on that name. Where are we reading these questions from? Because I

124
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,040
don't see them. Travis emailed us a question list. Is that how he does it usually? That's how he

125
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,400
usually does it. For the last 275 episodes. Is it bim bam 276? Is that really what episode it is?

126
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,320
I can't be right. Let's check the log book. Are we ready to move on? Let me check the

127
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,840
ledger. I'm checking the ledger. Oh my God, it's 276. What are we doing? This is why people...

128
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,360
I feel like when the magical art of sleight of hand was invented, it was for this very reason.

129
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
Because neither option is correct. Neither option is appropriate. You just got to make that little

130
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,120
copper bastard disappear. You do a little noodling over your fingers and then you

131
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,040
just sort of wave your hands and it's gone. But in all reality, you've just thrown it very far

132
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,560
across the restaurant to a place where you can't hear it hit the ground. This is why I've been

133
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,880
banging this drum forever about getting rid of the fucking penny. The penny has no value.

134
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
You know what I do when somebody gives me a handful of pennies? I throw them on the ground.

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,280
I would have thrown them on the ground outside. It's the one monetary that is such a direct

136
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,560
insult. If someone's like, hey, can I have some change? And you hand them a penny,

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,480
you might as well just spit in the palm of their hand. And let's just put this out there

138
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,800
and let's just grab the tiger and put him right up on the table. Pennies is just a couple letters

139
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,600
off from penis and I hate saying it. And we all hate saying it. We shouldn't have to,

140
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,360
I have to say peeny. See, there I go again. I have to say pennies all the time.

141
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,080
And sometimes I say that and children laugh at me.

142
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,280
Pennies are the absolute worst. I think what you should do is leave it on the counter

143
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,680
and just tell them, listen, this is your cross to bear now. Do the right thing and throw this

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,640
in the garbage. If enough of us did that, we would eventually run out of pennies so we could

145
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,360
be done with this stupid currency. I think that it should be a service that they provide,

146
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,400
right? That the cashier provides in the same way that they ask you if you want a receipt.

147
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,280
They say, do you want a receipt? And the answer is like, no, never. Why? Why am I going to need

148
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,400
a receipt? You're right, Griffin. I think that this is the real problem with the cashier. Why

149
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,760
did they hand you back a penny? They gave you that chore. Well, they do that because they have to,

150
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,640
right? Or else they get fired. No. Well, no, no, no. There's a till at the end of the day.

151
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,840
I have to balance it out. I'm saying we need to- Yeah, but there's a dollar lenience there.

152
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,320
We got to take this on in the Japanese style. That one doesn't really fit here, although they

153
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,560
don't use the one yen too frequently there. But you take that penny and when they say,

154
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,360
do you want your receipt? You say, of course not. What am I going to use that for? And then they

155
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,120
say, and do you want your pennies, sir? And I'll say, or it should just be customary that if I say,

156
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,960
hold the pennies and nickels, nothing smaller than a quarter, my man, then they know what's up.

157
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,840
Because I'm not going to use anything smaller. We're all waging war against the penny. What's

158
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,360
so fucking great about the dime? Nothing. I'll tell you what's great about the dime, Griffin.

159
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Here we go. 10 of them, very tiny, very lightweight. I like it. I don't want that. I don't want tiny,

160
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,040
lightweight coins. I like it better than the penny. I like it better than the nickel. Well,

161
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,840
yeah. It's 10 times better than the penny, Travis. And in many ways, I prefer it to the quarter.

162
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,040
No, fuck off. Now you're being a- It takes up way less space.

163
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,440
You're being obtuse. Quarters are great though. You get a quarter, you think,

164
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm going to do something with that. Maybe you're going to put it in a machine,

165
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,480
get a nice gumball out for yourself. Good half.

166
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,320
Blueberry gumball. Maybe get yourselves a nice little homey out of the machine.

167
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Get yourself a little homey. Get yourself a little sticky hand and use that sticky hand to

168
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,240
annoy your dad on the drive home. If somebody gives you a quarter, they're basically saying,

169
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
hey, this is your mad money. Just go crazy with this. Get whatever you want.

170
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,640
Hey, you know what? You've earned this. Thanks for being you.

171
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,040
Get yourself a psychedelic jawbreaker. Get two of these bad boys together and get yourself one

172
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,520
of them sticky hands from one of the vending machines. And annoy your dad on the way home.

173
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,360
Your dad's going to hate that sticky hand. I would say to the question asker,

174
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,120
just adopt the policy of being like, I don't need the penny. Just say it.

175
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,480
Okay, but this person can't be the only person saying this. We all have to take

176
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,920
a stand right now and say, hold the pennies. Even saying that, you have to say pennies.

177
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,200
And it's not right. And it's not clean. Hold the one cent piece. Hold the bit.

178
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,080
Now, Travis, I have to take umbrage, though. You say the person should say,

179
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,280
I don't need the penny. That's a crazy thing to say out loud.

180
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,440
And then you pop in your monocle. The inverse of that would be like, I need the penny.

181
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
Please, please don't skimp on the penny. I don't need the penny, you say loudly,

182
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,880
so everyone can hear you and then you leave. Yeah, it's like, yeah, who does?

183
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,280
But I do need it. Nobody needs it.

184
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,000
We got to digitize this transaction, don't we? We got to have some sort of little terminal

185
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,200
that after you give them your money and a little screen pops out and it's like,

186
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,560
you want those pennies? So you don't actually have to say the words. You can just hit yes or no.

187
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,760
Yeah, that's an equitable solution. Oh, and then they hand you an envelope

188
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
and maybe it's got a penny in it. Maybe it doesn't. No one needs to know.

189
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,080
It's like Schrodinger's penny. You know what I mean?

190
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
That's nothing. You need to know if there's

191
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,840
a penny in there or not. You've taken the inconvenience

192
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,720
of a penny and then removed its already slight monetary value.

193
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,840
And the value of the penny has to be exceeded by the value of the envelope, right?

194
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,440
Yeah, but why? Oh, very much so.

195
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,960
They're going to go out of business. Too sweet. It's a profit deal. I get it.

196
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,320
Japanese style. Let's get it done. Can I do a Yahoo?

197
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
You're kind of like stepping all over me a little bit.

198
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
Well, do we? Okay. Well, sorry. You know, we do one on one.

199
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,480
No, we don't always. Most of the time.

200
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,440
This Yahoo was sent in by level 9000 Yajru Drew at Drew Davenport.

201
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
Thank you, Drew Davenport. It's by Yajru Answers user Joshua Leal.

202
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,480
Putting his whole name out there and I've hacked him.

203
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm in. I'm into Joshua. Oh, I've got all his files.

204
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,280
He's a dirty boy. Living the Josh life.

205
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,040
Just kidding. It's mostly JPEGs of his trip to...

206
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,120
Boca Raton.

207
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,960
Boca Raton. Ooh, yeah.

208
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,440
Found one of his butt in some swimming trunks.

209
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
Putting this on Tumblr.

210
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
Thank you, Joshua, for your files.

211
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,520
Thanks for your files, Josh.

212
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,560
Joshua asks...

213
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,480
Why are people looking at my butt?

214
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,400
It's not a nude butt picture. It's just like some nice trunks.

215
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,440
Joshua...

216
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,080
My trunks picked a butt Tumblr. I gotta know.

217
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,640
So...

218
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,680
Joshua asks...

219
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,760
Can you bring board games such as Monopoly onto an airplane?

220
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Huh.

221
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Can you bring board games such as Monopoly onto an airplane?

222
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't think he doesn't specify,

223
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,200
and so I don't think he's talking about travel-sized board games.

224
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,720
Let's assume not.

225
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
No, because that would be not funny.

226
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,520
Can you bring...

227
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,800
Excuse me, excuse me.

228
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
Oh, this is my carry-on.

229
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
It's the board game Monopoly.

230
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,640
On one condition.

231
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,720
Which is?

232
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
If you are traveling alone.

233
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,920
Well, that's...

234
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,280
Who wants to get in on this?

235
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Come on, folks.

236
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,520
I need at least three other players for it to be fun.

237
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,760
Row 18, I know you feel me.

238
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,920
I'll let one of you guys be the top hat.

239
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,160
That would be a little bit cumbersome, I think.

240
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,840
Also, it would be a race against time.

241
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,280
Monopoly's not a great example, I feel like,

242
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,240
because no game in Monopoly has lasted shorter than like six hours.

243
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,880
Yeah, it's good for international flights, though.

244
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,680
It is.

245
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,360
I think one sweet thing would be

246
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,680
is if you get one of the flight attendants into the game

247
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,320
so that you have to ring your buzzer every few minutes

248
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
and bring it back to your chair like,

249
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,360
hey, listen, I don't need a warm towel or a fresh coffee.

250
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,000
I just need you to go ahead and take your turn.

251
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,720
Take your turn.

252
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
Roll them bones.

253
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,000
That's the ballroom.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,800
It's not the ballroom.

255
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,000
It's not the ballroom.

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,120
Well, wait, what am I doing?

257
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,760
This is Clue.

258
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm not supposed to tell you that.

259
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
You know what game would work really well on the plane?

260
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
Connect Four.

261
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,840
Connect Four would be great, Travis.

262
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Yes, great travel game recommendations

263
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,120
from my brother, my brother, and me.

264
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,520
You heard it here first.

265
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,800
It's very vertical.

266
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,760
It's vertical.

267
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,480
It doesn't take up as much room on your tray.

268
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,920
Those pieces aren't going damn anywhere, are they?

269
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,800
They're gonna stay locked.

270
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,280
It's like a little Czechish prison, isn't it?

271
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
Imagine if you were playing like chess

272
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,760
and the person in front of you leaned their chair back

273
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
and ruined the whole game.

274
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah, that's done.

275
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
That's not gonna happen in Connect Four.

276
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
My recommendation would be the hit game Don't Wake Daddy

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
because there's nothing that would bring me more joy

278
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,480
than to be on an airplane and frequently exclaiming,

279
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,320
hey, don't wake daddy.

280
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Everybody keep it down or you're gonna wake daddy.

281
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,280
Don't wake daddy.

282
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,400
Maybe we could play Grape Escape or Crackers in the Bed.

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
What's crackers in the bed?

284
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
I think it's the one where you eat crackers in a fake bed.

285
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,960
All I remember is the title, Frank.

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
That sounds like a sick game.

287
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,240
Knock, knock, knock.

288
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Hi, are you the captain of the flight?

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes, I guess I'm the captain.

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,800
How can I help you?

291
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,600
How did you get in here?

292
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,880
That's not important right now.

293
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,120
Could you please try to keep the flight turbulence free

294
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,560
as you have repeatedly knocked over both the chandelier

295
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,360
and the fireplace trap on my copy of 13 Dead End Drive?

296
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,680
Jesus.

297
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
And we're trying to enjoy a game

298
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,880
of 13 Dead End Drive right here

299
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
and your turbulence is making it nigh impossible.

300
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,680
Me and my nephew are trying to play stack-em-ups.

301
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,960
What is stack-em-ups?

302
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,800
It's like when you go to Target to buy Jenga

303
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,360
but they don't have Jenga so you buy stack-em-ups instead.

304
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
And there's like animal faces on the box.

305
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
Animal faces on the box but on the underside of the box

306
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
there's sex suggestions.

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
Are you playing this with your nephew?

308
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah, we're just, we're not, you're ignoring the sex suggestions.

309
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
They didn't have Jenga, okay?

310
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,160
Maybe you bring on a copy of Operation

311
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,320
and just have like sunglasses so people know,

312
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,920
yeah, you're that kind of guy.

313
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,640
You can play Operation on a flight, no problem.

314
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,080
Added level difficulty.

315
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
No scope that liver.

316
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,800
Reach right in there, pop it out.

317
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
It doesn't matter how much the plane shakes.

318
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
Your hands are rock steady.

319
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,640
You do it staring wistfully out the window.

320
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
Yeah, you don't even need to pay attention.

321
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
That's how good you are at Operation.

322
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,760
I'm flying to Hong Kong on Saturday

323
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,040
and that flight is 16 hours.

324
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,360
Which I'm just gonna round up to a day.

325
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,400
Yeah, 100.

326
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm gonna have a sky day with the air people

327
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,600
and I guess should I bring the Game of Life on board?

328
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,440
I hadn't even considered it as a possibility

329
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,560
but I figure if I'm gonna be on a day on a plane,

330
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
if it's one of those day planes

331
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
that they're gonna give you lots of room

332
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,480
to spread out and do whatever, play board games.

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
Are you doing that Air Emirates?

334
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
Because they give you a shower and stuff in that one.

335
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
No, that would be very sick if that's true.

336
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,480
But I think I'm just doing like American Airlines

337
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,360
or Hong Kong Great Flights.

338
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
No shower in that one.

339
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,320
Just a communal bathtub.

340
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,000
That's fine too.

341
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,400
I can bring my floaties and balance a copy of Risk on it

342
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
or something.

343
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,040
Don't you think it's about time

344
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,360
that we stormed into the offices of Milton Bradley

345
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
and Hasbro and told them,

346
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,400
hey, just because you've been making this beat-ass board game

347
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
for a hundred years doesn't mean you need to keep making it

348
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,360
because it sucks.

349
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,640
Are we talking about Monopoly here?

350
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm talking about Game of Life sucks.

351
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,720
Candy Land, not even a fucking game, it sucks.

352
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,440
Yeah.

353
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
Battleship, that game is horse shit.

354
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah, that game's not very good.

355
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
Candy Land especially, it sucks.

356
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,920
It's not a game.

357
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Fucking crackers in the bed.

358
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,240
No, hey, hardcore gamers agree.

359
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,600
Crackers in the bed is better than real.

360
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Yeah, but you have to keep buying crackers.

361
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
Yeah, well, you gotta get the expansions.

362
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,160
No, they're not expansions, Travis.

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
You gotta get soda crackers.

364
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,560
You gotta get Ritz crackers, the Saltines.

365
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,200
The Saltines expansion, it's rare.

366
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,560
You're just describing crackers that you buy at a store.

367
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,160
Yeah, at a grocery game store.

368
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,640
No, just like it's a grocery store.

369
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
And you can play it with Grape Escape.

370
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
I guess you could play Grape Escape with real grapes,

371
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,040
couldn't you?

372
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Once, and then your board's all soggy and sticky and ruined.

373
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,920
You could play Mousetrap with real mice.

374
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,880
Yeah, sure, you play Operation with a real guy.

375
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,880
No way.

376
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,880
No, go for it.

377
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,680
As long as we're saying dumb shit, cut him in.

378
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,120
Just start cutting on a man.

379
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
Just say whatever dumb shit you want.

380
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,960
Make them, take them to the factory, mash them, smash them.

381
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,920
Now they're history.

382
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
Justin knows the Grape Escape theme song,

383
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,040
so now that's in the show.

384
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,880
Anybody else have anything that they know?

385
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,240
Anybody else have any things they know

386
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
that they just gonna put in our show forever?

387
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
I just don't want to lose it, you know?

388
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,760
Have we tapped the whole board game thing?

389
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,680
We've preserved it in digital amber.

390
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,880
Okay, well, scientists in the future.

391
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
Let me say, does anybody else know any board games

392
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,440
that they can just say, no need for a joke,

393
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,200
as we've already proven many times over

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
in the past five minutes.

395
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,120
Just board games that you'd like to say out loud.

396
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,080
Hero Quest.

397
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,920
Yes, and that's the only one.

398
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Let's move on.

399
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,560
All right, here's another question.

400
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,640
It comes in to us from a listener of our show.

401
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,560
If you'd like to send in one, you can send it to

402
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,400
mbmbam at maximumfun.org.

403
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,200
Here's the question.

404
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,040
God, I feel like shit.

405
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,580
Woof.

406
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah.

407
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,840
Shake them off.

408
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
Shake it off.

409
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
My husband and I are from different parts of the country.

410
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Him, Midwest.

411
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,920
Me, Southeast.

412
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,280
And I find some of their food.

413
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,400
We're at war.

414
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
Yeah, I find some of their food nasty.

415
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
The Midwest.

416
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,400
Excuse me?

417
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Some of my in-laws come to see us for a holiday meal

418
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
and I'm wondering, am I supposed to make some

419
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,040
of their traditional stuff, even though it's gross?

420
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,320
Or since they're in my house, is this a you-get-what-you-get

421
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,960
situation?

422
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,160
That's from Steamed vs. Fried in Tennessee.

423
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,560
How could you ask this question and not send some, like,

424
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,600
concrete examples?

425
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,100
Yes?

426
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,600
Are you talking about, like, a deep dish za?

428
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,800
You talking about that Cincinnati chili?

429
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,520
What are you talking about?

430
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
No, never make Cincinnati chili, ever.

431
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,040
It's an abomination.

432
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,600
Are they talking, like, maybe, like,

433
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
like, potato salad?

434
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
Like, what is the Midwest have?

435
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,480
Maybe, maybe it's something like, um, you know,

436
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,640
your sweet potato casserole with the multicolored

437
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
marshmallows on top.

438
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
I don't have anything against that, mind you,

439
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,680
but I can see where that might be off-putting to outsiders.

440
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,880
What the fuck?

441
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
Can I, can I ask a question?

442
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,360
What the fuck is so great about Southeast food?

443
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
What do you got, what do you got crackle-ackin' in Florida?

444
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,960
Oranges?

445
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,000
Is that all you subsist on?

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,280
Chocodiles?

447
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,680
Chocodiles and oranges, is that it?

448
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,880
Key lime pie?

449
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,520
Key lime pie?

450
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,480
That's not a healthy diet.

451
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
You've just named three sweet things.

452
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,840
I don't know what's in the mid-

453
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Like, can we clarify this for me?

454
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,720
What is the Midwest?

455
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,840
I think the Midwest is everything that's not New York,

456
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,280
California, and Florida.

457
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,080
Okay, got it.

458
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,280
Now, what's the Southeast?

459
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,440
Just Winston, Salem, and surrounding areas, right?

460
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,560
Okay, that can't be right.

461
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
Texas is like the South-South.

462
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,760
Incorrect.

463
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,280
I, I think here's what you have to do.

464
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,240
I think you need to

465
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,600
to check in with your husband's family.

466
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
So let's, let's put this in context

467
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
and say it's like Thanksgiving, right?

468
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,560
Talk to your husband or to your in-laws and say,

469
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,160
what are like three dishes that if you don't have

470
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,560
will feel like an incomplete Thanksgiving?

471
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,480
I don't think you need to like recreate

472
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,560
their Thanksgiving whole cloth.

473
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,320
I think that you just have to say like,

474
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,800
you know, maybe like they always have green bean casserole

475
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,320
and if there's no green bean casserole,

476
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
it just doesn't feel like Thanksgiving?

477
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,520
Well, in that case, yes,

478
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
you should have green bean casserole.

479
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,240
When my in-laws came in town for Thanksgiving last year

480
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
and Rachel and I cooked for them,

481
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
I was like, welcome to, welcome to my house.

482
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
Welcome to Aaron's party.

483
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,280
And I did, I did them, I did them what I wanted

484
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,880
and then they liked it all very much because I was right.

485
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,520
Like the food I like is just right.

486
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,680
There is a, there is a distinction here, I think,

487
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,400
between like, you can get away with, at holiday time,

488
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,800
I think a lot of people can get away with like bad food

489
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,320
that they traditionally eat around this time of year

490
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,120
and it is appropriate and okay.

491
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,400
Like I would say if you just make good food

492
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
that tastes very good,

493
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,760
I don't think anybody's gonna grouse.

494
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,080
Like maybe you do wanna throw in a couple of their favorites

495
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,880
just as like pay homage and tribute.

496
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,840
You don't have to eat them.

497
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,680
But serve them, serve them in like a grody plastic cup.

498
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,720
Just so they- Like a dog bowl.

499
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
Yeah, just, no, not that blatant,

500
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,360
but like a fucking- Solo cup.

501
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,400
Like a men in black two commemorative plastic cup

502
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
you got from Burger King.

503
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,800
Also, listen, there's so,

504
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
like the internet is such a great resource

505
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,560
to find a recipe that you like for a dish that they like

506
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,280
where you can be like, oh, here's an iteration of it

507
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,960
that doesn't sound disgusting to me.

508
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,200
So I'll make this version of, you know, potatoes au gratin

509
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
that they'll like because it's that,

510
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,400
but I like it because the ingredients sound good to me.

511
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,280
There are things like, I'll give you guys an example.

512
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,400
Around every Thanksgiving, not around,

513
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,960
on every Thanksgiving, I forced- Somewhere near it.

514
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,560
I forced Sydney to make my mom's sweet potato casserole.

515
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,240
Because it's the best.

516
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Okay, it is the best, it is amazing, right?

517
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,200
Okay, let me just pump the brakes here for a second, guys.

518
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
Guys, do you eat this casserole any other day of the year?

519
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,320
No.

520
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Well, I mean, the following Friday and Saturday.

521
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah, Friday and Saturday, it's like dope.

522
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
You reheated it, it's dope.

523
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,240
We'll post the recipe for our mom's sweet potato casserole

524
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,880
on the, somewhere, on the Facebook maybe.

525
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,080
But anyway, we don't eat it any other time of year, right?

526
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,160
Why is that, do you think?

527
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,000
Like, I really like it.

528
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,520
I never think to myself, I'm gonna eat this.

529
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,760
I have to assume it's because it's like a special occasion.

530
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,000
I like, I don't have birthday cake on random Wednesdays.

531
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
I guess, yeah, but like, if you really liked it,

532
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,640
why wouldn't you want it to eat at other times of the year?

533
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,120
Well, it's only because if it's the middle of June,

534
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,240
or even late June, and someone sees you eating

535
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,840
a Christmas ham, you'll be asked to leave the town

536
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,960
that you're in.

537
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
You'll be literally run out of town.

538
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
That's in the Old Town Charter.

539
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Yeah, no Christmas hams in June.

540
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,360
You know, it's a little bit of that special occasion thing.

541
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,920
But you know what?

542
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,600
Also, I will say this question, Asger.

543
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,960
When you get married, and like, there starts to be

544
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,760
that like mixing of like family traditions and stuff,

545
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,080
it's all about like, what's our holiday now?

546
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,680
Like, what's our event going to be?

547
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,400
Not what was it when you were 13, but what is it now

548
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,480
that we're forming our own family?

549
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,280
You know what I mean?

550
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,840
And so this is a great time, especially if you're hosting it

551
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,520
for the first time, to maybe try out some new stuff,

552
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,400
and maybe be like, this is a thing we're gonna have

553
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,840
every year now, if you like it.

554
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,400
If you don't like it, we never have it again,

555
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,720
because it's very flexible and valuable,

556
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,920
and we can do whatever we want.

557
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,640
That's fine and all, but the first time their in-laws

558
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,680
come in town, it's like, where's the creamy ham salad?

559
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,080
And you're like, oh no, no, we're doing our own thing.

560
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
You'll be asked to leave the town.

561
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,040
Because you've disappointed your in-laws so desperately.

562
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
And then you have to move.

563
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
You gotta make that creamy ham salad.

564
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,080
Here's the recipe.

565
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,280
You gotta go out there and you gotta get sour cream.

566
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,720
The good stuff.

567
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
No wait, the bad stuff.

568
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,040
The cheapest, grossest sour cream you can find.

569
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,080
I'm talking about 14 ounces of standing water

570
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,640
on top of this piece of shit when you open the tub.

571
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
And then you're gonna wanna get some ham.

572
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
Again, this time actually you wanna splurge a little bit.

573
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,000
Mix them all up, throw in a little bit of leaves,

574
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,760
up to you which kind, my man,

575
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,480
and then put it right there on the table,

576
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,680
and serve it with chopsticks in the traditional eating style.

577
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,560
Sydney's grandmother makes this thing

578
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,240
every Christmas Eve called frozen salad.

579
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,640
And I hate it if I don't like to eat it with my mouth,

580
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,600
but if it wasn't there, but every year I'm like,

581
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,960
hell yeah, there it is.

582
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
What's up, y'all?

583
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,640
What's up, y'all?

584
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,320
I feel comforted by its presence.

585
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,440
What's up, y'all son of a bitch?

586
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,880
Of course I'm gonna get a slice of you.

587
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,360
Frozen salad, you cold son of a bitch?

588
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,000
Get in here.

589
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,240
Just like a one sentence description of frozen salad.

590
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
No, no, no, no, I'm actually gonna demand

591
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,960
that you do not tell us what frozen salad is

592
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
because you just said the words,

593
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
let me have a slice of salad,

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,840
and science PSA from your old buddy Professor Griffin,

595
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
salad should not be served in slice form.

596
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,200
Frozen salad, you see.

597
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
Let's go to the money's up.

598
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,560
Gmod Jody, if you're listening, I'm into frozen salad.

599
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,320
Gmod Jody, really looking forward to it.

600
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
Highlight of the holidays.

601
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,920
You're gonna crush it this time, I feel it.

602
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,520
Let's go to the money's up.

603
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Let's go to the money's up.

604
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,120
My Brother, My Brother, Me is supported in part by harrys.com.

605
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,480
You guys doing Movember?

606
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,960
I mean, I've got a full beard all the time.

607
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,200
I've already shaved, it looks bad, dirty face.

608
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,480
I'm gonna donate to Movember, I did Movember once

609
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,680
and it was the year that I met my,

610
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,040
it was actually over Thanksgiving,

611
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,000
it was Thanksgiving, I met my in-laws

612
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,640
and my father-in-law has this amazing mustache

613
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,120
and I was afraid that he thought I was making fun of him

614
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,160
with my really bad mustache, I wasn't.

615
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,480
That is a long con to make fun of someone.

616
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,720
I grew a mustache for three weeks, get it?

617
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,320
I grew a parody mustache.

618
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
But we were just meeting and it could have been

619
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,520
a power move, I don't know.

620
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,120
Anyway, the official partner of the Movember Foundation

621
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,360
is Harry's and they're gonna be donating money

622
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,600
to help raise awareness for men's health.

623
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Harry's starter set is $15 and it includes a razor,

624
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,560
foaming shave gel or shave cream and three razor blades

625
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,320
plus free shipping.

626
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,080
You can go to harrys.com for the $5 off the starter set

627
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
with the code MYBROTHER, all one word.

628
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,040
You take that $15, you're gonna cut a third off of it

629
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,960
for just 10 bucks.

630
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,920
You can get the razor, the foaming shave gel and three blades.

631
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,560
Start shaving better today, you are really going to enjoy

632
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,000
the Harry's shaving experience, I can guarantee you of that.

633
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,240
And men, don't forget to get your prostate checked.

634
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,240
While we're at it.

635
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,000
While we're at it, get up in there.

636
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,160
There's no, it's never too early.

637
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,920
Get your walnut checked out.

638
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,840
Scope that nut.

639
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,960
You wear underwear every day?

640
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,800
Sometimes. Mostly?

641
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,080
Mianis understands that and that's why they're dedicated

642
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
to creating the world's most comfortable underwear.

643
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,640
Well, I want them to sell me on the concept

644
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,240
of even wearing the stuff.

645
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
It's just like double pants.

646
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,000
Yesterday I did not wear underwear,

647
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,360
it would have just been an impediment.

648
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,500
Yeah.

649
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
You wore your long johns with the flap on the butt.

650
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah, my supernatural pants, I call them.

651
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,480
And a dog, a dog ran into the house

652
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,680
and tore off the butt part of your supernatural pants.

653
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,240
And damn if he didn't steal my roast beef.

654
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,200
I spent all weekend making that damn mutt.

655
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,040
Get him out of here.

656
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,540
Muffins?

657
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,760
Tore my vest long johns, stole my roast beef.

658
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,720
Had to put him down.

659
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,840
Hate that dog.

660
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,200
What am I supposed to snack on during my binge sessions

661
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
of the supernatural?

662
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,960
What am I supposed to even wear?

663
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
If you need something to wear underneath your best long johns,

664
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
Mianis has tons of colors and styles.

665
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,080
And it's the only place to get matching pairs

666
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,520
for men and women.

667
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
Plus we all know paying for shipping sucks.

668
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,880
So Mianis has removed that from the equation.

669
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,880
All orders to the US and Canada ship for free.

670
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,160
Now to sweeten the deal,

671
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,680
Mianis is offering you 20% off your first order

672
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,040
at mianis.com slash my brother.

673
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,720
That's M-E-N-D-I-S.com slash my brother.

674
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,960
I got a message here.

675
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,600
Can I read it?

676
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,480
Yes.

677
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,480
It's from Sarah, AKA Chuggs.

678
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,720
That's C-H Chuggs.

679
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
And it's to Derek.

680
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,600
And Chuggs says to Derek,

681
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,400
thanks for being the best friend a girl could ever ask for.

682
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
Between doing incredibly sweet things

683
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,160
like cooking me gourmet meals while I relax

684
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,600
and listen to my bim bam

685
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
and tolerating my insane family,

686
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
you're pretty much perfect.

687
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,720
Here's to having the best summer ever.

688
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,720
2016, I hope.

689
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,120
Hootie hoo, big D.

690
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Hootie hoo.

691
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
Hootie hoo indeed.

692
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,440
I feel like the inflection on that is like,

693
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
because of the repetition,

694
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,640
it's a little more somber and purposeful.

695
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,000
Like, hootie hoo, big D, hootie hoo.

696
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,560
Hootie hoo.

697
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Is that like what Carla said on Top Chef?

698
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,040
What?

699
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,360
Carla on Top Chef?

700
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,040
This next message.

701
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,400
Carla on Top Chef had this thing-

702
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
Griffin, can you say, uh,

703
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Carla on Top Chef one more time?

704
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,240
Yeah.

705
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,960
I'm pretty-

706
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,000
Just to be clear,

707
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,240
pretty sure they're referencing the Outkast tune,

708
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,800
Hootie Hoo.

709
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,480
Oh, it could be what Carla said in Top Chef,

710
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,080
because she had a system worked out

711
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,000
where if she ever got separated from her husband

712
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,040
in a grocery store,

713
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,560
she would just go, hootie hoo.

714
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,160
And then he would yell, hootie hoo.

715
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,760
And they would find each other like that.

716
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,240
Like, like married echolocation.

717
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,440
I really like that.

718
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,120
Just food for thought, ponder on it.

719
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Think about your own catchphrases

720
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,640
that you can use to find your lost husband

721
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,440
in a grocery store.

722
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,840
This next message is for the McElroy-

723
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,400
or sorry.

724
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
This next message is for the brothers McElroy.

725
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,520
It is from Lieutenant Randolph and Dr. Claw.

726
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,400
Happy birthday to the three brothers McElroy.

727
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,720
Nice, nice.

728
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
Since this day has so much fanfare,

729
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,760
it was also chosen to be our wedding date last year.

730
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,200
Like NBNB AM,

731
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,800
we had a great sharing of wisdom among friends and family.

732
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,080
And like NBNB AM,

733
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,920
it was one of the best things in my life.

734
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Keep it up guys,

735
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,560
and we'll see Travis in LA.

736
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,000
What?

737
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,120
Watch out.

738
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,000
You will?

739
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
Keep your eyes peeled, motherfucker.

740
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
Yeah, we didn't even talk about-

741
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,480
Well, I guess we did talk about

742
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,920
how it was Justin's shit birthday.

743
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,920
And my awesome birthday.

744
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,160
Yeah, and I had a great birthday.

745
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,000
I went and did karaoke.

746
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,760
And now I'm playing Fallout 4.

747
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
I ate a bunch of steak.

748
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
Daddy mailed me a little present.

749
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,200
He what?

750
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
Daddy mailed me a little present

751
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,400
just so I didn't feel left out.

752
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,320
Oh, that's nice.

753
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,400
Yeah, it's a little Hulk toy

754
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,920
from the Avengers.

755
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,440
It's like a little Hulk toy.

756
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
And he squeezes legs together

757
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,800
and he flexes his big old muscles

758
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,280
and he goes,

759
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,800
happy birthday, Griffin.

760
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,440
Let's be honest,

761
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,880
we live in a world with too much media.

762
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
You need a podcast on the front lines

763
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,320
figuring out what's great.

764
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,280
We're here for you.

765
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,240
We're Pop Rocket.

766
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,440
I am Guy Branham.

767
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,640
I'm a comedian.

768
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

769
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,360
I call myself a digital strategist.

770
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
I'm Oliver Wang,

771
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
academic and disc junkie.

772
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,200
Margaret Wappler,

773
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,480
je suis es journalist.

774
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,040
And we watch, listen to,

775
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,840
and read everything

776
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,200
so that you don't have to.

777
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,560
And then we tell you about all the things

778
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,840
that you'll love to love.

779
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
Find us in iTunes

780
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
or wherever you download podcasts.

781
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,520
Pop Rocket,

782
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

783
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,800
Some classmates of mine recently-

784
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,200
You guys want to Yahoo?

785
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
Actually do Yahoo?

786
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,000
That's what I was going to say.

787
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,500
Sorry.

788
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,280
Do you even want to keep doing Yahoo's

789
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,080
in the show anymore?

790
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,200
Like, do you want to stop doing them?

791
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,360
Well, that is another part of the flavor

792
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,440
that's been chomped so severely.

793
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,120
I'm wondering if we need to move on.

794
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,240
That one doesn't bother me.

795
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,880
We didn't like-

796
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,120
We didn't invent Yahoo's are dumb.

797
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,560
Some people are sending us messages.

798
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,840
It's like, I didn't program Yahoo Answers

799
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,520
and get like a grassroots effort

800
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
to build its user base.

801
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,040
Yeah, but like a lot of people

802
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
are tapping that Yahoo Answers.

803
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,840
That is, that is true.

804
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Sent in by Zoe Kinski,

805
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,640
climbing that ladder.

806
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,360
Thank you, Zoe.

807
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

808
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,760
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

809
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,800
We're just going to maybe refresh the page,

810
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,120
see if data might populate.

811
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,640
We'll see if this string,

812
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,920
this text field, no.

813
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,360
We're going to call him Ranald,

814
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,560
which is like Ronald,

815
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,400
but different, Ranald.

816
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,280
But more active.

817
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,160
Ranald asks,

818
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,320
how to convert sexual energy

819
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
into sporting and athletic prowess.

820
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,200
I've read that everyone

821
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,600
is really just sexual energy.

822
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Correct?

823
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,040
Yeah.

824
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
Just sexual protons and electrons

825
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
just bounce off each other,

826
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,200
generating electricity and stuff.

827
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,880
I've read that everyone

828
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,080
is really just sexual energy.

829
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,280
I have lots of it

830
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
and a really high sex drive.

831
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,360
Wow.

832
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,960
And I want to convert the energy

833
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,680
so I can use it

834
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,160
in my non-sexual physical endeavors.

835
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,840
I do realize that when I'm horny,

836
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,080
I seem filled with a lot of raging energy.

837
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,160
You wouldn't like me when I'm horny.

838
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
I seem filled with a lot of raging energy,

839
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,120
but it's not there when I'm not.

840
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,320
How do I control and use

841
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,240
my massive sexual energy

842
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,080
so I can be a super athlete?

843
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
Oh, Ranald, you have to be so careful.

844
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,880
You gotta be careful, Ranald.

845
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,280
If you channel too much sexual energy,

846
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,040
like, say, onto the basketball court,

847
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,920
you are going to be getting

848
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,840
personal fouls left and right.

849
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,680
Yeah, against the audience.

850
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Extremely personal fouls.

851
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,000
Against the viewers and the referees.

852
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,280
Against decency.

853
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,600
Against basketball shorts manufacturers.

854
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,360
No, okay.

855
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,640
I rarely defend Yahoo Answers questions.

856
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,720
But I get where a stupid person...

857
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,160
No, think about, like,

858
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,840
it's pretty common parlance

859
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,280
when you hear, like, the boxers

860
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,040
that, like, they won't sleep

861
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,400
with their wives before the fight

862
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,680
or their girlfriends before the fight

863
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,800
because they want to, like,

864
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,240
save it all for the ring.

865
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,600
That always confuses...

866
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,520
Save all that dude juice?

867
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,080
Right?

868
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,120
But just that idea of, like,

869
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,720
no, not before the fight.

870
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,360
Really?

871
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,760
Really?

872
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
What are you going to do in that fight?

873
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,180
Yeah.

874
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,840
Boy, will he be surprised.

875
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,120
All it takes at boxing,

876
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,640
you just mentioned the beautiful sport.

877
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,240
It's a game of, you know,

878
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
that takes place in those fractions

879
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,280
of hundreds of seconds.

880
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,360
And you got to, like,

881
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,640
they catch them off guard

882
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,920
and you get that good hook in.

883
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,920
And nothing's going to catch you off guard

884
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,120
like a fucking raging hog

885
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,560
inside billowy shorts with your name on it.

886
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,640
I think the key here is to just...

887
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,960
You got to do a little bit of, like,

888
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,840
like a fantasy projection,

889
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,760
the secret mnemonic device kind of thing

890
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,040
where if you're...

891
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,520
Let's say you're on the track at the meet

892
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
and you got to run a hundred meter dash

893
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,560
at...

894
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,080
You just got to, like,

895
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,160
keep telling yourself or pretend

896
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,400
that at the end of that a hundred meters,

897
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,640
there's a big old slice of juicy butt

898
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,360
waiting for you.

899
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,760
Yeah.

900
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,880
You'll be able to carve...

901
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,560
Like, if you're getting a touchdown

902
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,600
and you got the ball,

903
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
you just got to pretend like you're running

904
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,560
to slam it into a big old slice of juicy butt.

905
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:34,800
Yeah.

906
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,320
And you can do that with pretty much anything.

907
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,640
You can slam a basketball into a big,

908
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,760
juicy butt, you know?

909
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,400
Yeah, for sure.

910
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
It is important when you get that touchdown

911
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,080
that you then instantly remind yourself

912
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,240
that there is no juicy butt there.

913
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,120
Well, no, that's right.

914
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,640
You might get an excessive celebration.

915
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,120
That's why most touchdown dances

916
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,920
that people do

917
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,600
is actually just them looking for the butt.

918
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,240
Where's the butt?

919
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,720
Where is it?

920
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,120
Oh, he's left into the crowd.

921
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,680
Oh my God.

922
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,080
Oh my God, that's that Lambo leap.

923
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,680
That's that Lambo leap, my package.

924
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,720
More like Lamboner.

925
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,440
Yeah, got it.

926
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,680
It's just looking for butt anywhere you can find it.

927
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,840
You actually shouldn't-

928
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,280
Just prowling the crowd.

929
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,200
And that's why after most touchdown dances,

930
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,960
most sports athletes look so disappointed.

931
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,400
And then they have to cut the commercial instantly.

932
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:18,640
Yeah.

933
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:18,800
Yeah.

934
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,440
You actually shouldn't break the spell

935
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,640
until the game's over.

936
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
So like, after you get a touchdown,

937
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,840
you have to try to tell yourself

938
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,960
the enemy team is trying to put their ball

939
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,400
into your butt.

940
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,280
Not your own butt,

941
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,400
but your butt that you own.

942
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,200
Your metaphorical butt.

943
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,240
Your metaphorical butt.

944
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,400
The juicy butt that you own yourself.

945
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,240
And so you got to defend the butt.

946
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,720
And then-

947
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,040
Oh.

948
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,440
So like an offensive lineman.

949
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,000
To them, the quarterback is the butt.

950
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,120
And they have to defend,

951
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,880
oh, we will defend this butt.

952
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,240
And that's why they dump the Colt Gatorade on a coach

953
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,920
who has the most sexual energy.

954
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh yeah.

955
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,160
Because they're trying to kill their boner.

956
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,800
Hey dude, fucking cool it, okay?

957
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,920
Okay.

958
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,040
Coach, we get it.

959
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,120
That's why everybody slaps each other's butts.

960
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,440
Yeah.

961
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:01,920
So I guess-

962
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,040
Hey, you got the butt today.

963
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
If you're a defender then,

964
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,680
and you're rushing in to get a sack,

965
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,600
that must be instant gratification

966
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,200
because that quarterback looks like a big old butt.

967
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
You just go diving right into it.

968
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,000
Griffin, are you just quoting Denzel Washington's speech

969
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,040
from Remember the Titans?

970
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
You guys ever see somebody who's really good at curling?

971
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,720
In their mind, they're using a giant brush

972
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,680
to just polish up the juiciest slab of butt they can find.

973
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,960
Oh my God, the whole sport takes place on a big frozen butt?

974
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,160
It's all on a big butt

975
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,440
and they're just polishing up the butt

976
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,880
and they're thinking later on,

977
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,600
I'm gonna grab a fork and dig into this butt,

978
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,520
but not until I get it perfectly polished.

979
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,880
Oops, perfect score, 20 points.

980
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,640
That's why every NASCAR racer,

981
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,440
if you actually, most of the windows are fully tinted

982
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,640
so you can't see inside the car

983
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,680
because if you did,

984
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,760
you would see hanging from the rear view mirror

985
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,720
is like a novelty plushy butt.

986
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,480
And that's the carrot.

987
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,760
And the drivers get confused, yeah,

988
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,280
and they think, oh, I'm so close.

989
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
They'll never get it though.

990
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,800
They'll never get that butt.

991
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,880
Well, that's, I mean, that's the sad truth.

992
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,760
You know what I mean?

993
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,360
Yeah, they never do.

994
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,680
They never get that butt, it's never worth it.

995
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,200
It's so sad that our successful professional athletes

996
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,800
never have sex with anybody.

997
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,000
In olden times with car racing,

998
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,200
they used to have a butt on like a stick

999
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,800
that ran around the track

1000
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,240
that people would just put on the brakes.

1001
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,520
Now they have a HUD,

1002
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,840
an electronic HUD AR display

1003
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,080
to project a butt onto the windshield.

1004
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,600
And all of this is why Wilt Chamberlain

1005
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,200
was so bad at basketball.

1006
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
Right, because he had to wear Google Glass

1007
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,600
with a picture of a butt on it.

1008
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,800
And he just used it all up.

1009
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,680
And he used it all up.

1010
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,920
It's just, you know, the original name of football,

1011
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,480
what they used to call it was Tumbling Cut Golds.

1012
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,720
I didn't know that, something I didn't know.

1013
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,000
Some classmates of mine recently informed me

1014
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,080
that I overused the phrase, oh geez,

1015
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,520
whenever I'm surprised by anything.

1016
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,200
This is really weird to me

1017
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
because I've heard them all say it before

1018
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,640
until they let me know they're only saying it

1019
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,600
because they're making fun of me.

1020
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,960
Oh no.

1021
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,840
That's a good look.

1022
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,360
Since then, everyone I've asked-

1023
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,480
How do I get new friends?

1024
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,280
It is something that only I say.

1025
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Is oh geez an okay catchphrase to have

1026
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,120
or should I try to replace it with something else?

1027
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,440
That's from Need a New Catchphrase in New York.

1028
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,360
I'll point out to the listener at home

1029
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,960
because they will not be privy to this information

1030
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,840
that the question asker has spelled geez

1031
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,160
two different ways in this email,

1032
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,680
which makes me think that it's not something

1033
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,680
they use in written correspondence all that often.

1034
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,120
Or more of a vocal thing.

1035
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,400
Potentially, in that last sentence,

1036
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,520
they could be asking,

1037
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,840
because they spelled it G-E-E-Z,

1038
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,720
if it's okay if they change it to oh geez.

1039
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,760
Oh geez.

1040
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,280
I like it.

1041
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,080
It's endearing.

1042
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,160
But then again, I imagine by the time

1043
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,200
we reach the end of this bit,

1044
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,040
and we've said it two dozen times,

1045
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,800
I will not find it endearing.

1046
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,240
I think that you should do your...

1047
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,080
I think it's okay to have little quirks like this.

1048
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,040
I think it's okay.

1049
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,480
Especially, you know what I like about it

1050
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,600
is that it wasn't forced.

1051
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,800
It wasn't something you decided,

1052
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,240
hey, I'm gonna start saying this.

1053
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,920
It just sort of wormed its way into your pattern.

1054
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,280
You know what the problem is?

1055
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,440
And your friends took this away from you.

1056
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,560
Your innocence.

1057
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,200
Because now, the next year when you say oh geez,

1058
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,280
you'll click in your head.

1059
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,720
You'll hear it and be like, I'm sorry.

1060
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,800
That's what happened when Justin told me,

1061
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,640
I say, let me throw this out too much.

1062
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,320
You ruined it for me for a solid year.

1063
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,920
I'm back on it now.

1064
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,800
Other people will have to...

1065
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,120
If I wasn't defending our listeners

1066
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,560
from having to hear you say it all the time,

1067
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,720
if it was just casual conversation between the two of us,

1068
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,400
I would not have pointed it out.

1069
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,960
I appreciate that.

1070
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,880
We put out professional radio broadcast.

1071
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,320
People hear this?

1072
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,400
Can I ask you guys a question?

1073
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,400
I think nobody used catchphrases

1074
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,920
for like a wicked long time.

1075
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,640
Did Charlie Sheen sort of kick this whole thing off?

1076
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,480
Yes, Charlie Sheen started catchphrases.

1077
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,120
No, no, no, no, no.

1078
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,620
I'm not saying...

1079
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,600
Charlie Sheen, I'm not talking about Charlie Sheen

1080
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,360
on his hit show, Taftman.

1081
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,320
I'm talking about Charlie Sheen in life

1082
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,400
when he started saying winning about himself,

1083
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,240
and then like other people started saying winning,

1084
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,520
and then they stopped pretty quickly.

1085
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,680
But I think that planted the seeds in everyone's minds

1086
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,240
of just like, you can just say a word

1087
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,760
and have that sort of be your whole thing.

1088
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,200
And then you can put it on, you know,

1089
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
shirts and sell it and make money and stuff like that.

1090
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,000
And I feel like people didn't do this

1091
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,600
for like a really long time.

1092
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,280
Maybe back in the 30s they did, right?

1093
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,360
And it'd be like, show you for the haircut.

1094
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,640
Try to say hello.

1095
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,080
Yeah, and people would be like,

1096
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,400
ha ha, good one, Charles.

1097
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,920
I'm just confused.

1098
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,120
Charles Sheen, senior.

1099
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,040
Charles Sheen, senior, senior, senior.

1100
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,800
Because that was the name

1101
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,280
of the great, great, great grandfather of that family.

1102
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,080
Not Estevez.

1103
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,800
You know what I mean, though?

1104
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,680
Is there anything here?

1105
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,080
Is this something?

1106
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,960
Is this something?

1107
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,760
I think that it's hard to...

1108
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,520
It's hard to catch these, right?

1109
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
And like, it's hard to notice them

1110
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,120
warming their way into your speech patterns

1111
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,800
because people probably aren't calling you on it.

1112
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,960
I think that, you know, if this bothers you,

1113
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,680
if it bothers you that you say, oh geez,

1114
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,640
feel free to correct it.

1115
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,920
But I don't think it bothered you

1116
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,560
because you were saying it and just like living your life.

1117
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,840
Well, and here's the problem.

1118
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,080
Here's where I think the catch is.

1119
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,200
If you have a catchphrase,

1120
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,280
it's like you burst into a party, right?

1121
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,960
And you're like, the party's here, right?

1122
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,800
Nobody cheers and it's awesome, right?

1123
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,160
That's your catchphrase and you walk in.

1124
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,680
Versus what this sounds like,

1125
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,560
which is like a vocal tick where it's like,

1126
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,560
you know, something happens in your immediate reaction

1127
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,480
without thinking it's, oh geez, oh geez,

1128
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,560
oh geez, oh geez, right?

1129
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,080
Then you're not in control of it.

1130
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,840
I just hit that point, by the way, where I hate it.

1131
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,800
Yeah.

1132
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
Where I could see where that would be a little bit

1133
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,120
like disconcerting when you say it

1134
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,240
and someone's like, you just said it.

1135
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,200
And you're like, oh, did I?

1136
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,360
Oh, I didn't even realize I did.

1137
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,440
That can be off-putting.

1138
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,240
I had this with Hachi Machi for a while.

1139
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,600
Yeah, you sure did.

1140
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,760
Hachi Machi, of course, is an expression

1141
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,520
from the, I'll use the word failed.

1142
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,280
I guess it had a couple seasons,

1143
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,760
but John Lovitz's program, The Critic,

1144
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,760
it was something that The Critic said, Hachi Machi.

1145
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,280
It began as a reference to that hit series.

1146
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,920
And at some point, it just sort of like got out of control

1147
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,520
and then people would say Hachi Machi to me.

1148
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,640
And I still think it's a pretty good thing to say,

1149
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,120
but I definitely think I started leaning on it too much.

1150
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,560
Our dear listeners will remember

1151
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,760
when I, for like maybe two and a half years,

1152
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,880
I couldn't go five minutes without just yelling,

1153
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,680
get that dick.

1154
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,160
And that was sort of like my personal brand.

1155
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,280
I'll go ahead and call them what they were,

1156
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,800
which is brand cuffs.

1157
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
I just wanna say I'm very proud

1158
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,960
and I hope our listeners are proud of me

1159
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,920
in that I have done really well

1160
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,640
at following my New Year's resolution

1161
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,960
of not throwing it off to Luda as much.

1162
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,400
It's been a long time since I did it not on purpose.

1163
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,240
Yeah, well, and then there was that one time

1164
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,920
that we were at a party and Luda was there

1165
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,280
and you started to tell a story

1166
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,640
and then he started to tell a story

1167
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,520
like in the middle of your story

1168
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,480
and you were like, oh no, please, Ludacris, go ahead.

1169
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:16,980
Yeah.

1170
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,720
Continue, Ludacris.

1171
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,840
Please, Ludacris, go ahead and do me.

1172
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,880
No, but you tell it better.

1173
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,120
Yeah, yeah.

1174
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,760
You tell it better, Ludacris.

1175
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,720
No, you were there.

1176
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,480
Like you were on set with Paul.

1177
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,080
So you go ahead.

1178
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,920
No, you do it now, please.

1179
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,280
I just read it on IMDB.

1180
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,920
I wasn't there firsthand, please.

1181
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,800
Secondhand story.

1182
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,680
Luda tells it best.

1183
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,120
He does, ugh.

1184
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,480
And he does the voices and like jumps back and forth.

1185
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,920
Like he's doing an H-I-D-I.

1186
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,760
You know, he's like jumping left and right

1187
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,880
and talking to himself.

1188
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,640
And his The Rock is spot on.

1189
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,720
It's better than The Rock.

1190
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, so head on over.

1191
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He's more The Rock than The Rock at this point.

1192
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,680
Head on over to maxfundstore.com

1193
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,880

00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,200
Should we wrap?

1196
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,160
Yeah, we should.

1197
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Yeah, folks, that's gonna do it for us

1198
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,480
on this issue of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

1199
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,280
a magazine apparently that we print.

1200
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,240
Our zine.

1201
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,880
Our zine.

1202
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,120
Thank you so much for joining us.

1203
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,200
We didn't do our feature on Bernie Sanders

1204
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,840
and his campaign period.

1205
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,520
Burning it to the streets.

1206
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,640
But we will have a lot more fun

1207
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,560
and frivolity for you next time.

1208
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,840
So we hope you'll join us again.

1209
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,040
And we do wanna say thanks again to MeUndies.

1210
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,520
You can go to meundies.com slash my brother

1211
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,680
and to get 20% off your first order

1212

1213
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,160
Oh my God.

1214
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,720
I wanna say some quick thank yous

1215
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,000
to people who have sent us things

1216
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,760
to the East Coast My Brother, My Brother, Me post.po box.

1217
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,920
Kyle sent us a lovely postcard.

1218
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,360
Sarah sent us a graduation notice.

1219
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,800
Robert sent us a graduation notice.

1220
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,360
We gotta save the date from Kristy and Eric.

1221
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,080
Sailor Steve sent us a postcard.

1222
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,320
Adam and Shelley Evsons sent a lovely postcard.

1223
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,000
Dane and Sean sent us some Sheetz cards

1224
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,560
from my YouTube show, Things I Bought at Sheetz.

1225
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,240
Kelsey slash Borf, that's her D and D name,

1226
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,560
sent us a ghost horse book.

1227
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,680
Donna sent us some lovely socks and stickers.

1228
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,520
Remind me to get those socks to you guys.

1229
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,400
They're from the UK, very continental.

1230
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
And Brittany sent me a bunch of crunchy bars

1231
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,720
which are Canadian, I think,

1232
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,960
and have sea foam wrapped in chocolate.

1233
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,480
And they were very delicious and I enjoy them very much.

1234
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,320
So thank you to all of you.

1235
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,880
And what is that P.O. box, Justin,

1236
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,760
in case anybody wants to send you something?

1237
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,880
P.O. box 54, Huntington Woods, Virginia, 25706.

1238
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,840
Oh, and to whoever subscribed that box

1239
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,640
to Western Horseman Magazine, go fuck yourself.

1240
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,280
It's always full, and I hate you.

1241
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,680
It's always full of eight issues of it

1242
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,280
and I have to throw it directly into the car by.

1243
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,880
An hourly magazine?

1244
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,440
Like my brother, my brother, me,

1245
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,200
it's a weekly magazine release.

1246
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Oh shit, that's amazing.

1247
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,200
And if you would like to send anything

1248
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,520
to the West Coast box, it is P.O. box 341769,

1249
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,560
Los Angeles, California 90034.

1250
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,480
Subscribe his ass to Western Horseman.

1251
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,520
I would love that.

1252
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
I don't own a P.O. box for this specific reason.

1253
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,640
I'm gonna actually say, if you're hearing this,

1254
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,680
hopefully we'll get it out today on Tuesday.

1255
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,560
Please send in questions, and Yahoo's,

1256
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,920
if you usually do, don't wait,

1257
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,840
because we have to record another episode

1258
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,640
sometime in the next 72 hours,

1259
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,560
because I'm leaving town for like 10 days

1260
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,600
and we have to get one in,

1261
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,680
and I'm really worried that we won't have enough

1262
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,320
questions and stuff.

1263
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,760
So please send in questions, Yahoo's,

1264
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,040
Drew, Rachel, Zoe, Ira, the usuals, everybody, please.

1265
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
Jacob Locker, come out of retirement,

1266
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,920
dust off your brain.

1267
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,560
Yeah, he's actually sent some stuff in, I think.

1268
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,560
I love all my precious children.

1269
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,680
Anyway, please send in stuff,

1270
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,440
because we're gonna need a lot of it.

1271
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,800
And if you know any hot shit in Hong Kong,

1272
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,040
drop us a line, bim bam, at maximumfun.org.

1273
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,320
No racist jokes, though.

1274
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,080
I asked on Twitter a couple days ago,

1275
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,520
like, hey, what's good in Hong Kong?

1276
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
I got a lot of racist jokes.

1277
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,640
Not from listeners of the show, I'm sure,

1278
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,680
but just, you know, let me keep that shit in line.

1279
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,000
Just a reminder, Candle Nights 2015

1280
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,680
is coming up December 21st.

1281
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,000
It's a Monday in Huntington, West Virginia,

1282
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena.

1283
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,680
Tickets are on sale, bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights 2.

1284
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,400
I'm willing to bet at this point,

1285
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,440
we haven't gotten the numbers yet,

1286
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,840
but I'm betting we've sold about 50% of the tickets.

1287
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,680
That's my guess at this point.

1288
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,880
We'd love to see you there.

1289
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,720
It's our holiday, spectacular.

1290
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,600
Sawbones is gonna be there.

1291
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,560
We're gonna be there.

1292
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,600
It's in our hometown, so that's always fun.

1293
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,360
Last year, we had a day named after us by the mayor,

1294
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,200
and we dressed up as ghosts.

1295
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,320
Who knows what fun and frivolity will happen this year,

1296
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,240
and we would love it if you were there.

1297
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,800
Go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights 2.

1298
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,080
I think that's gonna do it for us, Max.

1299
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,800
I think that's it.

1300
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,120
Oh, thanks.

1301
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,760
It's our network.

1302
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,440
Thanks to them for having us,

1303
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,200
and go to all the shows there, they're great.

1304
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,480
Yes, yes, and thanks to John Roderick

1305
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,680
and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1306
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,440
instead of our trophy album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1307
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,400
We haven't done that, have we?

1308
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,040
What, no, no.

1309
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,240
Talked about it and thanked John Roderick.

1310
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,760
I spent a lot of time yesterday actually listening

1311
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,440
to When I Pretend to Fall.

1312
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,240
I mean, you know what?

1313
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,000
What if for like the next few episodes,

1314
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,440
instead of recommending Putting the Days to Bed,

1315
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,960
which is what our theme song is from,

1316
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,440
we'd recommend other great Long Winters albums.

1317
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,320
That sounds good to me.

1318
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,320
Also, just a quick reminder,

1319
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,800
because we got a couple emails about it this week.

1320
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,320
If you would like a Jumbotron,

1321
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,240
if you would like us to talk about you in the Money Zone,

1322
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,360
wish someone a happy birthday,

1323
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,200
talk about your website, whatever you would like,

1324
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,440
go to maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron to sign up.

1325
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,560
But just a word of warning,

1326
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,560
we're sold out for the next couple months.

1327
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,240
So if you would like something read

1328
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,120
and say January, February, March,

1329
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,480
now is the time to buy it.

1330
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,800
So don't wait or it may be a little while

1331
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,560
before you actually get to hear your message.

1332
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:10,320
This final Yahoo was sent in by Aaron Kiss or Kiss.

1333
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:10,960
Thank you, Aaron.

1334
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Anders who asks,

1335
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,760
how to get a haircut similar to Joseph Stalin

1336
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,920
without showing the girl who cuts my hair

1337
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,480
a picture of Joseph Stalin?

1338
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,760
I'm Joseph McElroy.

1339
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,040
I'm Travis McElroy.

1340
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,520
Get that dick.

1341
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,600
This has been my brother, my brother,

1342
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,960
and me, Kiss Your Dad's Grown Alips.

1343
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:50,160
Luda!

1344
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,080
Maximumfun.org.

1345
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,120
Comedy and culture.

1346

Artist owned.

1347
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,360
Listener supported.

1348
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,240
I'm Jesse Thorne.

1349
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,520
I'm Jordan Morris.

1350
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,920
The federal government has millions of dollars

1351
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,680
in programs and opportunities

1352
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,680
that you need to seize today.

1353
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,120
You're a taxpayer, right?

1354
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,720
Well, then you've got it coming.

1355
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,000
Thanks to Uncle Sam,

1356
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,880
you can learn to get grants for education.

1357
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,320
Learn to ride a llama.

1358
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,800
Print money the old fashioned way.

1359
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,840
Force your dog to stop being so rambunctious.

1360
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,120
Make a souffle that sets and stays set.

1361
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,760
Mount the heads of your enemies on spikes.

1362
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,160
Grind your own corrective lenses

1363
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,720
using just rock salt and diamonds.

1364
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,800
