1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,880
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:04,480
It's coming in hot, folks. I'm sure you've seen it blowing up the TVs and your mobile devices.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,360
It's finally almost here. So close now. Thor Ragnarok. This is a Thor Ragnarok watch. Just

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,680
checking the buzz. Checking out all the buzz around Thor Ragnarok. Finger on the pulse of

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,200
this hot body of Thor. Now, boys, I'm so excited to talk about this because I got to see a special

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,280
preview screener two days ago. Oh, great. How's my huge friend doing, Thor?

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
Well, he's doing good. And let me tell you, I can give... Okay, leaning close. Here are some

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,600
special insights I can give you. One, he's dreamy. Two, he's creamy.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,880
He's creamy. They have really leaned into Thor, the bro-iest Avenger.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
Yeah, absolutely. In a good way. In a good, good way.

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Okay. I will also say that as I watched the movie

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,560
of the preview screener, I mean, I liked to imagine that there would be someone who would

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,720
go to see this movie who knew nothing about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and had never read a

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,760
comic book before in their life and maybe didn't even know anything about Norse mythology trying

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,960
to make either heads or tails of this movie. And it made me very happy because of how often the

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,480
sentence, now who's this beefy fellow, would pop up in their heads.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,040
Now... Just a lot of beefy boys.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
How many beefy friends? A lot of beefy boys.

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,640
How many beefy friends? Give me an exact number.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,320
I would say, Griffin, all the hamburger buns are empty because all the beef is in this movie.

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,080
Wow. Now, I...

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,960
That's not a number. Twelve?

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Okay, okay, okay. Now, we're just a few days... This came out on November 3rd,

30
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
so we're getting close to release here on December 4th.

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
American release. It came out in, I believe, Japan November 3rd.

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes, they love the huge man, Thor, and all of his much smaller friends,

33
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,960
except for the green one who can sometimes get bigger.

34
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,400
Green buddy. It's large man Thor and green buddy.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
And my green friend, the Hulk, or Bruce.

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,120
I saw that Bruce is in the film and I heard that there's a scene where he says,

37
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
why do we need... Thor says, why do we need the strong man here?

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
I am strong. We do not need two of the strong men.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,800
Bring me someone who can fly, or perhaps a laser boy.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,960
And they... Thor doesn't understand why there needs another strong man.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,480
And let's talk about Avengers composition. Let's talk about it team comp.

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,560
In terms of tank, DPS, healer, right?

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,160
There's just like... There's vision, right? You can go through walls. That's fun.

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,280
Hawkeye shoots a bow and arrow and sometimes says really sexist stuff.

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,360
And then there's Black Widow who does all kinds of flips and spins.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
And then we have like... And Iron Man's got beams.

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,240
And then there's like four strong men. It's like, do we need four?

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,000
Just what do you do? Strong. I do strong-ness.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,880
Now Trav, tell me about the scene. I heard there's a scene where Thor says,

50
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,800
um, you may be strong Hulk, Bruce, but I have this hammer.

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,640
And then Hulk takes the hammer and Thor says, I'm no longer needed.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,080
And I will step away. And then he retires.

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,040
Yeah. And you know, that comes five minutes into the movie.

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
Wow. Yeah.

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
And then the rest of the movie is Hulk as Thor.

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,360
And they keep calling him Thulk, which is cute. I like that.

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,720
And it keeps cutting back to Thor, like, you know, at the supermarket,

58
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
or like, uh, he gets married, has a kid, serves on the PTA.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,640
Is the sun big and green?

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
No, the sun is actually kind of a nerdy puny guy.

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
So like Thor has to deal with that.

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Now, now the weird... I heard another scene that I saw.

63
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,200
Now this was on a Fandango bonus clip that I got for pre-ordering tickets

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,720
for this movie that opened a month ago.

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Uh-huh. And in it, in this bonus clip,

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,200
after Thor raises a family, Hulk comes to his house and says,

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,000
I am stronger than you. I will teach the children to be strong.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm the father now.

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
And he becomes... And Thor says, you're right.

70
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah. And Hulk becomes Thor's kids' dads.

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Is that in the final cut? Did that one get bragged and cut?

72
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
Absolutely. That's actually, Justin, I'm glad you brought that up

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,200
because that's actually a post-credits scene that dovetails with Daddy's Home 2.

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,440
Oh, good. I was hoping we could talk about that picture in the podcast.

75
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
Yeah, so then it's all in the Daddy's Home multiverse.

76
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
And that's when Samuel L. Jackson shows up and says,

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,480
I'm putting together a team of step-dads.

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,200
Yeah. I like the scene in Daddy's Home 2 where the Hulk comes and crushes,

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,520
then eats just all the men in that picture.

80
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,160
And then they're gone in real life, which is really cool and fun.

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
And great.

82
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,280
Now, does Thor Ragnarok include the scene where John Lithgow

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
shows up on the first day of Daddy's Home 2 filming

84
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
and sees that the other new daddy is Mel Gibson?

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
And there's 15 minutes of him just like, are we sure?

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,480
Are you sure about that? Are you sure about this one?

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,640
I actually also got a preview screener of Daddy's Home 2 and without the CGI.

88
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,080
And what they haven't released yet, maybe this is like a special bonus thing,

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,160
but John Lithgow is not in the movie.

90
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,480
It's all Andy Serkis motion capture.

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah, cause John Lithgow walked over and saw the comedy duo,

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,120
the hysterical duo of Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson they put together.

93
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
And he literally, he just, he pulled out his grappling hook and ziplined away.

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,560
But Andy Serkis stepped in and he was like, I have no problem with these two.

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
So Andy Serkis is doing, is John Lithgow.

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
Loves Mel Gibson.

97
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
They've already paid him.

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,640
Yeah, now I heard there's a scene in Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri,

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,920
where the Hulk comes and takes the three billboards

100
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,120
and says, now there's no more need for your movie.

101
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,640
I will take these to mine.

102
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,280
And so France makes Dormant, it's like, well, I retire.

103
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,760
Well, actually what happens is-

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,040
The billboards are gone in her movie, so she closes her movie

105
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,160
and Hulk puts the three billboards into Hulk Ragnarok, a Thor picture.

106
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,480
You must've seen a previous version.

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,760
Maybe that was like 1.0 because in the version I saw,

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
Thor goes to grab the billboards and Frances McDormand says no.

109
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,520
And Hulk goes, well, I bow to your wisdom.

110
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,400
Thank you so much for everything you've done.

111
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
You're amazing.

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,200
And then she kills and eats Hulk and becomes Hulk.

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,440
Yes.

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
Now I heard there's-

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
Justin heard about it.

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,040
Justin's just seen all the scenes.

117
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,280
And so let's just sit back and watch him do his thing.

118
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
It's almost a spoiler.

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,480
At this, I feel like so much has been spoiled,

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,320
but I heard that Hulk does jump into the Orient Express

121
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,280
and says, I have the final solution.

122
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
The butler conducted the crime.

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,920
And Poro's like, there's no butler.

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
And Hulk's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.

125
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,000
I said the butler committed the crime.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,560
You may put your train back into the station.

127
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
Your film is no longer needed.

128
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
And then he eats the whole train.

129
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
He does eat the whole train.

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Which is also how Snowpiercer ended,

131
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
with just the train starts up again

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
and then it goes right into Hulk's big mouth and open belly.

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,480
Yep.

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
That's all accurate.

135
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
That all happens.

136
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,160
It's the scene in the movie where Hulk finally gets his reward

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,720
of getting a Coca-Cola and then the Ant-Man shows up

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,080
and steals his fucking Coca-Cola, that piece of shit Ant-Man.

139
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,440
There's also a prolonged scene in which Hulk walks around naked

140
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,960
and I wish this was a joke.

141
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,120
And it makes me, for the first time-

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,920
Erect.

143
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,480
Erect.

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,440
It forces me to think about Hulk's genitalia in a way that I-

145
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
The first time, bud.

146
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
The first time, bud.

147
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
As if the first time fucking Stanley was like,

148
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,200
ah, Eureka, my catchphrase, I've got it.

149
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
The man turns big and green.

150
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
And instantly we heard that conceit and we're like, dick too though, right?

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,560
Stanley?

152
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
No, actually I have concrete proof.

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
So, okay, the Hulk, Bruce Banner transforms into the Hulk.

154
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
Imagine the classic image.

155
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
What you see is pants that have been torn,

156
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,160
usually from the mid thigh to knee down, right?

157
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,720
But after the transformation into Hulk and back into Bruce Banner,

158
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
those pants have been torn.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,120
The crotch of the pants is never destroyed.

160
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
So we have to assume that Hulk gets huge muscles,

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
but like just a regular human penis.

162
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
But Bruce's penis is probably pretty good.

163
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
Bruce's penis.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,640
I mean, he's already had pants sized to his penis that the Hulk does not destroy.

165
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
Actually, when he's Bruce, he has the Hulk's penis.

166
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
And when he's the Hulk, he has Bruce's penis.

167
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
It's a weird sort of mix around.

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,480
Now, I heard that there's, I saw one more deleted scene

169
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,120
where the Hulk goes into Lady Bird and says,

170
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm not aware of what this film is or is about,

171
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
but I've heard good things, so I'll take it for my own.

172
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
And then he goes into the shape of water and is like,

173
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
I don't know, teardrops, lakes, and ocean.

174
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Anyway, your movie is over too.

175
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
And the Hulk takes all the water.

176
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,200
So what you're suggesting, Justin, is that what you've seen

177
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,400
is a cut of the movie that is a very like last action hero.

178
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
Hulk is a film walker.

179
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,840
He just claims movies as his own.

180
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,320
Now, I did sweet a lot of this.

181
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,040
So a lot of this is sort of sweeted stuff from my own studio

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,280
here at the house.

183
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,480
I saw a scene in A Bad Mom's Christmas that,

184
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
and the Ant-Man, and by scene, I mean the whole movie.

185
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,720
Ant-Man's in the whole thing.

186
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,360
You just can't see him.

187
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,080
He's really small.

188
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,880
He's like a speck of dust just floating around,

189
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
landing on Mila Kunis' nose, but you don't see him.

190
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,840
But if you turn up the audio like all the way,

191
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
like blow out your speakers,

192
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,200
you can hear Paul Rudd doing his comedy.

193
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh, that's fun.

194
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
Yeah, he's in most movies the whole time,

195
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,240
just very small and you can't tell, but he's very small.

196
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
To be fair though, Paul Rudd is just in most movies.

197
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
That's true.

198
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,880
And it's very confusing because he's also in it as Ant-Man.

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
Yeah.

200
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,440
Well, that's the thing is he's always been Ant-Man in movies.

201
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
It's just like pre getting the suit and post getting the suit.

202
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,040
Sure.

203
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
Hey, questions time because half of the show will be a special thing

204
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
and I would love to get at least some of our good work into it.

205
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
Okay, before we do, before we do,

206
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
if you're listening to this on Monday, tonight,

207
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I am participating in a World Builders,

208
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,400
which is a charity organization spearheaded by Pat Rothfuss,

209
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,480
a StarCraft tournament.

210
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
Oh my God, are you playing StarCraft?

211
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
I am.

212
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,800
Have you ever played StarCraft?

213
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
I have not.

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
This should be good, bro.

215
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
What's your APMs?

216
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh God, it's me and Tybee playing as a team run fan cast

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,720
with absolutely positively no idea what we're doing,

218
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,320
but it's for a good cause.

219
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
You can go to bit.ly forward slash run WB

220
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,080
and help donate money to sponsor our team.

221
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,880
I can't, you know I'm gonna be there watching you fuck up

222
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,520
at like building too many pylons or whatever.

223
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh, Griffin, it's gonna be terrible.

224
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
Like, listen, it's gonna be fun.

225
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm gonna be terrible.

226
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,840
Let me be clear.

227
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
Have you not watched any videos?

228
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,480
Have you not watched any videos or whatever

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,120
on how to StarCraft?

230
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
I mean, I will.

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,120
Okay.

232
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,640
I'm sure I will.

233
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,760
And I believe that happens tonight at 10.30 central time

234
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,680
is when I'm playing.

235
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
There's lots of other people playing.

236
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,800
The double clicks are playing.

237
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
Paul and Storm are playing.

238
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
Mikey Newman is playing.

239
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,200
Lots of people are playing.

240
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,960
I hear Mikey's got sick APM,

241
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,320
so you're gonna get put in the trash can.

242
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh no, he is gonna just kick my ass.

243
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
No doubt, no doubt.

244
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,040
But check that out and run bit.ly forward slash run WB

245
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,400
to help sponsor that.

246
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,040
And Justin, tell us about NBNB AM Angels

247
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
before we kick off these questions.

248
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, before we get in the show,

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
NBNB AM Angels is an annual project

250
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,520
that we sort of like tangentially do

251
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,040
just because it's like us,

252
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,280
but really we don't do any of the heavy lifting.

253
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,720
We have a great team of people

254
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
that are like doing this hard work.

255
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,920
But we have a lot of people in the area that we grew up

256
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
and where I still live here in Huntington

257
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
and the surrounding Tri-State area

258
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,160
who have a lot of needs for this holiday season.

259
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,840
And there are a lot of people

260
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,520
who aren't gonna have anything

261
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,560
for this blessed Candle Nights season.

262
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
And we're not talking about like fun toys usually.

263
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,480
We're talking about stuff like a wheelchair is needed

264
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
and a gas car to get to work

265
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,040
and a bed and a tent and things like this,

266
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,280
just things that people really need.

267
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,240
And you can be a hero this Candle Nights season

268
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,120
and help fix these problems.

269
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
I mean, like it's heartbreaking.

270
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,360
And if you go to NBNBAMangels.com,

271
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,880
you're gonna see a ton of opportunities

272
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,000
where you can help.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
It's easy to do.

274
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
There's a great team of people

275
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,400
who are ready to assist you.

276
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
And even if you're just gonna kick in a few bucks,

277
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,840
you don't have to buy one of these items specifically.

278
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,040
But it's a wonderful project

279
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,600
that we care a lot about.

280
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
So if you can find it in your heart to help out,

281
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
NBNBAMangels.com and you can find someone to help.

282
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,360
And if you do, please tweet at us.

283
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
Let us know so we can thank you personally.

284
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,960
And we really appreciate anything you can do

285
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,560
to assist with that.

286
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,240
Real quick, I misspoke that the StarCraft Tournament,

287
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,040
I will be playing at 9.30 Central, 10.30 Eastern PM tonight.

288
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,760
The tournament kicks off at 8 PM Central time.

289
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,200
And you can find out all the information

290
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
at worldbuilders.org slash StarCraft.

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,080
All right, first question.

292
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,360
I tend to lounge around the house

293
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
in a luxurious plaid bathrobe,

294
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,640
almost always with a t-shirt and shorts under it.

295
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,040
Sometimes when I want candy, I will go to the convenience store

296
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,200
across the street without putting on real clothes.

297
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,000
This is legitimate because it's really close to where I live.

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,320
Well, now I want a bagel, but I don't want to change.

299
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,720
But the bagel place is like a half mile away.

300
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Is that too far for the bathrobe?

301
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,960
Well, people think I'm just a weirdo.

302
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,400
That's from the robed one.

303
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
There's so much going on.

304
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,600
You are making assumptions left and right.

305
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,680
You just, here's the thing about the bathrobe look.

306
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,240
I mean, I support you and you walk your path.

307
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm not trying to shame anyone's bathrobe usage,

308
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,560
except that I am about to do just that.

309
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,320
But there's not a bubble extending from your house

310
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,840
where the bathrobe is acceptable.

311
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,360
The bubble is the house.

312
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
The bubble's the house.

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,200
It's literally maybe where your paper lands.

314
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,920
Unless I just don't know.

315
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,880
It's as far as your Wi-Fi extends from your house.

316
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
If you got the Wi-Fi signal, you can pull out your phone

317
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,560
and say like, no, no, no, it's cool.

318
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
See, Robbie's place.

319
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,480
You see that?

320
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,280
Don't try to hack Robbie's place.

321
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,240
It's iron clad.

322
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
If you still have Wi-Fi, you can Arthur Dent all over town.

323
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
You can set up repeaters down the block and just,

324
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
but okay, listen, you can't just say,

325
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
listen, question asker, I love you.

326
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,520
You know that, right?

327
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,320
I love you.

328
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
You can't just say, this is legitimate

329
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,400
because it's really close.

330
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,920
You don't get to make that call.

331
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,040
Yeah, it's legitimate because I really wanted candy.

332
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,240
And now I'm in the bathroom.

333
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,080
Now I will say that bagel place,

334
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,480
I feel like is more appropriate for the bathrobe

335
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,720
because it's a breakfast time thing.

336
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
And so you can show up and you say like, oops,

337
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
Monday's breakfast time, bagel, please.

338
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm not naked under this.

339
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,840
And that's so, you've got to say the last part.

340
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,360
The highest level of maturity is being able to see the world

341
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,280
through the point of view of other people.

342
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,040
And you have to understand that when you go

343
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,320
to the convenience store, see it through their eyes,

344
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,880
they don't look at each other after you leave and say,

345
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
it's cool, he lives nearby.

346
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
That's not, that dialogue does not take place.

347
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Is it okay to go out of doors, dress in an outfit

348
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
with a robe over it?

349
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,560
I assume shoes, please wear shoes.

350
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,520
Yeah, I mean, legally, legally speaking, sure.

351
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,720
Are you saying, will people maybe give me a little side eye?

352
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
Absolutely.

353
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
Absolutely they will.

354
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,680
Unless.

355
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,200
Unless?

356
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,840
Unless?

357
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
In one question, unless.

358
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,680
If you're gonna leave the house, you silly goose,

359
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
just tuck the robe into the shorts.

360
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
And then at the worst, people are just gonna think

361
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
you got a super lumpy duff.

362
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,440
And that's it.

363
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,000
They're just wearing a coat and their shorts are holding in.

364
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
They're very, very lumpy duff.

365
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,800
Would this be different if instead of like a luxurious

366
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,320
plaid bathrobe, you were wearing like an embroidered

367
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,760
like boxer's robe?

368
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,400
Oh, and then people might think you're a champion boxer.

369
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Oh, he needs those Mike and Ikes to carve up

370
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,600
before the big fight.

371
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
Before the big fight today.

372
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
It's gonna be hard for me to see that and not assume

373
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
that you're putting it through heavy usage

374
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,440
and then start thinking about the scent,

375
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,840
the scent of it, because you know what I'm talking about.

376
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,760
A robe that gets heavy usage, it's got all your smell in it.

377
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,080
And I don't want to even look at the smell

378
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
because I can feel it and taste it.

379
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,800
Again, if you want to wear a robe, go for it,

380
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,200
but please stop creating justifications for yourself.

381
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,800
You're a guy wearing a robe or a gal wearing a robe

382
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,920
or a person wearing a robe.

383
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,280
I don't know, but you're still wearing a robe

384
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
outside of your house.

385
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
It doesn't matter how far you're from your home.

386
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,400
It's a wild tactic.

387
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,200
How about this Yahoo?

388
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
It was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

389
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,520
Thank you, Seth.

390
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,200
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

391
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,440
Jotun Hurtigen asks,

392
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,640
what happens if a vampire bites another vampire?

393
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm, can I tell you?

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm so glad that this question is included.

395
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
It's long overdue.

396
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,600
And listen, we'll circle back to this super vampire steak,

397
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
but I was thinking about this.

398
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
People like to throw a lot of shit at vampires

399
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,480
and I bet you, I bet you, Griffin,

400
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
a lot of those people that are hurling shit at vampires

401
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
also eat steaks.

402
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
Vampires gotta eat.

403
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,760
That's what I'm saying.

404
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
This has gone on for too long.

405
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,400
What, a vampire, so we kill him?

406
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
People are cattle.

407
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,680
To a vampire?

408
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
Yeah, no, I know.

409
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
But you still sort of,

410
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,720
you still definitely said it with your whole mouth.

411
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,240
To a vampire?

412
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,680
Yeah, that's how, listen,

413
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,400
it's the circle of life.

414
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
No, I will not, no.

415
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,400
It's sort of a straight line of light.

416
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
It's like a life pyramid.

417
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
Well, but then bacteria eat vampires, so.

418
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,680
Yeah, I guess it all keeps,

419
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,960
the big wheel keeps spinning.

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh, no, wait, the sun eats vampires

421
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,760
and then plants eat the sun.

422
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
There we go, so when you're eating,

423
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
if you're eating a cucumber,

424
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,360
then you're just eating vampire, basically.

425
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,880
Yeah, basically, it's the circle of life.

426
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,800
The sun is powered by vampire energy

427
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
from vampires they've consumed.

428
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,680
We all know that.

429
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,520
That's why global warming is such an issue.

430
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,320
Too many vamps.

431
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,520
Two things, I think.

432
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
If a vampire bites another vampire,

433
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,280
one double vampire

434
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,800
and these are the scariest of all.

435
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,560
Can you even,

436
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,800
if a double vampire bites a double vampire,

437
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,200
is it a triple vampire or do we square root it?

438
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
What are some of the key differentiators,

439
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,480
Griffin, of a double vampire?

440
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,600
Four fangs, four fangs.

441
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
Four big fangs and the accent gets like,

442
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,160
if a regular vampire is here,

443
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,600
a double vampire is like here.

444
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
And the quadruple vampire is here.

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Now, if I was a quintuple vampire,

446
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760
exactly what would that sound like?

447
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:13,280
A quintuple vampire and an octuple vampire is here.

448
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,960
I want to suck your blood, donkey.

449
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,600
Are you suggesting Shrek was an octuple vampire?

450
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,800
Yeah, I think Shrek is an octuple vampire, for sure.

451
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,600
That makes sense.

452
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
He was a vampire that bit another vampire

453
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
and then bit a double vampire

454
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,520
and then bit a quadruple vampire.

455
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
Okay, so this is my question.

456
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,640
The vampire that doubles,

457
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,560
is it the vampire that bites or the vampire that is bit?

458
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,800
Ooh, I think it's a vampire that is bit.

459
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,920
That's a good point, Travis.

460
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Oh, see, I was gonna say the vampire that bites.

461
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,920
No, because that's not how the vampiric process works.

462
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,800
I guess that's true.

463
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,720
I was thinking, I guess more of like

464
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
the double vampire siphons the vampire away

465
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
and then that vampire is like, well, you're normal again.

466
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,000
No, the vampire bites another vampire,

467
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
transforming the bitten vampire into a double vampire,

468
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
and then the new double vampire turns around

469
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
and is like, now you fucked up.

470
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,040
Now you fucked up.

471
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,000
Look at these fangs.

472
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
You're in trouble now.

473
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,160
Is it a triple vampire or is it like squared every time?

474
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,200
I think we go up by the root of two.

475
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Now, that's the first scenario, a double vampire,

476
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,560
and it is the correct scenario

477
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,320
because it's such a good world that I want to live in.

478
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
That one's science-based.

479
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,920
That one's science-based.

480
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,880
The other situation that could happen is it's just awkward.

481
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
It's just like, look, look, look.

482
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,920
Hey, dude, hey, dude, stop, stop, stop, stop.

483
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,200
Look, check the fangs.

484
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
One, two.

485
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
Oh.

486
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

487
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,120
Oh, man.

488
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, I'm a vampire.

489
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,880
I hate the sun and garlic and love to bite.

490
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
That's me too, so.

491
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,440
They don't have blood, right?

492
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,560
Vampires don't have blood.

493
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,600
It's just dust in there, right?

494
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,160
It's just dust.

495
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,880
That's why they need to keep drinking it.

496
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
Well, it depends if they've recently fed.

497
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
I think the blood's only in their tummy at that point though.

498
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,520
Do they, so do the vampires pee out blood?

499
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,400
And if so, how do they know when they have prostate issues?

500
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,360
I mean, you fit.

501
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,320
As somebody who's had prostate issues before, you'll know.

502
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,160
Do you think that with a vampire pees and it's not blood,

503
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
they're like, oh, no.

504
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
Oh, crap.

505
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh, it's wearing.

506
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,320
Oh, never mind.

507
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,440
Psych, I'm immortal.

508
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,000
I forgot.

509
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
Oh, wait, yeah, I don't have prostate issues.

510
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,280
Fine.

511
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,120
Double vampire.

512
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,000
How about another question?

513
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,440
Brothers, some local teens just knocked on our door

514
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,520
and asked us to cook their unpopped microwave popcorn.

515
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
I do not recognize these youths.

516
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
Am I setting myself up for a long con

517
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,880
by being a cool neighbor?

518
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,440
That's from corny conundrum in Gooneyville.

519
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
Yes, literally the town from Goonies, Astoria, Oregon.

520
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,440
Fuck yeah.

521
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,920
I mean, is it the Goonies that came to your house?

522
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,600
Because maybe they got a treasure map.

523
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,400
They want to steal it.

524
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
Maybe there's treasures under your house

525
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
and they would just want to go in your basement.

526
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,120
I mean, they're adults now, though.

527
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,480
So these would be adults like, hey,

528
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,760
can we come in your basement?

529
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
I bet you got a map.

530
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
Here's some popcorn.

531
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,360
I'm Sean Astin.

532
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,000
This is what I sound like.

533
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
I'm a septuple vampire.

534
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,920
I didn't have an accent when I started.

535
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,000
Why do they have a bag of microwave popcorn

536
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
but no microwave?

537
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,400
Why did they purchase?

538
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,760
They robbed a Boy Scout.

539
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
They might've robbed a Boy Scout.

540
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
They might've robbed a Boy Scout

541
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,560
who was selling popcorn door to door.

542
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:16,960
Oh, no.

543
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,680
I mean, I'm kind of into this Moonrise Kingdom,

544
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,560
like a band of kids sitting out on their own,

545
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,000
the only food they brought with them

546
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,360
on their journey was popcorn,

547
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,000
but they're kids, so they didn't think about it.

548
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,560
And so they need you to pop the popcorn

549
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,040
so they can eat something while they wander into the forest

550
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,200
because one of them knows where a dead body is,

551
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,480
just like in Moonrise Kingdom.

552
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,920
Yeah, you know, I guess I assumed that these kids

553
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,400
were like local next door kids,

554
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,360
but these kids could have been on a long journey

555
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,760
and maybe like the last thing they had in their packs

556
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,960
was like microwave popcorn.

557
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,000
You know what I mean?

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,640
It's possible.

559
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,640
Why not say yes, but then you have to stay on the porch

560
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,560
and wait and you close the door

561
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,000
and you pop their corn for them

562
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
and then you return it and you send those scamps on their way,

563
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
but don't let them in your house.

564
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,680
Dear God, whatever you do, don't let them in your house.

565
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,000
I think a good way to test their intentions

566
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,320
is to say, yes, I will pop the popcorn,

567
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
but you will enjoy this popcorn with me

568
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
and we'll all enjoy this popcorn together

569
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,680
here on the porch in just a communal manner

570
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,760
and we'll all share the popcorn together.

571
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
I need the 10% for the juice, for the vig.

572
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm gonna get my beak salty.

573
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
They could be vamps, though, trying to get access

574
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,440
to the gentleman's side.

575
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
That's why you can't let them in the house.

576
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,520
Can't let them in the house.

577
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
Don't let the wrong one in.

578
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
That's what the movie's called.

579
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,680
I got a Yahoo here and I want to read it

580
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,200
before we go to the Money Zone

581
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
and move on to a very special segment

582
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
because it features something so pure and so wonderful.

583
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
It's another Seth Carlson jam.

584
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
Thank you, Seth.

585
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,560
It's Yahoo Answers user.

586
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,160
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

587
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,520
I'm gonna call him Broderick asks,

588
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,120
NCIS-themed birthday party?

589
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,600
I want to throw a really nice NCIS-themed birthday party,

590
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
but aren't sure how to do it.

591
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,800
I don't know what to do for a cake,

592
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,480
decorations, games, anything like that.

593
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,800
Thanks.

594
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,360
Okay, before we get into the details of this.

595
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,480
How much have we watched?

596
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
Well, here's the thing.

597
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,920
I love somebody saying,

598
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,600
I want to throw specific theme birthday party here.

599
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,800
I have no ideas.

600
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,040
I have no ideas for it whatsoever.

601
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,720
So like, do you then?

602
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
Do you want to throw that party?

603
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,800
Or do you just like NCIS?

604
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,200
I very much like NCIS and I very much like aging

605
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,040
and I want to combine those two activities.

606
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,600
I think the only thing I know about NCIS,

607
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
I know two things.

608
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,160
One, the Secret Service agent from West Wing is in it.

609
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,400
Correct, Mark Harmon.

610
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
And there's some-

611
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,080
Incredible hero, incredible hero, sorry.

612
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
Incredible hero, Mark Harmon,

613
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,240
that once saved a boy from a burning car.

614
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,880
Mark Harmon.

615
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,360
Wait, really?

616
00:26:59,360 --> 00:26:59,920
Yeah, Mark Harmon.

617
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,440
Fuck yeah, dude.

618
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Mark Harmon saved a boy from a burning car?

619
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,880
Yeah, Mark Harmon is a fucking hero.

620
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
He pulled two kids out of a burning car.

621
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
Well, now it's two kids?

622
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,280
Hold on, this started as one kid.

623
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,640
It started as one kid.

624
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
He pulled six kids out of a burning bus.

625
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,280
He ate a burning limousine.

626
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,640
To save 12 kids.

627
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
We've talked about this before, I believe,

628
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
so I'm going to go through this quickly.

629
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,240
But Mark Harmon was kicking it in LA, 1996, 715.

630
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
These teens missed a turn, crashed into a tree,

631
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,400
flipped over and burst into flames.

632
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,120
Mark Harmon smashed the windows out with a sledgehammer

633
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,560
and pulled the boys to safety.

634
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,440
He was just holding the sledgehammer sitting on his porch

635
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,320
as he's want to do.

636
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
Fuck yeah, Mark Harmon, hero.

637
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,600
Mark Harmon rules.

638
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,880
Anyway, Mark Harmon.

639
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,040
Also, as long as we're talking about Mark Harmon,

640
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,760
I did a quick Google for NCIS party

641
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,520
to see kind of what was out there.

642
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
There's a lot.

643
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,080
It won't surprise you.

644
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,160
A lot of fun cakes, et cetera.

645
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,640
His character on the show NCIS is named Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

646
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,920
Do you think that it was penance for having such a cool name

647
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,160
like Mark Harmon that they had to knock him down a few times?

648
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,240
I feel like one thing you could do for your party

649
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,720
is set your house ablaze in Brentwood

650
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,360
and then Mark will show up.

651
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,400
Be like, I'm here to save you.

652
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,080
And then you quickly douse the flame.

653
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,280
And you're like, Mark, Mark, Mark,

654
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,240
long as you're here, lordy, lordy, look who's 40.

655
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,680
It's me, Mark.

656
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,040
Thank you for coming.

657
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
Thank you for coming, Mark.

658
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,520
The second thing I know about NCIS

659
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,400
is that there is a goth woman or a punk woman

660
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
who seems very prevalent in the show.

661
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,600
I believe her name is Abby on the show.

662
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,040
How do you know that?

663
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,400
She's on all the NCIS.

664
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,120
Because I've been reading this Yahoo, Travis.

665
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,840
I want to just-

666
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,360
There's someone named Donald Ducky Mallard.

667
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,400
There's a lot of fun.

668
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,640
Listen, they have fun with the names.

669
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
NCIS creators.

670
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:02,880
Yeah.

671
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,160
But Ducky is his nickname and Mallard is his last name.

672
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,200
Like, you could have gotten to Ducky just from Donald

673
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,360
or Ducky just from Mallard,

674
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,720
but you went ahead and named Donald the most famous duck

675
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,160
and also Mallard.

676
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,960
Yeah, I mean, there's a character on the chief of the NCIS

677
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
is named Bill Butthole Rectum.

678
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
They just really went wild with the names.

679
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,320
So NCIS stands for Naval Criminal Investigative Services, right?

680
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,000
So they investigate crimes

681
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
that have to do with the Navy and the Marines.

682
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,960
That show has been going on for 15 seasons.

683
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Hey, Navy, are you okay?

684
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,480
Because it seems like you maybe have a lot of crime.

685
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,800
It seems like there's a lot of crime going on with y'all.

686
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,600
I mean, I learned that-

687
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
You and JAG.

688
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,520
I learned that on JAG.

689
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,760
Yeah, JAG has just really opened my eyes to-

690
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
Holy shit.

691
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,920
JAG and NCIS are in the same universe.

692
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Yes.

693
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,600
Two episodes in season eight of JAG.

694
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
It's called the, Travis, it's called the Viewisk universe.

695
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes.

696
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Ice Queen and Meltdown.

697
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,320
Two episodes from season eight of JAG.

698
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,000
We're back to our pilots for NCIS

699
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,400
that featured Mark Harmon as Gibbs

700
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,320
on those JAG episodes.

701
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
Yeah, it's called a spinoff.

702
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,640
It's called a spinoff.

703
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,600
But from JAG.

704
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,280
NCIS is a spinoff from JAG, I had no idea.

705
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,560
It's called a JAG-off.

706
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
I wanted to read this question

707
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,560
because there's Yahoo Answers user named Lady Die who says,

708
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,440
be sure that you either have an actual mystery to solve

709
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,400
as the evening progresses

710
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,560
or that you simply use the theme as a backdrop.

711
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,160
There really isn't any right way or wrong way

712
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,960
to do a birthday party.

713
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,920
But if you wanna throw the party

714
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,960
that everyone will be talking about,

715
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you need to create a specific crime

716
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
for the scene you're investigating

717
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,880
and leave clues everywhere to help with the investigation.

718
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Decorating your crime scene party crime scene tape

719
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,080
and chalk outlines on the floor

720
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,440
are easy additions to your theme.

721
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Make sure to leave them realistic in size

722
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
by having a person actually lay down

723
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,840
for you to draw the outline.

724
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,760
You might leave fake footprints, fingerprints,

725
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,880
and clue cards throughout the room,

726
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,280
not too well hidden unless you want people snooping.

727
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
You can even get help when leaving the clues

728
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,760
and decorating because of the novelty of this sort of party.

729
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,080
You do not have to confine the festivities to one room

730
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
and you can, if you're feeling truly adventurous,

731
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
have a different case going on in different rooms.

732
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,520
Just have the guests draw numbers for teams

733
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,040
and then race to solve the crime first.

734
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,400
This is a fairly huge undertaking,

735
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,480
but it will make the party remembered for years.

736
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
You might also wanna set up a lab

737
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
complete with a microscope and tables

738
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
dedicated to sorting out the evidence

739
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,560
and making notes for the shocking conclusion

740
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,680
of the crimes in question.

741
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
Of course, you'll wanna make the crime simple and solvable

742
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,440
by leaving clues that guests will have no trouble finding

743
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
or deciphering without making it too easy.

744
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,360
Use your favorite episode for guidance if you must

745
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,520
and throw in a red herring or two to keep things fun.

746
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,200
There are reruns that you should have no problem

747
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360
finding a show that will give you some great ideas.

748
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,200
For free, you can have an actual NCIS cake

749
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,040
or go with cookies that are shaped like footprints

750
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,000
or thumbprint cookies for an excellent play on words.

751
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
Sloppy Joes, pizza, finger foods, chips and dips,

752
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,560
and cookies and cake will have an excellent food addition

753
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,880
to the party without needing to fit into any one theme.

754
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,280
Be sure to have plenty of soda and bottled water on hand.

755
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,080
Here's a picture of an NCIS cake, and then I put a link.

756
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,480
This is so pure and so good,

757
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,560
and the first time that somebody's ever asked anything

758
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,880
on Yahoo Answers where a good, helpful,

759
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,760
kind Christian person swoops in with a fucking manual

760
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
on how to perfectly do the thing.

761
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,560
I wanted to include this because hope's not all lost.

762
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,080
Most things are bad.

763
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,520
90% of the things are bad,

764
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,680
but then there's Yahoo Answers user, Lady Di,

765
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,120
who swoops in here is like,

766
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
you know what's good at parties?

767
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
Sloppy Joes sometimes.

768
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,280
How about a fingerprint cookie?

769
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,520
I like the inclusion of the line,

770
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,520
make sure to have soda and water available.

771
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
That's not NCIS specific.

772
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,720
It's just a good overall.

773
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,160
It's a good party thing.

774
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,200
I've never seen NCIS, a single frame of it.

775
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,920
But this, what I love about this,

776
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,240
and the reason I was troubled doing it,

777
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,120
is I was worried that Lady Di had confused NCIS with CSI.

778
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,400
No, I think they also do plenty of CSI-ing.

779
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
Okay, because this would also,

780
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,880
then this is not a qualm I have with Lady Di.

781
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,920
This is a qualm I have with the creators of NCIS.

782
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,320
You made your letters sound like a preexisting thing, CSI.

783
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
You used three of the same.

784
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,240
You just added an N in there

785
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,840
and then kind of flipped them all around.

786
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,480
Right, which also could be New Orleans CSI,

787
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,880
I think is in there, or is it NCIS New Orleans?

788
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,720
Who even fucking knows anymore?

789
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,120
I mean, I know because NCIS New Orleans has my boy, Scott Bakula.

790
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm just talking about the title, Griffin.

791
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,360
Okay, I just wanted to talk about Scott Bakula.

792
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,360
If you're going to use three of the same letters in your thing,

793
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,760
maybe don't have so much like microscopes

794
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,040
and fingerprints and stuff.

795
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,640
This is GSI, grime scene investigation.

796
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,080
Investigate all the grimiest scenes.

797
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,040
Do we want to move on to the money zone or?

798
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,080
I want to move on to the money zone

799
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,560
so that we can get to our guest segment even faster.

800
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,200
So let's do it.

801
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,520
I want to tell everybody about Wink.

802
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,760
That's W-I-N-C, Wink.

803
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,480
Wink's wine experts select wines

804
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,920
matched to your taste, personalized for you,

805
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,440
and then they ship them right to your door

806
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
just starting at 13 bucks a bottle.

807
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,400
How it works is you go to Wink's website,

808
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,840
which is trywink, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com,

809
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,760
and you fill out their palette profile quiz

810
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,880
and you answer simple questions

811
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,240
like how do you take your coffee

812
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,160
and how do you feel about blueberries?

813
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,680
Yes to both.

814
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,800
I'm afraid of them.

815
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,160
How do I take my coffee?

816
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Yes.

817
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,240
How do you feel about blueberries?

818
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,960
Very scared.

819
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,520
There are no membership fees you can skip any month

820
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,960
and you can cancel at any time

821
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,640
and it makes a good holiday gift.

822
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,080
You can send a personalized gift card

823
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,600
and let your recipient choose their wine from Wink's great selection.

824
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,080
You can discover great wine today

825
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,280
if you go to trywink.com.

826
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,440
Again, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother

827
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
and you'll get $20 off your first shipment one more time.

828
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,160
That is trywink.com, T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother for 20 bucks off.

829
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,800
I want to tell you about Stitch Fix

830
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,760
and I'm really excited because I just got my first Stitch Fix box.

831
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,800
Me too!

832
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,080
Three days ago, right?

833
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,040
It was amazing.

834
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,160
It's very good.

835
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,520
I've been on it for like six months.

836
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm doing it even when they're not giving it to me for free.

837
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,880
I adore it.

838
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,080
Oh, I've continued now.

839
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,440
Like I actually just made my next box come even faster

840
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,040
because I couldn't wait to get more of it.

841
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
But I got a flannel shirt in this box

842
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
that was like an instant favorite.

843
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,280
Like I pulled it out and was like, yes, I wore it that day.

844
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,240
It was so amazing.

845
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,600
So basically, here's how it works.

846
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,280
It's a new way to shop for clothes that does all the work for you.

847
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,880
Sweater weather's here, folks.

848
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,920
And if you're like me-

849
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,280
It got really serious there.

850
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,720
Well, hi, I'm Travis McElroy.

851
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
I'd like to talk to you about sweater weather.

852
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
I forgot to buy any sweaters.

853
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,160
I just, I moved back from Los Angeles.

854
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
I didn't leave my house at all last year when I lived in Cincinnati

855
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,320
because I had a baby and I was scared of the outside world

856
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,080
and I forgot to buy any sweaters.

857
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,560
So that's where I turned to Stitch Fix.

858
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,680
You go online, answer some questions about your sizes,

859
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,840
favorite styles and budget.

860
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,120
And I love that, by the way.

861
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,440
You can put not just like your budget for spending,

862
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,520
but your budget for individual items.

863
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,320
So you can say like-

864
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,560
How much are you willing to spend on a sweater?

865
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,040
Right.

866
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,200
Or like a t-shirt or socks or whatever.

867
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
You can say like, I don't want to spend more than blank on t-shirts.

868
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,560
And your personal stylist will pick five pieces

869
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
based on your preference and send them to your door.

870
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,960
And then you try them on at home.

871
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,240
And if you don't like something, you don't pay for it.

872
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,960
You just send it back.

873
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,160
You only pay for what you keep.

874
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,080
And there's no subscription and it's no club to join.

875
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,520
You just order stuff.

876
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
You say you need stuff when you need it.

877
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,680
So get started now at stitchfix.com slash my brother,

878
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,280
and you'll get 25% off when you keep all five items.

879
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,960
So that's stitchfix.com slash my brother,

880
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,520
stitchfix.com slash my brother.

881
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Yeah, and the cool thing is that it evolves.

882
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,440
So like you give them feedback when you get a box

883
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,200
and then they'll take that feedback into consideration

884
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,320
the next time they send you something.

885
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
It only gets better.

886
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,760
And also, I was really impressed by this.

887
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
Along with the items they send you,

888
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,160
they send you suggestions of other things

889
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
you could wear with those items.

890
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
Love that, need that, need that.

891
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,480
Juice, do you want to read this next message?

892
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
Yeah, have you noticed how the world is filled with problems

893
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
and that the leaders supposed to solve them

894
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,120
are all a bunch of sad squares and sad square boxes

895
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,640
who could really chill the heck out?

896
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,840
Ryan and John sure did.

897
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,480
They noticed so hard that they bought a microphone

898
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,120
and set up shop solving the world's toughest problems

899
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,120
with the help of the stickiest of green herbs.

900
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,440
Excellent, I was wondering, I was waiting for the twist.

901
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,840
Twist, they're high.

902
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,680
Join them every few weeks.

903
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,880
That's a very cool, that's a very chill release schedule.

904
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,400
I don't know.

905
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,640
Sometimes, join them sometimes on the Hypocrisy podcast

906
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
as they get creative, fix the world,

907
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,560
and fend off rabid dogs and smoke a lot of weed.

908
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,200
And that's Hypocrisy, H-I-G-H-P-O-C-R-A-C-Y.

909
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,640
You can go to Hypocrisy.zone or find, it's so good,

910
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,040
or find them wherever you get your podcasts.

911
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,360
Got another message for Mackenzie and it's from Caitlin.

912
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,920
It says, happy birthday to my favorite sister-in-law.

913
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,520
I can't wait to see you, Robert and Peps,

914
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,240
so I can show her all the best food in Austin

915
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,800
and solidify my position as her favorite aunt.

916
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
Love you lots, Caitlin.

917
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,360
And that's next available, is what that says.

918
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,720
So like, they're just really taking a shot in the dark there.

919
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
This is them gilting them for an Austin trip.

920
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,240
Like no matter what time of year this lands,

921
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,520
gotta get you down here, gotta get the barbecue,

922
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
gotta have the tacos.

923
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,640
Two more quick plugs before we move on

924
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,400
to our amazing, amazing guest segment

925
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,120
that I'm so excited, so I'm gonna make up really quick.

926
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,600
Schmaners is going to be performing

927
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,760
at San Francisco Sketch Fest this year.

928
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,040
On the first Sunday, I believe it's the 14th, January 14th.

929
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,880
So you can go to bit.ly forward slash SF Schmaners,

930
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,040
S-F-S-H-M-A-N-N-E-R-S, go check that out.

931
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,960
Did you just forget how to spell your own podcast?

932
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,640
Well, there's a lot of S's in there.

933
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,280
Sure, sure.

934
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
Yeah, and also Schmaners is going to be performing

935
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,120
on the JoCo Cruise along a lot of other stuff.

936
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
Dad's gonna be there.

937
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,960
We're gonna be doing a lot of like special events

938
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,680
and that kind of thing.

939
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,560
You can find out about that at JoCoCruise.com,

940
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,760
J-O-C-O Cruise.com, and that is in February.

941
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
I believe it starts February 18th.

942
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,400
In general, it's an amazing lineup and amazing cruise.

943
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,280
Go check it out.

944
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,000
All right, I can't believe you're about to hear

945
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
this segment that you're about to hear.

946
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,080
We had a very special guest on the show

947
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,840
and he's legitimately a hero of mine

948
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,280
and it is bizarre that he agreed to do our program,

949
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,960
but he did, so there.

950
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
So I guess we should just get into it.

951
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
Is there any sort of setup we need, I guess?

952
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,080
Well, one thing that's really important to me

953
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
is that we play a MaxFun promo right now.

954
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
Hey, Biz, have you seen any good movies lately?

955
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,920
Hey, Teresa, does Curious George's boo fest count?

956
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,400
It doesn't.

957
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,640
Well, I blame my current life situation

958
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
that has small children that need things.

959
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,080
God, I love them and I miss knowing about stuff.

960
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,120
Well, after catching up on the current cultural offerings

961
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,520
on podcasts that provide such information,

962
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,680
join us on One Bad Mother as we help explore

963
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
the harsh realities of sweeping self-identity changes

964
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
as we try to find ourselves

965
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,800
between our pre- and post-kid selves.

966
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,560
I used to like all the things.

967
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,000
Download One Bad Mother on MaximumFun.org

968
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
for Apple podcasts.

969
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,880
And yes, there will be swears.

970
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,280
All right.

971
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,080
Well, you ready to get started?

972
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,280
Y'all settled?

973
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,120
I thought we were starting.

974
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,400
Let's roll.

975
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:34,960
This is it.

976
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,000
This is the show.

977
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,920
I've had a nap and an espresso.

978
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,960
This could go anywhere.

979
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,840
Maya, our guest this week, as surreal as it is for me to say,

980
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,480
is Mr. Jimmy Buffett.

981
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,280
Hello, and welcome to the program.

982
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,160
Oh, oh, no, I'm not going to do the show.

983
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,200
Oh, that was, well, all right, bye, everybody.

984
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,240
I just, I just decided, I didn't tell y'all that.

985
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,360
No, no, you just didn't,

986
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,200
because he called you Mr. Jimmy Buffett.

987
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,400
Was that why you didn't want to do the show?

988
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,960
Yeah, that Mr. stuff.

989
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,480
If you call me Jimmy, I'll continue.

990
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,280
But if you call me Mr. Buffett, I'm out of here.

991
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
All right, Jimmy, Jimmy it is.

992
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,720
Okay, all right, Jess.

993
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,000
You got a new-

994
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,680
Take two, hey, how you guys doing?

995
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
Hey, pretty good, doing great, Jimmy.

996
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,800
Great, great.

997
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Great, great.

998
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
You got a new album out, Buried Treasure, volume one.

999
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
Yeah, new album full of a lot of old stuff.

1000
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,760
Now, I hate listening to anything

1001
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,520
I recorded more than two weeks ago.

1002
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,440
So how do you, how did you feel digging these up

1003
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,160
and hearing them for the first time in a long time?

1004
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,840
You know, what I did is I went and into my little studio.

1005
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,160
I was in New York in the summer and I went out to the studio,

1006
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,040
I took a bottle of wine and had a few glasses of wine

1007
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,760
and went back and just, I was curious.

1008
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
And I wanted to go listen to them because,

1009
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,600
you know, the name comes from the kind of

1010
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,480
the way that it actually happened.

1011
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,840
They weren't buried in the ground, like in the dirt or anything,

1012
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:11,280
but they were actually lost tapes in some,

1013
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,720
you know, closet or storage facility.

1014
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,880
And when they went to sell the studio,

1015
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,320
they opened it up and there they were.

1016
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,840
So be that as it may, it was kind of a time machine, you know.

1017
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,600
So I was interested in the fact that there were over 120 songs there

1018
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,560
and I could not remember writing that many songs.

1019
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,160
So that's what kind of got me interested.

1020
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,320
So I wanted to go listen to them all.

1021
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,360
And so I did.

1022
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,240
And then I started laughing and it was kind of fun and amusing

1023
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,120
because good God, did I sound like, I sounded so much.

1024
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,720
I know who I was, who I was channeling in those days

1025
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,920
and it was Gordon Lightfoot.

1026
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,680
And boy, it was just, it was way too close.

1027
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,640
He should have sued me.

1028
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,680
So I listened to them all

1029
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,520
and then I tried to figure out what to do with them.

1030
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,040
And the interesting thing was, you know, first idea was,

1031
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,640
is this worth anything when people want to hear it?

1032
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,960
Because, you know, once you get to one stage,

1033
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,800
if you've survived this long in the business,

1034
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,680
it's not like trying to do something new every year

1035
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,360
and kind of keep the ball rolling.

1036
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,040
I just try to make things

1037
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,960
that if people want to add to their collection

1038
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,320
based on what they've heard

1039
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
and been such loyal fans about before,

1040
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,400
then that's what a project is.

1041
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
So I kind of put it up, weighted against those parameters,

1042
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,160
which were, you know, would this be something fans would be interested in?

1043
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,000
Something, you know, that was this raw and this far back.

1044
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,160
And I thought maybe they would,

1045
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,120
but then the other thing that kind of pushed me to the conclusion

1046
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,040
of yes, they would was that the songs themselves,

1047
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,120
when I heard them kind of conjured up visions

1048
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,640
of the people playing them,

1049
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,040
what was going on in my life at the time,

1050
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,480
which was actually nothing.

1051
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,280
Because nobody knew who I was

1052
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,000
except these five guys I'd go to the studio with.

1053
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,240
I also thought it would be unique to capture

1054
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,920
these guys who were still, A, alive

1055
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,960
and B, in mobile, who were the guys that kind of

1056
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,920
were the only ones that knew me at the time

1057
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
when they were putting bands together

1058
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,720
and helping try to promote me coming out of the studio.

1059
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,040
So I thought that was a kind of unique thing

1060
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,640
to get their perspective in.

1061
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,040
And then my daughter did a video

1062
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,640
or a little documentary on all these guys who were in the studio.

1063
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,960
So that's how the whole thing kind of,

1064
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,560
it grew into what it became.

1065
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,680
And then when it did come out,

1066
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,960
all of a sudden I looked at it and the packaging alone

1067
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,680
was worth doing it because Kim and her team,

1068
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,040
the people that did it out in New York,

1069
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,280
did a great job of putting this whole thing together.

1070
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,000
Two, again, I thought at that point

1071
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,400
we'd done what the objective was,

1072
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
was to make something that if people liked what we did,

1073
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,360
they could add this to their collection.

1074
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,120
And that's kind of the way it happened in a short version.

1075
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,600
Well, I was listening to it this morning

1076
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,480
and enjoying it a lot.

1077
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,640
So I think it's great that you got it out there.

1078
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,320
We got a lot of people wanting your sage wisdom here.

1079
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,560
A lot of our listeners wrote in with questions

1080
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,440
and I'm just gonna hit you with-

1081
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,560
Stage wisdom?

1082
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,520
Sage wisdom.

1083
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,020
I know.

1084
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,640
Did you say sage or stage?

1085
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
I can do both, which way do you want?

1086
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,120
You're sage, stage, wisdom.

1087
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,080
Sage, stage, wisdom.

1088
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,840
Stage, sage, wisdom, either way.

1089
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,200
This is the first one and you asked for questions

1090
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,080
about sailing, lionfish in Puerto Rico.

1091
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,000
We have all three covered.

1092
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,280
So you're in good hands.

1093
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,640
That covers some things, huh?

1094
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,920
We got all the bases, here we go.

1095
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,680
Here's our first question.

1096
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,400
Do you have any recommendations for a city slicker

1097
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,320
who wants to get into sailing?

1098
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,280
Are there books to read before taking an actual course?

1099
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,160
Any places or organizations that would get your seal of approval?

1100
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,600
That's from the only bait in Phinadelphia is their name.

1101
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
Phinadelphia, I like that.

1102
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,640
From a city slicker to go sailing,

1103
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,120
I would certainly say that reading is the first thing to do

1104
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,400
and read books.

1105
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,720
And then because there's so much great stuff out there

1106
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,240
and if I was going to boil it down,

1107
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
of course Treasure Island was the first one.

1108
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,920
But if you really want to read some good stuff,

1109
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,560
it would be the Patrick O'Brien series

1110
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:33,120
about Albury and I can't remember Captain Jack Albury.

1111
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,600
And I can't remember his sidekick.

1112
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,480
But it's a great series of books

1113
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,440
about the British Navy and the Napoleonic Wars.

1114
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,920
And it's because the great thing about it is

1115
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,680
it gets into the way people actually lived on boats back then.

1116
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,640
You know, we think of them as you see them in movies

1117
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,440
and there's just pirates and there's people on boats.

1118
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,480
I mean, when they went,

1119
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,320
they didn't know when they were coming back.

1120
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,200
They had live animals, you know,

1121
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,240
they all played music too because, you know,

1122
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
there was no wifi back in those days.

1123
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,800
And so most sailors had an instrument

1124
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,120
or played an instrument and it's the way also

1125
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,240
that a lot of music and different music

1126
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,000
from around the world found its way

1127
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,400
to other cultures was on boats.

1128
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,480
So that all kind of, they're great adventures

1129
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,240
but they take the essence of sailing

1130
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,280
and how people lived and how they entertained themselves

1131
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,320
when they weren't fighting

1132
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,000
or when they weren't off, you know, in raging storms.

1133
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,920
There was a lot of dull time on boats

1134
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,000
and believe me, as one who sailed a lot,

1135
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,600
you try to find some things to do.

1136
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,840
So I think reading about it first

1137
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,880
and then, you know, go down,

1138
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,720
go find yourself a little sailing school somewhere.

1139
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,840
If you live in Philly, you can go to the Jersey Shore,

1140
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,360
you know, and get in a boat and if you don't puke,

1141
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,640
then keep going.

1142
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,680
Now, I gotta be honest, of all the sailing advice

1143
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,440
I expected to get from Jimmy Buffett,

1144
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,200
make sure you read up on it first.

1145
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,960
It's not one of the things I expected to hear.

1146
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,040
Not a lot of that.

1147
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,480
You know what, I'll just go throw them in a boat

1148
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,400
and point them out there and go try to get back.

1149
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Yeah, you'll be fine, bye.

1150
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,680
Yeah, they'll figure it out, right?

1151
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,920
No, I'm not a Captain Blah, you know,

1152
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,680
you gotta read about it first, yeah.

1153
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,120
Jimmy, I got a question for you.

1154
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,440
I'm about to go on my first cruise,

1155
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,600
which will be my first time really on a ship of any note

1156
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,200
other than like a ferry.

1157
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,440
That's a boat with an engine and.

1158
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,600
True, but here's my question.

1159
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,200
That's a hotel with an engine.

1160
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,280
That's a floating hotel we're talking about, right?

1161
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,560
Yes, but will there be a point

1162
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,840
when I'm in the middle of the ocean

1163
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,280
and I can't see land anywhere and my mind just breaks

1164
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,480
and I just start screaming

1165
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,600
because that's what I'm worried about now.

1166
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I think that's called ocean madness.

1167
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,200
Yes. Ocean madness.

1168
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
Well, you know what I would do?

1169
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,680
I would start drinking seawater.

1170
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,120
Okay.

1171
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,720
And that will really make you crazy.

1172
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,560
Just really.

1173
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,520
Just lean into it.

1174
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,960
I'm just kidding.

1175
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,120
No, so I'm gonna tell you what.

1176
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,240
To me, being out of sight of land

1177
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,600
is one of the most pleasant and freeing experiences.

1178
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,600
And it'll take you, how long is your cruise?

1179
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,960
About a week.

1180
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,920
Okay, that's good.

1181
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,640
So, see, two days out, it takes a little while

1182
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,920
to kind of get your sailor's legs about you,

1183
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
even if you're on one of those big boats,

1184
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,360
because you're moving.

1185
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,360
And stay away from the buffet probably

1186
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,120
would be a good other thing to do

1187
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,320
until you get your sea legs.

1188
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,960
But even when I would go out on my little boats

1189
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,360
and once you left and you were on there,

1190
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,800
you had to kind of readjust your brain,

1191
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,600
readjust and your sense of balance has to readjust

1192
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,240
whether you're on a big ship or a little ship,

1193
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,760
it just automatically will do that

1194
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,360
because you're not on real land.

1195
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,400
So if you ever notice you get tired out there,

1196
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,520
that's your inner ear working to keep your balance up.

1197
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,680
So once you do leave land,

1198
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,160
you have to reacclimate to being on the water.

1199
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,280
So that's like two days.

1200
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,600
And then after that, your anxiety should go away

1201
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,800
and then you can relax.

1202
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,280
Yeah, just try not to think about the fact

1203
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,440
that the Poseidon adventure is based on a real story

1204
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,760
and it happens to like one third of cruise ships out there.

1205
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,800
And then the other thing I wouldn't do

1206
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,080
is look at those disaster at sea videos on YouTube

1207
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,280
before you go.

1208
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,240
There's a lot of them.

1209
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,640
Especially the ones with the cruise ships

1210
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,800
getting smacked sideways by a 50 foot wave.

1211
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,760
I wouldn't watch those.

1212
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,440
There's so many because it's so common.

1213
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,960
Oh no.

1214
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,920
Hope that helped.

1215
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,760
There's a great question here I wanna read.

1216
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,840
The question is, the boom of my sailboat is terrifying to me.

1217
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,080
I'm always worried that sucker is gonna brain me.

1218
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,840
How do I overcome my fear of the boom?

1219
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,400
And that's from Deliberate Land Dweller in Durham.

1220
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,800
Okay, it's called a boom vang.

1221
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,120
They make a device that you can put on your boom

1222
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,960
and attach to your deck,

1223
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,760
which will allow it not to hit you in your head.

1224
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,680
So go out and buy a boom vang.

1225
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,440
Now let's, Jimmy, just pretend,

1226
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,480
I mean, obviously we all know what the boom is,

1227
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,560
but let's pretend our listeners don't know

1228
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,720
what the boom of a sailboat is.

1229
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,320
And maybe you could explain that first.

1230
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,560
Okay, it's very simple, okay?

1231
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,880
The sail is triangular, so you have a mast

1232
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,200
and you raise the sail and the sail is attached to the mast,

1233
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,040
but the sail has to move.

1234
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,960
So the mast is vertical

1235
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,360
and then the boom is the section of the mast

1236
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,080
that's horizontal that the sail attaches to

1237
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,240
so it can swing back and forth

1238
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,880
because you've got to catch the wind

1239
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,400
and the wind is always moving.

1240
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,160
And the reason it's called a boom

1241
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,000
is because when it does hit you in the head, it goes boom.

1242
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,440
I don't know what they called it before that.

1243
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,080
They call it a perfectly nice steering instrument on a ship.

1244
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,320
And a boom vang is just a piece of line

1245
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,520
that will tie it to the boat

1246
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,280
that will keep it from going boom.

1247
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,600
Could you tie pillows to the boom

1248
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,320
so that if it does boom you, it's at least sort of,

1249
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,280
it cushions the blow?

1250
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,680
Of course you could, but I've never seen it.

1251
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,960
I feel like you might get some,

1252
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,720
I feel like you might get hassled by some of the other sailors.

1253
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,040
Let's say they'd probably get soggy, then mildewed,

1254
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,320
and then seagulls would shit on them and stuff like that.

1255
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,880
They could get funky in a hurry,

1256
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,440
so you might not want that pillow as protection.

1257
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,240
In my defense, a seagull can shit on any part of a boat

1258
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,400
no matter what, pretty much at any time.

1259
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,440
That is correct, yeah.

1260
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1261
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,480
Here's another question for you, Jimmy.

1262
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
There's been a push to eat lionfish

1263
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,080
in order to curb their numbers

1264
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,840
because they're an invasive species.

1265
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,440
Have you tried it, would you?

1266
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,480
And if you have, did it give you poisonous spines,

1267
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,680
I guess, growing out of your body?

1268
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,960
I don't see why that would happen.

1269
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,800
That's from James.

1270
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,280
That's from James.

1271
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,920
Well, yeah, I went to the dermatologist

1272
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,960
and I got those removed.

1273
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,560
No, no, I don't want to scare anybody

1274
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,720
because this is kind of a serious subject.

1275
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,320
They are an invasive species.

1276
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,800
And the thing of it is, if you're a lover of the islands

1277
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,240
and water and diving and snorkeling and all that stuff,

1278
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,440
which, you know, if you go on vacation,

1279
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,480
that's what you want to do,

1280
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,960
lionfish are a big problem.

1281
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,880
And the fact of it is,

1282
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,520
they don't have any natural predators in the ocean.

1283
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,680
The thing of it is, you'll never get,

1284
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,000
you can't equate it with ciguatera,

1285
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,040
which you can get from like reef fish sometimes.

1286
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,120
That doesn't happen in the flesh of the lionfish.

1287
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,080
And yes, it's good.

1288
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,000
We serve it at the restaurant in Margaritaville.

1289
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,520
We make sushi out of it.

1290
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,240
And we're trying to get people interested

1291
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,080
in making it a commercial product,

1292
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,520
which makes it something that the price of it would increase

1293
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,040
so that more people would go catch them.

1294
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,600
You know, you can actually kill a fish

1295
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,560
and save a reef here.

1296
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,480
You know, that's kind of an oxymoron

1297
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,400
when you're out there thinking about trying to save the ocean.

1298
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,480
You're trying to prevent everything from dying,

1299
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,160
but you can knock off quite a few lionfish

1300
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,520
and it's going to help the ocean.

1301
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,920
So we're kind of involved actively

1302
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,280
in some ways to promote that.

1303
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,720
And people are doing it already.

1304
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,800
They have lionfish rodeos in Florida and all,

1305
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,240
but nobody has had seen them really as a food source

1306
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,760
until a couple of people started figuring out

1307
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,560
that they were good.

1308
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,440
We shot them about five or six years ago

1309
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,720
and just brought them up and cooked them

1310
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,840
and they were fine.

1311
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,360
Cleaning them is a bit of a problem,

1312
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,920
but then our people down in our kitchen staff

1313
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,440
at the hotel in Hollywood have done just that

1314
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,000
to made it an easier way to clean it and not get poked.

1315
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,320
And so the only danger to that is in cleaning it.

1316
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,440
It's not going to kill you though,

1317
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,120
but it does hurt like hell.

1318
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,320
But anyway, we're looking at better ways

1319
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,120
that we could clean them more efficiently

1320
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,880
and make them more of a food commodity

1321
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,480
because the fish does taste great.

1322
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,040
And that's a great way to get the invasive species

1323
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,840
under control.

1324
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,720
So we're going to do it and we're doing it at the hotel.

1325
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,600
We're going to start doing it down at our little restaurant

1326
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,760
at the cruise ship dock in Belize.

1327
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,920
If you get, who's going on the cruise,

1328
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,560
Travis or Griffin or just Travis?

1329
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,200
Just Travis.

1330
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,120
Are you going to go to Belize?

1331
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,280
I don't think so.

1332
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,840
Not unless things go horribly awry.

1333
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,320
Yeah, if he ends up in Belize,

1334
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,760
something has gone terribly wrong with his-

1335
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,120
A perfect storm situation.

1336
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,640
Well, I was going to say, if you get down there,

1337
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,640
you could go try some lionfish, you know?

1338
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,720
I do really want to eat lionfish now.

1339
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,960
Where are you going?

1340
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,160
We're going down to Cozumel and Cabo.

1341
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,880
You're going to Key West?

1342
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,160
No, Cozumel and Cabo, okay.

1343
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,640
I tell you, Jimmy, if you've never been to Mexico,

1344
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,320
you should totally check it out.

1345
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,600
It's pretty sick, yeah.

1346
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,040
I've heard of it.

1347
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,080
That's right.

1348
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,240
Have you ever thought about doing an all-you-can-eat

1349
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,560
lionfish night in Margaritaville?

1350
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,400
I've always wanted to be an inspirational

1351
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,600
environmental hero by eating a lot of fish.

1352
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,080
I'm in.

1353
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,240
What I am going to do is go out,

1354
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,520
and when I get back from,

1355
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
I got to go up and work on the musical.

1356
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,120
When I get done with that, I'm going to go out on the boat

1357
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,200
and with Carlo, my head chef down there,

1358
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
who kind of started this thing,

1359
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,280
I'm going to go out and shoot some lionfish with him,

1360
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,880
and he's going to teach me how to clean them,

1361
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,400
and then we're going to cook them right there on the boat,

1362
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,680
and then make a video.

1363
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,000
Please be careful.

1364
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,640
You've said shoot a couple of times now, and I'm wondering if you can-

1365
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,200
Yes, spear guns.

1366
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,720
Oh, spear guns.

1367
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,200
Okay, yes.

1368
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,240
That makes a lot of sense now.

1369
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,800
Not like shotguns.

1370
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,080
No, I'm not taking an AR-15 on your boat right now.

1371
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,560
I feel like if we could rebrand the lionfish,

1372
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,200
because that's probably my hang up with it,

1373
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,480
is that it sounds dangerous.

1374
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,120
But the name tuna,

1375
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,720
the reason there's only four tuna left,

1376
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,080
is the name tuna, just that name sounds so good.

1377
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,480
Right.

1378
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,240
It sounds really tasty, and safe, and huge, and awesome.

1379
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,840
What about tasty fish?

1380
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,240
Tasty fish.

1381
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,920
We call the lionfish tasty fish.

1382
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,920
Tasty, there you go, just call it tasty fish.

1383
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,280
Tasty fish.

1384
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
And we changed tuna to big poison monster.

1385
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,640
I don't think we need to drag tuna through the mud.

1386
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,280
No, come on, yeah, come on.

1387
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,160
Tuna, yeah, tuna's got enough problems here.

1388
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,520
We got to get, yeah.

1389
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,200
But tasty fish.

1390
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,880
Well, you know, when you go into any restaurant now,

1391
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,240
and they're serving you like sea bass,

1392
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,480
you know, that's a complete, that's fake fish.

1393
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:41,760
Oh.

1394
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,640
Oh, no.

1395
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,320
No hamburger, or is that chicken that they-

1396
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,880
Yeah, I think they serve a lot of it at the White House,

1397
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,920
fake fish these days.

1398
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,560
But no, it's called the, let's see, it's the tooth fish,

1399
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,760
but it's like the Argentina, the South Atlantic tooth fish.

1400
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,440
And that's what they are, they're called,

1401
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,200
and to your point, nobody's going to eat a tooth fish

1402
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,520
with that name, so they just basically renamed them sea bass.

1403
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,560
See, let's do that for lionfish.

1404
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,880
Chilean sea bass, you know.

1405
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,520
They're not any bass out there at all, they're tooth fish.

1406
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:21,520
So the lionfish becomes the temptingly tasty fish.

1407
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,880
Yeah, go for it.

1408
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,840
Totally eat that.

1409
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,000
I have like a, I have a practical question

1410
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,200
that wasn't sent in by the audience,

1411
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,880
but it's something that I struggle with every time

1412
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,560
I go to, every time I go to the beach, I always feel,

1413
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,400
and I enjoy going to the beach,

1414
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,160
I always feel like I forgot something,

1415
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,720
like I could have brought something

1416
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,560
to help me feel more comfortable at the beach,

1417
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,720
like maybe a better chair so that I'm not getting all sandy,

1418
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,640
or it's like a sunshade to-

1419
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,000
You notice that the beach has sand on it, correct?

1420
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,880
The beach has sand on it, and it gets all over.

1421
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,200
It gets all over, I'm curious, when you go to the beach,

1422
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,440
which I imagine you do sometimes,

1423
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,600
what do you take, like what do you bring with you?

1424
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,480
What are like your beach, like survival tools?

1425
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,720
My beach survival tool.

1426
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,400
Yeah, like a drink or an umbrella.

1427
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,800
Because I feel like if I saw Jimmy Buffett at the beach,

1428
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,320
I would start to get real paranoid

1429
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,080
to make sure I'm doing everything right,

1430
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,000
and just sort of try to do-

1431
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,080
What I would bring to the beach is my van

1432
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,600
that has everything in it.

1433
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,560
There we go.

1434
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,200
That's so good.

1435
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,960
Just drive it right onto the beach.

1436
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,760
Drive it, it's four-wheel drive, you drive onto the beach,

1437
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,640
and get a van.

1438
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,200
That's the first thing I do, and put all your stuff in it.

1439
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,120
And they make little vans and big vans,

1440
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,880
you know, you can get a little Volkswagen van,

1441
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,240
four-wheel drive, let a little air out of the tires,

1442
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,000
put it right out on the beach, and there you go.

1443
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
And you can take everything you want.

1444
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,680
That's a good solution.

1445
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,040
That's a good solution.

1446
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,680
That's really good.

1447
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,120
I'm gonna read another audience question.

1448
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:47,520
Okay.

1449
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,160
Several years ago, my sister went to Puerto Rico

1450
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,440
and brought some home massive avocados.

1451
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,760
They were the best avocados I have ever had,

1452
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,600
and the guacamole we made from them

1453
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,640
has made all the guacamole scents seem like trash.

1454
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,360
How do I deal with my unreasonably high standards,

1455
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,160
and that's from Avocado Don't, know how to quit you?

1456
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,080
Avocado Don't.

1457
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,080
Well, I think the thing of it is,

1458
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,240
I would kind of research the fact of what's going on

1459
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,320
in Puerto Rico in terms of agriculture,

1460
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,240
and if your avocado groves are still there,

1461
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,560
and if they're not, then I'm sure that there's some people.

1462
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,400
There's a lot of people doing great things

1463
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,400
in Puerto Rico right now.

1464
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,600
I don't know if you ever,

1465
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,880
did you see Jose Reyes' piece on 60 Minutes the other day

1466
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,000
about cooking down there?

1467
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,160
If not, you should check it out.

1468
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,960
I mean, he literally took the terrible situation

1469
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,520
where there was, and as he said, there was food there,

1470
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,880
but people, they were in charge, didn't know how to do it.

1471
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,040
He went down and in a matter of two weeks

1472
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,680
was cooking for 100,000 people a day.

1473
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,120
It's a pretty amazing story.

1474
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:59,600
So there's that kind of care

1475
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,560
and that kind of wanting to help on the ground in Puerto Rico,

1476
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,000
and I bet you that somebody is reforesting at this moment

1477
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,080
or else evaluating where those giant beautiful avocados are.

1478
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,520
So maybe you want to get involved,

1479
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,320
and because the thing about it is as disastrous as hurricanes

1480
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,480
are having grown up in Hurricane Alley on the Gulf Coast

1481
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,880
and lived amongst hurricanes,

1482
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,080
the nature comes back pretty quick in the tropics,

1483
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,920
and it's amazing how fast things grow again.

1484
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,440
So I think your avocados will be back

1485
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,760
and maybe you could help them get back.

1486
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,840
And help Puerto Rico recover

1487
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,320
and provide any kind of relief that you possibly,

1488
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,440
it's been like a couple of months,

1489
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,680
but obviously they still need help.

1490
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,440
So this is probably a good time to mention

1491
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,480
anything you can give to any organization

1492
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,320
that you think can help, like UNICEF for-

1493
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,200
The Hispanic Federation is doing a ton of good stuff.

1494
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,960
Yeah, and they're doing stuff down there.

1495
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,800
And if you can get direct to people that are,

1496
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,160
our hotel got severely damaged there.

1497
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,080
So we're basically getting all of our employees back to work,

1498
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,440
cleaning up and getting the hotel back into shape.

1499
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,480
So, you know, and trying to just at that level

1500
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,240
make sure that everybody has something to do

1501
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,800
as in the process of recovery is going along.

1502
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,120
Jim, we got a lot of different versions of this question,

1503
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,200
but this one kind of sums it up.

1504
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,880
I work a fairly standard dead-end office job.

1505
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,040
As you can imagine, life within a cubicle

1506
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,440
can be unglamorous and sometimes stressful.

1507
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,760
I don't have the time to get away from it all often.

1508
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,440
Any tips for relaxing

1509
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,680
and finding my own cheeseburger in paradise

1510
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,040
in everyday life?

1511
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,840
And that's from Big Boy Job in Baltimore.

1512
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,520
Big Boy Job in Baltimore.

1513
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,360
I would, I'd go find myself a local bar.

1514
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,800
That's what I would do first.

1515
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,680
And they probably had good crab cakes in.

1516
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,000
And I know some of those exist in Baltimore.

1517
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,680
And just the other thing to do,

1518
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,960
is to get outside a little more,

1519
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,680
even if it's cold or even if it's not pouring down rain,

1520
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,160
just to get out and walk around without sunglasses

1521
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,360
or any glasses on about 45 minutes a day.

1522
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,200
It kind of recharges your batteries.

1523
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,600
What about corrective glasses, like for bad vision?

1524
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,520
Just take them off and try not to walk in traffic

1525
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,960
while you're using your phone.

1526
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,560
Do you feel a lot of pressure

1527
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,360
to always be the calmest person in the room

1528
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,040
in your day-to-day life?

1529
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,280
I feel like if I was doing something

1530
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,880
and I saw Jimmy Buffett stressed out,

1531
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,720
I would probably flip my shit, honestly.

1532
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,000
It's Jimmy Buffett, man.

1533
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,440
Oh God, get out of here.

1534
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,880
Jimmy Buffett's not calm.

1535
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,400
None of us can be calm right now.

1536
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,440
We all have to freak out.

1537
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,720
There are days, let's say that I,

1538
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,040
well, I get attentive, okay?

1539
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,560
I don't know if I will.

1540
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,760
That's the top of the scale.

1541
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,920
Yeah, being rather attentive to a situation

1542
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,160
might get at the top of the scale there, you know?

1543
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,560
But I've had a few close calls

1544
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,960
and it's either I'm either still supposed to be here

1545
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,280
or I'm making up for lost time

1546
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,600
because I should not be here or I'm supposed to be here.

1547
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,400
So either way, I'm still glad I am here

1548
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,800
and I'm not on the front nine anymore.

1549
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,320
So I think the older you get,

1550
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,760
all the stresses of life seem to go away

1551
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,880
because you don't have a lot of time

1552
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,800
to deal with that shit, you know?

1553
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,360
So why not go out and try to enjoy every day you got

1554
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,880
and not let everything get you down?

1555
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,680
Jimmy, the last time you went to the doctor

1556
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,280
was your blood pressure four?

1557
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,880
No, I got my Apple watch on.

1558
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,960
I'll tell you what it is right now, okay?

1559
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,600
You want to know?

1560
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,680
I actually am really curious.

1561
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,360
I'm super curious what your blood pressure is.

1562
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,160
Get a blood pressure check.

1563
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,200
Get a pulse rate check.

1564
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,640
Okay, here it's measuring now.

1565
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,400
Okay, let's see here.

1566
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,240
It's 54 beats a minute.

1567
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,360
Wow, really?

1568
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,480
That's amazing.

1569
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,280
Your resting heart rate is like 88 on a good day.

1570
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,080
That's insane.

1571
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:08,800
What's yours now?

1572
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,400
I'm at 99.

1573
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,040
That's rough.

1574
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,320
I almost have two Jimmy Buffett hearts inside of me.

1575
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,560
I'm at 86, but I'm also recording a podcast with Jimmy Buffett.

1576
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,400
So I feel like I'm allowed to kind of do

1577
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,200
whatever my heart's going to do.

1578
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,400
Have a heightened state.

1579
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,240
Wait, this podcast is making your blood pressure rise.

1580
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:28,800
That's cool.

1581
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,680
Yeah, it's about the most stressful thing that I do,

1582
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,720
believe it or not.

1583
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,440
It's really cool.

1584
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,040
As shameful as that is.

1585
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,800
It's really cool and killing all three of us.

1586
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,440
I think you're holding it together pretty well.

1587
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,680
I do.

1588
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,480
Thanks.

1589
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,040
Well, this is the closest we get to physical labor.

1590
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,160
Yeah, this is the hardest.

1591
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:42,400
Yeah.

1592
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,800
Where would you rate on a scale of very chill to attentive,

1593
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,320
creating a musical based on your music,

1594
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,640
Escape to Margaritaville, which just finished.

1595
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,320
It's about to wrap up, I guess, tomorrow.

1596
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,560
It's run in Chicago and then it's moving to Broadway

1597
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,000
middle of February.

1598
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,440
How sort of stressful was that?

1599
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,360
Or is that more of a joyful thing?

1600
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,480
Or how was that for you?

1601
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,680
It's a bit of yin and yang there because, of course,

1602
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,200
it's a dream come true and I've always loved musical theater.

1603
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,840
And the actual fact that it's happening,

1604
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,000
I mean, as I've been to shows,

1605
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,800
we've been in La Jolla, New Orleans, Houston,

1606
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,920
now in Chicago.

1607
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,040
I sit out there and I love watching the audience

1608
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,400
because I don't get out there that much.

1609
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,280
And I love that this show really entertains them.

1610
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,800
And I get a big kick out of watching people enjoy the show.

1611
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,120
And I have to pinch myself to believe

1612
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,320
that this is actually happening.

1613
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,680
We're going to Broadway.

1614
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,280
And then, I mean, and Justin, you were there

1615
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,240
when your good friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda,

1616
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,280
brought you to the show.

1617
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,280
And then we could have, how do you think I felt

1618
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,120
when he came out and we did Margaritaville?

1619
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,440
I go, God, this is cool.

1620
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,440
But I got a little over than attentive.

1621
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,320
I got excited.

1622
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,600
When Lin-Manuel came on the stage.

1623
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,400
Yes, I did.

1624
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,480
Which show do you think is better,

1625
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,560
Escape to Margaritaville or Escape to Margaritaville?

1626
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,680
Margaritaville or Hamilton?

1627
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,600
And this is the question that is on everyone's lips.

1628
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,760
Oh my God, oh God, okay.

1629
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,960
Well, let's just say this.

1630
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,360
I like them both, but nobody gets killed in Margaritaville.

1631
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,440
And they don't drop any beach balls on you in Hamilton.

1632
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,440
I don't know, it's different skills.

1633
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,680
No, but when we did it that day, Justin,

1634
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,080
I thought it was pretty cool to go get a history lesson

1635
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,320
and get them, hell, I was crying at the end of Hamilton.

1636
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,480
And that's about the eighth or ninth time I've seen it.

1637
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,640
When Who Tells Your Story comes on, they got me again.

1638
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,720
That's what's great about it.

1639
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,360
But get a history lesson in the afternoon

1640
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,840
and feel like you've gone to group therapy

1641
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,840
and then go get a drink, go to Margaritaville.

1642
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,520
It's a great day in Chicago.

1643
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,800
If I could live that day every day.

1644
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,000
There's only two more of them.

1645
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,000
But you'll be able to do it in New York

1646
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,360
because we're right down the street

1647
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,960
from them in New York too.

1648
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,460
Perfect.

1649
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:00,740
All right, well, Buried Treasure Volume One is in stores now.

1650
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,580
Escaped Margaritaville moving to Broadway mid-February.

1651
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,140
You can go get tickets, escapedmargaritaville.com,

1652
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,940
I believe is the, escapedmargaritavillemusical.com.

1653
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,220
It's interesting to get those.

1654
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,140
Oh, you know what else is coming up too?

1655
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,260
It's gonna be kind of fun.

1656
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:16,740
The new Avengers movie.

1657
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,780
Working with the Eagles.

1658
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,300
Working with the Eagles in next summer.

1659
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,820
Oh, okay.

1660
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,620
Yeah, yeah, those tickets are on sale now.

1661
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,220
I've known about it for a while.

1662
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,380
It doesn't come as a surprise for me

1663
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,060
because I've known about it.

1664
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,740
It's gonna be cool because, you know,

1665
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:35,780
I kind of got my big break opening for the Eagles

1666
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:39,780
way back when for the Hotel California tour.

1667
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,100
We became great friends and they were very instrumental

1668
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,860
in me making a big leap.

1669
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,380
And so it's gonna be,

1670
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,140
we haven't played together since then

1671
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,260
and it's gonna be a lot of fun.

1672
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:49,860
And I think we're doing,

1673
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,660
we're doing with them,

1674
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:56,100
we're doing Miami, Orlando, Minneapolis,

1675
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,780
going to Minneapolis, Denver.

1676
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,580
Love Minneapolis.

1677
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,180
And I think San Francisco.

1678
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,540
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

1679
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,860
Well, next time you make it out to Cincinnati,

1680
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:05,860
I know I'll be there.

1681
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,220
If you want to pick me out of the crowd,

1682
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,260
I'll be the middle-aged guy in a Hawaiian shirt.

1683
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:14,580
So if you see that, that's me in the crowd out there.

1684
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,380
You know, I've seen like three people in Cincinnati

1685
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,020
dressed like that.

1686
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:21,700
So can you tell me what color your shirt is?

1687
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,900
Cause there'll probably be two other people.

1688
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,180
I'm the one with the huge muscles.

1689
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,340
Huge muscles.

1690
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,140
Huge muscles.

1691
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,980
Glistening muscles, glistening in the sun.

1692
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,580
Huge glistening muscles.

1693
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,660
Hawaiian shirt.

1694
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,580
Yeah, that's me.

1695
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:35,620
I'm gonna be looking for you.

1696
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,300
I'm gonna try to throw a pick in your direction.

1697
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,500
You're gonna have to really chuck it

1698
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,100
cause I usually end up towards the back,

1699
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:42,660
but I'll try to push it away for you.

1700
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,620
Will you be on the lawn?

1701
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,420
You're gonna be up high, I mean, come on, come on.

1702
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,020
I know that, I know that, yeah.

1703
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,140
I've been out there.

1704
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,500
Jimmy, before we let you go,

1705
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,020
I just wanted to thank you for the most chill

1706
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,620
My Brother, My Brother and Me segment

1707
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,460
in the history of our podcast, I feel like.

1708
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:00,980
The most relaxing segment we've ever had on the show.

1709
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:05,140
Well, man, you're saying I made podcast history today?

1710
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:05,540
There it is.

1711
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,740
Yes, absolutely.

1712
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,580
Wow, okay, well, thank you.

1713
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,020
Cause I know a lot of people listen.

1714
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:12,900
So yeah, I know there's a reason to listen

1715
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,260
cause you guys are good.

1716
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:16,900
I'm glad we could finally give you your big break, Jimmy,

1717
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,180
and really get your name out there.

1718
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,860
I've been looking for that thing, yeah.

1719
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,020
So thanks for allowing me to have my big break.

1720
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,300
All right, thank you, Jimmy.

1721
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,900
Okay, guys, have a great holiday.

1722
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,780
Okay, Finza, bye-bye.

1723
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,380
Thank you to everybody.

1724
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,900
Thank you to Jimmy Buffett, I guess,

1725
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,340
especially for coming on and doing our show.

1726
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,260
One other quick thing I wanted to mention.

1727
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,900
I have one other small thing.

1728
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,540
Candle Nights show went on sale, sold out.

1729
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,980
Thank you so much to everybody who got tickets.

1730
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,020
Can't wait to see you.

1731
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,620
If you didn't get tickets, or even if you did,

1732
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,900
and you wanna do something else this Candle Nights season,

1733
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,140
Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Central West Virginia

1734
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,660
works with a lot of LGBTQ youth in our area.

1735
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:09,940
And because of that work, they lost $80,000 in donations

1736
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:10,740
because-

1737
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,100
People are assholes.

1738
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,300
Because people are assholes.

1739
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,780
But we're not, and more importantly, you're not.

1740
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,380
So we're trying to make up the gap.

1741
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:20,020
All the money from the show is being donated to them.

1742
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,820
But my sister-in-law, Riley,

1743
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,220
is also organizing a fundraiser with us

1744
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,940
that is be a Candle Nights star.

1745
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,260
So basically, for five bucks or more,

1746
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,540
if you can afford it, that would be great,

1747
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,180
you can get a star on the Candle Nights tree.

1748
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,700
And that'll be up at our show this December.

1749
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,540
And all the profits for that,

1750
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,820
you can personalize your own star

1751
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,180
and all the profits for that

1752
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:46,980
are gonna go to the Big Brothers Big Sisters

1753
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,180
of South Central West Virginia.

1754
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:52,980
So if you could do that, it's bit.ly forward slash mbmbam stars.

1755
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,940
And we really appreciate that.

1756
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,020
Two more quick things.

1757
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,900
PodCon is this weekend.

1758
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,700
Hopefully you've heard about it before now,

1759
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,460
but if you haven't, in Seattle, December 9th and 10th,

1760
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:11,460
there's a podcast convention with my brother and my brother

1761
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,140
and me, 99% Invisible, Welcome to Night Vale,

1762
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:19,860
Last Name Basis, and also some great guests

1763
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,660
are gonna be there.

1764
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,020
Apana and Charla's gonna be there.

1765
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,380
Gabby Dunn's gonna be there.

1766
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,980
I think Hal Lublin's gonna be there.

1767
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,980
Oh, they got Hal?

1768
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,700
They got Hal, and you can attend.

1769
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,620
You can come for just $100.

1770
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,860
And even if you're not in the area,

1771
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,620
there is a $30 remote attendance option

1772
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:42,100
that's like being there, but you don't have to travel for it

1773
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,140
for just 30 bucks.

1774
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,660
What a miracle.

1775
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,100
I know, and not only were we doing it,

1776
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,620
my brother, my brother, and me there,

1777
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,620
there's gonna be a bunch of other events

1778
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,340
that we pop our heads into and do.

1779
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,900
I'm moderating a panel about collaborative storytelling

1780
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,620
with some folks from Night Vale and Black Tapes

1781
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,100
and a couple other shows that I'm pretty excited about.

1782
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,380
So that'll be something.

1783
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,980
I've never moderated before.

1784
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,700
It's gonna be great.

1785
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,580
So you can check that out.

1786
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,180
It's gonna be great, so you can check that out

1787
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:10,180
at podcon.com, P-O-D-C-O-N.com.

1788
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,740
That's this weekend, so don't wait on that.

1789
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:15,140
And get your questions in if you're gonna be there

1790
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,060
for the My Brother, My Brother, and Me show.

1791
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,100
Please, we need those.

1792
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:20,420
And one more quick plug.

1793
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:23,060
I was on Hello from the Magic Tavern this week,

1794
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,220
which was an absolute dream of mine.

1795
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,500
It's one of my favorite podcasts.

1796
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,460
If you haven't checked it out,

1797
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,020
it's one of, I think, the funniest,

1798
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:35,220
most inventive podcasts in existence right now.

1799
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,180
And I got to be on it.

1800
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,500
And I played a character named Chest Trunkborn.

1801
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,180
And you boys would be proud of me.

1802
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,340
I did my character voice through the whole episode.

1803
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:42,980
Good boy.

1804
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,420
So good.

1805
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,060
And like I said, that's Hello from the Magic Tavern.

1806
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:48,980
And I was on it this weekend.

1807
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:50,180
It was super fun.

1808
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,220
It was a great time.

1809
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,980
And Paul Sabourin makes a couple cameos in there too.

1810
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,340
So go check it out.

1811
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,900
I wanna say I'm sorry about all the plugs,

1812
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,980
but this time, and I know that's annoying.

1813
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,500
So thank you for hanging in there with us.

1814
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,260
A lot of his charity,

1815
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,180
and I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1816
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,060
You're all good people.

1817
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,860
And I know everybody is looking for opportunities

1818
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:10,980
to make the world slightly better.

1819
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,260
So apologies about that.

1820
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,860
Just kind of a confluence of everything

1821
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,900
happening at all at once.

1822
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,460
You know, end of the year.

1823
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,500
Got a lot of plates spinning.

1824
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,340
A lot of plates spinning.

1825
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,460
It'll be, so thank you for indulging us.

1826
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:21,860
We really appreciate it.

1827
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,380
Yeah, and it's not fucking over yet

1828
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,420
because I wanna thank John Roderick

1829
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,020
and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1830
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,060
It's a departure off the album,

1831
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:27,940
Putting the Days to Bed.

1832
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,300
Very good album.

1833
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,180
Very wintry.

1834
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,660
Don't sleep on One Christmas at a Time,

1835
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:35,780
the John Roderick, Jonathan Colton Christmas album.

1836
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:36,500
That's also very good.

1837
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,060
Would you like me to sing the title track?

1838
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:39,620
Yes, right now.

1839
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,820
One Christmas at a time.

1840
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:43,220
That's it.

1841
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,580
And thank you to MaximumFun.org for having us.

Hell yeah.

1848
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,700

Uh-oh.

Daughter eponymous.

1859
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:10,340
Daughter eponymous asks,

1860
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,660
why is...

1861
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,060
I'll try to stress the all caps words in here.

1862
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:23,060
Why is our government and others hiding the truth about giants?

1863
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,300
