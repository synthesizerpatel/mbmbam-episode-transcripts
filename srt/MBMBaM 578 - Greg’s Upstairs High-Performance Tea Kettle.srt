1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,260
Hello

9
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:25,560
I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog with whoof McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby brother

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,380
Griffin snubbed at the Emmys once again McElroy

12
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,220
This was my this was my year with my show for Fred

13
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,380
Jasso, yeah. Yeah, how is Fred Jasso handling the loss?

14
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Fred Jasso is pretty sad

15
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:50,520
My boy dates and could a kiss is pretty hard torn up about it because he had a he had a star turn

16
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,900
Yeah as Fred Jasso

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,540
I'm gonna tell you the thing it's most is pointing Griffin if I'm a yeah

18
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,700
Fred Jasso came out two months before that other one and nobody's talking about it. It's bullshit

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,100
It's bullshit because we don't have maybe maybe maybe Dapes and Cadaceus doesn't have an SNL

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,420
Career to fall back on like, you know that he can point to and be like, I got the chops

21
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,460
You know what? I mean? I'm like some other I mean, he's a college improv. It was pretty good. He did some college improv

22
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,520
It was mostly religious based. He was the sort of star of the BYU improv circuit

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,960
I know that you had a bit you wanted to do Travis and I'm so here for it

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,280
Okay

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,520
Yeah

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,920
You guys know and I this would be the kind of thing that we would talk about if

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,600
Ted lasso was like a show that everybody was watching or nobody was watching

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
Sort of in a weird middle ground, but nobody's talking about Ted lasso

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,920
Did you guys know there's a conspiracy theory that the guy who plays Roy Kent is CGI? I do know about this. Yeah

30
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,880
No

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,760
He just look he he looks unbelievable. Yeah, he's incredible. I love Brett Goldstein. So here's the thing you got

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,940
Can I tell you the problem? Yeah, yeah reporting my brother my brother and me

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,800
Cuz sometimes people are like you guys don't do enough questions anymore. And you know what? Okay

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,160
Yeah, I put together a list this week and there's some really just absolute bangers in there, but then also

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Like grimace is a tastebud and like that's really kind of hard

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,600
Isn't it? Yeah, can I tell you so hard? Here's the wild thing about it?

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,440
I looked it up. Do you guys know the story behind this you guys hear about this?

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,600
Travis you you legally, you know, you're

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
Thank you

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,320
Thank you. So here's okay. Here's the best part about it, right? Everybody's talking about the fact that grimace is a taste

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,900
But that's not the best part about it. Nobody's talking about Ted lasso fuck Ted lasso

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,300
No grimace is a taste but so this came from this guy Brian Bates

43
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,540
Who is being honored as outstanding manager of the year?

44
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,900
just a manager of one of the branches of McDonald's or whatever and the interviewer asked him like what he's grimace and Bates just

45
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:08,620
Went rogue and went an enormous taste bud. Okay, but wait, hold on what he shouldn't be allowed to

46
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,500
You shouldn't be allowed to do that. What I mean, it's a manager of the year

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,020
It's true. I get that but you don't get creative rights for the front. You don't get to rest recruit the the sort of

48
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,900
CCO wheel just because you did a good job running a McDonald's

49
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,180
But I'll tell you that's what gets Bates to be the manager of the year that take charge attitude

50
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,940
What's like what is grimacing? It's like well if no one's gonna decide I'll decide right now buck stops here. He's a taste bud

51
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,780
Okay, I would say a bold

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
Call. I mean he could have said

53
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,860
Anything else and it would have made a lot more sense. I thought he was like a lung. Oh

54
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,140
Like one of those like this is what happens when you smoke cigarettes. I thought he was a lung that warned you against vaping

55
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh, I see

56
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,980
Yeah, or possibly maybe a very very very sick chicken nugget that fell behind a cash register or something for 15 years

57
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,380
And then they upgraded the cash registers and we're like, what the fuck is that?

58
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,820
So McDonald's had to make an official statement about it

59
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,060
And tell me if you could tell me which one of these three things

60
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,900
Grimace actually is based on the way they structure this sentence whether he's a taste bud a milkshake or just your favorite purple blob

61
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,500
The best part about grimace is that he means different things to different people. Okay, but he's not a fucking milkshake

62
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,460
Uh-huh. He used to be an evil character who stole milkshakes. Yes, but that does not mean that he is a milkshake

63
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,780
You know what? I know that that would be ridiculous

64
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,440
Just because Fred just because Fred Jasso runs around stealing all the soccer balls from all the players in

65
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,060
London that doesn't make him a soccer ball. Do you know what I mean?

66
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,420
Do you think that McDonald's when they originally had the characters of Hamburglar and Mayor McCheese were angling towards like and then one day

67
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,060
The Hamburglar takes his head off

68
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,500
Just steals his head to consume it and then like talk about it

69
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,500
But here's the thing that I realized reading this this story. Okay, we really know about grimace

70
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,820
Tell me right now you guys grew up in like the 80s and 90s. Yeah, what the fuck do you know about grimace?

71
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,460
He used to have two pairs arms like a Goro. Uh-huh. Interesting. That's true. But what do you know about his personality?

72
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,700
He's not happy to be there. He's not he's not um, he's not smart. Oh

73
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,780
Oh, he's filling that Patrick Starr

74
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,320
Sort of yeah. Yeah, both sort of he's filling that void both sort of

75
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,820
Spiritually and physically. Oh, so what you're saying Griffin is that Ronald keeps him around to make him look smart

76
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:52,420
Didn't McDonald's in their official statements say whether he's a milkshake or a blob. We don't fucking know

77
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,840
Yeah, then maybe you shouldn't have introduced him to the cannon

78
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,200
Well, they also say in the statement whatever he is. We're just proud our bestie makes people happy and that's what got me wondering

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,840
When you see grimace, are you like, oh, I'm filled with happiness. Oh, I'm so fucking happy right now

80
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,000
I would say first off you guys have not put that motherfucker in an ad for 20 years. This is my bestie

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,280
Yeah, your besties like corn syrup like it's not grimace

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,520
I don't even know if they're using Ronald that much anymore. No, they retired all of them when with a bunch of

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,480
Real party poopers decided to dress up like killer clowns and hide in bushes and scare people

84
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,320
Ronald got shuffled aside. Thank you. Take talk as always. Good job. I think they should just be very

85
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,960
Happy that Brian didn't go wilder because he had the stage

86
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,120
Yeah, for some reason Brian was handed the conch shell my man could have fully been like, oh

87
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,920
Ronald he's a sapient wolf

88
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,820
Oh

89
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,440
What's grimace do? Well, he's an alien and he's here to impregnate all of our pineapples

90
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,040
What what the a lot of people won't tell you is if you let grimace it gets you high

91
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Fuck and they're like, oh what is grimace? Well, he's a

92
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Representation of the darkness that lives in all of us. They're lucky. He only stuck to McDonald's

93
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Properties and wasn't like he's a tastebud

94
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,780
Gritty's a nut gritty is a gritty is a

95
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,820
Gritty's a nut sack. I can say whatever

96
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,260
Grimace is our ideal customer McDonald's

97
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,300
He's got a big fat hole ready to shove down all the different foods you have and a juicy ass

98
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,980
A juicy ass with plenty of burger space as we call it. We love it and he's kind of like a triangle

99
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,160
That's what we want. Yeah, cuz there's a he's a kind of a kind of a

100
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,140
Illuminati. Yeah. Oh have we mentioned that we're all in the Illuminati, you know heads back to Ronald

101
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,900
I'm Brian Bates out and it seems like mr. Bates. It seems like your store was there was no turnover

102
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,020
Increase affected by coven. We're just wondering what your secret is. I fucked Louie the lightning bug

103
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:14,300
Do you think you're gonna get in trouble with the McDonald's higher-ups for these guys they'll have to catch me

104
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,800
Rubble rubble and it's the perfect crime. It's the perfect crime because they can't they can't they can't fire you

105
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,640
That would be so you'd be elected president or against prime minister. Like do you can't fire you for saying that grimaces?

106
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,960
They're gonna elevate him to a place where he can be silenced right like that's what happened when you start spilling the beans like this

107
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,420
Right. It's like well, we can't fire him

108
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,800
So now he's gonna be like, you know a CEO or like he's gonna be in charge of like food studies or whatever

109
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,860
And we're gonna lock him away in like whatever a McDonald's version of area 54 is which is probably just area 54

110
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
It's not area 54

111
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,320
54 is the sexy club. Okay and

112
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,280
In studio 51 is the science club where they have aliens that dance all night

113
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Area 54 is the sexy club for nerds

114
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Wait, does that exist wait fuck does that exist cuz we can capitalize on that

115
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,220
Definitely. All right. Listen, well, that's that's enough of McDonald land top. We talked a lot about McDonald land care bring back birdie

116
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,040
She's a strong character. Birdie was the one birdie was cookies, right?

117
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
I

118
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,920
Thought birdie. Well, yeah, she wouldn't be literally times a flat circle. Yeah, it's true. I can't talk about

119
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Nuggets who wanted to be we gotta get out we gotta go we gotta go. You're right. You're right. Let's do a question. Yeah

120
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,560
This is I say this is my show. It's there's no way my brother my brother means advice shift the modular

121
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
Okay in the before times

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,860
I purchased an electric kettle for my office with the intention of providing myself and my co-workers with hot water for tea

123
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,460
Which according to Justin McElroy power rankings one of the top ten reasons to buy a kettle?

124
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,640
Absolutely hot water. Well, but it's also a power move to do it for others. Like you're you're kind of

125
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:13,320
Prometheus at that point sure we've been out of the office since March 2020 and why I'm being asked to pick up our

126
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,460
I'm gonna get something ripped a stinky beaver and then you had to reupholster the place

127
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
Oh

128
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,680
Well, it's funny is that there's somebody ripped a beaver in February 2020 unrelated and they got out just in time actually

129
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,260
I heard that this beaver was made in the lab

130
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,120
human could have made a beaver and the

131
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,780
being spread on 5g

132
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,900
The CEOs the CEO of the company is sending emails every week and like guys, we're all kovat free

133
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,060
It's aces over here. Don't worry about it. But this beaver

134
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,380
But I think we reupholster the place Tuesday, it smells fine Thursday the beaver came back

135
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,100
We think the beaver is hiding somewhere in the drop ceiling

136
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,940
We've got our best people in there

137
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,880
So anyway that happened and now we're being asked to pick up our belongings

138
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,620
Belongings so the CEO can sell the space. Good luck

139
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Sounds like fart

140
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,480
This tea kettle still belonged to me and can I take it home I

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,420
Have a tea kettle at home already the exact same kettle actually may you best love the performance

142
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,280
Once you find it you found it, you know, yeah

143
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,800
But I did buy this kettle and leaving it behind would imply it belongs to the office

144
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,980
I don't want to disappoint any of the people who will work in the new office by taking the kettle

145
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,120
But I don't know if anyone remembers I purchased the kettle to begin with is it stealing to take communal kettle that I purchased

146
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
That's from bubbling in Boston

147
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,720
I don't know if the CEO selling the space you do there's no expectation that the kettle would be left behind

148
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:14,300
It's not yeah, it doesn't commute the kettle. I think the easiest solution for this is you do raise

149
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,060
This up the flagpole to the CEO who lives at the top of the flagpole and say like hey

150
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,740
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this. This was a gift for my colleagues, but I do want a slice of

151
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:31,260
The profits from if they sell the space and the kettle goes with the state auction

152
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,900
Yes, then they should get you know

153
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
five percent of

154
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,140
this of this of the sale you could just recreate the this communal experience by every time you have a zoom call just set out

155
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,180
Like 12 cups of tea and pour it into it and then hold it up to the camera

156
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,020
So people can take drinks of it and everything that way you're still making tea for everybody and it won't be weird at all

157
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,820
We're not having enough fakey fake imaginary tea parties on thank you. Yeah, we could be having so much more fun with this

158
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:07,440
Which are imaginary biscuits? Hey, we have to get more work done on these zoom calls guys. We're having too many fucking tea parties

159
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Going under

160
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
Got a lot of thirsty teddies. I

161
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:20,140
Feel like this is a non-issue and I don't maybe it's a very very expensive kettle

162
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,420
But I also feel like if you have a kettle that is the same kettle already

163
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,140
You don't need two kettles knocking around the house

164
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,820
But oh, but I will also say has someone who is like cleaned up. So when I worked at

165
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,620
The theater like and whenever we'd have turnover or whatever people would always have this like well

166
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,860
I'll leave this behind and someone else will use it and it's like fuck no take it

167
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:49,140
Take it away because no one else will use it and it's garbage, right? So like don't leave it there. They're selling the space

168
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,940
So if you don't take it, no one else is gonna take it. I don't want to zoom in though

169
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,500
I think what the person is saying is that they didn't develop a strong

170
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:06,300
They didn't do a good job of branding the kettle as Greg's kettle. Yes, right

171
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,180
They didn't make a big and honestly everybody had a lot on their mind. I think when the kettle was first

172
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,220
They don't clarify when they just say that they bought it and then so if this was like March 1st

173
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,460
Yes, good point in Charleston. It probably got buried underneath some other news

174
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,620
That's true

175
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,940
But I would say let this be a lesson to others if you're gonna buy a communal tea kettle

176
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,080
What's the point of doing that if you're not using it to raise your profile in the office like like that water got pretty hot

177
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,140
I'm pretty quick. That's thanks to this guy. Don't burn your mouth on my super hot water. Yeah, let go of the material goods

178
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,700
You don't leave it there someone else will have to take care of it

179
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,580
Not someone else will have to take care of it

180
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,620
Like it just you don't need if you get a second kind of weekend do upstairs kettle

181
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,980
No one needs to move. We all love the idea of having a second coffee station in our home somewhere

182
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,020
We all love it

183
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,860
But none of us have it's like it's like you see people with a bar in their house like what you got a whole other

184
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,380
Set up there. You got a bunch of other glasses. Yeah, let's move to the other room

185
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,120
Right. Exactly. The party continues there. No, it doesn't

186
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,100
Especially when you're as old as we are the party will dissipate in eight steps. You can't do that

187
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,980
Yeah, here's what I'm gonna say though Justin

188
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,420
No one's gonna come through this office space like touring it to see if they want to purchase it to be like and does that?

189
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:40,140
Ten cup kettle come with the space. Is that right? Is that included? No, take it home and give it to somebody else

190
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,900
But why why it's your responsibility you brought it into the space to take it out

191
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,100
No incorrect you gave it a gift to the office. It is the CEOs responsibility. They're gonna sell this office

192
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,300
They're done with having a physical space to their employees fine

193
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,260
But they have to figure out the problem with the teacup you did a generous thing and brought in an office. Honestly, I

194
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,660
Think not providing a tea kettle to your employees is against OSHA. Yes, probably. Yeah, you've convinced me actually

195
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,260
This is the CEOs problem. It's a CEOs problem. Not yours. They're liquidating

196
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,220
Take care

197
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,700
What the fuck else are they doing? If not, you figuring this out, you know what I mean?

198
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,820
Like they do they they deliberate all the other shit out and other people are doing it

199
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,960
And so like give them something to do so they feel like ah a good day's work. I threw away a tea kettle

200
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,500
Hey, should we approach the wizard? Yeah

201
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
We're

202
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,020
Yeah, sure, I got teeth sweaters, you know what I mean, yeah, you don't want to

203
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,980
you when you supplicate yourself before the wizard of the cloud you do need to

204
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,300
Have the freshest the freshest well and the wizard always likes it when you bear your teeth

205
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,940
In a sign of submission. He thinks it's rude when you don't show your teeth that absolutely

206
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,460
A lot of people sent this one in over the course of the last couple months

207
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:08,940
So thank you to everybody who did that. It's uh, it's well, I can't find it author info on this one

208
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,820
So let's say is anonymous but there it's important question because they ask how to form an animal pack. Oh

209
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,060
Do you love animals and dream of creating a pack of them with your friends?

210
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,820
Yeah, you can now you can wait with your friends with your friends now

211
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,160
You can you can roleplay as any animal as long as you know how to form your pack and how to make it fairly

212
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,840
Realistic, I'm not interested anymore. Oh

213
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,040
fair fair did they type FA I

214
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,240
Rly or F E R a L

215
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Oh, why fairly really realistic?

216
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,460
Fairly realistic or fairly realistic now

217
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,280
They just mean sort of real like we're gonna have fun with our friends and form an animal pack

218
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:57,000
But we're not gonna be like dicks dicks about I thought that this was gonna be about how to form a pack of animals

219
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,340
Actually a way cooler wiki how a way cooler and way more useful practical wiki how article because here's here's the thing

220
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
I don't need them all the time

221
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,920
No, but I like the idea of like, oh man some shits going down to me and then just like yes

222
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,320
You know a pack of wolves shows up like you called Travis and I'm like, yes tonight we hunt

223
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,560
Yeah, um, yeah

224
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,360
I would do birds probably some sort of bird of prey some sort of raptor of this guy like a hawk or something like that

225
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,800
Just so I don't have to like keep tabs on them when I'm not fucking Raven would be cool. Are you kidding me?

226
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,720
Well, so I'm like Ravens. Yeah. Okay. Anyway collect members. We don't know how to do that

227
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,640
No, no, we don't know how to collect Ravens. No, like to gather a pack if we as a species knew how to have a pack of

228
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,520
Like collect a pack of animals every wiki. How about it? That's true

229
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,760
No, that's a good point. But this is how to have fun with your friends like at a park at a park or something

230
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,640
One collect members if you want to be an outsider and live with up to four people or less

231
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,720
You are not a full pack and therefore your miniature pack does not have to have a name

232
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,520
Members who want to be part of a pack should join a pack with at least five people or more

233
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,560
So just to start things out with if it's less than five people you are not a pack

234
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,480
You don't deserve a name and get the fuck out of here get the fuck out of this part because this is for

235
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
real animal packs only

236
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,880
This I've written there. Can it be a virtual pack Griffin?

237
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,920
Like can we it absolutely cannot be a virtual pack Travis that fucking suck

238
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,840
Thank you. Thank you for your terrible question, but some of my pack lives in like San Francisco

239
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,140
Okay, listen your pack. You can't yeah these days listen. Hey this article

240
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Take some twisty turns

241
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Decide ranks for your pack miniature packs. Don't have ranks another reason why if you're rocking with less than five people

242
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,120
Yes, is you got a clown cluster? That's not a pack

243
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,000
We can all agree that that is something that has come up in real life for that person who's writing this article, right?

244
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,980
Yeah, and Jerry before you fucking ask me again. No three is in a pack. Okay?

245
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,840
There must be a leader and the fairest way to do. This is to hold an election, you know, like wolves do

246
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,240
Remember not say that

247
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,520
No, remember not to vote for yourself if there is a tie have a mini wrestle or rock-paper-scissors battle then let the audience vote for who?

248
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
they think is the best so

249
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,800
Yeah

250
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,120
If animals any animal could vote for itself, it would absolutely do

251
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,600
Myself

252
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,160
Existence is voting for yourself. I every day. I think I'd be a great leader

253
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,000
Like that's not a rule that exists in any other election you ever like yeah

254
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,880
Oh, yeah president lost by one vote cuz I think they weren't allowed to vote for themselves. That's embarrassing

255
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,080
The rest of the pack and decide whether they just kind of dropped the word audience by the way

256
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,000
I assume they mean the rest of the pack, but they're watching

257
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,920
Yeah, there is a chance that if you're hanging out with your animal pack at the park, there might be a bit of an audience

258
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, I would guess I mean they you see people watching the SCA people down at the park, you know

259
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,120
Yeah, she's a more thing society for creative animals

260
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,900
Decide what animal the members in the pack will be and this includes many packs hold an election if there's a draw have everyone top

261
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,000
On the vote on the top two very democratic process forming an animal pack is yeah

262
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,680
I have to say this this is this is where I feel like this person writing this article has not done this

263
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
because I feel like I

264
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,780
I have a hard enough time getting friends together to like

265
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,080
Play a board game without a very clear idea of like what game we're gonna play

266
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,680
There's no I there's no way you could get a bunch of people together to do this

267
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,080
Unless you have the specific animal

268
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,640
ahead of time

269
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,240
to to lure them into this activity

270
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,980
Yeah, I also really feel like just by the very nature of this that there should be a step in this wiki

271
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,840
How that's just like hey news flash if you're the one reading this wiki how you're the leader

272
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,500
You're the leader and you get to pick the animal and everything, right?

273
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,000
What are you gonna do reach out to somebody like hey, I want you to be in charge and pick the animal

274
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,360
I just really love the idea of it. No, you're in charge take charge

275
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,880
Who's deciding who the president of the animal pack is and then deciding what the animal says because that's a good way to get stuck

276
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,920
with being like

277
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:39,080
King idiot bird or whatever. Well, oh, I have different friends though. Dick sell is the leader of different animal groups. Exactly

278
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,580
Thank you. Yes

279
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,720
Name your pack. I would make you the leader of like a parrot type group

280
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,140
Oh, I just repeat those shit that that's real nice child. No because of your beautiful plumage. Yeah, sure

281
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Because you talk good

282
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,020
Justin I think I would probably make you the leader of you know, like

283
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,060
Wow, I can't even think of it sells

284
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,740
Okay, Giselle, but yeah, I wouldn't make you the leader of a bunch of Giselle's

285
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,580
Okay. Yeah, and I think I'd be the leader of like some really cool like wolves. Yeah, but you can't

286
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,260
You can't vote for yourself though

287
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Okay, I'm gonna be a werewolf then all right name your pack this one's optional for many packs

288
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,980
So glad cuz I wanted to form a mini pack and I thought after the first point this article was not going to be for me

289
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,180
But they keep breaking me off little crumbs and I appreciate that

290
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,460
Try to use creative names instead of a more common one hold an election for the pack names

291
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,900
And if there's a tie let the leader decide again unbelievable how what what is the leader's job?

292
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
If not to decide these things

293
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,860
This is where the shit takes a turn decide your character's name gender appearance and backstory

294
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,820
You don't have to but it's more fun. It makes your pack more realistic. Okay, so all right

295
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,820
I need my boys together for the wolf pack. Oh, first of all, we didn't vote on the animal. Okay, you're yeah

296
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,780
Yeah, okay. You're right. I want to be kangaroos. Okay. We're a kangaroo pack. Who's in charge? I'm in charge great

297
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,220
My name is Mephistopheles

298
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,560
Karistikov and I am a gray kangaroo with a jetpack

299
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Oh

300
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:21,280
Okay, can we do it like a quick note session can we do this do we vote on that? No, we do not shit

301
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,280
Okay, I don't know just feels like

302
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,760
It's gonna be hard enough to convince people that we're kangaroos

303
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,160
Did you has the kangaroo make the jetpacker did like a scientist give it to you? I found it in a cave

304
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,360
Why it's a magical jetpack? Okay. Okay, Derek Derek real quick

305
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,880
Can we step outside the bit for a second? It's a magical jetpack. Like yeah, I'm sorry

306
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,800
You lost the alpha kangaroo election, but like you're kind of being an asshole right now right now

307
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,040
You are and my jetpack lets me control the mind of other kangaroos. Okay. All right. No, that's great, Derek

308
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,320
Okay, so map out your territory. Whatever this

309
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,960
Get Ally packs once you have about 10 to 20 members

310
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,600
What the fuck try to form alliances with other packs after all there's strength in numbers

311
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,800
Yeah, you know how you've heard of other people doing this thing. Yeah around you not good news

312
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,840
it's it's a jump after a jump because it's like once you have

313
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,860
Invited 15 other people. Hey, yeah, me and my friends do this thing

314
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:33,040
It's pretty cool. And if 15 people join you're like, oh damn. Did you hear about this rival group of of 20?

315
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,180
20 fake koala bears. Let's let's go get them. Let's go beat their asses though

316
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,560
Because that is actually sorry spoiler alert the next tip get rival packs once you've got 20 to 30 members

317
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,760
Start start turning down offers for others to join your pack or let the leader decide

318
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,600
Doesn't say vote on it on this one

319
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,040
But I do think that that's an option if you decline you could suggest they create a rival pack

320
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,760
I would like to address the big fake elephant in the room

321
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,400
okay, and say that if anybody's reading this and thinks

322
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:12,760
Actually, it sounds like you're a furry and that's fine. Go do that. That's awesome. It's fine. But like why are you putting it?

323
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I bet they're hurry

324
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Several furries. Let's see this who are like that sounds like so much fucking lot of work

325
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,400
How about just like get a costume and you like live your life? Yeah

326
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,720
Can you imagine going in there like I'd love to be an animal pack and then they're like, yeah

327
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
We're fucking kangaroos. I'm like, no, I'm not

328
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,360
You can all be kangaroos and I was adopted by kangaroos and I'm a marmoset or whatever like

329
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,160
I'd watch that. I'd watch that unlikely animal friend story

330
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,320
Like I'm I'm a cheetah cub that was adopted by kangaroos. I protect them now. Yeah, fuck

331
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah, actually you don't need to kangaroos are fucking terrifying. Yeah, they're really scary

332
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,040
It all kind of culminates here

333
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,160
I mean, there's more tips after this one, but tip number 10 is have battles and border raids

334
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,960
No, these can be acted out as once again

335
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,840
Many wrestles or rock-paper-scissors battles actually take that back. I would love to watch that

336
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,960
I mean, I would love to watch adults have a mini wrestle on the quad

337
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,240
That would be good for me. Okay. Okay. Okay, but here's my question and this is very important

338
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,880
It's not clarified here. Yeah, if there is a border dispute

339
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,800
Yeah, let's say a gang of

340
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,280
Rhinoceroses, yeah gang of kangaroos when they many wrestle do they have to wrestle in the manner of kangaroo?

341
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,240
Kangaroos and rhinoceroses or do they wrestle in human manner?

342
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,000
first of all the the

343
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,760
Collective name for rhino. I rhino is a crash of rhinoceri. Okay, it's very good and you gotta respect that

344
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,960
I don't I think you may have accidentally backed up into what would be the best sort of animal squad

345
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,640
Like if a crash a crash is coming your way. You don't want a mini wrestle with a crash of rhino

346
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,880
This is what I'm saying way

347
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,440
What if it's like a bunch of lemurs right and you're a gang of rhinoceri and you're like a crash, excuse me

348
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,320
And you're like, oh we can take lemurs, but then they show up and it's like some like six foot eight

349
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,720
Absolutely built human beings. You're like we are the lemurs and you're like fuck

350
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,920
I just jacked people are secretly lemurs

351
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,760
This is I'm saying and here here you are like 120 pounds soaking wet rhinoceri and like you're like fuck

352
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,960
You know what? We've overplayed our hands. I do not want a mini wrestle and once again Travis you have brought up a

353
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,720
Really interesting edge case because a group of lemurs is called the conspiracy of lemurs

354
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,240
and that's tough that's tough to beat a conspiracy of lemurs versus a crash of rhinoceri is I

355
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,800
Actually, that one's a fucking toss-up. I wanted to say two points. The first is

356
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,920
We basically did what they're describing in our safety town episode of my brother my brother

357
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,160
I mean, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's a real thing, too. Yeah

358
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,520
But the other thing I want to say is that you guys know how many spider-man villains have done this exact same thing

359
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,420
Yeah, I kind of trips you out when you think about it. Like that one guy got armor and he's like, I don't know now

360
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Everybody's like I don't think so

361
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,400
Okay, you want to challenge me cuz I'm gonna fucking hit you in the face with myself and you're like, yeah, you're right

362
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,200
Your vulture you say no way. Oh, look at him. All right. He's up there. Fuck. Oh fuck my arm

363
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,780
Oh shit, my arm fell off. Oh grew back lizard now

364
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,160
That they're more like this what they're more committed like the because they're able to deliver on some of the animal abilities

365
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
It's like less. Yeah

366
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,080
Listen if someone was like I'm a right now you're like no, you're not and they charge us through like a fucking concrete wall

367
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
You're like fuck

368
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,680
You might you charge through a concrete wall

369
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
You might be a rhino

370
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm just saying man that there are certain abilities that someone could demonstrate in front of me

371
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,680
That would make me say like well fuck I got you know, what we'll get you differently from that one

372
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,160
Yeah, you are fucking if somebody's like I'm a vulture and I was like no

373
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,680
You're not and then they like took off into the air and then buried their heads into a rotting carcass. I'd be like, oh fuck

374
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,240
Okay, fuck. Yeah, cool, man. I'm not gonna challenge you anymore. I'm so sorry

375
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,600
Michael Keaton's eating a dead buffalo that's been there for a while. Holy shit. I know awesome

376
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,400
That guy's awesome this fuck

377
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,360
Can I also say that there's part of me that 12 year old and maybe even older than that Travis would have been like, yeah

378
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,560
Let's go fucking be a pack of wolves in the park. That sounds fucking awesome

379
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,000
I would have totally done this and I I maybe have poked fun at this thing

380
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,560
Then I would sincerely want to do. Yeah, sure just burn down the rest of this

381
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Let everyone know about it is step 11 with posters all around the campus

382
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let me say as a person who has cared about things before don't do that

383
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,520
Don't do that get the leader to make about three to five rules that all pack members must obey

384
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
There's no way that that could go bad

385
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,080
And that is also the best best part about being an alpha wolf in any man

386
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:06,000
Pack is having to make and enforce rules. Yeah. Yeah, I get all the spaghetti Charles. I don't know what that

387
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,480
Means but it's on the it's on it is on the ledger

388
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:16,600
So only six beers per night per person per day Charles. That's a lot

389
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,200
That was only seven beers. You just

390
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,220
Said six Charles. I'm thirsty. I know what I said

391
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,240
Grimace is a taste bud. You can't actually put that one

392
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Anymore

393
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,520
Not since you smash through the wall of the break career charging yelling about how you are a rhinoceros

394
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,440
Established a lot of rhinoceros cred. Yeah. Yeah, and you and don't and Jerry Maguire style

395
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,520
You did pull a lot of people away from that company to join your your Rhino company

396
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,240
But you don't seem to have any kind of like business plan and we all kind of thought this would be a rhino business

397
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,200
Yeah, and you know what we were wrong

398
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,760
But we didn't know we were all so confused and we breathed in so much dust from just a plaster

399
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,480
You had shouted into the air and we all can we go back to work? Hey Charles, can we go get our jobs back?

400
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,720
you know these alt-right goofballs are

401
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,940
Calling a lot of more traditional conservatives

402
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,120
Rhinos like Republican in name only and do they not realize that that's like

403
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,020
That sounds awesome. Yep

404
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,700
Like you're you're being a real fucking rhino right now

405
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,860
Like you mean the big strong animal with the horn that charges and blows up a Jeep by running into it. Thank you very much

406
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,640
Anyway, that's some that's some political hold on and that's some

407
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,080
Oh, hold on and that's some of my political humor

408
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Can we take a quick break and come right back with more great comedy, um, are we gonna I mean are we gonna do ads

409
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,200
Yeah, yeah, I mean that's another way of saying it. Okay. I'm just trying to spice it up a little bit

410
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Well, you just made it sound like we were gonna like

411
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,160
Take a quick break and then let Justin and Travis the Griffith take up the commerce boys. Yeah

412
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,920
I say cause money bros and then and then we'll come back sort of the fun. We'll be like get out of here

413
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Yeah business business

414
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
finance bros

415
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Yeah, I don't think you can I don't that's taken actually

416
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,140
Okay, we're now come on. It's time to go to the money zone

417
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,140

426
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:14,000
And it is absolutely changed my life for the better and everyone I know who has tried therapy or tried just talking to somebody

427
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,760
It's really helped and you may not be feeling you know, like you need it or or anything like that

428
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,920
but if your stress is high, you can probably take a chance to unload and

429
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,840
Do that man. It really helps talk to somebody who's completely unbiased about your life

450
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,400

454
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,700
You know, I can't get Santa Fe bagels anywhere. Yeah, you got you got to get those and they do

455
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,300
They just put them on a zip line and

456
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,000
The bagel zips down the line to your door. That's a special thing

457
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,920
They do because Santa Fe is the highest point in the country. So for a limited time

471

How about another question sure I

472
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
recently moved to a really

473
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,880
One no jokes. No, uh, none of your cut-ups. No your classic cut-ups. Okay. No

474
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:26,360
I recently moved to a new state. I didn't know my podcast. Come on. You don't understand me. I

475
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:35,960
Want a bunch I want a bunch squad squad. I was kind of going for a BC boy

476
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,900
No, I got that but the problem is the question asker listening the show like oh my question. Oh, no

477
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Yeah, we're gonna get back to it, okay, we're gonna do a two-minute month on your quick. All right, this is quick ones

478
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,040
Um Panda Express to test orange chicken sandwich. This is just to say wait, hold on

479
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:04,320
Wait, did you say Panda Express to test orange chicken sandwich? And this is just to say how fucking dare you we're trying to hear

480
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
I thought you said detest

481
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,200
That they didn't they came up with it. They were like, fuck this awful

482
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,980
I was just wondering the chicken sandwich wars. How dare us just from that headline?

483
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,280
I would like to think that the test is like can we even do this wouldn't it be great?

484
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,940
If that if Panda Express is like we were going to and then we realize we can't do this and we wanted to announce our

485
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,680
Restraint, you know, here's the problem guys the orange chicken. It's all sloppy. We put it on the sandwich to break

486
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,280
It's all slow. We don't know what the fuck to do with this. I hate it. I hate this falls apart

487
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,520
You know the chicken sandwich wars were attempted to be ended by Popeye's right? This is like a month ago

488
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,960
It's still fucking going Panda Express is like can we get up in this?

489
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,800
It's like please I'd rather you did not not Taco Bell is like, I don't know if we're in it or not

490
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,600
Then and now you got jack-in-the-box, which is introduced to the new cluck chicken sandwich and a bbq cluck chicken

491
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Okay. All right. So so the reason I'm

492
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,780
Jack in the box when the nation that's all right

493
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:15,860
Hey, if you need a minute jack-in-the-box announced the rollout of its new cluck chicken sandwich and bbq cluck chicken sandwich a company

494
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,680
Thank you for pronouncing that correctly. By the way, no one ever pronounces that

495
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
cheap marketing campaign

496
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:28,860
Meant to poke fun at the infamous chicken wars, which I will remind everyone as I tried to every episode has claimed human lives

497
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,580
Along with the significantly bigger and

498
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:39,900
Crispier upgrade of the cluck chicken and this new cluck bbq cluck chicken and a bbq deluxe cluck chicken

499
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:47,800
Imagine standing before another human safe species as you and say, oh me. I'll take a bbq deluxe cluck chicken sandwich

500
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,820
The brand broke the news last week with a humorous video press release announcing that jack box

501
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,260
Try again, I guess is the name of the company because it just says jack box here, which I thought was

502
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,940
a different thing. Yeah, all right thing

503
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,020
Purchase the town it jack box had purchased the town

504
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,560
what of chicken, Alaska

505
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,860
Effectively owning chicken and winning the chicken wars for good. Okay. Okay. No. Yeah, great

506
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:27,100
Great. No. Yeah, great. There's nothing nothing bad could happen out of that right to have a company town

507
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,300
I got old-timey coal five years from now when jack box fucking succeeds

508
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,260
Yeah

509
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:38,580
Or when jack box only pays people in chicken Alaska with company script to get more chicken fries

510
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,860
To announce the rollout of the new chicken sandwiches the brand lean into its playful and comedic identity

511
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:51,060
With the campaign surrounding CEO jack boxes purchase of the small-town chicken, Alaska in exchange for

512
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:58,180
Now you may take a moment here to think about America's own troubled history with purchasing land

513
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,980
for rather ridiculous

514
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,180
Things that are not money

515
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,960
So now I'll complete the sentence and said that it bought the town of chicken, Alaska in exchange for 10,000

516
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:18,060
That doesn't seem like a lot of money it bought it's no money it's 10,000 said good point juice

517
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,100
It's 10,000 sandwiches, right?

518
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,980
Yeah, and they're but they they'll allow the brand to own chicken for good

519
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,960
Jackbox solidify the deal after a friendly negotiation with current chicken town owners

520
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
sue and max

521
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,780
Which I would love to be in the negotiation. I'm assuming that started at 8,000 chicken

522
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Max

523
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,900
Good so careful in those that goes because this could be genie rules

524
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,460
Right where you ask for that and then they deliver them all at once and you're like fuck

525
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,900
I can't eat 10,000 chicken sandwiches by the time this goes bad. He's like, well, you should have worded it more carefully

526
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,800
You want one chicken sandwich every day for 10,000 days that's how you want to phrase it my friends

527
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,620
Yeah, you should yeah, I it is not

528
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,540
clarified in here how these will be like

529
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
doled out

530
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
What's the population of chicken Alaska

531
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,700
I'm betting to

532
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,900
12

533
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,940
Damn, hold up 12 what 12 people live there?

534
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,100
So much chicken. Yeah, only 12 people. So let me just run some quick numbers

535
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,020
10,000 divided by 12. This is gonna be crazy

536
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,060
800 each one of the members of the chicken

537
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,260
community

538
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:48,220
Gets eight hundred and thirty three and a third chicken sandwiches. That's so many. They're gonna be so sick

539
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:58,540
So they did yeah, they did this whole ad about it you sound fucking bummed out juice

540
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,020
Oh, man, this one's hard cuz jack-in-the-box

541
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,580
Usually I love all their endings. I'm gonna see it play a little bit of a commercial or goes cool thing, obviously

542
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,860
Okay, Jack chicken is the French Riviera of Alaska

543
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,380
Okay, and by purchasing chicken Alaska, not only will you win these so-called chicken wars?

544
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,500
But you'll also get the chicken Creek saloon the chicken Creek cafe the chicken mercantile emporium

545
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,180
Cozy cabins and much more interesting. Okay, hear me out

546
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,680
My new cluck sandwich is bigger crispier and better than ever and I will straight-up give you

547
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,060
10,000 of them if you let me own chicken plus I'll throw in a commemorative hat

548
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,120
Wow

549
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,200
10,000 sandwiches is your

550
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,400
What can I say? All right, Jack, you've got a deal chicken is yours and it's just that

551
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,720
He didn't just buy it for 10,000 sandwiches

552
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,360
I don't for 10,000 sandwiches and a half. Yeah, and that's pretty messed up also cuz there's two people on the phone

553
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,160
Fuck you know what?

554
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,840
I love about that ad is that this spokesperson for chicken Alaska named several small businesses the chicken mercantile

555
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:24,480
Emporium the chicken Creek saloon the chicken Creek cafe all of which will probably be put out of business

556
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,560
By the info by the importing of 10

557
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
Chicken sandwiches into this town of 12

558
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,120
Yeah, that's I can't do the math of that

559
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,400
But it's a I just gonna say it's a lot of sandwiches per person and then what really?

560
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,920
We're really chaps my ass about this commercial which by the way in the 13 days since its release has had

561
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,960
Two thousand three hundred and fifty four people view it or one guy view it a lot of times

562
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:59,040
There's a message at the end where it says no, we didn't really buy chicken Alaska with our new club chicken sandwich. Come on

563
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,160
Oh, that's ridiculous. Just like the chicken wars are ridiculous. There's nothing fucking funnier

564
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,400
Me when you do a big crazy campaign like this, there's nothing funnier than when you're like

565
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,680
Also, we were joking. Hey everyone

566
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,960
Joke when they say but we're proud to call chicken Alaska our new friends and partners. Okay

567
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,320
But they just and then they did

568
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,140
Them and then it says while we don't own chicken Alaska because they're kin guys

569
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,800
This was a joke that we did for a laugh to promote chicken while we don't own chicken, Alaska

570
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,840
We did donate

571
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:46,400
Thousand dollars to help the town recover from the pandemic. Oh, all right money, please

572
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,080
Money, they did said I was thinking about 10,000 sandwiches. No, although I

573
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,720
Mean an act of largesse like that. I'm sure would have been very meaningful at the beginning, you know

574
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:05,000
Because the dollar value I don't know what these sandwiches cost, but it's probably more than a buck, right?

575
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,040
You would think you would think you

576
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:16,680
Would think if you're gonna do a bit or you give them 10,000 cluck sandwiches in this exchange for your town

577
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,400
that maybe you could give him the cash equivalent of

578
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,960
10,000 sandwiches, right? Yeah, maybe you would think that would be kind of a nice

579
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,220
It's not but it's not as clean. Is it it's just not as clean

580
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,220
All right, what's that price on that bbq cluck sandwich? They're not gonna show me on the website. Are they no, it's not

581
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,040
Cowards, we don't have a jack of the box around here son. We know what I'm saying. It's at least what?

582
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
two and a half three bucks

583
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,720
Gotta be gotta gotta be this big boy with I see I'm looking at a picture of it for pickles on it

584
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,160
That's yeah. Yeah, that's not free. I

585
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,800
Recently moved to a new state and I don't have any friends here with children do the pandemic

586
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,880
Scouts aren't posting up outside grocery stores to take your cash. How do I secure?

587
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,260
Secure, how do I secure access to girl scout cookies without in the existing kid connection?

588
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,880
That's from still mad about Savannah smiles in Savannah

589
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
How do you get?

590
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,480
Hmm I mean there's there to put jokes outside of the room there's an app

591
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,060
There's an app. Is there an app for that? There's an app for that. Yeah, it's

592
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:33,940
It's a it is called the cookie finder and it's they'll help you

593
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:41,460
They'll help you get where you're going here. Now. Are you gonna have to drive an hour and a half to get there? Maybe but

594
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,780
Worth it. How do I bet it? Yeah, because I don't want to give my cookie dollars

595
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,880
To like a girl scout who's not gonna appreciate going to camp or maybe it's just a real jag

596
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,160
yeah, and also, I mean you gotta be like I have a

597
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,960
You know, I have my my squad that I go to because I trust their product

598
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,820
But you can't just like go just you know, stop outside of some CVS or you see somebody who might be selling, you know

599
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:20,820
Cut cut tagalongs absolute sniggle friends. Yeah, you don't know. Sorry. Is this is this? Oh, this is baking soda

600
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,160
Yeah, there is baking soda you put coconut in this

601
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,720
That's if you don't like coconut and it's in something that's not supposed to have that right? Yeah. Okay. I got I got

602
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,660
That's a you know, you almost wonder if coconut was the right thing to pick. Yeah

603
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
That you didn't really buy chicken Alaska

604
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:48,520
Yeah, I mean there's there's there's it's 2021 there's digital resources for your literal every human desire

605
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:54,600
So it's tough. It's tough to deal with a question like this knowing that that is always a hundred percent going to be true

606
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,680
I was so disappointed because I I

607
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:08,040
There's a thing on the website that says you can text cookies Oh to five nine six one eight and then what happens

608
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,280
What happened was they sent me a link? Yeah, and what it did was

609
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,000
They it just sent me the Girl Scout cookies website. What a disappointment

610
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,800
Yeah, you kind of just want a text an automated text response to that to pop up that says we're on our way

611
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,880
We know what you need Justin. We're on our way

612
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:33,000
Can I just say as a parent and I don't like to play that card very often as a parent. I

613
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,860
Searched what the cookie rewards are for Girl Scouts to sell these motherfuckers

614
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
This is this is some

615
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:47,840
Chucky cheese prize counter level bullshit. Yeah for the amount of work that I the actual

616
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:54,320
Person am going to have to do to deliver these fucking cookies and you've got inflatable

617
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,880
ottoman on there come

618
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,440
Garbage that's fun a mini disco ball. Fuck you

619
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,840
Come on

620
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,760
Shake blanket sack. What the fuck you talking about?

621
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,200
You just ran into a Spencer's gifts with your arms outstretched

622
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,060
You just knock some shit off the shelves into a basket and say go for it

623
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,680
fucking horse apples a

624
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,460
Frisbee a

625
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,400
Frick if you sell

626
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:31,040
65 boxes or more you get a fucking frisbee a butterfly

627
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:39,000
carabiner for 90 they have placed a butterfly carabiner above a glow-in-the-dark flying disc fuck

628
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,080
I do want to point out Travis that the gifts are really just a way to say thank you

629
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:52,200
You're not buying the gifts what you're buying with this is the sense that you're helping a great organization fuck

630
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,480
I'm not blind the gifts Justin. It's not about the gifts. You're too old

631
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,720
You don't remember what it was like out there selling for daily on your church people. Oh

632
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:10,540
This fucking sucks when I sold the most Vidalia onions choke. Why you know what I got $200 cash

633
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,520
And it's just now as a 34 year old man hitting me is weird that you guys did sell onions

634
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,900
I got I sold boxes of Vidalia onions the sweeter than an apple vegetable was the slogan very

635
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:34,440
confusing not true either also not true and not not a fact not very sweet Vidalia onions and here's what they don't tell you

636
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:41,520
when you sell the most boxes of Vidalia onions at one point you will have in your house a lot of

637
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,240
Vidalia onions many onions. Yes, and then like a reverse loan shark

638
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,560
You have to hunt down the people who gave you their names at some point and say hey

639
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,680
Do you remember a month ago when I tricked you into buying a box of onions? It's your problem now

640
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,720
Act on this my house smells like Shrek swamp, please

641
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:12,160
And mom and dad load up the fucking Chrysler the Voyager with some boxes of stinky bitter apples

642
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:18,680
We're gonna take him to church and hope that Judy will be there cuz she got ten of these motherfuckers

643
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,520
For some reason and if she's not there bad news load him back up

644
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,860
She definitely thought she was just buying ten onions

645
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,800
Not ten boxes of onions, but that's fucking Judy's problem now now imagine if

646
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,380
For all this work. I brought home an inflatable ottoman

647
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,380
Oh

648
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,820
The Girl Scouts figured out the game though like they have the cookies there

649
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:52,000
And they're like you could be when I was a kid and I had to make money for band or whatever

650
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,520
It was a really wild system where you would show up at someone's door, and you'd be like hey

651
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,380
Do you like caramel turtles? They'd be like yeah?

652
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,460
Do you want to eat some in six weeks

653
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:13,940
I say I guess and then be like all right give me $20 what now yep?

654
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:20,940
And I promise that I a child will definitely bring you this can I a child will bring it to you

655
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,180
And then you say and then six

656
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,760
Later which is I will say though adults if this does happen

657
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:34,660
This is an amazing gift you could give to yourself because it is so rare that a child just walks up to your door

658
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:39,060
They're like here's the candy like oh hell. Yeah, thanks past me

659
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:45,020
I appreciate it, but it's a wild system like remember when you bought some caramel turtles from me. No absolutely not

660
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:51,420
Died in the intervening six weeks, so I guess that these are my inheritance now

661
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,580
Thank you very much the other system

662
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,380
That was very broken was here is a box of candy bars

663
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:02,020
You a 12 year old with no impulse control are now in charge of these candy bars

664
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:07,060
And we expect you to sell all of them for $1 and what that translates to you is hey mom and dad

665
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:13,820
I'm gonna need 30 bucks cuz I ate all of them because I'm a child and I was given a box of candy and no

666
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:21,180
Oversight yeah, sorry. I would eat it in my profits constantly. Yeah, I got high on my own supply mom and dad

667
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:27,900
Thanks so much for the 30 cold ones. It's crunching right into a fucking Vidalia onion like a iron chef does it?

668
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,900
Oh

669
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,000
Why to sell so many this stinky back you sold a lot of onions that trash

670
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,900
I think that's a testament to your charisma that you sold a lot. It's a lot. It was a lot

671
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,780
I I used every trick in the book

672
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,460
Vidalia onion selling

673
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:50,020
They did you guys are joking, but they do do this with like oranges. Yeah, you know wait. We're not juice

674
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,020
We're not joking joking about onions

675
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:59,620
Wait really I did that Bob. You did that. I thought you guys are having some fun. You were sweeter than an apple vegetable

676
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,500
I sold like a hundred and twenty boxes

677
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,580
They were stacked up in our dining room. How do you not they were next to the air-conditioner?

678
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:15,300
So much funnier than it's real cuz I thought it was a joke for podcast and I thought was a little nice shit for

679
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:20,660
My sensibilities you know to be like I would've been like fucking buy a case of sex dolls

680
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,660
So the podcast

681
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:31,420
Ribble I shared a bedroom with Travis during these trying times and it was like living is like sleeping inside of a Giants armpit

682
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,180
It was tough stuff

683
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,420
Especially after we had had some of those boxes for like a week

684
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,620
And it was getting harder to track down some of these deadbeats

685
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,900
And it was like hey

686
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:47,500
I'm worried that by the time I get these onions to them the products gonna be just ruined and who's that on?

687
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,380
Is that on me is that on them? Do I have to replace it? What is happening? Oh?

688
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:59,900
We ate a lot of onions in those days. Yeah, let's let's scoot. Let's scoot. Yeah, let's scoot
