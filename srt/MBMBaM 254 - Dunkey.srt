1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,040
Is he gone? Is the- check through the bar, see if he's gone.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,640
He stepped out. He went to go- he was empty and he had to go grab a refill.

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,360
Okay. Hey everybody, um, we don't have long. We have at most an hour. This is Justin McElroy,

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,680
and welcome to my brother, my brother and me 2.0 live from the, uh, Black Sight Powerade

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,480
Gulag prison deep within the bowels of Middle America. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,240
I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy. I'm your baby-est brother Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,640
Powerade is light and Powerade is life. Griffin, you have to fight. We've been taken captive by

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,720
Powerade because of our, uh, negative messages that we've sent and because we're in violation-

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,480
listen, guys, listen. Read the fine print. If you're going to commit to a contract on a relaunch

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,040
of your podcast sponsored by Powerade- Mmm, Powerade even sits music to my ears, that brand.

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,000
Griffin, you gotta snap out of it. We've been locked inside a Powerade conditioning plant

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,640
where not only is Powerade the first- the first destroyer. Not only is Powerade made here,

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,720
but also it's a secret reprogramming facility where we are being held captive.

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Powerade is double plus good is what they want us to say, but I refuse Powerade. It's the devil.

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,200
It's the devil. I never knew how deep this went. I'm- I don't- I don't want you guys to think

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,400
I've been reprogrammed. Is the- the thing is that I have suckled the jellies from the Powerade queen

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,480
directly from her larvae tap. Well, you shouldn't have done that. No one told you to do that.

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,880
But now I'm clean. I guess it's hard. It's really hard to explain this feeling.

23
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,760
Anytime we reach for a beverage or food that does not include the word mountain, alpine,

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,040
or blasted, we are smacked across the face by a very large gentleman named Raul. And it is highly

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,680
unpleasant because he has been drinking a lot of Powerade. So he is- Double strong.

26
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,280
Supreme slapping energy. And- and his palms are really moist. I don't know if that's from the

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,840
Powerade, maybe he's just so hydrated that it can't- because his palms are like moist with

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,280
blue liquid. That's the- that's the worst part is we've become reverse dehydrated. Yeah. I don't

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,480
know if there's a word for reverse dehydrated, but that is what we have become. Whatever the inverse

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,560
of cottonmouth is, uh, uh, uh, sloppy gums, we have that. We got- we got sloppy gums real bad,

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,600
you guys. I'm not gonna lie to you. But you know what? We're not gonna let that stop us

32
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
from taking your questions and turning them alchemy-like into wisdom. Let me just say this

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,680
though. In this economy, you gotta- you gotta take those brand relationships where you can get them.

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,400
And- and honestly, we're in a black site gulag, and I get slapped a lot more often- yes, okay.

35
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm a fan of the Powerade product. I do get slapped a lot more often than I would like

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,760
on a day-to-day basis by a big, big- oh my gosh, it's a very strong man. Um, but I'm not complaining

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,040
because I'm getting that cheddar. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Not actual cheddar. It's not real cheddar,

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,680
um, and it's not- We're not getting paid for this deal. We already made that perfectly clear. Well,

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,640
energy- well, energy fluid. I mean, you can't- you can't spend it at a store. You can't deposit

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,520
your energy fluid in a bank, but it keeps you energized, I think. Keeps your gum sloppy. I guess-

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,920
You can deposit it in your life bank, in your- in your soul bank, where the energy goes.

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I just- I- I think you guys are looking a gift horse in the wet mouth.

43
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
A gift queen. We're looking at a gift queen in her pupus.

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
You're looking at the gift queen's thorax.

45
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
And maybe you can't see- you can't see the gift queen for the pupus, as I always say.

46
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm in a moral quandary. I broke up with my ex six months ago, and now I'm stuck with Albatross

47
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,880
in my underwear drawer. While we were together, he surprised me on my birthday by telling me to

48
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,800
close my eyes, and he- and placing an unidentified phallic object in my hands. Upon opening my eyes,

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,600
I discovered that this object was a- Hit it. Ramp over it. Ramp over this. Do it.

50
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,520
Keep it down, Raul can hear you.

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
A DIY vibrating dildo cast from his own erect penis.

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm glad it was erect.

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,480
Yeah, thank you for clarifying erect. God forbid.

54
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,280
Is this a plastic Cheeto? What am I supposed to do with this?

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
Understandably, now that we have broken up and I am in a new relationship, I would like to return it.

56
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,480
Brothers, is there any way on earth to tactfully return my ex-boyfriend's manhood?

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,960
That's from shunning the schlong in Sydney.

58
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,200
I- all I get- I want there to be a scene of your new boyfriend like going to grab something and

59
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,520
being like, honey, what is- what is this? Honey, have you seen my sunglasses? What is this?

60
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
This looks like Mark, kind of.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I assume- Honey, is this Mark's penis?

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
This looks like a full swollen Mark. This looks like an engorged Mark.

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
This looks like a hundred percent unadulterated pure uncut Mark.

64
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,640
Well, cut. But you know what I mean. Cut. But you know what I mean, yeah.

65
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,320
Um, I- at first blush, I think why do you need to return it, throw it in the garbage,

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,720
and then throw that- Yes, correct. And then throw that garbage in a bigger garbage container

67
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,040
so that it will never- so that the- the light will never shine upon it.

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:12,080
But at the same time, this is a DIY vibrating dildo cast from his own erect penis.

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,840
There are several levels of mastery being, uh, illustrated here.

70
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,920
Like, to cast your own penis is impressive. First of all, to cast it, right, you got to get it

71
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,880
going and you got to get those juices- you got to get your craft noodle going long enough to cast it.

72
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
Yeah, then maintain that.

73
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,760
Then maintain it. Yeah, exactly.

74
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,320
That's impressive.

75
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,160
While you cover it in papier-mache and that's- I mean, that's a number one boner killer because

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
that like hardens and constricts and you would think that's a bad scene down there.

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,840
Um, so that's impressive. And then to actually fabricate a dildo from that mold,

78
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,280
really impressive. And then to imbue it with a- with a motor.

79
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,480
It's a- I'm- I'm kind of flabbergasted at the work. I mean, this is a- this is a good two-month project.

80
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
Do you think that he had to lose the penis to actually do the cast?

81
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,840
Oh, man.

82
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
Do you think that it stayed in the mold?

83
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,240
I mean, Justin, hold on. Are you acting if he removed his own penis in order to do this?

84
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,360
Like, for the sake of the gift, he was like, this must be done.

85
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
Susan deserves the best.

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,760
I just figured out why she can't throw it away because you- you- if you throw it away,

87
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,960
what if you accidentally- this seems unlikely. What if you accidentally left it on and vibrating

88
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,160
when you threw it away? Because then it would be in two trash cans and you'd see the trash can

89
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
vibrating and then you'd have to start digging through the trash and that would be a sight

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,360
if anybody were to come across that because then they would have to see you digging through trash

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,960
desperately trying to find a vibrating dildo cast in the shape of Mark's penis.

92
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Oh, we've all been there.

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,000
We've all been there.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,320
Best episode of Seinfeld ever, by the way.

95
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,760
When he drops the- when he drops the dildo cast from his own penis that he

96
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,680
had imbued with motors and life and he dropped it inside of the surgery.

97
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:12,800
The weirdest thing about the DIY angle is how long do you think he had to sort of,

98
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,360
like, agonize and debate about color of it? Because what color really captures your penis?

99
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,480
Like, what, you know-

100
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,880
Amber.

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
Amber is the color of your penis energy.

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,760
I mean, well, it's just my energy in general. I don't have a discrete penis energy color.

103
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,560
It's part of the- if you'll forgive the pun- the whole package.

104
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,080
I don't understand why this question was not- so I just threw it in a lake and now I want some

105
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
advice on some fun lake activities that I can do while I'm here.

106
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
Is this a thing that your ex-boyfriend has been asking for it back?

107
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,880
Like, what?

108
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
There is no use for this whatsoever at this point.

109
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
It is the end of your relationship and it should have disintegrated into ash.

110
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
You're not going to hand it to him and him go,

111
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,840
well, I understand. Thank you very much for returning this.

112
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
Maybe I can get my money back?

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,720
What if he- what if he could fashion it further into a strap-on and then it's like,

114
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
you do not see this coming. It's me too, penis mark.

115
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,880
I haven't-

116
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,240
Which penis is real?

117
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,080
Oh, welcome to the hall of mirrors and penises.

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
It's mirrors and penises. Good luck.

119
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
You're never getting out of here alive.

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
Do you guys want a yahoo?

121
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes, please.

122
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Let's keep this dildo bender going.

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
Let's keep this dildo vibrating.

124
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,360
Let's not also say dildo bender ever again.

125
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
This one was sent in by Jacob Wells and Evan Jones Thorn.

126
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,280
I got this from two different people.

127
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,240
So you know it's a good one.

128
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,840
Thank you, you too.

129
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,240
It's by yahoo answers user Shershaah, who says and asks,

130
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,760
Someone threw a dildo to my window.

131
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Okay, so I never experienced any- something paranormal,

132
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,320
but I remember something unusual happened around two years ago.

133
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
It was like one hour after midnight and I was planning to go to sleep,

134
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,760
but first I went to the bathroom when suddenly I was standing behind a window

135
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,960
and I noticed something long and white clashed to my window.

136
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,160
It almost looked like it fell from the clouds to my window.

137
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,680
Then I went outside to check what was going on, but there was nothing going on.

138
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
And keep in mind, my garden was closed with walls so nobody could get there.

139
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
Never wanted to talk about this because it's really weird.

140
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,400
It happened two years ago, but what do you think it was?

141
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:37,360
Come to my window, chuck a donker, watch as it thuds against glass.

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
I like that this happened and this person go,

143
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
this is too weird to ever speak of.

144
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,720
No one would understand the brush with the supernatural I have had.

145
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
And then they launched yahoo answers and they were like, I am home.

146
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Now we're in this question.

147
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Now we're in this question, do they confirm this was a dildo?

148
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
Except in the headline of it.

149
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,280
It could, let me hit you with this.

150
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,760
A thing that is-

151
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,520
You're thinking clickbait?

152
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,600
Maybe it wasn't a dildo, they're just trying to get some readers?

153
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
Yeah, I think they maximize their SEO.

154
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,080
And I'm learning a lesson from this as a content producer

155
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,680
that I need to apparently just squeeze dildos in well.

156
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,480
But like, here's a thing that's in the sky that runs into windows a lot

157
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
and then typically vanishes is birds.

158
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,440
Ghosts.

159
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,320
Dildo birds.

160
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh, birds.

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
No, just regular old birds.

162
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,560
They hit windows all the time

163
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,160
because they have a hard time understanding, you know, translucence.

164
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,640
Or did they go out and search for the dildo

165
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,960
but no dildo was to be found?

166
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I can swear it sounded like a dildo.

167
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Listen, I know a dildo when I hear one hitting a second story window

168
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,720
and that sir was a dildo.

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,680
How much do dildos cost if you don't make them yourself?

170
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
Well, depends Griffin.

171
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Like, are you looking for your basic model?

172
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
Are you looking for one with all the bells and whistles?

173
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm saying like the standard issue, the dildo you buy at Walmart.

174
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,600
I think about $50.

175
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,640
$50?

176
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,680
If you really want to get dildos.

177
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,840
No, I'm talking about the-

178
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,720
You're just talking about like just a basic dildo.

179
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,760
A bulk dildo.

180
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,040
The Volvo dildo.

181
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,960
Yeah, the Mazda.

182
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
Like a bottom shelf, like a two buck chuck dildo.

183
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
The Honda Fit dildo.

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,280
Um, you know what?

186
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,840
ExtremeRestrains.com, answer this for us.

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,240
Oh, pops right up when I type in EX in my search bar.

188
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,360
Terrific.

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
Dildos and insertables.

190
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,440
I would say you're looking at like $10 to $15.

191
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
$10 to $15, okay.

192
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,800
We are all in our own way looking for a way to make our mark on this world.

193
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,880
Um, I think you could do much worse than dropping $1,000 on a hundred dildos.

194
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,960
And then for one night, and just for shorthand, we'll call it from this point forward,

195
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,240
the best night of your life.

196
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,160
You just go from house to house pelting windows with dildos, like Johnny Dildo Seed.

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,640
And then you-

198
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,600
And wherever the dildos fall, a dildo tree grows.

199
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
It's going to make the news, guaranteed.

200
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,680
Guaranteed.

201
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
Guaranteed it's going to make the nightly news.

202
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Conan is probably going to riff about it.

203
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,640
Drudge is there.

204
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,520
It's a conspiracy.

205
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Drudge is definitely, definitely going to report on this.

206
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Loose change to-

207
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,720
Loose change to the dildo windows mystery.

208
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,280
The splurge.

209
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080
Serial season two.

210
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
Serial season two.

211
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,040
The dildo storm.

212
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,440
But what I want to talk about is not the worldwide cultural implications,

213
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,080
but about the 100 lives that you have transformed.

214
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh, like that movie Seven Pounds.

215
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
It's just like the movie Seven Pounds, except instead of killing yourself

216
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,360
and giving your organs to people, you buy a hundred dildos for a thousand dollars

217
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,200
with an amazing value at extreme exchange.

218
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,120
They almost definitely, they almost definitely offer bulk pricing.

219
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,080
Bulk rates, for sure.

220
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,400
For sure.

221
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,200
And you maybe-

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,520
Gervan, what would you think about the idea of maybe writing something on the dildo?

223
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:07,920
Keep it up.

224
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,680
That just says, well, that just says like, tomorrow's a new day.

225
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Or like, think about how your life is different tomorrow.

226
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
That's a little lengthy.

227
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,080
Just something-

228
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,640
How about this?

229
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,200
How about this?

230
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
This is not a dildo.

231
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,540
Ooh.

232
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,120
This, or like this could have been, like, think about what could have been.

233
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Maybe a dildo that makes you reflect on all your choices up till now

234
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
and makes you kind of like, Ebenezer screwed yourself.

235
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,520
That's a whole-

236
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
Really not taken.

237
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
That's a whole episode of Serial right there.

238
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,360
Right there.

239
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
Now I want to talk, we've talked about the dildo trajectory,

240
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,840
the angle, the pricing, the bulk pricing at Extreme Restraints.

241
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,160
Today I want to focus on something we mentioned in the pilot

242
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,240
of this second season of Serial that very few people are listening to now.

243
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,480
And that was the message that was inscribed on each dildo.

244
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
Is there a payphone outside Extreme Restraints?

245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,840
That's what we'll talk about next time on Serial.

246
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
You know, we've had a lot of fun here today,

247
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,320
but I think we should take a moment to reflect on the sheer terror

248
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,120
that that paper boy felt when he reached into his bag at the end of his shift

249
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,080
and found one extra paper and no dildo.

250
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,960
Why, he thought to himself, why did I keep my extra dildo in there?

251
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,520
Yeah.

252
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:23,840
This is so embarrassing.

253
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Oh, I had to take that dildo to the dildo shop to get it repaired.

254
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
How embarrassing for me.

255
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh, listen, he had a dog was chasing him, a tire for some reason,

256
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,280
a sentient tire was rolling after him.

257
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,280
He had to avoid oil slicks and people opening their doors.

258
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:41,920
It's hard out there.

259
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
There was a hand coming out of the gutter?

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
There's a, if memory serves, there was a hand coming out of the gutter.

261
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,080
Sometimes you just chuck a dildo.

262
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,920
My friend works at a bagel shop and at the end of the day,

263
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,880
the employees are allowed to take home any of the leftover bagels that didn't sell.

264
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,800
Well, my question is, should I continue accepting his kind carb loaded gifts

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
or is eating stale bagels going to lead to an early death?

266
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,600
More importantly, can I leave the bagels in my fridge and eat them two days after?

267
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,520
Three, four, that's from bone for bagels in Baltimore.

268
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,320
I have a theory about this and there's an important factor to this question.

269
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,320
And that is your age.

270
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,440
Yeah.

271
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,400
Hmm. I think that there's a certain age at which you should cut yourself off

272
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,200
from accepting leftover food from a friend's employment.

273
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,520
And what age is that, Travis?

274
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,960
It feels like to me that age is like 25, 26.

275
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,920
Wow, that's old.

276
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,080
That is a lot older than I thought it was going to be.

277
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,360
How old were you going to say?

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
20, 21.

279
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,840
No, you got to get out of college and past a couple years

280
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,280
where you're trying to figure some things out.

281
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,080
That's what I'm saying.

282
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,520
So like 24? I thought you were going to talk about the ramifications

283
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
that this has on your body.

284
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,960
I was actually thinking at the grocery store yesterday,

285
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,160
you know, I like bagels.

286
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,400
Yeah.

287
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,080
I really do. I love a good bagel.

288
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,120
I can't have those in the house.

289
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,840
I know, nor-

290
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,160
What am I going to do? Eat a bagel for breakfast?

291
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
I'll have a bagel thin.

292
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll certainly get down on a bagel thin.

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
Yes, of course a bagel thin.

294
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,000
But if I ate a bagel thick-

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,720
With smoked salmon?

296
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,000
If I ate a bagel Alan thick, that's my day and possibly my week.

297
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
I think this is a bad business strategy for this guy

298
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,400
because if you're an employee and somebody comes in,

299
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,640
your main goal, your sustainability as a going concern

300
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
is tied to you not selling all of that day's bagels.

301
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,120
Yeah.

302
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,560
What if someone comes in and they're like,

303
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,880
I want 30 bagels, that's going to tap you out.

304
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
You think, well, you know, ma'am, that may be too many bagels.

305
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Maybe you want a-

306
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,680
Sorry, were you confused?

307
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,880
These are thick bagels.

308
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,960
You get that, right?

309
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
Oh, those bagels?

310
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,480
You don't want those bagels.

311
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,600
There's a, that raises a question I've always pondered.

312
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
There's this chain of like sort of bagel,

313
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,920
coffee, pastry places called Pret-a-Manger.

314
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
I'm probably murdering-

315
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,280
One more time.

316
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,160
The pronunciation of that.

317
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
Pret-a-Manger.

318
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,960
I'm probably murdering the pronunciation.

319
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
It's pronounced Starbucks, Justin.

320
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,560
At the end of the day, they have these signs.

321
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,640
At the end of the day, they donate the food

322
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,800
that they don't sell to local homeless shelters.

323
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,680
So this has always bothered me because if you-

324
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,520
Wow, Justin, why does that, wow.

325
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
Well, let me tell you-

326
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,480
Fuck those places.

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
No, let me tell you-

328
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Just throw it away.

329
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,680
There's method to my method.

330
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
By shopping there-

331
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Oh, I see.

332
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,240
You are, with every bagel that you buy there,

333
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,040
you are taking out of the mouth of a homeless person.

334
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,880
Think about that.

335
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,800
You know what I would do in both scenarios

336
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
if I worked at these places?

337
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Either I get to take them home or they go to the less fortunate.

338
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
Both are equal in my eyes.

339
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,600
I think that I would make a big old batch of bagels

340
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
two minutes before closing.

341
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,920
Oh, you're like Robin Hood, but for yeast.

342
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,040
Yeah, set them out and be like,

343
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,000
mm, guess it didn't sell.

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
And then just put them right into my bag

345
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
or give them to the less fortunate.

346
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
How long do you think this grift's gonna last, Travis?

347
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
Not long, Justin.

348
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,560
But my question is this, in this scenario,

349
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,640
how many bagels is your friend bringing back?

350
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,880
Because maybe he works at a failing bagel place.

351
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,360
Maybe they're not doing so hot.

352
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,280
If they're overproducing like this, I guarantee,

353
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
I don't even need to look at their books.

354
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,240
They're failing.

355
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,480
Yeah.

356
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,120
They're failing.

357
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
It's all about supply and demand.

358
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
You can just get Amazon Prime, get bagels next day.

359
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, for sure.

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,280
Or same day bagels.

361
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,160
They'll do that for you.

362
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
They'll drone those bagels right to you.

363
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
I think, Justin, to return to your point,

364
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
that is a marketing ploy.

365
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
Because when you buy a bagel from,

366
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
you are understanding that you are robbing

367
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
a more needful person.

368
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,680
And so knowing that, and knowing that people are still doing it,

369
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,720
those must be some pretty good bagels.

370
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, I see.

371
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,960
Bagels that are worth stealing from a homeless person.

372
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,240
Pret-a-mer-mer-mer.

373
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,960
Bagels so good, you'll lose your sense of caring

374
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
for your fellow man.

375
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,800
I would like a bagel with everything,

376
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,720
and I want that to include guilt.

377
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
I want everything to also have that in it.

378
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
I would like a bagel to eat, and then a bagel just to throw away,

379
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,920
so I know no one else gets it.

380
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,240
I know no one else gets it.

381
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,360
I like to feed one very lucky bird a day,

382
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,560
one entire bagel.

383
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,000
Do you guys know Yahoo?

384
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:22,960
Yeah.

385
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,800
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski,

386
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,840
climbing that ladder.

387
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,400
Thank you, Zoe.

388
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, John Blix, who asks...

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
This is my favorite question we've had in a very long time.

390
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,840
I'm a big time lawyer in the city, and yet...

391
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,320
Let me finish.

392
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm a big time lawyer in the city,

393
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,920
and yet I'm addicted to donkey basketball.

394
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
All I think about, is this okay?

395
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
It started as a corporate fundraiser.

396
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
We had a gym reserved, and a company provided us with the donkeys.

397
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,840
It seemed innocent enough until game time,

398
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,680
when everything seemed to slow down,

399
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,440
and I became entranced with the game.

400
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,200
Every aspect of it seemed logical and right.

401
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
When the final buzzer sounded,

402
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,120
I had thrown up the game-winning shot.

403
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,680
Buckets.

404
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,640
My teammates rode over to me to congratulate me,

405
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,440
and I had never received such euphoria.

406
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,360
That night, I could not sleep.

407
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,040
I think about it during meetings,

408
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,600
and it is starting to interfere with my home life,

409
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
and I'm even a Republican.

410
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
I am thinking about getting professional help,

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
because I see no solution.

412
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,440
I do not want to stop thinking about it,

413
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
but I also do not want it to further hinder my life.

414
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,600
Across the city, they have another charity function,

415
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,200
and I am thinking about going,

416
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
even though I am not invited to go.

417
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,940
I'm excited.

418
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,280
If this is not the construction of the various,

419
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,000
you know, wins and changes in shifting tectonic plates

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
that create our reality,

421
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,560
if this is not a product of that,

422
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,880
but rather a shitty in-joke reference to,

423
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,560
like, a really terrible Bradley Cooper movie he made

424
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,240
before he was Bradley Cooper

425
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
that someone got for $1.50 from the hidden treasure shelf

426
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,680
at Dollar General, I'm going to be very...

427
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,720
And what would that movie be called?

428
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,920
Donkey.

429
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,120
Donkey.

430
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
The basketball playing donkey.

431
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
You guys understand that it's not the donkeys.

432
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
There are people housed.

433
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
Don't fucking ruin this for me.

434
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
I want a little magic left in the world, Griffin.

435
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,440
No, you can find different kinds of magic.

436
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,120
It is important for me, as your brother,

437
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,800
that the two of you understand,

438
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,320
no, there are human beings firmly housed upon these donks.

439
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,440
Go for three, donkey.

440
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
I forgot which animal we were talking about.

441
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,160
I could only dunk, boss.

442
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,600
I can't dunk from three.

443
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,800
You can do it, donkey.

444
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,880
Bray, bray, bray, bray.

445
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,560
Bray to the Lord, donkey.

446
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
It also has strong religious undertones.

447
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,800
That's one blessed beast.

448
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I am a big time lawyer in the city,

449
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
and I'm addicted to donkey basketball.

450
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
Your honor, if you refer to the folder of evidence

451
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
I've handed you, these are just pictures of donkeys

452
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,120
playing basketball.

453
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,240
Oh, I must have grabbed the wrong briefcase.

454
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,080
I need a recess.

455
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,680
Oh no, I'm getting too stressed out

456
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,520
and I'm transforming into donkey.

457
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
Basketball playing donkey.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
Oh no, I ate some spicy food

459
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,680
and now I'm transforming into donkey.

460
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,720
I'm transforming into donkey.

461
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,400
The basketball playing donkey.

462
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
Can somebody say hey?

463
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,120
How embarrassing.

464
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,640
There's a gray bristly hair

465
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,280
coming out of my fancy lawyer collar.

466
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,200
And I've got a big old donkey boner.

467
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,160
Can we go what episode without referencing Turbo Team?

468
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Is that like physically possible

469
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,920
to keep us from talking about Turbo Team

470
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,280
for a single episode?

471
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,440
That was also in the Powerade contract.

472
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,240
Would this person be okay with their

473
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
incurable addiction to donkey basketball

474
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,680
if they were not a big time lawyer?

475
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,040
Like if they were just a,

476
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
if they were in law school even.

477
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,600
I mean, first of all, if you're in law school,

478
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
you wouldn't have the time, I don't think, to indulge.

479
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,120
I think what we're dealing with here, Griffin,

480
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,440
is a matter of public image.

481
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
If you're like a defense lawyer,

482
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
like a family lawyer, or even like,

483
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,560
let's say like a contract lawyer,

484
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,040
you can be into donkey basketball.

485
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,440
But if you're a big time lawyer in the city,

486
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
you need to be in like gorilla basketball,

487
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
something much higher class.

488
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,080
Oh, silverback gorilla.

489
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
Maybe even human basketball.

490
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,200
That's where one human rides on another human

491
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
to play basketball upon them.

492
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,360
But they do wear long trench coats,

493
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,760
so it appears to just be super tall humans.

494
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,240
I see.

495
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
That's really weird, Travis,

496
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,720
because I was about to suggest

497
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,160
that you disguise yourself

498
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,400
by going to donkey basketball games,

499
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
by getting a friend to sit on your shoulders,

500
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,960
and then wearing an extra long trench coat,

501
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,040
so people just think there's a really tall man there.

502
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,880
And not care about his profession

503
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
or the jurisdiction in which he practices.

504
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,160
Well, they'll just assume his profession

505
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
is world's tallest man.

506
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,080
Yeah.

507
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,280
No, if you see someone that tall,

508
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,120
you assume that they're scouting donkeys

509
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
for human basketball.

510
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
This is the next big thing I'm telling you.

511
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,360
Donkey players.

512
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
Guys, I just wish I knew more about basketball

513
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,800
to make better jokes.

514
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,720
That's the only problem,

515
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
is I already said dunk and three pointer.

516
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah.

517
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,000
That's about it.

518
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
I will say this.

519
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I express surprise

520
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,360
that the owner of a basketball arena

521
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
would allow donkeys in it.

522
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,920
I feel like that would be a thing

523
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,720
where they would be like,

524
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,560
that will destroy the floors

525
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,400
and they'll probably poop everywhere.

526
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm not positive

527
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
that you would definitely need to do it

528
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,120
on like a regulation.

529
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, you're talking about that donkey street ball.

530
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,800
Oh, so like and one donkey.

531
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,560
Donkey two, take it to the streets.

532
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,280
You've forgotten your roots, donkey.

533
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,240
You gotta go back.

534
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,480
I can't go back.

535
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm too big time now.

536
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
After I got my contract with Nike

537
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,400
and I signed a powder raid deal

538
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
that was really disadvantageous.

539
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I should have read the contract.

540
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,320
If only I had a big time lawyer in the city

541
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,000
to get me out of the contract.

542
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Lawyer half a donkey.

543
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,480
You forgot your roots in the big city.

544
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,720
You gotta go back to street law.

545
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,440
You have to go back to courts in alleys

546
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,560
and the judge's hair is made

547
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,760
of torn up toilet paper.

548
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,920
Wait, hold on.

549
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,480
Wait, why would that?

550
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,520
Oh, because of the wigs.

551
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
I see there's no barristers wigs.

552
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,680
Oh, this is in England.

553
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,480
I meant to say.

554
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Don't jump right over the England setting

555
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,520
and waste that in the sequel

556
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
because that could be the third flick right there.

557
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,640
That's donkey three.

558
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
Her Majesty's secret donkey.

559
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
Also, he becomes a secret agent.

560
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,440
Yeah, well, yeah, naturally.

561
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,040
Basketball is the front to get him

562
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,640
into the Russian headquarters.

563
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,040
Listen, if you transfer an American film franchise

564
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,840
to the UK, there's gonna be spies

565
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,960
and shit up in it.

566
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,760
That's a guarantee.

567
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,960
We've found out that we've tracked down

568
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,160
this Colombian drug lord.

569
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,560
He's been hiding out in Wales

570
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,920
and he's using mules to sneak drugs

571
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,280
across the border.

572
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,880
And the donkey's like,

573
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
that sounds like a job for me.

574
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,640
I'm already there.

575
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,160
He's already out the door

576
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,960
before they're talking.

577
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,760
Tell him like, you know,

578
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,800
it's metaphorical mules,

579
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,000
but okay, donkey.

580
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,200
Do your best.

581
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,720
Dunktastic.

582
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,960
I had something I wanted to say.

583
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,600
I've forgotten.

584
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,480
Was there something about donkey?

585
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
Because it's the only thing

586
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,720
I care about anymore.

587
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,160
I remember it was in the sequel,

588
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,400
Donkey 2, dunking it to the streets.

589
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,200
Uh-huh.

590
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,400
Can we get, now, bear with me here.

591
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay, bears?

592
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,960
Yes.

593
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,120
No.

594
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,320
Okay.

595
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,960
A sexy female donkey,

596
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,920
kind of like Lola from Space Jam,

597
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,000
who did it for a lot of people.

598
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,440
Who shall remain nameless.

599
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
Who will not be named on this show.

600
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,280
But can we get a sexy female donkey

601
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,640
and maybe she's a little bit

602
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,080
more anthropomorphized?

603
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
We need something for the fellas,

604
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,040
because up till now,

605
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,880
donkey's just been all for the ladies.

606
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,360
Yeah.

607
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,120
Super quick round robin.

608
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,800
Who voices, what's her name?

609
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,300
Lola?

610
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,580
What?

611
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,240
No, not Lola Griffin.

612
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,560
Can you go five minutes of that time?

613
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
Just five minutes.

614
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,200
Griffin, can you go five minutes of that talking about Lola?

615
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I need a name for female donkey.

616
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,920
Oh, oh, oh.

617
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,720
Dunkina.

618
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,440
Patricia Arquette.

619
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,400
Dunkina is like,

620
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,280
Patricia Arquette?

621
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,080
Well, Dunkina's name can't be Patricia Arquette, Griffin.

622
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,160
You're gonna ask it for a while.

623
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm so sorry.

624
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,440
Patricia Arquette is going to voice Dunkachino,

625
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,400
because, and she's Italian.

626
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,600
She's Italian, and we all know

627
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,960
Patricia Arquette can do Italian.

628
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Oh, fuck that.

629
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,160
Then I'm getting Isabella Rossellini.

630
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,720
Oh, nice.

631
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,760
She's Dunkachino.

632
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,040
She's everywhere right now.

633
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,800
Everything has had Patricia Arquette in it.

634
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,800
And where else are we gonna do it?

635
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,360
You know, as the, as Dunkey's mom?

636
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,360
No, that's just insulting.

637
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,480
I think she needs to have a more central role in the film.

638
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,720
Could, could, could, could Patricia Arquette voice

639
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,280
Dunkey's bird buddy.

640
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,320
And that would be?

641
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,840
Uh, Larry Bird.

642
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh, we've, no, we've lost it.

643
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Let's go to the mic.

644
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,800
We had it.

645
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,760
We had it.

646
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
We had it for a bit there.

647
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,680
But then we lost it.

648
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:50,960
Patricia Arquette took it from us.

649
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,800
The undies is dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear

650
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,320
that's also fun to wear.

651
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm wearing some now.

652
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,280
What is, describe them.

653
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,400
Mmm, silky, smooth, comfort, snugness.

654
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,320
I mean, no, they're really, they're really comfortable.

655
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,240
I, I did laundry today because I was out of me undies.

656
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,120
This is true.

657
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,200
I just had terrible old underwear and I needed to replace them

658
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,040
with something that's gonna like bring glory to my frame.

659
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,320
And I did it with me undies.

660
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,560
Now these aren't just for fellas.

661
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,320
I know we're all three fellas here.

662
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
But they just launched their All of Me women's collection.

663
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,280
I'm a dog.

664
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,920
It's a four piece.

665
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm a dog.

666
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,040
It's a four piece line of undies designed specifically

667
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,880
for the female body in all of its, should I say this?

668
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,680
I'm gonna say it.

669
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,640
Ain't all it's complex, gorgeous as hell glory.

670
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,720
The real sufferers are the other two of us

671
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,560
that had to listen to the third one say it.

672
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,720
Somebody, somebody was gonna get burnt there.

673
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
You know what I think, Justin?

674
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,280
I'm just gonna say it.

675
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,400
This is controversial.

676
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,960
I know.

677
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
I think women are great.

678
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,600
Whoa.

679
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:53,840
Yeah.

680
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm gonna lay it all out on the line.

681
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,440
My main problem is referring to their bodies as complex.

682
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,920
Because I think I've got it pretty well figured out.

683
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,320
So ladies, if you can figure out.

684
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,840
By now.

685
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,360
If you can, ladies, if you can figure out a way

686
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,960
to use your confusing body to access a website,

687
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
slinging your limbs hither and yon.

688
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,280
Your tendrils.

689
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,480
Your tendrils.

690
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,000
Your probisci.

691

That's meundies.com slash my brother.

693
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,400
These really are great underwear.

694
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,040
And Sid has gotten some of the women's pairs before.

695
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,120
They're extremely comfortable and great.

696
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,200
So men and women, you are going to find something

697
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,080
that you like there.

698
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,040
You know what?

699
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,520
No matter where on the gender spectrum you fall,

700
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,880
I think you're gonna like me undies.

701
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm just gonna put it out there.

702
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,360
Except not for dogs.

703
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Not for dogs.

704
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,440
No.

705
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,560
Or donkeys.

706
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:10,880
Or donkeys.

707
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,200
20% off by going to meundies.com slash my brother.

708
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
We have another sponsor returning.

709
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,560
I think this is our second time having them on the show.

710
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,240
But I'm just as excited as the first.

711
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,120
It's SlipShot.

712
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,080
Woo.

713
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,560
Woo.

714
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,720
My Bim Bam is supported in part by SlipShine,

715
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,560

and 10 years of sexy, sex-positive adult comics

723
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,400
worth of archives.

724
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,840
That sentence got away from me.

725
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,960
But now, Griffin, what if I think that this is a cool idea

726
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,680
and I'd love to check it out, but it's important to me

727
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,720
that the landing page was specific to a podcast I enjoy.

728
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,800
You're talking about wanting to see in the same web page

729
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,120
The Three of Us, nudity, sexual intercourse

730
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,520
between two illustrated beauties,

731
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:24,640
some penises, some breasts and vaginas,

732
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
and also The Three of Us are there.

733
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,520
And also some vore.

734
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,560
And a little bit of vore.

735
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Is that something they could provide for me?

736
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,200
Yeah, I think we can do that for you.

737
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,160
It's slipshine.net slash mbmbam.

738
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,720
What are you guys into?

739
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,480
Well, I have this podcast I listen to.

740
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm also into sexual intercourse

741
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
between two consenting characters in a comic.

742
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,640
Radical.

743
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,680
We got you.

744
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,480
Maybe more.

745
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,320
I bet I have not read all 10 years of the Slipshine Archives.

746
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,520
I am betting that at some point more than two partners

747
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,560
are involved in sexual intercourse.

748
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,000
No, it's just two people.

749
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
Their names are Marcus and Danielle.

750
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,000
That is the one area in which Slipshine is not sex positive

751
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,320
is that it has to be two married adults.

752
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
That's the only thing about it that's different.

753
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,600
No, no, they got it.

754
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,040
And they don't make eye contact

755
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,160
and they do it with the lights off.

756
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,480
They got it.

757
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,200
slipshine.net slash mbmbam.

758
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,560
There's no first time sign up fee

759
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,120
and you get a 10% discount on six month

760
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,800
and yearly subscriptions.

761
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,680
They got a fresh content monthly in 10 years.

762
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,400
A decade of sexy, sexy archives.

763
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,280
Go.

764
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,480
I have a message here for Max A

765
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,240
and it's from electricity and magnetism, really.

766
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,840
And these two inscrutable primal forces of the universe

767
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,600
say to their buddy, Max A,

768
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,280
in my opinion, a better prank would be a mbmbam jumbotron spot

769
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,600
calling you out for planting a creepy picture

770
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,160
of my sister's doppelganger in her room.

771
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,000
It's also significantly more expensive,

772
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
but this is America.

773
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,720
So the people decide who the ultimate prankster really is.

774
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,120
Either way, this past year has been the best.

775
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,000
Love you always.

776
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
Man, Max is in good

777
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,720
with these two inscrutable primal forces of the universe.

778
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,400
Do you think he has control over magnetism and electricity?

779
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,120
Like he can like shoot thunder waves and stuff out of his-

780
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,800
I think he's probably a Pikachu.

781
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,360
I think he's just well acquainted with them.

782
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,560
I have another message.

783
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,680
This is fantastic.

784
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
This is for future Scott.

785
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,640
But honestly, by the time you're reading that,

786
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,840
I mean, in the exact moment that is now,

787
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,400
it's for present Scott, I would assume, right?

788
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
It was written for future Scott.

789
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,560
It's being delivered to present Scott

790
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,120
and it is from past Scott.

791
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,680
And the message is, you're doing fine.

792
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,240
Keep it up.

793
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,780
Heart.

794
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,640
There's like a less than three.

795
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,760
He didn't-

796
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:51,920
Yeah.

797
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,480
He wasn't talking.

798
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,120
Picture of a heart.

799
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,840
Hey, keep it up.

800
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,400
And also keep listening to the band Heart.

801
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,360
This is terrific.

802
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,400
Man, I hope-

803
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Keep supporting the wrestler, Brett the Hitman heart.

804
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,960
I hope this paid off.

805
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,920
It probably did, right?

806
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,400
I think right now past Scott is like, I think I did it.

807
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,160
Now past Scott can die quietly so that future Scott may live.

808
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,240
When did he throw this brick up?

809
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
When do you think he put this shot up in the air?

810
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
Let me check the email real quick.

811
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,460
What?

812
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,920
1916.

813
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,640
But that means-

814
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,920
I was wondering why this Jumbotron spot

815
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
was delivered by Western Union Telegram.

816
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,520
He made it.

817
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,800
He's alive.

818
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,520
Did the weeping angels get him?

819
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,880
Is that what's going on?

820
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,520
Telegram.

821
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,080
Telegram.

822
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,360
It says you're doing fine.

823
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,160
Keep it up.

824
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,560
And don't forget to steal your dad's car keys.

825
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,200
That's weird.

826
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,680
That's weird.

827
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,120
Garbage can.

828
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,400
Garbage can.

829
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,440
Also don't blink.

830
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,880
Oh, hey there everybody.

831
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm Guy Branham and welcome to Pop Rocket,

832
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,960
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture we all love to love.

833
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,200
With me to talk TV, film, music, and anything else entertaining

834
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,840
are journalist Margaret Wappler, academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

835
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,520
digital strategist Winona Mitchell, and comedian Santina Muha.

836
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,760
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

837
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,960
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

838
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,000
No name calling, no rudeness, just straight talk and a lot of role play.

839
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,600
I'm only 30-something for another year.

840
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,480
Me too.

841
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,040
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

842
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,040
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

843
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
My wife is a therapist with a master's degree

844
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,760
and I have a useless degree in illustration.

845
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,720
Work is not...

846
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
That is not my editorialization, by the way.

847
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,360
I think illustration degrees are great, I bet.

848
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,120
Work is not so plentiful in Indiana,

849
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,760
so I'm working as an educational assistant

850
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
and doing a minimum wage summer job.

851
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
I'm on the track to getting a better degree right now,

852
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,920
but in the meantime, I can't help but feel a little less than equal with her.

853
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,280
She's amazingly supportive.

854
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,240
The problem isn't with her.

855
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
I know traditional gender roles are bullshit,

856
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,960
but I can't seem to feel okay making so much less,

857
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
especially when we got student loans out the ass.

858
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,200
And I stopped worrying about this.

859
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
That's from Tragically Traditional Teacher,

860
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,320
pending licensure,

861
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,800
and I've got the solution you've been waiting for.

862
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,440
Are you ready?

863
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,320
Yes.

864
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,880
Make more money.

865
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,120
Okay.

866
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,400
Okay?

867
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,280
Wait, now think.

868
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,840
Take the idea you heard from us about Dunkey,

869
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,280
turn it into a spec script.

870
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,360
You go to LA, you sell it for a million dollars.

871
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,760
What's that?

872
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,080
Story.

873
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,040
New Steven Soderbergh?

874
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,680
I should think so.

875
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,000
Storyboard it with your illustration skills.

876
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,880
Storyboard Dunkey with your illustration skills.

877
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,240
Maybe it's an animated movie.

878
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,960
You know, the thing is,

879
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
when you're in a partnership with somebody,

880
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
I mean, maybe you're married,

881
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
maybe you're just a, you know,

882
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,800
are in a committed relationship, whatever.

883
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,840
The biggest, most important thing you can do is

884
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,520
in areas like this,

885
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
not, this is not all encompassing,

886
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,280
but like in areas like this, especially,

887
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,000
where it's just about the business of,

888
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,280
of like progressing in life,

889
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,640
the business end of life,

890
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,120
rather than the rest of it.

891
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,360
Pleasure.

892
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,640
I think it's really important

893
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,200
to stop seeing two individual people here

894
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,840
and really legitimately start seeing a team.

895
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,840
So if the two of you are getting by

896
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,120
and you're figuring it out

897
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,040
and you're, you know,

898
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
you have what you need to make ends meet

899
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,360
and you have enough money,

900
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,240
like to get through the day and what have you,

901
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,440
I don't think that you should feel like guilt necessarily

902
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,480
that you are not,

903
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,400
there's not as many like zeros on your paycheck.

904
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,640
Like, I think that's a destructive way

905
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,520
of looking at things

906
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,000
because if you think of the situation more inverse,

907
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
if you were making more money than her,

908
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,160
you wouldn't want her to, you know,

909
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,160
beat herself up this way.

910
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
There's also countless other things

911
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,800
that you provide that have nothing to do

912
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
with the financials of the relationship.

913
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,440
Stuff like support and being there for each other,

914
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,680
you know, so money is not the only factor.

915
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,840
It's not the only thing anyone can contribute

916
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
and you could drive yourself crazy

917
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,360
and ruin all of those other aspects of the relationship

918
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,960
because you become so focused on this idea of equality

919
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,440
wherein-

920
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,960
Not just equality, Trev, financial equality.

921
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,600
Yeah, financial equality.

922
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,080
I think that's the pit that you fall into.

923
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,560
When I married my wife,

924
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,000
she was in medical school

925
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,200
and I was, I think, working at the newspaper.

926
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,080
But either way,

927
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,160
I knew that I was not gonna do anything

928
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,000
with my sort of professional existence

929
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,720
that would be in any way helpful

930
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,400
to Earth and people and stuff in the way that my wife is.

931
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,480
So I made the decision when we got married

932
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,840
that, okay, what I'm gonna do,

933
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,440
the most important thing I'm gonna do

934
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,000
is support her so she can do actual real things

935
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,880
that are helpful to Earth.

936
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,320
And I knew I wasn't actually gonna be able

937
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,840
to come up with her financially either.

938
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,280
So it's like kind of a double whammy,

939
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,040
but I knew that my highest and best use

940
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,520
was supporting her so she could do that stuff.

941
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,600
So if you're looking for self-worth

942
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,720
and to feel justified in a relationship,

943
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
if you're looking for that from a paycheck,

944
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,240
you're always gonna be disappointed.

945
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,640
I agree.

946
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,840
Focus more on what you are bringing to the team

947
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,040
and if you are contributing in ways

948
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,160
that aren't just monetary.

949
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,600
Because honestly, when it boils down to it,

950
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,320
that's one of the, that's not the be-all end-all solution.

951
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,800
I agree.

952
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,360
Yeah, I mean, do that.

953
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,400
Don't worry about it anymore.

954
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,360
But you're free.

955
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,160
You're free.

956
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,240
We freed you from your anxiety.

957
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,040
Fly away.

958
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,400
You guys wanna Yahoo?

959
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,900
Yes.

960
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

961
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,280
And before I read it,

962
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,680
I wanna read another one that Drew Davenport sent in.

963
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Let me actually find the email

964
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,280
because it's really great.

965
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,760
Hold on.

966
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,040
God, it's like Inception.

967
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,000
To understand, you must first understand

968
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
the first Drew Davenport.

969
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
But which layer of Drew Davenport are you on now?

970
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,280
I'm still trying to close this Slipshine landing page,

971
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,800
but it is horny and a half.

972
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,520
Yeah, it's tough.

973
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,760
It just keeps popping up

974
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,840
and I'm not talking about the webpage.

975
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,600
Drew Davenport sent this in.

976
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,960
I mean Martinez.

977
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,680
Right, right, right.

978
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Drew Davenport sent this email in.

979
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,720
Because it's becoming a rest.

980
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,200
Travis.

981
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,640
Drew Davenport sent this email in.

982
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,000
And he said,

983
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,880
Dear brothers,

984
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,920
look at what my meddling

985
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,840
in the Yahoo Answers service has wrought.

986
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,400
And he sent in a link to a Yahoo asked by Panda Pants,

987
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,040
who asked,

988
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,320
this past February,

989
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,280
how can I have sex with Drew Davenport?

990
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,200
What?

991
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,520
What?

992
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,560
And then someone with the Yahoo Answers name, C,

993
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,600
responded,

994
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,320
insert his pins in your vagina.

995
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:55,780
What?

996
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,780
Jeez.

997
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,880
So them probably not getting the reference.

998
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,120
Clearly not.

999
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,440
Or understanding how to spell the word penis,

1000
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,640
or completely misunderstanding how the sexual act works.

1001
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,520
Or completely understanding that Drew Davenport

1002
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
just has a bunch of pins down there.

1003
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,120
Just has a bunch of pins down there.

1004
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,240
Bound together.

1005
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,560
It's like the bottom of an NES cartridge down there.

1006
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,600
It's just a strip of different connectors.

1007
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,400
No, I was thinking more like writing pens.

1008
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,240
But they're all like,

1009
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,280
it's like 14 bic pens.

1010
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,560
And they're all bound together

1011
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,360
with like a braces bracket rubber band thing.

1012
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,440
And only three of them have ink left in them.

1013
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,320
Oh, Travis.

1014
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,720
He's a virile, virile young man.

1015
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,280
Okay, then three of the 14 don't have ink in them.

1016
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,960
But that leaves 11 that do.

1017
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,960
And if you push down on the top of them,

1018
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,800
it goes from red to blue to black.

1019
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,680
I like that.

1020
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,920
Anyway, I really love that this person

1021
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,440
just put a message in the metaphorical bottle.

1022
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,160
Just sent it out hoping that it would land on Drew Davenport.

1023
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,560
And it did.

1024
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
It was snagged in his dragnet.

1025
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,440
And now we've actually talked about it on the show,

1026
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
rewarding this behavior.

1027
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,280
Yeah, I'm all for that actually.

1028
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,480
If you want to keep dropping these sexual landmines

1029
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,600
into the vast ocean of Yahoo Answers

1030
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,680
and see if our buddy Drew Davenport picks it up.

1031
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,120
You have to be careful with that though.

1032
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,120
I've long worried about our interference

1033
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,200
with the Yahoo Answers ecosystem.

1034
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,520
I try to discourage that at every turn

1035
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,280
because it will get to a point where it's just Ouroboros.

1036
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,000
Like, so I got my question on the bim bam

1037
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
and then this is on the bim bam too.

1038
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
And then they're reading it and then they turn it into a clip

1039
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,160
and I'm going to ask it in a new Yahoo Answer service.

1040
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,040
You can't get off that train.

1041
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,600
Yeah, that's a good point.

1042
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,360
And then you end up in Finding Nemo 2.

1043
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,280
There's a scene of them fleeing through sharks

1044
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,240
and going through a whole field of sexual landmines.

1045
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,600
And it's just too dangerous.

1046
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,560
You know what I mean?

1047
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,040
No, I don't.

1048
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,080
It's called Finding Dory.

1049
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,880
It's actually coming out.

1050
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,080
Oh.

1051
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,200
Do you know that, Trev?

1052
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,760
I didn't know.

1053
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,640
Now I'm very excited about it.

1054
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,520
Hey, hey, hey.

1055
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,840
Did you all know that they're making a Finding Nemo 2?

1056
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:07,600
Hey.

1057
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,320
Hey, you guys have been listening to our podcast for a while.

1058
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,080
Did you know I'm making a Finding Nemo 2?

1059
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,640
I think it's bullshit that Finding Nemo 2,

1060
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,280
Finding Dory gets to be on the silver screen.

1061
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,640
But my script, Dunkey, is just sitting unread inside.

1062
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,680
Inside of your brain because you haven't pinned yet.

1063
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,800
Unread and unwritten.

1064
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,880
This was another Yahoo sent in by Drew Davenport though.

1065
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
Francis Ford Coppola's Nestor.

1066
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,680
That's what I was trying to pull.

1067
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,160
Sorry.

1068
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user ABC who asks,

1069
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,800
if you could make a new custom flag for America,

1070
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,240
what would the flag look like?

1071
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,320
Can you describe it or draw a picture of it?

1072
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,640
A little arts and crafts challenge for my two brothers.

1073
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,680
Okay, new flag for America.

1074
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,160
New flag.

1075
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,200
Throw this old one out.

1076
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,640
We want more states so badly.

1077
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,400
Oh man, do we want more states.

1078
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,840
But we can't get them because then we got to do a new flag.

1079
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,040
And it's going to look ridiculous.

1080
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,160
51 stars.

1081
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,400
That would actually be my new design by the way.

1082
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,880
I would make it 51 stars and then just show it

1083
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,320
to like neighboring nations.

1084
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,200
Like, hey.

1085
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,560
Hey, Canada, Puerto Rico.

1086
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,920
Hey, Canada, Puerto Rico.

1087
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,680
Got a spot for you right here.

1088
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,760
Or when we go and occupy a country for some reason,

1089
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,640
then we can be like, you sure you won't mess with us?

1090
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,680
Because we hungry.

1091
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,480
Oh man, we hungry.

1092
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,920
Gonna eat your nation up.

1093
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,280
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1094
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,400
I would use a special dye that would allow the colors to run.

1095
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,520
Travis.

1096
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,520
These colors are very vulnerable to the elements.

1097
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,760
A lot of shitty bumper stickers would have to be

1098
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,080
gouged on off of a lot of shitty cars.

1099
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,880
But I would, to be fair, I would make it so that they would

1100
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,280
only run in very specific circumstances.

1101
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,840
Like if it rained and the temperature was above like 97 degrees.

1102
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,080
Okay.

1103
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,960
Right, so that that way we can make bumper stickers that said

1104
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,480
these colors do not normally run.

1105
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,360
But given the right set of circumstances,

1106
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
we have that option should we choose it.

1107
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,840
How about this?

1108
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,240
Calvin peeing on a pile of every other country's flags.

1109
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,120
That's pretty good.

1110
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,920
And then kneeling respectfully before a pile of every other

1111
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,040
nation's flag soaked in.

1112
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:35,440
How about Bart Simpson and Calvin peeing into each other?

1113
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,840
Wait, like in a circular kind of infinity thing?

1114
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,480
Following the Fibonacci sequence.

1115
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,200
A mobius strip of peeing.

1116
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,720
Underneath it, it says America 2 in Comic Sans.

1117
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:52,960
Yeah.

1118
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,800
To the Bart man.

1119
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:05,440
This is a subtitle for America 2 to the Bart man.

1120
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,000
The UN recognizes the delegate from America 2 to the Bart man.

1121
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,440
Thank you, ghost of Kofi Annan.

1122
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,280
What I'm here to do is announce a bold new feature for our country,

1123
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,440
which is now called America 2 to the Bart man.

1124
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,720
I have these words of wisdom for the delegates from Iraq.

1125
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,000
Don't have a cow, man.

1126
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,720
What would we do with the old flags in America 2 to the Bart man?

1127
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,440
They would only be used for boxers to wear as capes as they entered the ring.

1128
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,960
We got all these flags lying around.

1129
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,640
We could give them to the less fortunate.

1130
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,840
At the end of the day, we have all these flags lying around.

1131
00:48:51,840 --> 00:49:00,240
I mean, if dumb-dumbs who are especially enthused about Confederate history are any example,

1132
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,920
you just keep using them.

1133
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,040
You don't even need to worry about it.

1134
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,120
You just keep on using them.

1135
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,640
Children, gather around.

1136
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,000
Now, child citizens of America 2 colon to the Bart man.

1137
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,360
This is what a flag looked like over 50 years ago.

1138
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,600
Oh, but teacher, that flag is not extreme or sassy at all.

1139
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,480
No, it is not.

1140
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,920
That's why it was scrapped.

1141
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Also, there's 50 stars on it, and we have 78 states.

1142
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm confused.

1143
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,120
What would you see before we ate Africa?

1144
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,960
The new dollar bill should have a picture of a pyramid with Stewie's head floating above it.

1145
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,280
I think that would be great, but we only have singles because it's America 2,

1146
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,040
so we have a lot more strip clubs.

1147
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,760
I can't wait for that glorious day.

1148
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,240
What would our new national anthem be in America 2?

1149
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,720
Don't say Do the Bart Man.

1150
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,220
Okay.

1151
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,720
And don't say Deep, Deep Trouble, the B side of Do the Bart Man.

1152
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,520
Oh my god, I cannot believe that poll.

1153
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,200
How about Simpson sing the blues the entire album?

1154
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,240
Listen, don't get to the baseball game on time.

1155
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,080
You will be treated to 48 minutes of songs about the Simpsons.

1156
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,480
Just listen.

1157
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,520
I'm gonna get there.

1158
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,200
No, I'm gonna get there.

1159
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm sitting outside.

1160
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,680
I'm gonna keep tailgating.

1161
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,200
When you hear Mr. Burns saying, look at all these idiots,

1162
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,840
we're about one track from the end of the record,

1163
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,520
so just go ahead and call me then, and I'll go ahead and come up.

1164
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:33,840
All right.

1165
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,040
Cowabunga, brother.

1166
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,880
Cowabunga's here.

1167
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,680
All hail Bart.

1168
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,000
Guys, guys, I hear Raoul coming.

1169
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
Okay, listen, we gotta wrap.

1170
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,560
Raoul's coming back.

1171
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,840
Just a few more housekeeping things to wrap up.

1172
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,320
We haven't mentioned for a little bit,

1173
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,840
but we've got some fun stuff for sale in the Max Fun Store.

1174
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,600
That's maxfunstore.com.

1175
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,560
If you missed out on the one cool thing is the tour poster

1176
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,880
for our Midwest shows designed by Justin Gray.

1177
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,760
They are really cool.

1178
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,200
They have secret codes on them.

1179
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,560
You can buy them for 15 bucks at maxfunstore.com,

1180
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,080
and you can choose which city you want.

1181
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,920
There's one more for Chicago.

1182
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,200
If you want that one, you should.

1183
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,160
There are not a lot of,

1184
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,440
these are the posters that we didn't get rid of at the live shows.

1185
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,680
So there's not a lot of them, but they're really cool.

1186
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,000
And they're relics, I would say, I guess.

1187
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,440
Relics of our freedom.

1188
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,940
Yeah.

1189
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,420
And I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1190
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,300
for the use of our theme song.

1191
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,540
It's a departure off the album Plane of the Days to Bed.

1192
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,380
We're going to be hanging out with John Roderick here

1193
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,020
in a couple of weeks at Max Fun Con.

1194
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,540
I'm really, really excited for that.

1195
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:48,980
And I'm really excited for him to win his Seattle City Council run.

1196
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,260
Yeah, he's running for city council in Seattle.

1197
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,460
I know we've talked about it before,

1198
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,060
and I'm sure you all know about it by now.

1199
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,420
But if you live in Seattle,

1200
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,940
you should probably vote for John Roderick.

1201
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,540
Well, learn about his platform.

1202
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,060
Well, learn about his platform.

1203
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,580
You know, you don't want to rush in anything.

1204
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,180
Go to voteroderick.com.

1205
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,540
That's R-O-D-E-R-I-C-K.com.

1206
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,820
Check out his platform.

1207
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,020
See sort of if he aligns with your own viewpoint.

1208
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,740
I bet he does.

1209
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,700
He's awesome.

1210
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,140
He wrote our theme song.

1211
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,740
So how bad could he be?

1212
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,020
How bad could his ideas about bills and tariffs really be?

1213
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,700
Do they still do tariffs?

1214
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,740
Not in America, too.

1215
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh, that's good to hear.

1216
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,660
We've got a couple of live shows coming up at the end of August.

1217
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,620
We're doing three.

1218
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,060
One in Portland, one in Seattle, one in Vancouver.

1219
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,500
The Portland show is already sold out,

1220
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,980
but you can get tickets for the Seattle and Vancouver shows

at bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Seattle

1222
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,260
and bit.ly forward slash van M-B-M-B-A-M.

1223
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,860
There's a new podcast you might like

1224
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,100
that Travis makes with his friend, a musician,

1225
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,500
and YouTube superstar, Brent O'Floss.

1226
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,700
It's called Trends Like These.

1227
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,340
And you can find it on iTunes.

1228
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,580
And you go there, and you search for it, and you download it.

1229
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,220
And it's about what's happening on the internet.

1230
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,700
And it's a really funny show, and I enjoy it very much.

1231
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,540
And you can go get it.

1232
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,060
You can also, there's a brand new viral video series

1233
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,660
that I just cannot get enough of called Things I Bought at Sheets

1234
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,180
starring our own Justin McElroy and his friend Dwight Slappy.

1235
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,060
And Justin stops at Sheets, buys something, eats it,

1236
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:29,700
and then Dwight guesses what his review of that item will be.

1237
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,660
And here's the thing, you guys, take some twists and turns.

1238
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,940
You're never gonna see it coming.

1239
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,060
You gotta go check it out.

1240
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,260
Just wrapped season one.

1241
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,820
I really wanted to make a season two,

1242
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,580
and the only way they're gonna do that is with your support.

1243
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,860
So go to YouTube and search Things I Bought at Sheets with a Z.

1244
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,380
And I'm still working on my video series

1245
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,020
where I use my bare feet and I step on desserts.

1246
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:53,860
And then people-

1247
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,140
What's that called?

1248
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,900
Smush shoes.

1249
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,020
Smush shoes.

1250
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,180
Smush shoes, the Griffin McElroy story.

1251
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,940
Sorry, Justin, I was checking my texts.

1252
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,380
I'm glad you jumped in there for me.

1253
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,260
It's called smushy shoes, Trapp.

1254
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,700
And it's just me stepping on desserts,

1255
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,140
and every week it's a new dessert.

1256
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,020
Did I say week?

1257
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,220
I meant hour.

1258
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,180
It's an hourly show.

1259
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,500
It's an hourly video show.

1260
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,100
We also want to encourage you to check out

1261
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,740
all the other amazing Max Fun podcasts.

1262
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,620
There's a ton.

1263
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,140
The one I want to talk about right now

1264
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,700
is the Flop House just did a Mordecai episode

1265
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,980
that made me so happy.

1266
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:29,220
And their opinions of it were very surprising.

1267
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,020
And now I might actually have to watch Mordecai.

1268
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,220
No, no, no, no, no.

1269
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:33,700
Listen.

1270
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1271
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,340
I might live stream me watching Mordecai

1272
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,340
so you could watch me watch Mordecai.

1273
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,940
That'd be highly illegal, first of all.

1274
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,940
No, you don't get to watch Mordecai.

1275
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,020
You just see my face as I watch Mordecai.

1276
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,540
How about a final yahoo?

1277
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,140
Well, go listen to the Flop House.

1278
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,700
Okay, well, right now and then we can close the show?

1279
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,420
Yeah, yeah.

1280
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,340
Okay, one hour later.

1281
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,580
Man, that was a great podcast.

1282
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:56,900
I love it so much.

1283
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,660
There's still 45 minutes left.

1284
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,140
Oh, no.

1285
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,420
This is sent in again by Drew Davenport.

1286
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,460
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

1287
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,860
It's by yahoo answers user Vincent.

1288
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,940
And it's a little bit out there.

1289
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,380
It's not going to make a lot of sense,

1290
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,860
but just picture it in your mind.

1291
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,700
Vincent asks,

1292
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:24,340
Did Shia LaBeouf get his scream from John Turturro?

1293
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,380
I'm Justin McElroy.

1294
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,500
I'm Travis McElroy.

1295
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,180
I'm Griffin McElroy, or Chaz.

1296
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,220
I'm Chaz, I'm Chaz, I'm Chaz, I'm Chaz.

1297
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,300
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1298
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:49,460
He's your dad, square on the lips.

1299
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,180
that you need to seize today.

1300
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,700
You're a taxpayer, right?

1301
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,300
Well, then you've got it coming.

1302
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,580
Thanks to Uncle Sam.

1303
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,460
You can learn to get grants for education.

1304
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,820
Learn to ride a llama.

1305
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,380
Print money the old fashioned way.

1306
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,420
Force your dog to stop being so rambunctious.

1307
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,700
Make a souffle that sets and stays set.

1308
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,340
Mount the heads of your enemies on spikes.

1309
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,660
Grind your own corrective lenses

1310
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,300
using just rock salt and diamonds.

1311
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,660
