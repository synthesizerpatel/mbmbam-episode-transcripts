1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Oh boys, I'm so excited. Why are you excited? Because it's Avengers Infinity War Watch.

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,280
Infinity Watch? Let's go with Infinity Watch. Yes, we watched Avengers Infinity War Watch

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,120
at midnight in Detroit and right after a live show because we felt like we'd fucking earned it.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,440
And boy, that was a late one, but I sure enjoyed seeing all the Avengers get back together to fight

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:32,560
off the big bad one who was I think a demon and it was very late and I loved seeing Fireman do his

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,240
stunts. I will say just a brief spoiler, I think my favorite thing was watching all those beefy

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,200
bros hugging. Oh, I love to see those beefy bros together. You saw beef boys who to this point

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
have existed in their own movies and Stan Lee and his beautiful mind made them all get together and

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,640
hug in the same movie and I said, so good. I said yes. Yeah, I said yes too. Griffin and I were

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,400
watching it for the first time in that theater and we both kept saying yes over and over and over

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,360
again. Yes, yes, yes, good hugs. I think that my favorite moment in the movie, once again, spoilers,

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,440
is when Star-Lord and Tony Stark just stop what they're doing and make out so hard. Yeah, they

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,800
kiss each other really hard on the mouth. For like a long time and then they stop and they say like,

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,640
now we're forever bros. Yeah, I remember saying yes out loud on that one. Ant-Man was there,

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,280
people, a lot of buzz talking about how he wasn't, but he was just so very small. Small,

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,600
he's actually in the entire movie. He punched the space demon so hard that I thought I was gonna

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,200
nut. I lost it. I said yes like three times in a row. Did you guys, when Space Grimace stopped the

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,960
movie and he yelled at our projectionist and called him by name. Yeah. He said, Derek, stop the movie

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,440
and then he sat on a stump that he had recently sawed down himself. So it's 15 minutes of him

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,640
sawing this tree down, right? Yes, I remember. And I'm like seven and a half minutes in thinking,

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,800
is this hard? And it was because he sat down and he ate about seven bananas and the sequence took

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,720
about 20 minutes. And I mean, I get it that he's very, just the caloric intake it would take to

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,240
power a titan like him. In his defense, he said there's probably an infinity gem in one of these

31
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,520
bananas and I'm gonna find it the old fashioned way. And he was right. Yeah, and he was right.

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,520
There it was, the tropical gem. But all your favorites were in this one, Iron Man, Spider-Man.

33
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:45,600
Wait, the Animaniacs, Crash Bandicoot, Marco Rubio. They all got together for the-

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,680
Rick or Morty, whichever one is the scientist. Yeah, haven't seen it.

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,880
I like the part where they revealed that Stan Lee was actually the world's greatest hero

36
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,560
and he had just been like stepping between dimensions. That was a pretty huge reveal

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
because this whole time you're like, oh, it's nice of them to put in some cameos

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,560
for old Stan Lee. But then you're like, no, actually he's Shazam.

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,160
He played Batman in this one. It felt masturbatory a little bit. He's like,

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,040
well, this is my movie, so I'm gonna save it. And he does. It felt a little masturbatory,

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,760
but it might just be that way because he masturbated in one scene.

42
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,840
There was that one scene where he masturbated real hard.

43
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,120
Right there, real good. And also then he pulled out the book that

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
he was writing the movie in as the movie was happening and he wrote down Stan Lee masturbates

45
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,720
and then he did it. Do you think, Stan Lee's an older fellow, probably doesn't leave his house

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,800
much. I know that he's a nonagenarian, I believe, but they want him to film all this jazz. If it

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,880
was me, I'd never leave my house. Do you think Stan Lee has a green screen room in his home

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,840
that they just like come and load in like half a school bus or like a DJ table or an electric

49
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,880
chair, if you remember that one. Little known fact, Andy Serkis plays Stan Lee in all the

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
Marvel movies. In a lot of them. But all your friends are here. You're gonna see a lot of

51
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:15,600
familiar faces like Scarlet Witch, bonkers from the TV show Bonkers. Totally nuts. Toxic Avengers.

52
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Toxic Avengers. I think I said Marco Rubio. I'm in it. Yeah, Big Bad Beetleborgs.

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,200
And they line up and one by one punch the demon. And he stands there and he's like,

54
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,840
I'm too tough for this. And Stan Lee gets the killing blow. Anyway, it's a pretty bad movie,

55
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,600
and I don't know why everybody liked it so much, because I thought it was trash.

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
Not a good movie. There's a lot of masturbation in it.

57
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Have you heard of the masturbation, the 20 minutes of banana eating,

58
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,560
the 15 minutes of log sawing? It's just not a good, well put together film.

59
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
Bonkers just sort of runaway racism.

60
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,280
Yeah. Oh, huge. Huge. Huge, big racism.

61
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:07,040
I also found it weird that it seems like every superhero had a bathroom break in the movie.

62
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
And the movie would stop. They'd be like, I have to go to the bathroom. And then everybody would

63
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,240
just stand around while Drax or Thor or whoever went to the bathroom. And they'd wait for them

64
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,560
to come back. I also thought it was weird when Drax changed his name to Rax and then tried to

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,960
sell everybody roast beef sandwiches. Yeah.

66
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,400
Here's the one that killed me. Here's the one where I had to get up and leave.

67
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:41,920
There is a 37 minute steady cam shot of Peter Stormare scrolling through direct TV listings.

68
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,080
There's nothing on. There's nothing on. There's nothing on. I don't want this.

69
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I've seen this episode of Mystery at the Museum before. There's nothing on.

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,120
And it's like 37 minutes of that. Sometimes if you look out the window,

71
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,800
you can kind of see Green Lantern flying around or something. But it's like, by and large,

72
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
there's nothing happening in this scene. That moved this narrative forward.

73
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,240
I did not say yes once during this scene. I did not say yes once during the banana scene.

74
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,320
I did not say yes. I said yes once during the Stanley jerk off scene.

75
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,240
Yes. And you know when I said it.

76
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,520
You don't have to. Yeah.

77
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,560
I will say, all in all, I like the beefy boys hugging. Yeah.

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,360
I like the Stanley fight scenes. Three out of five.

79
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, it's important that we do a review every time we do one of these segments.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,520
We've always done it. Yep.

81
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,240
You got to put a number on it. If you don't put a number on it, it doesn't count.

82
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,080
Hey, Super Justin. That's an Avengers joke. Can you read a question?

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,320
My father was recently retelling a story over dinner that I've heard

84
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,720
since early childhood. When he was in grade school, he was playing American football.

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Hey, you don't have to do that. No, I appreciate it.

86
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
This is a safe place. Thank you for clarifying.

87
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,920
With some friends before being aggressively tackled to the ground by a boy a few years

88
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,520
older than he, blacking out instantly and waking up in the hospital.

89
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,920
The boy did not apologize. This time in telling the story, however,

90
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,240
my father casually revealed that the tackler was Mark Harmon.

91
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,800
My question is this. Do I have a legitimate case against Mark Harmon for tackling my dad?

92
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,840
And if so, what should I say slash do upon him seeing him in court or otherwise?

93
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,080
Please advise. I need closure now that I'm fully aware of the direct link between NCIS

94
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,680
and my primal fear of contact sports. That's from healing in Hawaii.

95
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,120
Now, is it possible that your dad has told this story a lot of times and has felt like,

96
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,600
maybe I don't grab him like I used to. This time, I'm going to lie and say it was

97
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
Mark Harmon who tackled. Like your dad just out of the corner of his eye saw an episode of NCIS

98
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,240
playing and he said Mark Harmon. And what's going to happen is you're going to go on like a cross

99
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,400
country manhunt for Mark Harmon. You're going to find him and you're going to be like, Mark Harmon,

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,720
you tackled my dad. And Mark Harmon is going to be like, I never even played football,

101
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,600
American or otherwise. And you're like, what? And Mark Harmon is the perfect poll for that,

102
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,760
right? Because if he was trying to impress you and he's like, I got tackled by all of Destiny's

103
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,040
child, then you would know like, come on, daddy, that's a lie. Mark Harmon, I could see a quiet

104
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,720
rage in those eyes. I could see a tackle monster behind that gentle face.

105
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
Is it possible while your dad had the football, he was running into the end zone. He says,

106
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,000
he said something like, I'm going to do some terrorism in the end zone. And Mark Harmon,

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,600
you know, said, I'm going to hurt CJ Craig. I'm going to hurt CJ Craig. And then your Mark Harmon

108
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,960
uncle Mark came over and dunked him to the ground for America. Is that a possibility?

109
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,520
I think that's exactly what happened. It's also possible that because this would explain a lot

110
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:03,600
that Mark Harmon remembers in clear, like perfect detail, tackling this young man. And he felt so

111
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,080
terrible about it that it is what has driven him to excellence today.

112
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,960
Or he felt so good about it that it drove him to excellence and made him feel so powerful and

113
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,680
strong. And here's the flip side of this. If your dad had gotten the big tackle down on NCIS as Mark

114
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,160
Harmon, your dad would be the NCIS man. Your dad would love CJ Craig.

115
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,080
I don't, I won't take any more jokes about Mark Harmon. The man's a fucking hero.

116
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
And I'm not going to, I was not joking at all. Well, I was, I mean,

117
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,280
now I'm like saying he's a literal hero. I've told the story before on this podcast.

118
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm fairly certain. And I'm going to tell it again. The year was 1996.

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,560
A young Colin Sprecht, 16 years old in a, in a riding shotgun and his friend's car,

120
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,400
the friend's joy riding. There was a crash in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.

121
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,280
And the crash, luckily for Colin Sprecht, just happened to be in front of the home of Mark

122
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:11,600
Harmon. Mark Harmon goes to the car and he used a sledgehammer to break the window of the car.

123
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
That he just, that he just had.

124
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
He's going to bring, I'm going to bring this fucking sledgehammer. I'm going to need it.

125
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,840
He tugged me because I was still upside down with the seatbelt in and he ripped me out of the car,

126
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,000
said Sprecht. And he suffered third degree burns and was hospitalized for months.

127
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,440
So a little bit faster on the draw next time, Mark. But Mark Harmon, Mark Harmon had never

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,880
spoken about the incident until the story in 2013. Didn't tell anybody about it.

129
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,280
And here's what he said when actually, actually interviewed about it. He said,

130
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,440
I won't take credit for it because if the car exploded and I'm there next to the car,

131
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,720
then you're talking about two young boys who don't have a father, said Harmon.

132
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
And you'd be doing this interview with my wife and talking about how stupid it was.

133
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,000
So humble. And you know, he was sprinting towards the car, his Mjolnir in hand.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Yes.

135
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,080
And he had the thought, I only have the courage to do this because of the great

136
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,880
tackle I did where I dunked that kid to, I dunked that kid to sleep on the gridiron.

137
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,960
And that, but here's the thing, that could have been your dad. That could have been your

138
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,400
dad living in a nice house in Brentwood, ready to be on West Wing.

139
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Or is it maybe a penance? Is it maybe to get forgiveness for the terrible tackle?

140
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,480
He has to rescue a hundred people from burning cars.

141
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
And now he just has 99 miles to go.

142
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,960
In some way or someone must have some kind of like tally marker of how many times we

143
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,680
gently or directly referenced the lives of Blackjack Savage.

144
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:56,160
The wildest part about this story, if I saved someone's groceries from a car that had stalled

145
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,240
to the side of a country road, it would be all I talked about for the rest of my fucking life.

146
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,640
It would be like, oh yeah, there were popsicles and they were about to melt.

147
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,520
And I was like, not on my watch. And I got most of them.

148
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,280
I ate three of them as a payment.

149
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,080
Yeah, but it'd be all I talked about.

150
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,640
It would be in my bio when you'd come to see me at the off-off-Broadway one-man show

151
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,400
where I tell the story of how I saved someone from a burning car.

152
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,160
Beloved popsicle rescuer, Justin McElroy.

153
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
Anyway, I love Mark Harmon.

154
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by level 9,000 Yajuritru Davenport.

155
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,160
It's from Yajuranser's user, YuWrong, who asks,

156
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
heroes and villains?

157
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
Who are the biggest heroes and villains in baseball today?

158
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,200
Give your reasons why.

159
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Well, Damien Darke, the pitcher for the Orioles, everybody seems to hate this guy.

160
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,520
He throws his pitch wildly and sometimes somebody will look at him weird from the stands

161
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,880
and he'll throw a pitch right at him and get the person on base.

162
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
So the team hates him, too, because that's not great.

163
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
You're not supposed to just throw the ball right.

164
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,400
Well, hold on.

165
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,960
If you throw the ball right out into the stands and hit somebody who's like yelling like,

166
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,120
Damien, you're a dipshit, and you hit him and the popcorn goes up all funny,

167
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,360
is that a point for the other team or is it a foul?

168
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,920
Do you know how much I want to play in this space with you?

169
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,800
Desperately want to play in this space with you.

170
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,840
I don't understand enough about modern sport, I think,

171
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,800
to play with you here in the space you've created.

172
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
Well, then let me tell you the biggest villain,

173
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,120
and I think we can both agree on this, the Philly fanatic.

174
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,120
Mostly because of how many he's killed.

176
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,840
I remember that one time he was dancing on top of the dugout

177
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,200
and whatever you want to define his gaping maw or proboscis or whatever you want to call it,

178
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,840
he just leaned down and swallowed a person whole

179
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
because they were rooting for the other team.

180
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,480
Oh, I hate that.

181
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
You hate that when that happens.

182
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,160
And he's done it so much, like twice a game for the last 20 years.

183
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
Is that true or?

184
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
Yeah, Philly fanatic eats people.

185
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,200
Biggest hero, I would say, is probably Stew.

186
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,640
And this is a guy that sells beer for the Orioles.

187
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Again, it's the only team I'm able to pull for some reason right now.

188
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,360
And he just walks through and he's just like, ice cold beer.

189
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
And he says it in a way that I hear it,

190
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,200
and I'm not really enjoying myself because it's 200 fucking degrees

191
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,600
and the game's been going on for nine hours.

192
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,840
And I hear him say, ice cold beer.

193
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,960
And I think like, oh, Stew, you got my fucking number.

194
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
Slide me, what is that?

195
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,280
Oh, a Bud Light?

196
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,000
I guess.

197
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
Do you have the ones in like the metal bottles?

198
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,840
You don't?

199
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,080
You just have it in like, you know, sloppy Slurpee cups that are gonna get all over?

200
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,480
Okay.

201
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
Can I at least get a Bud Light lime?

202
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
Because it's summer.

203
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Summertime, Stew.

204
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,440
Summer beer?

205
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
Summer beer, ice cold light.

206
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,640
Summer beer from Swo-

207
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,880
What was that?

208
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
What did you say, Stew?

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,280
Don't worry about it.

210
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,280
So biggest villain, another big one, is the Caddyshack Mole.

211
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,840
Yeah.

212
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,640
Yeah.

213
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,200
It's like they work so hard to maintain the greens, and then, you know,

214
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
Randy Johnson throws a big pitch, and then the Mole jumps up and grabs the ball

215
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,280
and takes it back underground,

216
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,160
and then everybody's game is ruined.

217
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,200
Well, Griffin, you've just dropped a name,

218
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,700
I think, of one of our greatest heroes

219
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,000
for defeating that evil bird, Randy Johnson.

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,360
Randy Johnson is a great hero.

221
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,160
That bird was a pervert.

222
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,200
A lot of people won't say it, but we will.

223
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
Well, not a lot of birds are perverts

224
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,640
because they have a bird's eye view,

225
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,960
and they'll look down and see some stuff

226
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,040
that you're not supposed to see,

227
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
and then they'll be like.

228
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,680
And only Randy Johnson can stop them.

229
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,620
And only Randy Johnson can do it.

230
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,440
One of the big villains for me

231
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,520
is the magic boxing gloves Rocky wears

232
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,420
that make him keep fighting

233
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,880
even if he wants to stop fighting.

234
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,280
Oh, so this is not a greatest villain's baseball thing.

235
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,120
Yeah.

236
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, correct.

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Well, you remember when those magic boxing gloves

238
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,560
took a turn at professional baseball.

239
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,400
You great.

240
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,800
I did wanna say, Griffin did say the Caddyshack Mall,

241
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,620
so maybe you guys can all fuck off.

242
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,680
I did still tie it into baseball in some way.

243
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,520
I referenced baseball.

244
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,060
You didn't even let me finish.

245
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,140
Oh, yeah, please.

246
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,320
One of them was a catching glove.

247
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,200
Oh, okay.

248
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
And one was a punching glove, so.

249
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,500
Michael Jordan, I don't know which one he is

250
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,660
because he's both a little bit villainous

251
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,600
in that he's like probably not great at the sport,

252
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,880
but everyone's still sort of paying a lot of attention

253
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,720
to him there anyway.

254
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,800
But a hero because he did know when was the right time

255
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,680
to walk away and defeat the Monstars.

256
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,900
Griffin, to touch on a little bit

257
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,640
of your actual sports expertise,

258
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,920
how come in baseball people, there are no heels

259
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,520
and whatever you're called when you're the good guy,

260
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,800
why don't they have more storylines in baseball?

261
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,120
Well, they do, but there's this concept in wrestling

262
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,720
called kayfabe that's like now Shinsuke Nakamura,

263
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,800
my son, is now a heel, and as much as it hurts me

264
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,000
to watch people be angry at him or sad at him

265
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
for kicking wrestlers in the balls very, very hard,

266
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
which is his new gag, which is great

267
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,800
because he's worked so hard his entire life

268
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,320
to become a professional wrestler

269
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
and trained his body and mind and moves,

270
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,680
and now he's just sort of doing some beavis

271
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,340
and butt head stuff out there.

272
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,260
It's still fun because you know he's probably

273
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,680
not that bad a guy, but the bad ones in baseball,

274
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
they can actually, my experience has been,

275
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,400
they can actually be quite bad,

276
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
even when they're off the-

277
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,400
On and off the court.

278
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,220
On and off the grass court.

279
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,300
So they can get tricky there.

280
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Do you think that the, I think the only way

281
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,940
to denote the bad guys and the good guys

282
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,980
is based on what song they pick for their walkout music

283
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,860
when they come up to bat?

284
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,700
You know what I mean?

285
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,980
Because if they're playing like some ACDC,

286
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,860
they probably see themselves as like the bad boy.

287
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,500
You know, they're like, oh, I'm a bad boy of baseball.

288
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,740
But if you walk out to like some melon camp,

289
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,160
you probably see yourself as like,

290
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,020
I'm just a good, I'm a good guy

291
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,500
just out here trying to play some baseball in America.

292
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,020
There's only one, there's one metric for me,

293
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,660
and it's how many balls you throw out

294
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,580
to the kids in the stands.

295
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,460
You remember Smiley Tevis played for the,

296
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,140
I believe the Baltimore Orioles,

297
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,340
and he would throw every ball he got his hands on

298
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,780
into the crowd, and so he'd, you know,

299
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,540
catch a grounder, he would shortstop,

300
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,740
and then he would run from the shortstop place

301
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,780
all the way over to the out-of-bounds area

302
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,860
and just throw that live ball right out to the kid.

303
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,900
And he would really hum it if memory serves.

304
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,540
He would bust at one of those kids, yeah.

305
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,340
He ended up though being kind of forcibly retired

306
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,740
from baseball though, because also every time

307
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,620
he was up at bat, he would catch the balls

308
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,780
the pitcher would throw, and then he would throw them

309
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,100
into the stands.

310
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,940
Yeah, they hated that.

311
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,180
The umpires didn't know what to do with it,

312
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,980
and they were like, I guess that's a foul ball.

313
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,180
And he would like stand there and like foul

314
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,700
like 11 or 12 times before they'd be like,

315
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,740
okay, just walk, just go, just walk up there,

316
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,260
come on, go away.

317
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,500
Pitchers would just start hitting him

318
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,380
just to get it over with, so Smiley Tevis

319
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,220
got on the plate every single time.

320
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,460
Yeah.

321
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,260
He's my hero.

322
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,220
Okay, that's important.

323
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,900
This morning I decided to wear shorts to work.

324
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,780
It's the first day of May, and they haven't turned

325
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,660
the air conditioning on at school I work at.

326
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,260
There was probably an article in there I was missing,

327
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,100
sorry about that.

328
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,900
Yesterday, I was really hot at the end of the day,

329
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
and it was like 78 outside.

330
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,500
Today it's gonna be 85, hence the shorts.

331
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,060
Hey, that's a really good reading of that by the way,

332
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
because that really sounded like you had stopped

333
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,300
reading the question and were just telling us

334
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,900
about the shorts you wore.

335
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,980
No, I am wearing shorts, and it is probably too cool

336
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,880
to be wearing them, but I put them on

337
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
so I'm pot committed.

338
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,480
So why are all of the other teachers coming up to me

339
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,420
and saying, shorts?

340
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,980
Nice.

341
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,320
As if some kind of island spirit or beach nymph.

342
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,620
It's gonna be hot, I wanna wear shorts.

343
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,940
Help, am I losing my mind?

344
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,980
That's from Shorts Boy in Chicago.

345
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,440
Well, you can, listen, we can all have a lot of fun

346
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,200
here on this show, but you can love shorts

347
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,060
as much as you want.

348
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,800
God knows I'm a fan of those little jeans, as I call them,

349
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,800
and it doesn't make it so that that's the standard

350
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,260
in a business environment.

351
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,240
Like, you can love shorts with all your heart

352
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,580
and be as uncomfortable in long pants as you want,

353
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,140
but it's not gonna change the fact

354
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,420
that you're gonna get a few raised eyebrows

355
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,820
with a pair of shorts.

356
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,140
Wearing shorts to work, especially in the environment

357
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,000
of working at a school or something like that,

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,460
is the equivalent of a futuristic dystopia

359
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,180
where one person rises up to defeat the robot overlords

360
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,380
and everybody rallies behind them.

361
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,780
I can imagine that the principal of your school

362
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,260
and, I don't know, the school board,

363
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,780
whoever's in charge of that kind of thing,

364
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,260
was like peeking through blinds at you and your shorts,

365
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,460
like, we gotta stop this person.

366
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,140
We can't let this person wear shorts anymore.

367
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,900
It's like calf loose.

368
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,700
I think that it could have been a compliment

369
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,620
of your buns, maybe.

370
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,060
Like, if they say shorts, nice.

371
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,380
Like, it could have been a buns reference to your buns.

372
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,240
But your shorts aren't, unless they're like,

373
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,380
wholly inappropriate for work,

374
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,500
they're not really featuring the buns

375
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,820
more prominently than long pants.

376
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,660
Aren't they, though?

377
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
I mean, it is sort of an indicate.

378
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,300
It does give the hint, the faintest wisp,

379
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,660
of here's a little bit closer of a view

380
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,840
to what's going on there in that region.

381
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,140
Also, to tie it back to baseball,

382
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,060
it's like shrinking the strike zone

383
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,700
of where people are gonna look when they're like,

384
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,260
I wanna see what pants they're wearing, right?

385
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,740
They don't accidentally land on your calves or your knees.

386
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,460
It's like, you are only gonna,

387
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,180
it's 50-50 butt and thigh, you know what I mean?

388
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,780
And so there's a chance, when you look at my pants

389
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,740
to see what kind of pants I'm rocking,

390
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,060
you're probably gonna see my butt.

391
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,780
You'll consider the buns, and it's possible.

392
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,580
Consider the buns!

393
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,740
It's not appropriate for a workplace setting,

394
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,100
but that's not your problem.

395
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,980
Listen, we'd all be wearing shorts all the time

396
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,380
unless it's cold all the time.

397
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,220
And as Justin said, there's a time and a season.

398
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,420
The Bible also said that,

399
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,260
so Justin was technically quoting the Bible.

400
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,920
And I was too when I mentioned the stuff about the buns.

401
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,140
When we do live shows, I would love to wear shorts,

402
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,100
but I don't classically, because I want people to know

403
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,320
that I'm there to conduct my business.

404
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,140
I'm there at a business meeting.

405
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,380
It's nice to be able to walk off stage,

406
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,460
and as soon as you hit the sight line off stage,

407
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,020
just change into shorts.

408
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,240
Because then you know your time's done.

409
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,140
This is a thing people don't do anymore,

410
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,140
that I hear about older generations of coming home

411
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,500
and changing completely out of work clothes,

412
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,520
and now it's time for my home clothes.

413
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,180
And the problem is I work from home,

414
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,060
and I don't know when to do that.

415
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,500
I do that every day at 5.30, I change into shorts.

416
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,340
A.M.?

417
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,740
Best part of my day, yep.

418
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,100
Or today, where I'm already wearing shorts,

419
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,960
I'll change into slightly less dressy shorts.

420
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,380
I'll tell you the good luck

421
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,740
that those old folks had down pat

422
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,620
that is tough to pull off these days

423
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,260
is the shorts with the sock garters.

424
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,520
That makes you look like you are down for anything, friend.

425
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,360
Yeah.

426
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,380
Hard to find, hard to find sock garters.

427
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,940
When you go into any sort of clothing store,

428
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,340
and you say, where's your sock garter section?

429
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,280
You get some looks.

430
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,100
Yeah, they say this is old Navy.

431
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,460
Get out of here, pervert.

432
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,220
You're looking for very old Navy.

433
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,980
Somebody invent elastic,

434
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,420
so we can get rid of these darn things.

435
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,500
Was that what it was?

436
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,040
Yeah, nobody had elastic, because the war was on.

437
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,860
Which war?

438
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,660
We needed them for our rubber band guns?

439
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,300
No, for like tanks and stuff.

440
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,660
Like, because there's plastic.

441
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,540
You don't have plastic, you can't make elastic,

442
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,820
so you can't put elastic into the stockings

443
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,220
or the socks or whatever, so you had to have garters

444
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,060
to hold them up.

445
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,380
You must have slippy socks

446
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,540
for the boys on the front.

447
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,900
There's a war on.

448
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,840
There's a war on.

449
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,600
Your socks must be slippy.

450
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,060
Timothy, your sock holes are so droopy, dude.

451
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,740
Thank you for your service.

452
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,820
Our friends overseas sure do appreciate it.

453
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
You're gonna bring them home

454
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,340
with your droopy ass weird old dead socks.

455
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,180
I have a Yahoo here.

456
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,100
This one was sent in by Grin Velesty.

457
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,940
Thank you, Grin.

458
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,100
It's Yahoo Answers user, and I don't know, they're...

459
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,460
What could it matter at this point?

460
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah, I'm gonna call them bubs, asks.

461
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,980
Any ideas for my plant pot experiment?

462
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,660
So, there are types of plant that are basically very tough

463
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,100
and competitive with other plants

464
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,260
and like to take over.

465
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Ivy, mint, dandelion, raspberry, mare's tail, et cetera.

466
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,300
I had an idea of sourcing some of these

467
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,180
and putting them all into one single plant pot

468
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,580
and then waiting to see what happens

469
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,900
as they all fight for dominance

470
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,480
and see what comes out on top.

471
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,420
So to make this interesting,

472
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,460
what would be the best plants to use for this experiment?

473
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,920
I'm looking for competitive plants

474
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,620
that will fight each other for dominance.

475
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,860
Y'all come on over this Sunday.

476
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,380
I got a cooler full of brews.

477
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,300
We're gonna sit down

478
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,580
and watch these plants kick each other's asses.

479
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,740
It is going to be so fucking dope.

480
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,820
I'm having a plant and an illegal plant fight

481
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,780
in the alley behind the Arby's,

482
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,860
and we're gonna meet there

483
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,560
and place our bets and my money's on bamboo.

484
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,100
Their various tendrils and vines

485
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,140
are gonna be whipping hither and yon.

486
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,180
This person is assuming the plants will fight

487
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,100
and not what will actually happen,

488
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,880
which is the plants will team up to defeat you.

489
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,620
Like think about it.

490
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,420
If you were thinking logically what's gonna happen

491
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,980
when I get a bunch of plants together,

492
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,620
the plants are gonna dislike each other

493
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,500
or they're going to dislike the person

494
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,780
who locked them in a pot.

495
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,720
I mean, for a while,

496
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
I think they're gonna kick each other's asses

497
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,500
and that's gonna be the sweet spot.

498
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,900
Before they turn on you,

499
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,260
like the raspberry is just wrapping all around

500
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,620
the dandelion and trying to strangle it

501
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,100
and the ivy's just waiting for its chance

502
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,300
and the mare's tail is just really disappointing me

503
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,080
because I thought it was gonna get nasty in there,

504
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,100
but it's just kind of not doing much

505
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,000
because it's just a blazy plant.

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,340
But then eventually, yeah, Trev,

507
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,180
I think it is gonna sort of realize,

508
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,860
wait a minute, it'll lead a sort of Spartacus revolution

509
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,820
and you're gonna need some sort of spray.

510
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,560
Because they're too powerful.

511
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,660
Yeah, and maybe you could hold a tasty food

512
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,560
for plants over it and just be like,

513
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,620
first one to grow up here and get it.

514
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,380
And boy, I would just love to watch these plants

515
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,420
just fucking rumble in the jungle.

516
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,060
Wouldn't it be fucking rad to put a bunch of plants

517
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,260
at the bottom of the agro crag

518
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,860
and then at the top you put like,

519
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,660
what do plants like, the sun?

520
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,260
Sweet water, I think, like sugary water.

521
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,260
You put some sugary water up there

522
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,380
and just tell them to go hog a while

523
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,140
and see what happens. Go for it, plants.

524
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,920
Just go for it, reach for it.

525
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,340
Don't be afraid to take what's yours.

526
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,460
There's most forms of making things fight is not good.

527
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,760
But even battle bots, I'll watch a battle bots fight

528
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,180
sometime and be like, these toasters don't deserve this.

529
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,700
They should be doing other stuff like-

530
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,420
Make no mistake that when the robots

531
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,220
try to rally others of the sentient ones to their cause,

532
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,500
the battle bots footage will be the footage that they show.

533
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,940
Like, this is what they did.

534
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,460
Especially the shots of when the robots cry.

535
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,180
That's the ones that always get me, you know?

536
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,820
It's like, I don't want to fight him.

537
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
He's my brother.

538
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,820
When they cry data just pours out their ears.

539
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,500
Their eyes, they're crying data.

540
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,420
Griffin, I just want to let you know.

541
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,540
Yeah, tears of raw kilobytes of data.

542
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,700
They're crying megs and megs of data.

543
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,180
But I watched Ivy use, you know,

544
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,180
razor leaf on a raspberry plant and I feel nothing.

545
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,780
I feel absolutely nothing except for pure enjoyment.

546
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,180
That's so sad, Griffin.

547
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm just saying, I'm here for it.

548
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
I feel nothing.

549
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,300
Get him, get him Dandelion.

550
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,340
Do something for me once in your life, Dandelion.

551
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,660
Kick that raspberry's ass.

552
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,780
I have 50 cold ones on you.

553
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,420
Dandelions do all kinds of great shit.

554
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,860
You can make wine out of them.

555
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,380
You can rub them on your friend's arm

556
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,820
and pretend that the flower peed on them.

557
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,980
No, that's a good one.

558
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,660
I love that shit. It's a very good one.

559
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,500
Especially, Dan, when your friend is like, I like this.

560
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,300
Huh, huh, huh, yeah, okay.

561
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,020
I say yes about this.

562
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,060
Huh.

563
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,900
Hey, take us to Mighty Zone, please.

564
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,780
Well, let's go.

565
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:19,620
This week, we're sponsored by Casper.

566
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,020
Oh my God, I just had the impulse

567
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,540
to make a friendly ghost reference.

568
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,860
And like Casper-

569
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,580
Wouldn't be the first one to do that.

570
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,780
So that would be fun.

571
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,420
I'm disappointed in myself.

572
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,780
I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight,

573
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,300
but the answer is well,

574
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,060
because I sleep on a Casper mattress.

575
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,700
Casper has revolutionized its line of products

576
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,180
to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience

577
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,500
one night at a time.

578
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,820
They offer affordable prices

579
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,940
because Casper cuts out the middleman

580
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,340
and sells directly to the consumer.

581
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,540
Now don't get me wrong.

582
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,260
I feel bad for the middleman in this economy

583
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,460
to be cut out like that.

584
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,660
But also that middleman,

585
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,540
the specific one that Casper cuts out is a jerk.

586
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,940
Davis.

587
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,260
His name is Davis.

588
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,700
Davis, yeah, and he's a jerk.

589
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,060
So you don't have to feel bad about Davis

590
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:05,060
not getting to dip his snoot in the old mattress till.

591
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,700
And I love Casper mattresses.

592
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,740
I sleep on one every night.

593
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,060
Every time we go on a tour,

594
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,620
I come home and I sleep so much better.

595
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,100
And I remember like, oh yeah, this is what sleep is

596
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,520
because they can buy multiple supportive memory phones

597
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,840
for a quality sleep service

598
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,900
with the right amounts of both sync and bounce.

599
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,260
You can be sure of your purchase

600
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,420
Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

601
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,660
And you can get $50 towards select mattresses

602
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,220
by visiting Casper.com slash my brother

603
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,060

605
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,820
Terms and conditions apply.

606
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,300
I sleep extra good at my Casper

607
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,860
just knowing that I'm making Davis go hungry.

608
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,420
Yeah, take that Davis you jerk-o.

609
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,940
I'm gonna tell you about stamps.com.

610
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,900
No, I wanna tell him about stamps.com.

611
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
No, I wanna tell him about stamps.com.

612
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,260
And you just did one.

613
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,180
Should we all just talk about stamps.com

614
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
at the same time? Simultaneously.

615
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,780
Yes, okay. So Griffin go.

616
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,460
It'll be the first time we've ever talked over each other.

617
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,060
Stamps.com's great.

618
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,020
They'll give you the stamps whenever you need them

619
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,220
and you print them out right there

620
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,000
and you don't have to worry about going to the post office

621
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
to mail your letters and packages

622
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,260
because you can get postage on demand

623
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,620
and you even weigh the shit

624
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,620
and you put the stamps right on the package

625
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,020
after wrapping it up in package stuff

626
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,960
and you ship it right on the fuck off

627
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,300
and you don't even have to sweat it, dude.

628
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,740
You get all the amazing services at post office

629
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,460
right at your desk 24 seven.

630
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,580
You can buy and print official US postage

631
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,780
for any letter, any package using your own computer

632
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,620
and printer.

633
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,980
It's very convenient.

634
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,980
It's come as you are.

635
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,060
Open door policy at stamps.com.

636
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,660
Everything's on demand.

637
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,660
So right now I'll use my brother for this special offer

638
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,260
and by my brother, I mean Justin.

639
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,780
Just hit him up.

640
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,060
Oh, stamps.com?

641
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,180
Yeah, I know a guy.

642
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,020
Hold on.

643
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,060
Let me get you a $50 free postage.

644
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,980
What he does is he holds out a calculator

645
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,340
and you punch in some numbers

646
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,900
and the stamp comes right out of his fucking mouth.

647
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,940
He's got a Game Boy printer he swallowed

648
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,500
all the way back in 2002

649
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,340
and that thing does its job.

650
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,100
Great flags of the world.

651
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,060
That's the theme.

652
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,900
That's the only theme I can think of.

653
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Yeah, that's the theme this month.

654
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,620
You gotta punch him in the stomach real hard

655
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,140
if you want to change it to Harry Potter stamps.

656
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,900
No, you use the promo code my brother

657
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,940

It includes up to $55 free postage, a digital scale

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,460

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,460
and type in my brother, all one word.

664
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,180
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

665
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,460
I like stamps.

666
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,380
Okay.

667
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,380
I want to tell you all about 8 Bit Geek,

668
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,620
a podcast that shares its insignificant views

669
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,540
on gaming and film.

670
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,420
Stop in as we share some laughs

671
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,340

676
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,660
Is the missed connections from geek stuff,

677
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,500
so like Luigi to Princess Fiona from Shrek,

678
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,900
just like like your style.

679
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,580
I know that you're married, but do you like-

680
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,860
You're into green dudes.

681
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,780
I'm a green dude.

682
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,740
I'm a green dude.

683
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,700
Do you and your husband like to have fun?

684
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,220
I will say though, if you click through to this website,

685
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,060
you're going to see some beards.

686
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,860
There will be beards and they are increasingly impressive.

687
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,480
There's Jeremy, Doug and Kevin.

688
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
Jeremy has a respectable beard.

689
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,240
Doug's got a massive beard and mustache.

690
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,300
Kevin has shaved the mustache.

691
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,560
So you can't fucking think of about anything

692
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,180
other than Kevin's amazing beard.

693
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,980
Yeah, I have a Jumbotron here.

694
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,340
This one's from Melhaliwa and it's from Dave who says,

695
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,300
Hey, sweetie pie, I'm writing this Jumbotron at 4 a.m.

696
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,100
the day before your birthday and two days

697
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,060
before our wedding day.

698
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,840
It will hopefully run on our planned wedding day.

699
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,340
I'm so glad-

700
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,900
Wait, oh wow.

701
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,720
What came in under the wire on this one?

702
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,820
I'm so glad we snuck in a bonus six months of wedded bliss.

703
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,380
Thank you for marathoning the first 200 Mabim Bams with me.

704
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,220
Mistake!

705
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,900
And for getting Papa McElroy to retweet pictures

706
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,940
of our dog XOXO.

707
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,860
I wanted that on May 12th,

708
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,700
which I guess is the planned wedding day.

709
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,620
And I think we came in pretty close to that.

710
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,340
Not exactly on it, but whatever.

711
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,660
I'd rather do it before,

712
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,420
because our next episode is the 14th

713
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,460
and we would have missed it.

714
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,300
What a bum missed it.

715
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,740
That's a true point, Travis.

716
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,980
And a little weird that you're marrying a pie, Dave.

717
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,140
That's a joke, because he said sweetie pie.

718
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,220
But I've eaten, yeah, I eat a pie so good

719
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,260
that I would marry it.

720
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Yes, this final Jumbotron, it's for Catherine.

721
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,980
It's from Kai.

722
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,780
And it says, happy birthday and or general existence

723
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,940
to my longest best friend.

724
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,020
Now, I assume there that you mean someone

725
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,580
who's been your best friend the longest

726
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,260
and not like a 10 foot tall best friend.

727
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,740
Well, it says longest, so they could be,

728
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,820
you know, five foot four tall, but 10 feet deep.

729
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,300
What a deep friend I have.

730
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,260
A very deep, deep friend.

731
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,180
Thanks for putting up with me when I don't text back,

732
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,860
playing D&D with me, introducing me to German musicals,

733
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,420
giving me up to date on content from these good, good boys.

734
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,340
I hope you know how proud I am of you for everything you do.

735
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,260
Never forget, you're a fucking badass.

736
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,700
Hey, folks, don't rely on your friend, Catherine,

737
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,860
to tell you what's going on with us.

738
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,940
We got lots of social media.

739
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,040
You don't have to wait for Catherine to tell you.

740
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,780
But Catherine, if you do wanna handle telling everybody

741
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,100
what's going on, we appreciate the effort.

742
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,220
If that's a service you offer, Catherine,

743
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,180
we can push more people your way.

744
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,580
Yeah, if you wanna sort of take up that mantle

745
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,540
of keeping people informed.

746
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,900
So everybody just go on Twitter, search Catherine,

747
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,780
and follow the first person that comes up.

748
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,420
That's probably Catherine.

749
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,940
And you're gonna get all the great news from us.

750
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,300
And then be sure to ask that Catherine constantly,

751
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,780
like, so what's up with the McElroy's?

752
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

753
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,260

How about a Yahoo? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

775
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,340
This one was sent in by Grin Velesty also.

776
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,700
Thank you, Grin.

777
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,640
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

778
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,900
but I'm gonna say Davis sent this one in.

779
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,300
So sad, so hungry.

780
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,460
Davis asks, what would it be like

781
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,820
if Deadpool took over the Cracker Barrel franchise?

782
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,900
Oh, fuck, this is good.

783
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,860
You know we'd be in there with his like twisted views.

784
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,700
Well, let me finish,

785
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,020
and then we'll get into the twisted views,

786
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,420
but I'm about to work there.

787
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,340
I just wonder how hilarious it would be

788
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,780
if he were running things.

789
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,620
Oh, yeah.

790
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,540
Yeah, so he'd be like, hey, this is Deadpool.

791
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,260
Come on down for a good country breakfast,

792
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,020
eggs, toast, and my balls.

793
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,940
Yeah, yeah.

794
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,360
But he also probably wouldn't have fired that one woman

795
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,940
for no reason that the internet went wild about.

796
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Like Deadpool wouldn't have done that,

797
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,180
but he would have made people look at his butt

798
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,660
while he brought them biscuits.

799
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,860
Yeah, you'd be doing the peg puzzle thing

800
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,780
to find out how smart you are in the little wooden triangle,

801
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,520
and you'd be getting close to finishing it,

802
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,700
and you went to put the last peg in, but it was his butt.

803
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Yeah, but he wouldn't have fired that woman for no reason.

804
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,220
Yeah, that was bad Cracker Barrel.

805
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,020
You get some like old-timey candy, but then what's that?

806
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,100
He's eating it, and also his butt's there.

807
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,940
Yeah, he's eating it.

808
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,940
You think he's behind the,

809
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,860
like he just helped you be your waiter,

810
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,180
and then when you go to the counter to buy

811
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,620
those Jawbreakers our dad likes, it's him,

812
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,820
but he's got a fake mustache on.

813
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,660
Oh, yeah.

814
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,100
And he's talking kind of like an old-timey voice,

815
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,260
like, I'll help you, kid.

816
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,620
Yeah, a guy comes up to him,

817
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,060
he's sitting in one of those rocking chairs

818
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,340
out in front of the Cracker Barrel,

819
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,180
and he's like, hey, rocking chair,

820
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,660
why don't you get back to work?

821
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
And then Deadpool's like, my balls,

822
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,540
and he pulls out two big guns and just wastes them.

823
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,020
Yeah, yeah.

824
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,580
Oh, and then there's some problems

825
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,580
with overages, with too much being spent on labor

826
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,180
for like some of the down periods for Cracker Barrel,

827
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,440
and he finds a way of just sort of shoring that up,

828
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,260
the equitable for all the employees,

829
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,340
and also for the overhead.

830
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,740
Yeah. Just better.

831
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,860
And then at the end of, okay, you guys tell me

832
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,660
what I was gonna finish my 15-minute-long ramble with,

833
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,540
because I had a great.

834
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,900
Nah, dude, stick the landing.

835
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,740
It's you, baby.

836
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,820
No, come on, you got it, Justin.

837
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,980
He farts.

838
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,820
Okay.

839
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,300
That's what happens at the end of mine is he farts.

840
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,780
In context, it would have been very good.

841
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,080
I was trying to get to like, yes, he farts,

842
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,100
and his butt and his balls and stuff,

843
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,700
but also he turns out to be really good

844
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,780
at running the Cracker Barrel franchise.

845
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,140
That's just the inverse of mine, though.

846
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,060
You just put the balls and the farts at the beginning.

847
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,620
Oh, what if they ran out of syrup,

848
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,840
and he's like, huh, I know how to get some more syrup,

849
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,940
and he finds a new syrup supplier.

850
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,200
Yeah.

851
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,040
And then he stabs him with his katanas.

852
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,780
And then somebody's like, I'm worried about my healthcare,

853
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,860
and he's like, I got your healthcare right here,

854
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,780
and he hands them like a packet with all the information

855
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,260
about the new healthcare plan.

856
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,500
And TJ Miller shows up, and everyone's like,

857
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,280
get the fuck out of here.

858
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,540
You get the fuck out of here.

859
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,380
No, thank you.

860
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,960
Recently, I attended my good friend

861
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,900
and fellow friend of the show's housewarming.

862
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,380
I hadn't been there for very long

863
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,260
before another friend asked me

864
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,020
if I had seen the terrible thing he did in the bathroom.

865
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,860
Oh, Jesus.

866
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,100
Now, I want to clarify here,

867
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,900
because I think the pronoun is difficult.

868
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,600
The he refers to the good friend,

869
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,880
and not the other friend asking about it.

870
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,060
Nervously, I followed up to find out

871
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,580
that our friend had installed a padded toilet seat

872
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,300
in his bathroom.

873
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,380
The bathroom separate from his bedroom

874
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,340
that also served as a guest bathroom for the house.

875
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,200
We tried to tell him that it was unacceptable,

876
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,660
but he wouldn't hear it.

877
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,620
Tell me, brothers, in today's enlightened times,

878
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,780
is it acceptable to have a cheap padded toilet seat

879
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,500
in the one bathroom every guest in your house will use,

880
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,660
or am I in the wrong for not loving it?

881
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,480
We decided to let you be the judges.

882
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,820
I don't understand the, what's the problem?

883
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,260
You don't understand the problem, Justin?

884
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,100
What's the problem?

885
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,660
Let me tell you the problem.

886
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,900
Tell me the problem. The problem is,

887
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,020
and this is a man coming from a man

888
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,760
who owns a bidet and loves it,

889
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,780
but in an ideal scenario,

890
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,900
toilet seats would be a one-use, single-use item,

891
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
and then replaced.

892
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,340
You tear it off the toilet and throw it out the window.

893
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,380
Right, a padded toilet seat is the polar opposite

894
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,320
of a single-use toilet seat,

895
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,540
because when you sit on it and get up,

896
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,740
it will suck back in particles

897
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,700
as it reinflates from your weight being on it

898
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,660
and getting off.

899
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,980
And so not only is it being used, it is saving.

900
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,580
It is downloading every time it is used,

901
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,180
until eventually it's just full of butt particles.

902
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,580
Data, yeah.

903
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,380
Full of butt data.

904
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,900
Yeah, it's not good.

905
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,560
Every part of it, when you sit down

906
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,520
and you expect a firm friend down there

907
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,660
to help you do your thing,

908
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,540
and instead you get a pfft, nope,

909
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,700
and the butt particles, Justin,

910
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,220
how are you not incensed?

911
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,700
I need, Neil deGrasse Tyson sounded off

912
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,260
about the when you nut, it pushed you backwards.

913
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,100
Yeah.

914
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,860
He actually did this back in 2011, so thoughtcrime.

915
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,620
I need him to let me know about the butt particles,

916
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,460
because I think that's gonna be the final word on this one.

917
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,500
I guess I see what you're saying.

918
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,860
How are you not upset about this?

919
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,740
I mean, you're breathing dookie 24 hours a day.

920
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,100
Like, open your mouth and you're breathing dookie.

921
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,940
You should do a medical history podcast.

922
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,820
Everything is dookie, for real.

923
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,100
Like, it's all dookie.

924
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,760
The fact that you can be incensed by this

925
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,600
is a level of naivete that makes me wanna

926
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,900
craft a backpack for you out of forest leaves

927
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,860
and put you in it and carry around,

928
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,740
and you'll be like my little partner

929
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,300
who I teach about the world,

930
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,760
and I raise from a whelp.

931
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,660
Can we all start carrying our own seats?

932
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,960
Yes.

933
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,620
With us, and we could start putting powerful magnets

934
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,820
on all the toilets that will snap onto the seat

935
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,980
and also destroy your cellphone,

936
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,580
but it's a small price to pay.

937
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,420
Okay, this is great, because we're always looking

938
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,700
for new business opportunities.

939
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,780
That's why we started this show, obviously.

940
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,620
We can start personalizing them, and like,

941
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,920
oh, what skin do you have on your toilet seat,

942
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,280
and branding them, and it's like,

943
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,260
oh, it's the new Pokemon toilet seat,

944
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,660
shaped like Snorlax's face.

945
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,780
Oh, when you said skin, I thought you meant

946
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
the skin of other people who had used it,

947
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,940
and that could be cool, too,

948
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,580
because it's like, I got Mark Harmon to use mine once.

949
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,820
Oh, that's good.

950
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,340
Y'all ever use one of those toilets

951
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,100
that the seat has like a layer of plastic on it,

952
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,580
and you press a button and the plastic kind of rotates

953
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,980
to give you a fresh toilet seat every time?

954
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,700
I remember they had one in the West Virginia

955
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,960
like Congress building, and I always was scared of that

956
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,320
because I was afraid it would activate

957
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,160
while I was sitting on it,

958
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,780
and it would twist my butt all up.

959
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,140
You know what I mean?

960
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,300
Yeah, I hear you, man.

961
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,140
I hear you.

962
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,940
What if you could make a toilet seat

963
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,380
look like Guy Fieri's mouth?

964
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,140
And that's the end of the podcast.

965
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,620
I don't, and I don't just mean this episode.

966
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,060
I mean, like, there's not gonna be a way

967
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,520
to come back from that organically.

968
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,280
Like, I can't go back to talking about,

969
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,740
like, I had a weird dream.

970
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,960
Like, I can't talk about that.

971
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,300
I can't talk about Deadpool.

972
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,400
I really, it's hard to really think about

973
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,220
even thinking of anything ever again.

974
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,740
Even when I'm not doing the podcast,

975
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,740
like, my brain won't be able to generate other thoughts.

976
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,300
Like, I'll be looking at my son's face,

977
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,780
and he says this first word, and he says like,

978
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,580
daddy, daddy, I love you.

979
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
And I'll be like, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

980
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

981
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,060
Like, I'll be driving, and there'll be traffic,

982
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,860
but I won't see the traffic, and I'll plow right into it

983
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,040
because of what happened just now.

984
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,820
So, like, the show's over, life's over, happiness is done.

985
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,820
Griffith's canceled.

986
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,620
I'm canceled.

987
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,260
I had plans, I was maybe gonna try

988
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,460
and go see A Quiet Place today.

989
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,980
I have, like, kind of a day off.

990
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,380
But I don't think, I mean, it's gonna be so fresh now

991
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,900
that the thought of me even enjoying a movie

992
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,140
for the next, like, two months, let alone, like, two hours

993
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,860
is a dream. Unthinkable.

994
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,840
A dream I had once.

995
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,800
So there's, I guess, two parts of my life now, two halves,

996
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,300
and I thought that it would be closer to 50

997
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,200
when I would sort of divide my life up like that,

998
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,580
but really, it was right here at 31

999
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,580
before I knew this and after.

1000
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,900
Okay, that seems pretty authoritative.

1001
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,220
Here's one more question.

1002
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,400
I don't know, like, you heard what I just said, right?

1003
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,980
Like, you can give me another question,

1004
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,100
but I'm gonna be here in my own sort of prison.

1005
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,460
That's fine, I wanna see what the new Griffin is like

1006
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,300
because you still gotta make a living.

1007
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,740
Okay, yeah, sure, sure.

1008
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,700
Phone calls tend to give me terrible anxiety

1009
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,520
and at work, this manifests in a very particular way.

1010
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,500
When spelling out a word, I find it very difficult

1011
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,860
to do the traditional letter-as-in-a-word thing,

1012
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,260
like F as in Frank.

1013
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,020
I panic and cannot think of any words

1014
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,220
that start with the letter,

1015
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,980
which just makes me more anxious

1016
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,140
and as it folds in on itself like an Ouroboros

1017
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,980
with sweaty palms, I generally try to get out

1018
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,780
of having to do it by just saying the letter on its own

1019
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,980
and enunciating really hard,

1020
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,140
but sometimes that doesn't do the trick.

1021
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,340
I know there's a military phonetic alphabet

1022
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,860
being in my panicky state, I tend to forget that too.

1023
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,460
Please help, what's the way around this terrible problem?

1024
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,400
Yeah, yeah, it's a toughie.

1025
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,900
What if you just start saying like F as in F,

1026
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,420
G as in G, you know, like the letter G.

1027
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,380
F as in the one after E and before G, if that helps.

1028
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,740
You know, the one that's like in the alphabet,

1029
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,260
maybe just start saying the number

1030
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,880
and you're like D as in the fourth letter.

1031
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:29,940
Yeah.

1032
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,860
Could you learn Morse code?

1033
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,460
Uh-huh.

1034
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,360
Could everyone would have to, huh?

1035
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,740
Sure.

1036
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,420
Griffin, are you okay?

1037
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,420
Let me try to, Alar, split my mind into two halves

1038
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,420
and a half of it will always be thinking

1039
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,260
about the thing Justin said, but the other half

1040
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,220
is gonna be trying to make comedy,

1041
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,860
but it's just gonna be 50% of a brain,

1042
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,900
but have you ever heard people try to use

1043
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,620
the military phonetic alphabet, but they're not military

1044
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,660
and they say things like Quebec, Foxtrot,

1045
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,420
Bravo, Bravo, Juliet, November, Oscar,

1046
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,260
and it's like, dude, you need to fucking chill out here,

1047
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,140
Jason Bourne, Yankee, Zulu, X-Ray, Bravo.

1048
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,980
You need to calm the fuck down there.

1049
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,300
You're taking so much more time to do it

1050
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,380
and some of them don't even sound like other letters.

1051
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,540
Like you don't even need to worry about it.

1052
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,960
I think I've got Q down.

1053
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,460
I think if you say W, I probably know what you mean.

1054
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,260
Yeah.

1055
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,320
F, F as in Frank, who's ever heard F?

1056
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,140
I mean, I guess it comes with an S.

1057
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:37,980
I guess.

1058
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,160
Sound like X too, if you think about it,

1059
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,060
if your connections have. Oh my God, you're right.

1060
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,900
All right, let's do this, a new alphabet.

1061
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,180
Fuck the old alphabet.

1062
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,420
A, A can, A sounds like J, so A's gotta change.

1063
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,340
Now it's called- And why is it, wait,

1064
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,300
why is it gotta be in that order?

1065
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,820
Cause the order is completely without,

1066
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,120
like A does not naturally come before B.

1067
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,360
Someone made that decision. Sure.

1068
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,360
We just need 26 sounds that don't sound like anything else.

1069
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,520
So we can be like, squeak, and crumb.

1070
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,740
And Doug.

1071
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,340
And Doug, and bug.

1072
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,580
Ah, shit. Fuck!

1073
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,620
See? Okay.

1074
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,960
There's only so many sounds.

1075
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,780
Nah, I can make 26 sounds right now.

1076
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,840
I'm even with half of you with half my brain.

1077
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,860
I'll count. Okay.

1078
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,660
This'll be a great finale, I'll count.

1079
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,740
Okay, well I'll use some letters,

1080
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,900
cause it's gonna be hard work,

1081
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,780
but it can be like A, B, crumb.

1082
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,620
Okay.

1083
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,340
D, wow, it starts off with a lot of rhymes.

1084
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,740
Yeah, a lot of rhymes. B, C, D, E, all rhymes.

1085
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,300
So A, B, crunk.

1086
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,300
Doug.

1087
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,300
Oh!

1088
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,140
F.

1089
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,620
Gumpy.

1090
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,460
No, you can't have two syllables.

1091
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,640
It can't be two syllables.

1092
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,480
No, we do have double E though.

1093
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,740
Double E is suck my ass. Okay, you're right, dumpy.

1094
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,580
Okay, dumpy.

1095
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,100
Huff my duff.

1096
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,740
Is that the, wait, is that for H?

1097
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,580
Huff my duff?

1098
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,060
Huff my duff is H.

1099
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,700
Start from the beginning.

1100
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,540
Okay.

1101
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,680
A, B, crunk.

1102
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,520
Doug.

1103
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,340
E.

1104
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,180
F.

1105
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,900
Gumpy.

1106
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,380
Hey!

1107
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,100
I is good.

1108
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,820
J is good.

1109
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,660
J's not good.

1110
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,500
J rhymes with A.

1111
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,420
J sounds like A.

1112
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,420
Oh, you're right.

1113
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,980
You gotta be able to whistle to do this alphabet.

1114
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,820
Okay.

1115
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,860
Start over.

1116
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,680
God.

1117
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,060
A, B, crunk.

1118
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,900
Doug.

1119
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,720
E.

1120
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,560
F.

1121
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,500
Gumpy.

1122
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,020
Hey!

1123
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,820
I love you, dad.

1124
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,180
Is I.

1125
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,660
I love you, dad.

1126
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,020
You're right, this is too hard.

1127
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,860
It's too much work.

1128
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,940
You did so good, you made nine, you made 10 letters in.

1129
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,100
All right.

1130
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,020
Jesus, we'll just give him that letter.

1131
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,320
People seem to be a big fan.

1132
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,500
Cronk two, you would say it

1133
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,260
and let people know it's the second one for K.

1134
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,700
The sequel.

1135
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,460
L is good.

1136
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,040
M is good, but then N has to be like evil M.

1137
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,800
Oh, daddy.

1138
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,660
So you reference your dad in two of the letters

1139
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,460
of the alphabet and he's really gonna appreciate that.

1140
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,580
The military word for P is papa,

1141
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,540
so let's just continue the theme there.

1142
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,880
Quebec I like.

1143
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,420
Arr, fun pirate joke, people like that.

1144
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,260
Very good.

1145
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,700
And then we can do like sssssssss.

1146
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,200
T just be like, you clap.

1147
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,800
So that's gonna make Spelling Bee

1148
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,500
sort of like a stomp musical.

1149
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,560
A U and W I think can stay.

1150
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,920
This is stop being funny.

1151
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,620
Okay, now start from the beginning.

1152
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,020
Repeat it one more time, Griffin.

1153
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,340
No, there's only four more letters

1154
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,660
and so I feel like I should finish,

1155
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,020
but I'm conflicted because of just how

1156
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,340
it's long ago it stopped being entertaining at all

1157
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,260
for anybody.

1158
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,580
Go ahead and finish it though.

1159
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,620
Vape, W, cross.

1160
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,540
Okay, that's good, it's easy to remember.

1161
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,420
Yep.

1162
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,740
Said like the guy on Storage Wars for Y.

1163
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,160
Thank you, yes, good, yes.

1164
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,860
And then Z is, well you're just gonna remove that one.

1165
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,300
Oh, so we won't have that letter anymore.

1166
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,460
Excellent, 25 letters.

1167
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,180
25 feels a lot better to me.

1168
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,100
Yeah, me too.

1169
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,660
Folks, that's gonna do it for us this week.

1170
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,620
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

1171
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,800
We always do our best.

1172
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,640
There it is.

1173
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,580
We do our best.

1174
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,220
Thank you to everybody who came out to our shows

1175
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,620
in the Midwest this past weekend.

1176
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,220
It was, you were all very pleasant

1177
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,940
and you have beautiful cities

1178
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,620
that we wish we had had more time to explore.

1179
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,920
Next week you are going to hear our show from Columbus

1180
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,540
where we experimented with a new audience questions format

1181
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,580
that I think went very, very well

1182
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,180
and we got a lot of very nice feedback on,

1183
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,040
so we're probably gonna do that from now on

1184
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,900
and you will hear that next Monday

1185
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,020
when you hear the Columbus episode.

1186
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,260
Also, speaking of our live shows,

1187
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,320

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,440
You can also pre-order that at theadventurezonecomic.com.

1198
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,780
You can also pre-order the Sawbones book

1199
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,100
on Amazon right now.

1200
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,520
Bit.ly forward slash Sawbones book.

1201
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,740
I wrote it with my wife

1202
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,380
and Taylor's wrote the illustrations

1203
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,460
and it's a great book.

1204
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,260
It's gonna be a good book.

1205
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,420
We also just real quick,

1206
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,400
I don't know if we announced this on NBNB AM yet,

1207
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,000
but we're doing, so there's a company

1208
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,420
called the Mysterious Package Company.

1209
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,940
It's an amazing kind of deal where you sign up

1210
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,260
and they send you stories as packages.

1211
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,820
So you get letters and items in the packages

1212
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,700
that kind of tell a story as it all unfolds

1213
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,020
and we are partnering with them

1214
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:56,020
to do a Tacos School of Wizardry story with them

1215
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,300
and we're really, really excited about it

1216
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,860
and you can pre-order that now.

1217
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,420
Do we have a bit.ly for that?

1218
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,580
Yes, bit.ly forward slash taco school.

1219
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,780
That's T-A-A-K-O and you can.

1220
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,360
If you didn't know that, you're not gonna pre-order this.

1221
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,860
Yeah, that's a fair, that's fair, that's fair, yeah.

1222
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,660
But it's $64.99 and it's like,

1223
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,180
which is like a little pricier

1224
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,340
than we normally like to do things,

1225
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,660
but when you're making stuff

1226
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,620
and then putting it in the mail and sending it places,

1227
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,100
I don't know, you get to a certain point

1228
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,140
where it's as low as you could make it, I promise.

1229
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,020
It covers two big old packages full of fun stuff.

1230
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,420
And it's great because it's a great thing

1231
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,380
if you want to get it for yourself

1232
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,660
and it also makes a great present, so check that out.

1233
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,620
Especially if you can give it to somebody

1234
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,340
who doesn't have any idea it's happening,

1235
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,300
what a wild gift that would be.

1236
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,540
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1237
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,100
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1238
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,780
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1239
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,020
It's a very good album

1240
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,300
that I cannot speak highly of enough,

1241
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,820
I can't speak enough highly,

1242
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,420
I can't speak high enough of it.

1243
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,380

why should I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

How do I be fleet?

1268
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,300
Is it okay to break up with someone using emojis?

1269
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,060
And sometimes we talk about butts.

1270
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,600
