1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:29,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Better it's better

8
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,260
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,940
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your miller's brother Travis big dog wolf wolf for McElroy

10
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,820
And I'm also a new brother and happy to be here Ron funches

11
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,520
Ron funches is our newest brother. That's our new brother Ron funches. We had to get rid of Griffin

12
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,820
They say last in first out, you know what I mean?

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,860
Yep, he's the youngest one and we needed some new fresh blood on the show. So we brought our dear friend Ron funches

14
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,660
Yeah, it's what some will play it called a studio reboot. Yep

15
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
family, yeah

16
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,420
We started with the family first like Ron has been in

17
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,180
Inserted into our family for a guy. It's been a few months now Ron where we brought you into

18
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
Have dinner with us

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,580
All the usual salads. Yeah, Christmas exchanges all the usual

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,540
And now only now that we've perfected the at home those rhythms that it took us decades to perfect with Griffin

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,860
Now we're ready for to make a podcast together. That's exciting. Well, it's fun. It really didn't take that long with me

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,540
Yeah, I mean he must have been you know, not that

23
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,020
Enjoyable to take decades to get that repertoire that only took us weeks

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,140
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say it Ron, but that is accurate

25
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,260
You know what? I mean, I just feel like I feel like you're more our brother now than Griffin ever was Wow

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,140
Yeah, I mean I didn't want I mean I do want to say it because I felt it

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
Yeah

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,660
More like our brother that Griffin ever has or ever will yep, I agree

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,380
This is this is so this is very exciting

30
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:07,620
Because Ron also has a thrilling. I mean, you know Ron from everything most importantly like us

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,660
He was a star of trolls and trolls world tour

32
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:18,060
We were only in the second one, but uh, you know Ron's done that with us and Ron does they couldn't afford you for the first?

33
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,580
That's right

34
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,180
project

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,860
Ron is the stand-up Ron does a

36
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,260
Podcast and Rhonda's streaming on streaming on Twitch Ron does everything but right now I want to talk about

37
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,900
I'm so excited for chop 420 on discovery plus

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,860
Launching I guess as the crow flies tomorrow if you're listening this launch day, why wouldn't you?

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,380
Can we just can I just can you just tell me what it's like? How is it wrong? It is as if

40
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,940
At some point I just have to go like am I dead is this a thing where

41
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm just living in my brain

42
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:06,900
you know like a matrix style thing of a future that I created that I would have wanted where they feed me delicious foods of

43
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
ducks and

44
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,060
Extravagant items and then they're also infused with marijuana and I get to host the show and I had to sign a contract

45
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:23,460
That said are you okay with smoking marijuana on camera, which most of my contracts say, please don't smoke marijuana

46
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,900
How do you like keep a balance like how do you do have you did you like at any point did you have to like

47
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,440
Pull aside a producer be like just a quick update. I'm getting too high

48
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,580
We're still making a TV show, right

49
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,560
I have a pretty good tolerance. So it never really came up and also I like to be professional

50
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:54,100
So, you know, I didn't I have to eat that much and I just had to smoke on occasion

51
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,740
So I just tried to host and have fun and then smoke after or smoke whenever was appropriate

52
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,820
But you know, it never it never became an issue for me. I could have done more for person now Ron

53
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,740
What's it like having a high tolerance with marijuana because if I hear but somebody like just hearing you talk about it

54
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,900
Now is making me feel like my organs are moving around inside my body

55
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,860
It's nice and also there's pluses and negatives

56
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,420
I think having a low tolerance is fun because then it doesn't take much at all

57
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
You're happy anything exactly

58
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,660
Exactly, but then having a high tolerance could be fun because you learn to appreciate the different flavors the different notes of things and

59
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:44,380
Can be fun like people who you know people who love wine a lot are just alcoholics, but

60
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,940
Still have fun with it, you know Ron, I'm really excited that we got you here because this gives us a chance to sort of

61
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,020
Shepard the next generation of TV stars because as you know, this everyone knows we had

62
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,900
Kind of a huge hit series called my brother my brother me on the CISO streaming network

63
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,300
And now I sort of I'm so excited to pass on sort of our expertise

64
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,220
that we gained from those six episodes of

65
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,220
television

66
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,900
The number one thing if I may Justin yeah, please if you need to go potty during filming you say ten one

67
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,260
And it means you have to go pee and ten two

68
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Means you need to make a dookie and you say those things and it confuses the crew so they can't judge you for

69
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,900
Releasing your your bodily stuff. So that's just something you need to know. I thought that might be some more sound guy made up

70
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,980
Especially the part where you have to delineate what you'll be doing the bathroom

71
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,120
I can't imagine why the sound guy needs to know that I will say the other day I when I was doing the live stream

72
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,140
escape room all of a sudden Neil Patrick Harris sprung up from his chair and yelled 10-1 and

73
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,060
There's no editing now Ron how many episodes are can we expect the first batch from

74
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,180
From chop 420. Well, you can expect five episodes to drop on

75
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,740
420 on discovery plus gives you a chance to binge them all

76
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:27,540
give us a chance to hopefully get people to rewatch them and and I would love to just get right back to making a new batch because

77
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,380
I

78
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,540
It's my favorite job. I've ever had I'm really good at it. I think

79
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:42,540
I'd like to keep doing it. It's just I mean that it's so fun to me because it's

80
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,040
It's like kind of a perfect mix of what I try to do. It's got the the chopped franchise

81
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,700
Which is the tent pole the cooking community is in the background of everyone's home

82
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,580
And then you add marijuana in me. It's fun. It's gonna be so fun

83
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,640
I just want people give it a chance you have the parts normally the hosts on these will like

84
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,940
Snatch a bite of the food, even though they're not judging. They'll like get a bite, right?

85
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,120
Does it is that the way does I feel like that'd be so much pressure because I I like most stuff that I

86
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,460
You know me like I like most things so I feel like I would be the one who's like, man

87
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,660
I don't know seems good to me. I yeah seems good. It's all warm all the way through and stuff. It's got salt

88
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,660
I love it. And then the judges would be like you uncultured buffoon. Yeah, that's pretty much what happened. Yeah

89
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
My anxieties are just yeah

90
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:46,340
That's what it was like to host it. But that's I felt okay with that cuz you know, I felt if people

91
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,540
Already cuz you know you get the like there's been other like pot

92
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,220
of cooking shows they're all like real laid-back and stuff and I think this one, you know

93
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,500
People were really going for that $10,000 is a lot of these chefs

94
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,140
Hadn't worked that much recently because the pandemic of course, you know

95
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,780
And so I was like, oh I can kind of like there's other people's jobs that tear apart their dishes or whatever

96
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
like I think it's my job to kind of just

97
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:20,040
Let everybody shine and you know and kind of cheerlead for everybody and support all the people and and I'm

98
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,500
Good at that. So that's kind of what became my role in the whole show now

99
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,320
Was there was there ever a moment and I know you can't give spoilers wrong

100
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,940
But was there ever a moment where somebody finished their dish and realized they'd forgot to put marijuana in it and just kind of sprinkled

101
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,940
it on top

102
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
That's what I would do

103
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,100
All right, let's get into like let's I mean I want to help people yeah, especially we have something actually knows they're talking about for a change

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,940
Let's go my friend and I have been talking a lot in the past several conversations

105
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,760
We have had she has mentioned a hat that I knitted for her

106
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,200
She had thanked me many times for it and made comments about how much she likes it

107
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I had no memory of ever giving her a hat, but I do knit

108
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,240
So I assume I gave it to her a long time ago and it has slipped my mind

109
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,200
For this reason I've mostly just given a vague you're welcome anytime

110
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,800
Recently, I was at her house and she pointed out the very well-made hat to me brothers. I did not make this hat

111
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,460
Shit brothers and Ron Funches. I did not make this hat

112
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,240
She has now asked me a couple times whether she can pay me to make another one like it

113
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,340
Do I agree to make her another hat under the guise of being the original has creator?

114
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,100
Do I come clean and face questioning about why I pretended to remember making the hat?

115
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,220
That's from knitting confusion in North Carolina

116
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
You should have told the truth the first time

117
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,540
I don't know how many times we have to tell people this but I feel like if you lie one time

118
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,020
That's kind of you've made that decision. I don't know

119
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,900
I know I just had to commit to the lie now. You've got to commit now

120
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,020
You've made a prison of lies and you're living it. This feels like a different scenario though because they didn't lie. Someone said

121
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,380
Did you make that hat and they thought I've made a lot of hats. I don't remember it but probably yeah

122
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,440
Yeah, sure. Like I don't know. I think that that was just more of like, you know, you assumed you made the hat

123
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,740
No, no, she pointed the hat out. Did you remember the part from the now friend pointed the hat out to you at their house?

124
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,860
But that was after they had already said that they made it that was after the assumption

125
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:38,940
That well, that's called what it is. You're not wrong the lie, but it was kind of an accidental lie. No, no, no

126
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,060
Can I point out one thing, please? And I'm not a judge. I'm very

127
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,620
Sex positive in all things, but this person sounds like a bit of a hat floozy

128
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Okay. Yeah

129
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,540
random hats from

130
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,820
Whoever to the point that they don't know what they got to have from

131
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,020
That's a good point there how many hats is this person getting yeah

132
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,980
You want out there but don't

133
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,580
Don't then turn around and then make other people feel bad about it

134
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,960
I feel like maybe yeah, you go ahead and say I will make you another hat

135
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:22,340
And but it doesn't have to be like that hat you just go look each one is a piece of art that I've made

136
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,460
That was the mood. I was in for the previous hat and now you get this other style hat

137
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,980
I bet you they don't they won't say anything. I'm not the me I was when I made that hat. Mm-hmm

138
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,660
Right, that's not a lie, right? You're not you're not the person who made that

139
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
It's actually pretty good

140
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,060
You know what we said that once you live one time but Travis kind of inadvertently made a decent point in that

141
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
um

142
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,700
You did have a one off ramp you had a chance

143
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,700
You had one chance when you saw the hat to be like, oh, okay

144
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,620
This is I'm sorry. I was confused about a different hat. This is not my work

145
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,780
I think there's a miscommunication, but you didn't do that and that was the last chance you didn't do that

146
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:19,380
Yeah, you have to live with this. You cannot go back. It's too wild. Yeah, that was when the mistake was made

147
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,820
The only out now is to truly just like borrow that half

148
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,780
I go like I'm gonna need this hat to recreate it and then you just have to spend your life

149
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,100
Trying to recreate that hat perfectly

150
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,780
Yeah, yeah, I mean I didn't want to say it but I think that's your option

151
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,860
You could also just stop talking to this person. Yeah, that's that's cut him out of your life. Yeah, that's always the option

152
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,380
I think that weren't so many times. I have would you guys like a Yahoo answer?

153
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,980
Oh, man, it's still a little fresh the wounds still a little fresh because it is

154
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,500
dying on

155
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,060
Well, I mean the last day to submit questions is tomorrow

156
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,060
But yeah, Trav. Yeah, I guess I guess I guess I guess so. Yeah. Okay. I'm filling in for Griffin here

157
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,620
So it's weird. This is uncharted territory for me. But here we go

158
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,740
This was sent in by Ben Kent. I believe the Wizards been can't if I remember correctly

159
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,300
It's asked by an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call Griffin McElroy and Griffin McElroy asks

160
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,580
Do you think frogs even like eating bugs or is it just their nature instinct? I

161
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,620
like this question because it does posit the idea of like a frog like eating a bug like oh

162
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
I wish I could eat

163
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,060
Oh

164
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Gross

165
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,020
Yeah, I mean I guess bugs are just I think it is probably instinctual well

166
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,260
Would you have to be taught where but your bet your parents probably have to teach you which ones are bugs, right?

167
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,060
Crogues I think apples are like very large stationary bugs, you know or

168
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,980
Cars are like gigantic metal bugs that you can eat like your parents have to teach you bug from not bug

169
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,100
I would assume

170
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,180
Well, do you think after a while like you you eat bugs for a while?

171
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,860
And then you see like a human being like having a hamburger and you're like wait, hold on. What the fuck is that?

172
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,300
No, no, I don't you don't think that happens. I don't think so. No, it's so big

173
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,260
You know, I think her to you you're out there. There's a lot of options. There's other things the tap hole

174
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,500
Oh, I guess you wouldn't use a tadpole. Oh god. No

175
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,540
Oh, that'd be ghoulish get yourself kicked out. Yeah kicked out of your frog family

176
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,020
I like to see what happens with that one and to tell you the truth, but I feel like you you love the bug

177
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,620
There's other options you could be having and you're choosing the bugs. I mean, I like crab

178
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,060
Well crabs was bugs of the sea, you know who we who we?

179
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,260
Who are we to judge frogs? No, I was just asking who we were just

180
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,620
Oh, oh Ron, um, we're the McElroy brothers. Yeah, you us three. Oh, yes

181
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,740
I mean like I feel like nature's part of it, but there's definitely some trial and error

182
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,540
Right. I mean you're definitely gonna eat something. It's not a bug and it turns out it was a pop cap. It's like oh, man

183
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,180
Yeah, I don't want that and also I feel like they eat certain bugs right not every bug passes the test

184
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,420
There's some type of palette involved

185
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,040
You gotta like some bugs more than other bugs, I guess well, I mean Timon and Pumbaa did teach us that like one

186
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:35,180
Bugs are delicious. But two there's got to be bugs that frogs are like, oh shit. Yeah that bug. That's the best bug

187
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,340
We'd love eating those bugs those bugs though. Those are the bad tasting bugs. We don't like those bugs

188
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Probably

189
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,020
Yeah science

190
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,100
Here's another question while in a car with my new co-workers. I was offered a piece of hard candy

191
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I had never tried before I

192
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,460
Gratefully accepted and I was enjoying the candy when I realized it was chewable

193
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,760
Now I'm sitting in the back seat trying desperately to figure out if this is supposed to be gum or something to be eaten

194
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,220
I've been setting the way my co-workers are moving their jaws and I still don't know what this candy is

195
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,500
What should I do? I really don't want to embarrass myself in front of my new friends

196
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:24,740
That's her full mix of Florida. Wow. Well, first of all, they probably been holding on to this for a long time now. Yeah

197
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,660
Yeah, there's no way we've got to this person in time to help

198
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,540
Gotta be stale by now or the mouth. They're just really chewing.

199
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:41,340
I enjoy that the person this question asker did not tell us what candy this is. They don't know. They don't know

200
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,380
It's a new experience to them. They don't even okay, okay

201
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,500
Which is the thing that I like about them first of all that they were open to new candies

202
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I like that as a person to me that tells me

203
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:58,860
That you've already found friends that are gonna like you and enjoy you that that you were open and willing to try a new candy

204
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,300
Experience you never had before. I'm gonna even if it's new to you

205
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,840
I refuse to believe you got a friend up in the front. They're like, hey, do you want candy? Do you want a candy?

206
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
Yeah, hey everybody. I'm gonna enjoy a candy

207
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,920
I feel like to enjoy a candy with me. No one would say it that way you serial killer. They would say a piece of candy

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
That's so dumb to script. I couldn't answer that

209
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,400
How do I know if I what if you got good and plenty's up there and I'm gonna subject myself to that

210
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on now, first of all good and plenty's are fine. Disrespect. Thank you so much

211
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,400
Oh, thank you my brother back you

212
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,720
Understand if you've had the most majority of good and plenty's are stale and inedible bricks

213
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,380
But if you just happen to have a lucky day, you'll find it a fresh batch of good and plenty's

214
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,640
It'll change your opinion. Really Ron. I just can't I can't get on board with it

215
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,320
Maybe it's like, you know, it's been a long time since I've tried him

216
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,060
I'm older now and I've learned a lot about the wrong person's candy. That's a dope candy

217
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
You need a mature

218
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,240
Palate to enjoy a good and plenty

219
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,760
I also I think I have a soft spot in my heart for good and plenty

220
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,800
Because they basically the name of them like there's fine. They're fine. There's a lot of them

221
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,240
Like the claim to fame is they're okay, and there's more than you expect

222
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,480
It was just true they feel it to the brim. Yeah, they know what they are

223
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
You know, they're not called like excellent and plenty. They're good

224
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
Okay, but you have okay, but what?

225
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,880
What you have said it has a grain of truth. Not the good part, but the plenty part is interesting because

226
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,720
most snack or junk type foods

227
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Market themselves on their crave ability. Yep, like if you think about Pringles like once you popped off the fun

228
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,360
Don't stop lace potato chips bet you can't eat just one

229
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,800
Right what good and plenty has the gust to say is you will get to a point where you're like, I've had plenty of these

230
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Yeah

231
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,680
One serving in here this is fine. Yeah, this is good

232
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm at a good level with these

233
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,660
Yeah, we just need something to chew on yeah good and plenty is there for yeah, I mean you're not wrong

234
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,080
It's it's a fair point. What was the question? Oh, I don't just swallow it

235
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,160
I mean you're gonna swallow it one way or the other might as well swallow it right now just swallow it

236
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,480
Yeah

237
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,160
And if it started off as a hard candy that got chewable odds are it's a candy not a gum

238
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,820
Like I don't know many gums that start off that way unless you're like

239
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,520
Even the hardest of the icebreakers, you know aren't like a hard candy

240
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,400
I think it must be a candy with a gooey

241
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,160
Chewy metal in the same family of a good and plenty or now

242
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,920
Eminem's I have been tricked by a mentos before because a mentos it's original right is

243
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,280
Seems so much like gum and it's not and then there's mentos gum

244
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,620
Which is almost exactly the same as mentos

245
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,920
Except it's gum. It's it's it's really fucking with me guys. I think you figured out what it was

246
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,000
I think it must be a mentos. It's gotta be right. It's confusing shit. Oh, I

247
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,640
Guess I mean, I guess it's possible anything's possible in this world, but I don't know you just got a dream

248
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I guess you just swallow it

249
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,120
Um, that's actually where I'm gonna come down no matter what it is. And and I think that you're I think you can later

250
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,920
Be like that candy was great. What was that? Oh, maybe can you stash it?

251
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,960
Can you kind of park it like you're supposed to do nicotine gum just like park it behind your lower lip and just be like

252
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,080
Oh, that was great. I've finished it. I've either spit it out or swallowed it

253
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,920
I finished mine. I'm done. What was that again?

254
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,000
I want to buy more later so I can either swallow more or spit out more pieces of it. Yes first. I'm done

255
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,800
My candy experience is complete

256
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,080
This is why cars should never have gotten rid of ashtrays in the door handles

257
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,320
Cuz that's what you could have hidden this but not now there's not a good receptacle for this in cars these days

258
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,120
Bring back car ashtrays. You guys remember those? Yeah

259
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Lincoln Continental

260
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Realize we were dealing with the royalty

261
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,000
I work in an engineering company and my co-worker Kyle has been acting strange lately with others and myself

262
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,680
He pins blame on other people and out outright avoids projects with with problems

263
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:57,480
But he's fine with with me for some reason. I have no quarrel with him and relatively just chill with others

264
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,160
We're going out to a brew house tonight with everyone in the department invited

265
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Should I invite Kyle?

266
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,840
That's her anti-social engineer in York. Oof

267
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Kyle on the outs

268
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
poor Kyle

269
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,600
Hmm. He seemed like he's making this problem

270
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,080
Here's the thing though. Kyle seems fine with the question asker for some reason

271
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Yeah, I don't know that I don't want to throw that away

272
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
You don't want to get on Kyle's bad side

273
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,400
Mmm, that's true. Cuz that way if you can play both

274
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,600
You get the full scope of the office, right? Yeah

275
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,960
You get the anti Kyle people tell you things and then you can tell the Kyle telling you his crazy side

276
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,760
your little Kyle birds

277
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,360
Your little Kyle birds telling you all your secrets. I want to keep a Kyle on my side

278
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,240
Yeah, I don't think I want to ostracize Kyle

279
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,960
Especially you might be all that Kyle has and that's gonna be hurtful. I think that's more important to foster that relationship

280
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,600
With Kyle cuz he really depends on you

281
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,780
Yeah, I think you can just sort of toss it by the wayside, you know

282
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,960
You might be able to bring Kyle back to the fold

283
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,480
You know what I mean? You might be able to reach out and help Kyle exactly because it says he's been acting strange lately

284
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Kyle wasn't always like this

285
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,320
Mmm, something's happened to Kyle something's going on with Kyle and Kyle's Kyle

286
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,560
Divided against himself cannot stand you guys. Oh, wow. You gotta build Kyle up not tear Kyle down

287
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,080
Yes behind every powerful Kyle. There's a good friend

288
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:47,400
It's maybe time to invent something that happened with Kyle that you can tell everybody else that they'll be nicer to Kyle

289
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,800
Is that like Kyle's been going through a hard time lately?

290
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,360
I what kind of hard time you can say heartbreak and heartbreak is so

291
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:01,300
Versatile it really is because people might assume romance, but you can have your heart broken about a lot of things, you know

292
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Yeah, heartbreak can come from anywhere

293
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,280
Welcome to our comedy podcast. Well anything can make you sad my friend

294
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,100
Ron you've probably had pretend jobs for about as long as we've had pretend jobs

295
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:23,560
Do you find it hard to reconnect to questions like this and remember what it was like to to have like?

296
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:33,040
co-workers that that you needed to navigate on a daily basis instead of just sort of like transient relationships with the

297
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,120
With the ebb and flow of the entertainment industry

298
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Yeah, I can still remember

299
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,720
No, because I've always used it as motivation. I can still like hear a bank call center

300
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,600
a phone calls going off in the back of my head so I can still

301
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,120
Remember it, but that's also what makes me feel like yeah

302
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,960
This is a make-or-break deal, right?

303
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,160
Cuz Kyle's gonna find out about this party no matter what no one no matter what that Ron makes a great point

304
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,000
It is 100% assured Kyle will find out about the party, especially if people don't like Kyle. They will tell Kyle

305
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,760
Oh, I didn't see you there. What were you Kyle? They will tell Kyle. Mm-hmm

306
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,720
I say bring Kyle what's the worst that could happen with him just coming out?

307
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,160
Oh, he blames other people and he avoids work. That sounds like a cool guy in regular life to me

308
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,040
Yeah, you're outside company hours you leave the company stuff at home at five o'clock

309
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,960
You're like, let's go just hang as regular people and what's going on the day work doesn't matter anymore

310
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,120
Unless it's your company then that's the part in it's the problem

311
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,320
Hey Ron that actually reminds me to ask you does the cast of trolls ever get together and hang out?

312
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,520
Cuz we haven't been getting those invites if that's the case. Yeah, that's been happening

313
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,920
We haven't been on that list. Like are you and Anna Kendrick hanging out a lot? I

314
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,520
Didn't know that I mean, I thought you I just thought you guys were busy. Oh

315
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,360
Okay

316
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,840
Okay, so the same rock what they told me every time, you know at the at the crew on the cruise

317
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
There's a cruise

318
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Last year

319
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
You know Ron we were supposed to

320
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,600
This is gonna be hard for you to hear but we were supposed to go to the premiere of the movie

321
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,560
Yeah, now they did explicitly tell us we couldn't bring anybody

322
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
And they wouldn't pay for our flights

323
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,800
But we were somewhat invited they would permit our fucking human meat

324
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:50,560
This space with the other people where we would be within like I'll probably not we would probably be in the overflow party

325
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,120
Where you're seeing Justin Timberlake on a jumbotron? Yeah run through five minutes

326
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
but um

327
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
the and really the greatest hole covered

328
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,520
It but we that got that didn't happen because they didn't do that

329
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,040
So we didn't get to go to that and that was probably like our one big

330
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,880
I feel like our one big shot. That was our chance

331
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,960
I was sad about that too because my mom was sad cuz she wanted to meet Mary J

332
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,320
Blige and I wanted to meet George Clinton

333
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,800
So I also understand sad and if it makes you feel better

334
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,600
I like, you know that I shot something just yesterday that

335
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,520
The assistant director wanted to let me know that well because I was coming in at the time

336
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,280
I did I technically wasn't supposed to have lunch if I wanted if I was really hungry to find a way to get

337
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,000
What's great about that no I have to know stop don't move forward rod

338
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,320
I have to know what your response was were you hungry enough where you're like, see what you can scrounge? No

339
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,480
I was actually at that point very very thankful that my wife had packed me a protein shake so that I could just go

340
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
No, I'm fine. I

341
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,480
Don't need your pity BLT. Yeah, I don't need you. Yeah, exactly. Oh, thank you

342
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,960
It's wild that the strap the different like

343
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,800
Strata of that, you know, I'll tell you a wild thing. You probably seen stuff like this

344
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,040
But we did our I don't know if you heard but we did six episodes of a streaming TV show

345
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,340
And it was on season network. Yeah, I was on the season network and we shot it and well

346
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,480
What what the heck travel do we shoot that in 2016? Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so we shot that in 2016

347
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,680
the the craft services table

348
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,880
which if you don't know some of the lingo going in is where they put like food and drinks and

349
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,440
We had a micro micro budget for this show. So there wasn't really money for that

350
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,240
there was mainly like old cell phone containers of people's food that they didn't take for lunch and

351
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,360
Like I think a few granola bars. Yeah, and then when they did the promo photos for it

352
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,600
They they had a photographer fly in and it and the photographer in the photography area had the most lavish

353
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,800
Spread of snacks and treats I've ever seen in my entire life

354
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,040
I like it was like it was like a stepparent trying to impress the kid like

355
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Don't give me a dog

356
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,640
Every day to be photo day. This is amazing. Look at this guy's this is fantastic. Oh, I've been on a couple see-so shoots

357
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I knew that the Trader Joe's

358
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,880
crafty that they had there a couple protein bars and

359
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
some crystal geyser waters

360
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,880
You see we shot honey to West Virginians, so we should we could we were murdered for Trader Joe's

361
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,680
I noticed that every this is getting more specific, but I think why not we're all here. We're all friends here

362
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,800
I've found that most in the very few instances and it has been obviously quite a while

363
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,360
In very few instances. I've been near craft services table one common mainstay is a big jug of trail mix

364
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,000
yep, and I think that's very interesting because that seems like a bad choice for the environment because they what they expect you to do is

365
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,920
Get a little styrofoam bowl, huh? I guess it just carry around

366
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,800
And also often there are spoons involved and yeah, like I'm gonna spoon out some trail mix for myself

367
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,200
I just wonder around with it. Yeah, I'm into your hand into your paw and that way it is very eco-friendly

368
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,120
But that's gone now because of COVID. They don't big jug of trail mix

369
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,160
Oh

370
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,400
COVID yeah takes everything from me. How is it? How have you been?

371
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,040
So the past like I don't know. What has it been? It's been almost exactly

372
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,480
13 months since things were sideways. How you been? How you been handling it Ron? It's always ups and downs ebbs and flows

373
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,800
You know, it was terrifying for first couple months and not knowing could stand up was always

374
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,080
not just my main source of income, but my how I kind of defined myself, so kind of forced me to

375
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,400
Redefine myself as more of a full person

376
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:12,440
which I think is probably for the best and then it just allowed me to start doing other things like the twitch and the

377
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:19,000
more voiceovers and and be home more with my family and which was a true blessing to get you know married and

378
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:25,120
Hang around with my son as he's getting ready to turn 18 before he's you know, doesn't want to hang out with me anymore

379
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,240
So and then you know taking some opportunities. I never I might not have done before like the the chop 420

380
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,360
Or you know, I got a movie coming out called golden arm on the 30th. So at the end of it

381
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,160
I'm like things are kind of okay. I'm all fine and it makes me more grateful for when I can go back and do stand up

382
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Whenever I can well i'm going out and do some in may so i'm trying nice to stay grateful and happy

383
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,240
Did you pick up any hobbies any non-entertainment hobbies? I started taking singing lessons

384
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,160
But that sounds like it wasn't for like entertainment. It was just for me

385
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,160
So I just started taking some singing lessons and do that. Um

386
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Every tuesday when I can

387
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,280
That's nice. I recently started taking blacksmith classes, but that is for entertainment purposes because I would like to win forged in fire

388
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,520
Have you found it have you found it hard we were kind of jokingly grousing about this last week

389
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,720
Have you found it hard to like or maybe two weeks? I don't know. Have you found it hard to like come up with new?

390
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,160
Uh, uh creative idea have you been like creatively stymied at all by like the lack of of new inputs?

391
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,880
Uh from the outside world. Oh, yeah, I haven't written a joke in probably a year for sure

392
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,440
Uh, I was gonna ask is that like hey anyone ever noticed how sometimes you come down for breakfast and your favorite chair

393
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,080
A little bit to the right and you're like, well who moved my chair, you know

394
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,640
I want you guys don't talk about have you guys ever noticed that my wife cindy mccroy does this one thing?

395
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,800
Yeah, yeah, I mean pretty much you got it lack of stimulus, you know, but i've been able to write I did write a couple things

396
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,240
but I just

397
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,760
Would change it to other things instead. You know, I wrote a couple. Um

398
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,600
Just script ideas some treatments out and try to do it that way which isn't as

399
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,200
Instantly gratifying as doing stand up

400
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,480
But I felt like you know when you're writing jokes

401
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,280
If you can't practice them if you can't get in front of an audience, I just kind of get stale

402
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
Yeah, pardon me

403
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,600
No, no

404
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,600
So I just was like hey ron. That was a very cute sneeze process adorable. Thank you

405
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Yeah, it's that I am who I am

406
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,800
Now that we've gotten that out of the way all that personal

407
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,520
Personal personal stuff because I think it's nice to check in and we have honestly it's kind of self-serving because I have

408
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Not a lot of other adults to talk to

409
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,320
So like it is

410
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,000
I've kind of using this to my own ends. I'm sorry to uh to listeners for abusing your your time that way

411
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,880
But hey all these perspectives. I feel like the real downside of this is going to be when people start writing a lot about it

412
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,480
and it's like

413
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,080
The everyone's experiences are so similar. I feel like this is gonna be like it's gonna uh, uh

414
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,360
Have this one period like if you set a movie

415
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,720
in this time period are you going to like

416
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,520
Do I guess you just won't right? Well, we're just all gonna pretend we didn't do this for a year

417
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,880
That's what I feel like. I feel like maybe one person gets to do a great one and that's it

418
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,040
and then other than that like I don't I that's what i've been noticing from going out and doing some stand up is that

419
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,960
When people get on stage and they start like being like, oh I went through this and that people are like, yeah

420
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah, we all did and so it's like I think um and what I truly enjoy is that people are just want to be like

421
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,960
Hey

422
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:00,160
I've been stressed out just be silly and make me happy and i'm like that's what I mean that to me is

423
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,160
Um was what I realized like oh, that's my that's my job

424
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,000
That's my purpose right now if things are super stressed out not to be like, whoa

425
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,720
Can you believe this is going on and and i'm poking a hole at this?

426
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,760
It's like let me try to relieve some stress, you know

427
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,200
Yeah, uh, can I do a quick poll real quick for our listeners and a poll a poll. Yeah

428
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,200
Um people listening and of course my two brothers ron and justin

429
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,080
Um when you picture a movie about covid and like starring someone and they're having the experience

430
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,280
Does anybody else picture steve carell or is that just me?

431
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,080
It's just immediately something about it makes me think steve carell

432
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,400
Is going to be the star of the movie about someone's experience through covid

433
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,880
Um, I don't I have not gotten that uh, necessarily. I I guess I kind of

434
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,240
Uh for some reason imagine jason siegel who sure seems like oh like oh no something else happened to jason siegel

435
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,600
Not again

436
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,840
A lot of the stuff that's happening with him. Um, uh, and I feel like jason siegel

437
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
would be the one to make one

438
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,440
um

439
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,240
So tall it's jason statham and he shrinks down

440
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,280
Over directly. Yes. Yes takes the fight to covid. Where's that osmosis jones sequel?

441
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,560
There's a bad there's a real bad dude on the block now now we really gotta get in there now

442
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,360
It's all animated except live action

443
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,960
Jason statham who's been shrunk down interspace style to get in there and fight alongside osmosis jones

444
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
And I believe a tylenol pill

445
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,360
Uh, well, it was not it was not real. Uh, it was dricks. Uh, uh

446
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,080
Was so it was not a dricks at all. So it's not a real time. Oh, right, right, right, right

447
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,400
And and they were fighting anthrax if I remember correctly his name was just thracks

448
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,880
But yeah, that is the that was the implication that it was anthrax

449
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,800
That one white blood cell and I believe a cold and flu pill we're gonna take out anthrax. What a wild movie

450
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,760
And they were all inside uh bill murray's body

451
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,840
um

452
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,880
More movies should take place. This was where this one should take place

453
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,480
I don't want to give bill murray covid but if anyone could make make something out of it he can yeah, he's gonna be unsafe

454
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,520
I hope so. Hope he's not crashing weddings

455
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,120
I don't know. I I I would actually I would love to

456
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,520
Ask just random people on the street like do you think bill murray's been safe for the past year?

457
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,800
Because I feel like it's 50 50 of my head. I have no idea

458
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,920
He's a bit of a recluse so he could just dial that up a little bit and been like super recluse

459
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
But he also seems to like appearing in places

460
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Um, hey, we're gonna take a quick break

461
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
uh from the the

462
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
hubbub of making a podcast

463
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,840
To sell things to you and attempt to sell things to you an assignment. We call the money zone

Um

468
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,300
Well, we sent ron out of the room because honestly he's a guest here and he shouldn't be exposed to such crass

469
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:27,540
He's also he's afraid of he's afraid of commercials. He's afraid of commercials. He said i'll never he's an artist

491
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,340
Love the things i've used them. I've had them used on me

492
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,820
Um by which I mean people have sent things to me using stamps

493
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,740
Not that people put stamps on me and ship me like I was flat stanley. Sure. I understand

494
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,740
Yeah, you get me and so that's why I love stamps.com because I love stamps

495
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:35,940
But I don't necessarily like going anywhere other than where I already currently am at any given moment

496
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,380
You know what I mean?

497
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,740
I don't want to take trips to the post office. I want to just be able to send things from my home

498
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,540
So stamps.com allows me to mail and ship anywhere

499
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,180
Right from where you are right from your computer, right?

500
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,020
So whether you're a small office sending out invoices and online sellers shipping out letters or even a giant

501
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,940
warehouse

502
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,460
Uh, it's important I think to include the warehouse part or even a giant sending thousands of packages a day

503
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,900
Stamps.com can handle all of that with ease with stamps.com

504
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,900
You get discounts of up to 40 off post office rates and up to 62 off ups shipping rates

MaxFunDrive 2021 is coming

513
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,600
It'll be May 3rd to May 14th

514
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,960
To get in the spirit we ask folks like you to let us know what maximum fun and our shows mean to them

515
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,280
You know the the maximum fun network is really important to me because

516
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,660
It is not just a collection of podcasts

517
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,280
But it is a lifestyle

518
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,600
And a value system

519
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:12,840
The podcasts frequently and deftly float between meaningful and irreverent in one moment drawing attention to social issues

520
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,640
And in another making dick jokes about Klingons

521
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:22,680
It shouldn't work, but it does and I have to believe it's because MaxFun's podcasts are at their core

522
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,360
Thoughtful and kind and human during a time that has often felt cold and isolated

523
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,360
So keep being great and doing what you do

524
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:38,040
MaxFunDrive will be May 3rd to May 14th 2021 and you won't want to miss it

525
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,880
Brilliant apps drive exclusive gifts and maybe some surprises

526
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:48,060
Want to directly support the hosts of the show? We just jumped into come back May 3rd for MaxFunDrive

527
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,720
Okay, do you guys want to hear another yahoo answers question

528
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,800
Yes

529
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,240
Yeah, okay. This was sent in by Michelle Smith

530
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,800
And and the question here this is asked by Bush

531
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,800
Which celebrity could eat the most hot dogs if given the time and motivation to do so?

532
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,960
And let me be clear here

533
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:27,080
I think the answer to this could literally be anybody right? But yeah, I I don't think it has anything to do and like with

534
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,600
with sort of their their their the physical body

535
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,680
I think it's more about like the spirit because if you look at the some of the competitive eaters

536
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,280
They're not people who you feel like have been eating like a while like they they're surprising

537
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,420
It's a surprising thing and the best part about this question to me is one word and that is motivation

538
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,040
given the motivation

539
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,640
To eat the motivation, right? They have to save their village or something

540
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,480
I don't know whatever the motivation or like if they switched up some of the like qualifications to win an oscar this year

541
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,840
You know what I mean? It was like whoever can eat the most hot dogs, right? I have two answers. Okay. Okay

542
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,460
Okay, the first answer I think is probably

543
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,320
The most logical answer is this person I think can eat a lot

544
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,720
We've seen it on their instagram that they can eat quite a bit when given the motivation. They also work out a bunch

545
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,880
And I think yes, they are the perfect specimen. Yep

546
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
They are the beyonce for boys

547
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,760
Yeah, the only person that could be both president and a competitive eater

548
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,100
Yeah, that is dwayne the rock johnson. I mean, it's a perfect answer. I mean, it's it's it's indisputable

549
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,440
Um, and he seems like a highly motivated man, right highly motivated to put it away

550
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,680
Like highly the rock seems like if he put his mind to anything

551
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,680
He would do it right like yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

552
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,440
My second answer is helen mirren because oh, okay

553
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,160
She commits to everything she does commit

554
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,920
See, I think cluny could put him away. I think cluny I I could see him

555
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,520
Being suave and looking cool while he does it

556
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,080
But just kind of quietly

557
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:14,940
Consuming an absurd amount of hot dogs. Yeah ben affleck ben affleck could either ben affleck could oh

558
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,100
If they challenge I would like to see the three

559
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,740
Uh oceans 11 leads, of course

560
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:28,300
I think the three of them brad pitt ben affleck. No way matt damon. I always get those two confused matt damon

561
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,580
uh

562
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:35,580
Brad pitt and cluny sit down and just have a hot dog eating contest. I'd like i'd pay to see that

563
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,260
You know what I mean?

564
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,460
That feels like one of the pranks they would have had that they love pranks and they love their pranks

565
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,220
They do love their pranks. That's a good point. You guys know about that time that uh, the cluny shit in a cat box

566
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,140
travis

567
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,540
That's real. It was a prank. It sounds apocryphal to me, but no this is a prank

568
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,300
He was saying i'm trying to remember who he was staying with

569
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,460
It's something weird like maybe danny davido or somebody who's staying with them and every morning

570
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,580
Uh cluny would clean the person's cat box before they woke up and so for like a week

571
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,620
The person thought that the cat wasn't going to the bathroom

572
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,860
And so then one morning cluny

573
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:16,620
Took a dump in the cat box and left it there for the person to find and the person was like, holy shit

574
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,340
Cat just made a big human-sized dookie. That's such a why can I say something?

575
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:30,300
Listen, that's such a wild way to balance out the karma of cleaning out the person's litter box.

576
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:37,020
Like so would it be like was george cluny your houseguest and you just sit there in silence for 10 minutes and be like well shit

577
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
Well, I don't know

578
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,220
um

579
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,020
I do hate cleaning the litter box also

580
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,060
Can we also imagine like?

581
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,540
They're usually in clothes

582
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,620
So yeah, right you had to climb in there

583
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,100
This is what i'm saying he was he was motivated and he did it he figured it out

584
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:10,380
He wasn't gonna get shown up by that contortionist from the from the uh oceans movies george cluny can do that too

585
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,380
I could do that for sure. Give me a half hour to get in the cat box real quick

586
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,100
I was in tomorrowland. Come on. Give me it was richard kind

587
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:25,260
Well, it was right. I looked it up. Sorry. He was staying at richard kind's house. Yep. God. There's a house party

588
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,820
Do that to richard kind

589
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,960
It is very tear it's terrible don't do that to richard kind he seems like he's balancing

590
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,940
As it is that you ah that's in that would send him off. I don't want that for him

591
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,300
He's such a nice his kind's in his name. You don't do that

592
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,060
Yeah, when when did I turn into richard mean? Well, it's quite a story

593
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:54,540
Let me told you so, you know, have you ever heard of the show er? Well sit down my friend. I got a tale to tell

594
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,440
Do you remember a guy from the first two seasons of rosanne

595
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:11,340
It's weird that george cluny was also on a sitcom called er, isn't that weird you guys ever think about that it's weird

596
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,380
Eventually, he was also on a drama called er

597
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,300
Yeah, I guess if somebody tries to make a show with er in it. He's just gonna show up like let me in there

598
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,260
I get him. I got an e and an r in my name. No problem

599
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,620
Oh

600
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,340

604
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,380
Fazoles, this is not a joke when a lot of times they're funny

605
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,300
I just want to give a heads up that fazoles is rolling out their wings

606
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,820
System-wide this is breaking news

607
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,680
finally, um in

608
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,480
There's they've been having wings at some locations since september

609
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:18,860
One of the gifts of covet is that I get to say the phrase new virtual wing concept wing ville

610
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,820
From fazoles. They've been sneakily rolling these out to you via door dash and grub hub

611
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:29,920
But now the time has come for uh, all fazoles to have these wings menu innovation

612
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:37,340
Continues to be a key ingredient fazoles recipe for success says fazoles chief marketing officer jody conrad

613
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,100
Delivery and drive-thru have both seen unprecedented sales growth for some time now

614
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,900
I'm out of theory about that jody if you want to take a seat. I have some hard news for you to hear

615
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:55,440
Uh, it's been impossible to eat in restaurants for 13 months. But hey, we knew how innovating our menu with an easily transportable

616
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:00,860
Product like wings would be the perfect solution to leverage this shift in ordering channels

617
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:06,220
Woof, wow wings have been a big contributor to our impressive achievements over the past seven months

618
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,720
So we look forward to seeing this trend continue as we start serving them nationwide

619
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,820
Now have you guys ever been in a fazoles and they give you a piece of pizza and you're like what the fuck am I?

620
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,980
Supposed to do with this. How can I get this home? This isn't transportable at all

621
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,020
No

622
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,180
No, exactly, but that's not that's not our big story. Okay. Our big story was sent to us by jesse. Thank you

Hold on

639
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,980
Explain to me why you need to delineate between cat owners

640
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,940
You don't have to you don't have to own a cat to like fancy feast

641
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:45,340
You can just support the brand. I just like what they're doing over there. I just think they're doing good work

642
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,380
fans of the brand

643
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,540

644
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,020
But made for you

645
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,580
Okay available for download. Let's see. It shows a lack of conviction. I think

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:05,100
Okay, print this motherfucker, let's go get it on ebay careful careful

647
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,300

648
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,260
Inspired by your cat's new favorite petite's entrees. Now. This is a weird little

649
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,220
Weird little cul-de-sac. They've included here is that the recipes

650
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,420
Are also single serve, uh-huh, which I think oh they'd have to be

651
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,100
Kind of they're kind of just it's a little judgmental. No, no

652
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,900
In the audience of a person who would buy a fancy feast cookbook

653
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,740
You welcome for one and also your but maybe for 12 cats, but one person

654
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,980
Yeah fair. You should actually take the time to dine with each of your cats

655
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,940
And if that means you have to eat 12 single serving meals, so be it

656
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,580
Uh, you have to give each of them the attention they deserve

657
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,980
Now these are carefully crafted by fancy feasts in-house chef

658
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,980
hmm, amanda hasner

659
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,900
Along with guest additions from james beard award my name is jerel guy

660
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:07,740
Yeah, uh, james beard award nominee jerel guy and actor turned baker josh schneider the petite's

661
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,380
Chrissy tegan. Wow

662
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,900
Do you just you're just making stuff up such a get

663
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:19,500
The petite's feet cookbook allows cat owners to take part in the dining experience with their cats

664
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:25,740
From chicken and ramen with tomato honey butter sauce to white fish and asparagus with beurre blanc

665
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,100
The cookbook features recipes that are elevated but easy enough to whip up on a weeknight

666
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,820
Now i'm going to stop you right there fancy feast in-house chef from an hasner. That does not seem

667
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:43,580
Easy enough to whip up on a weeknight, but please go on each dish was inspired by the small plate restaurant trend and cat food

668
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:47,580
Also, you can't forget that cat food. So let's go ahead and get started

669
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,500
You can't forget that cat food. The recipes are for humans. Okay

670
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:56,060
Not normally something you have to clarify in a recipe scenario

671
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:01,020
But the recipes are for humans, but were created in honor of the dishes. You will be serving your cat

672
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,180
now

673
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,860
Um, there's there's more to the press release, but I do want to stop for a second

674
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,140
fancy feast petites

675
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:16,220
Are single serving, uh, uh cat foods that you peel and dump in a bowl

676
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,180
Yep

677
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,060
Do you feel like a cat would watch you?

678
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,980
whip up

679
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:29,740
some uh, uh, uh white fish and asparagus with beurre blanc for like an hour and a half and a cat be like listen

680
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,820
I appreciate the effort so much

681
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:37,500
But how is it that you're just gonna like open up a package and dump it into a dirty ball for me?

682
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,460
But you're gonna spend this kind of time on product for you. I feel like there's still an imbalance here

683
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:48,380
I feel like we haven't rectified what's different between the two of us. I also do like the implication here

684
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,900
that like

685
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,820
You would do this and sit down to eat and the cat would think oh finally you're joining me in this

686
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,940
Yeah, your cat is not going to enjoy this. You could try to get your cat to eat with you

687
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,620
I don't think your cat. How was your day? Wait, where are you going? What's wrong?

688
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,300
You know for too long dogs have had

689
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:13,820
Uh, um just the stranglehold of sitting and eating with their owner

690
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,140
They've had lady in the tramp

691
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,340
And I feel like that's what cat owners want here

692
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,860
They want to be able to just share a meal and sit down with their cat pull out a little

693
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,700
Magical cloche and just open it up and one dish for you one dish for the cat

694
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,460
And and this is just something to really just go

695
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,180
This is who I am and i've gone this far and i'm aware of who I am and that's why

696
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,140
I'm comfortable with myself and I love the I love the idea

697
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:48,220
I just don't think a cat I don't feel like your cat is going to indulge you

698
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,100
I don't feel like you're going to say to your cat. Well, it's time to eat together

699
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:57,020
Now that would be the funniest thing though is if you do this on then your cat ghosts you on dinner

700
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:01,740
Oh, yeah, 100 that will be that I know cats i've had cats that will be the outcome

701
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,380
You're gonna get screwed up by something that lives in your house

702
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,180
You're gonna here's what's gonna happen

703
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,340
You will uh

704
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:15,340
Sit until your food gets cold and then you'll dump your food and your cat's food in the trash

705
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,880
You will go to bed and your cat will be like fucking finally

706
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,060
And climb up into the trash and eat all the food. That's cats. That's cats in a nutshell

707
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:29,420
Now I will say though that this is reminding me very much of the commercials that played when I was a kid where

708
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:34,220
I think it was cat food. They'd put that little puck of cat food onto like a crystal bowl

709
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,940
Oh, yeah, a little leaf on it. I do remember thinking as a kid like that looks good

710
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,380
And I think it's all presentation, but I was interested

711
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,540
These retail for a dollar at seven, so come on

712
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:52,860
You're uh, come on. Just make two servings of verblanc. I don't know if cats can have verblanc

713
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,340
Just between you me and the lord. Jesus christ guys. I don't even know what verblanc is exactly

714
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,620
It's something white justin. It's burr white. It's definitely a sauce. That's yeah some type of sauce

715
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:09,660
Also, I don't even feel like petite cats is is the style of meal that I would trust

716
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,700
To be like, oh, that's what you know, I want what a husky cat would want. I want a husky cat

717
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,700
They already make those they're just called hungry man meals and you just rip them up in a microwave

718
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,500
And no problem if your cat saw you doing that they would think ah equal playing ground. Okay, cool

719
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,220
What let me hit you with this idea where rather than trying harder

720
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,340
For to eat with your cat

721
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,900
You should be able to try less for everybody

722
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:44,460
So what i'm suggesting now to you guys is a is an instant microwave meal like a tv dinner. They used to call them

723
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:48,620
An instant microwave meal where one of the things in it

724
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,260
Is cat food. Oh

725
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,260
so you got

726
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,700
You got your chicken nuggets you got your brownie

727
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:02,540
You got your corn that some of the brownie leaked into that's the best corn. You got your cat food right there

728
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,540
Hey everybody soup's on for all of us. Oh, we're all eating together

729
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,500
You know what?

730
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,780
It should be uh, you can tear it away to be a little separate bowl for the cat or not

731
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,980
You know what? I mean if the cat just wants to hop up there next to you

732
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,700
And every like and you guys just kind of lean your heads down and both eat it out of the bowl

733
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,700
Yeah, it's fine. Yeah

734
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:29,020
No, that's the experience that you're really looking for right of eating over the bowl together with your cat. That's what

735
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,620
that's what you want if you are a cat owner or

736
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,860
Of paying a fancy freeze either way now i'm thinking through this now

737
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,060
We are going to have to be real explicit with the labeling on this

738
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:45,360
Because I have eaten some chocolate puddings in kid cuisines that are indistinguishable

739
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:50,640
Indistinguishable from uh from from cat food so that that would be it won't kill you

740
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,640
It'll be she'll be fine. It'd be almost like, you know, they do those mystery candies or the mystery

741
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
Which one's cat food?

742
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,500
That's our guys that's our tagline you'll never guess which one's captured

743
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,200
You guess which one's cat food will send your coupon for another one

744
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,960
Double and then it's double or nothing. We'll send you two the next time you get it. Hey, uh, ron
