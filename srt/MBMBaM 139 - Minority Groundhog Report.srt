1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,240
Welcome my brothers, my brother, me, and my ship for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:56,320
Justin McElroy, and we are all a fever for Super Bowl Sunday. Big, big game. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,560
I'm sorry, big game Sunday. The commish, the commish might be listening, because god knows he's not

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,800
busy governing the rules of the NFL, right guys? Nice, sit burn. Right, maybe governing them

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,160
too much, depending on what the popular wisdom is that will make us seem plugged in. That

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,960
touchdown in that Broncos game was highly suspect. I'm just excited, see a lot of people say they

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
watch the Super Bowl for the commercials, I watch it for the concussions. I wanna see someone have

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,480
some lasting damage. Sure. I watch it for those awesome plays where the dude can't get over the

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,120
line so he dives over everyone. God those are awesome. I love those divers. I love the plays

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,920
where a shirtless man runs out of the stands and has soy bomb written on his chest, and dances

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,120
around midfield. That's a real shame that that is your wheelhouse Justin, because that's an

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,680
incredibly rare, it's like, not a frequent occurrence. I watch the big game specifically

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,400
for the Star Spangled Banner. Who's dropping it on us this year? I have no idea. So you don't

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,520
really read up? No, I like to surprise myself with that. I try not, no spoilers, you know what I mean?

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,800
They're gonna wheel out a small television of a pre-recorded video of Beyonce singing it.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Now are we gonna have, I know that there's a tradition of sort of supplementary bowls. Oh

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,720
yeah. There's of course the Bud Bowl. I'm way more excited for the Puppy Bowl. Oh the Puppy Bowl,

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
I didn't know they were still doing that. Yeah they're doing it, and now they have, I think this

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,560
year they have like Piglet Cheerleaders or some shit. They're really getting out of town. They're

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,200
getting very commercial. Oh they've sold out. Yeah. I'm actually starting my own Puppy Bowl as

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,080
part self-entertainment, part protest. Oh kind of like an underground Puppy Bowl. An underground

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,760
Puppy Bowl. It's a lot more, like the puppies are more like into the sport, you know, they're more

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,040
into the game of it, so they're a lot, they're way more violent. So an X, maybe like the XFL of Puppy.

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,520
It's the XFL. So like arena Puppy Bowl. There's arena Puppy Bowl. I have a tiny, a tiny schnauzer

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,280
called He Hate Me. He's in the mix. You're welcome XFL fans. XFL fans really loved that He Hate Me

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,160
goof. And if you don't know about that one, google that. You're gonna love it. You're gonna love that

32
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:22,080
guy. But I'm having a lot of problems with dog, dog fatalities. Griffin, can you describe to me

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,040
sort of the, the, I'm sure you're, you're using different rules. Yeah it's more, it's sort of,

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,520
describe to me the flow of play. Right, we're basically talking about a one-on-one sort of

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,560
street ball, except they usually just ignore the ball altogether and just try to kill each other.

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,920
And, but like in, I guess in their defense, like there's a bunch of people standing around in a

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,400
circle screaming and throwing money. Griffin, Griffin, I'm sorry. Yeah, wait. It's, it sounds,

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
sounds a lot like the love of the game, right? No, it sounds, it sounds, it sounds like you're

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
hosting a dog fighting ring. It sounds like a dog fighting, yeah, a dog, is there a ball?

40
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,560
There is a, there is a ball, but it's sort of like, it's a little off to the side,

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,320
you know. Sure. Is, is there any kind of referee or like rule system? No, XFL baby, love of the

42
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:20,800
game, love of the sport. Or maybe is there a ruff-ery? No, this is the kind of games you can

43
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,360
expect from our hinted question. Did you guys introduce yourselves? I'm Travis McElroy. I'm

44
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Griffin, I'm Griffin McElroy. Please don't call any cops or animal cops or, I realize, like saying

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,520
all these things out loud. Yeah, don't call the dog, please. Don't call dog the bunny, bunny hunter.

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,840
Let's get into the advice. What do you mean dog the bounty hunter? Only specifically hunted dogs

47
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,600
for sport. You mean the dog bounty hunter. It's just a switching of the article there.

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:01,360
Boba Pat. Guys, Boba Pat. Boba Pat. Are we gonna give advice? I'd like to, yes. I hang out with

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,240
this girl at my office. We take our lunches together and chat all day. She makes work fun.

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Lately, she keeps telling me how attracted she is to me and how it makes her feel awful because she

51
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,760
has a boyfriend and now has suggested we stop hanging out all together. I like her. I think she's

52
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,920
a cute girl, but I just want to keep on being office buddies. Oh my God. How do I get her to

53
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,800
stop obsessing about how handsome she thinks I am? I don't know, but when you figure it out,

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,040
you tell me, brother. Just joke around and have fun like the old days. That's from just friends

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,400
in Florence, Kentucky. This guy sounds a lot like when you were in high school and everybody gets

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,640
their physicals to join the wrestling team and the one guy comes back and is like, yeah,

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,200
apparently the doctor said my wiener is abnormally enormous. Sure, pal. Sure, friend. Too big for

58
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,320
contention. It's in a whole nother weight class. I don't know. He said I couldn't do wrestling time.

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,640
I think if you really want to get serious about this, you got to go full man in the iron mask.

60
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,720
Yeah, that's really the deal. I was sitting here thinking, I'm glad you said it first Griffin,

61
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
because it almost seemed too obvious, but yeah, definitely man in the iron mask,

62
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,080
lock your face in sort of a prison of iron. Sure. I don't remember man in the iron mask,

63
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,880
but I think it was because the queen was sexually attracted to Leo DiCaprio because why wouldn't she

64
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,440
be? And so the king was like, I got to lock it up. Got to lock that sweet face up. And he did,

65
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,680
locked it right up. And yeah, because they couldn't handle his beauty. Made him look like

66
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,440
Ultraman a little bit. I feel like they were mixing their time periods a little bit.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah, it got a little mixed up. I did like it when he got his repulsor raised and started

68
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,320
legways to the bad guys in France. Yeah. That was pretty cool. The man in the iron man. Yeah.

69
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,120
I don't understand this question. Well, see, she's into him, but he's just not that into her.

70
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,880
But is she really into him or is this like, I'm really bored at the office and you're kind of cute.

71
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,360
It sounds like she wants to get a Jim Pam thing going, but her heart's not fully in it.

72
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
She still loves Roy. Giving you the half Jim Pam. And that's-

73
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,200
Because I find that that kind of thing doesn't work when you blatantly spell it out to the other

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,760
person. Like, listen, I'm just going to lay all my cards on the table. I like you. I think you're

75
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,320
really handsome. I've got a boyfriend. I don't know. Is it, is it not? We'll find out.

76
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,680
We'll find out on this climactic season finale of The Shitty Office.

77
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,760
The problem, the problem with your situation is you're trying to push the story forward too fast.

78
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,800
She's wanting that like season six Jim and Pam. Oh, right. And you're still in that season one

79
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,560
Jim and Pam where you may not even yet realize that she's the girl for you. Right. Right. Whatever

80
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,640
you do, don't get fast forwarded. Don't get the season eight Jim and Pam where it's like,

81
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,400
is there a new love interest? Of course there's not. Of course there's not. I'm a fucking adult

82
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,680
the office. Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Do you think you could just really lay it out for

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,920
it? Like, listen, I appreciate you think I'm handsome, but let me tell you this ain't never

84
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,360
gonna happen. It's never gonna happen between you and me. Can you sing a few verses of never

85
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,080
gonna get it except I guess change the words to never gonna happen as just suggested.

86
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:44,000
Never gonna happen. I need you guys on harmony. Never gonna happen. I can edit it. I can edit

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,400
it in. You know what I always hated about that song? Sorry to completely change. Didn't you guys

88
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,720
hate it when like they edit the song to make it sound like they were cutting back to the radio

89
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,880
and then they would bring it back for like another like another stanza? You remember that?

90
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,800
Yeah, I got excited because like I always feel whatever an invoke song ends, I always get a

91
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,480
mild depression when I think, oh God, I can't believe it's over already. I know. And then wait,

92
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
it's not. I know. It really ruins your expectations for all other radio music though, right?

93
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,840
Right. Just wait, it's coming back. It's gonna come back on. Hotel California. Hotel California

94
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,800
goes off and you're like, wait, it's coming back. I know it. Encore. Ah, fuck. Here comes the drop.

95
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,000
The Hotel California drop. I can honestly say that no one has ever listened to Hotel California and

96
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,240
wished it would come back on. Oh man, I wish there was more of that Eagles song. I mean,

97
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,160
because it's good news for whoever feels that way. You could just switch to a different channel. And

98
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,840
hey, it's on there too. Yeah, it's probably on somewhere else. You know, normally I push an

99
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:53,040
honest discussion on this sort of thing, but I think you have to be respectful of the fact that

100
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,920
if this woman is into you, then it may be hard for her to just do the friend thing. I mean,

101
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,400
that may not be easy for her. Yeah, it's fine. We don't usually get the question from this side.

102
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,440
You know, we get a lot of that, like the person telling the question asker that they are not

103
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,560
interested and just want to be friends. I think that when that happens, like you got to respect

104
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:25,040
it and to say, hey, drop it and just be cool again. That's kind of being a little bit inconsiderate of

105
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
her feelings. You know, she's trying to do the right thing and say, I've got a boyfriend. I'm

106
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,920
attracted to you. This isn't right. We shouldn't hang out anymore. And for you to try to push it,

107
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,040
I think there's a little callous. So maybe just give it some time. And as with most things,

108
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,520
eventually it'll get back to a place where you guys can probably hang out. The good news about

109
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,160
the human heart is that if she tries to deny herself, you, you're going to become more

110
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,360
attractive than you could have ever possibly been before. You'll be a tantalizing, forbidden fruit

111
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,760
hanging from the branch of the HR department. And she has, and you know that that is a feeling

112
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,960
everyone has always wanted to have. Yeah. Give this, give this thing six more months of you

113
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,880
ice it, putting it directly on ice. And then after those six months coming in your bicycle shorts,

114
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,240
she will literally explode. She will literally, she will literally disintegrate at the subatomic

115
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,760
level. Yeah. And if all else fails, you could maybe go with like a really overly sculpted

116
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,000
facial hair and just really turn her right off the whole side. Oh yeah. Like the guy from

117
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,880
hunger games. That would be great. Just stop bathing. Just really, why don't you just garbage

118
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,320
yourself up? Like real good. Next time she's like, listen, you're too attractive. Next time

119
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,080
she says you're too attractive and she can't, she just can't help herself. Have her put her hand

120
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,800
on a chair and then you sit on the chair and you fart on the top of her hand. And then you

121
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:04,560
put on a trilby. Then you're done. You are out. This is my fart cap. This is your fart

122
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:14,480
hat. Do you enjoy my trilby? My overly sculpted facial hair? We are in love. No? Bye. And then

123
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,480
you're fine. You can be friends again. I guess that will work. That would work. You'd have a

124
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:28,720
crazy story to tell all your other friends. Did you bring in a yahoo answer questions? I brought

125
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,920
a small satchel. Open up that drawstring. Let me pull open this drawstring and reach deep down.

126
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,320
This one is actually surprisingly pretty germane. It was sent in by Ira Ray. Are you Ira Ray? Who

127
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,200
wants to know? I like sometimes you give us both parts. Sometimes you just give us who wants to

128
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,320
know. If I thought you guys would give me who wants to know, I would stop delivering it. But

129
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,440
I know it'll never happen. Maybe maybe it's Christmas. I would also like to point out from

130
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,160
our emails this week how many people are utterly confused when Justin does that. Some people don't

131
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,400
get it. Some people love it. My friend Anna here here in Austin listens. It's her favorite thing

132
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,880
in the show, which makes me question everything about her. And our show. It's asked by yahoo

133
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:25,520
answers user Ahmed who asks what to get for ex-co-workers for Valentine's Day. I left the

134
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,200
company a month ago and want to surprise them by sending them something. What is a good surprise

135
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,520
gift for three female friends I used to work with? They are between 25 and 35. Please nothing

136
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,680
too suggestive. If they're your former co-workers and you get them a Valentine's Day present,

137
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,720
trust me, it will be a surprise gift. Yeah. And it will be suggestive too. Unless it's like

138
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:53,200
erasers like these. Why did we get shit from you? Some silly bands. Why did Tony send us some shit?

139
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,880
Like I don't even remember that the shape of that dude's face because I don't. I hardly knew it when

140
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,320
we worked together and that was nigh upon a month ago. I don't care if you send them a shitty cut

141
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,200
out Valentine that says like you complete bees and then there's a picture of bees. Yeah. Uh,

142
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,360
they still are going to think that you're upset. I don't care if you send them a Ziploc bag full

143
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,560
of bees. I don't care. You come into the office covering your bees. And then on the bag you've

144
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,360
scrawled out let's be buzz like buds so that people get. You really missed it because you

145
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,960
could have had bee in there and it would have been let's be but you blew it. Let's be buzz.

146
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,240
Be mine. And then like your platonic intention couldn't be any more clear or thorough and they

147
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,600
would still think you're trying to fuck. Yeah. I think the idea. Will you be my honey? Ah damn it.

148
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,640
That was nice. Really good. I think the idea. Be mine. Okay stop. You're drunk on power. I want to

149
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,120
dip my proboscis deep in your stamen and suck up the sweet humors of your your sweet leaves.

150
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,160
As friends. As buds. As buzz though. I think that getting Valentine's Day presents for anyone that

151
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,240
is not your significant other is just stupid. Right. I think back to when I was in elementary

152
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:23,680
school and how you get valentines for everybody in your class. Like teacher, bro friends, like

153
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,800
ladies that you are interested in but are clearly so so so far outside of your of your price range

154
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,600
because they already had their braces and you are still coming out. Such a minefield. You have to

155
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,240
consider everyone has a different message on it and they're in varying states of plutonicness.

156
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Right. So you have to weigh like is who is going to get this card and then you have like and then

157
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
and then you have like and then so so once you get that sorted out who's gonna get the appropriate

158
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,520
message. You fuck up. Then you have like 20 cards on your desk of like signals. Right. Just sort

159
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,880
through. You switch. You have mild ass burgers. You switch one envelope. You switch one envelope

160
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:13,440
of your Spider-Man themed valentines and give like weirdo Barry in the corner the one that

161
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,280
has Mary Jane on it saying like looking good tiger. You're done. You're done. Sorry. Change goals.

162
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,920
You are done. Become a Catholic. Go to the Catholic school. You're done. Change your name.

163
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,160
Fugue state. Pack them up. Move them away. You are donezo. Frozen in carbonite. Wait for a hundred

164
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,040
years. Thaw you out and then and only then can you start to rebuild your life. Hopefully. Until

165
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,000
until the creepy kid's grandson remembers you as that guy. The legacy of your ultimate shame will

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,160
will follow you through generations. Legend tells of a young man he handed out the wrong valentine

167
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:59,040
and then disappeared into the mist. I don't I do not envy this dude or anybody who feels

168
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
like they have to buy a valentine's day present for anybody other than like I only buy a valentine's

169
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,520
day gift for one person my fiance my finance and like that is already like puts a crippling amount

170
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,560
of pressure on me if I had to double that or apparently is this person thinks quadruple that

171
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:27,360
like I was gonna say the issue here is that this gentleman is not being honest with himself

172
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,920
because I'd be willing to bet if this dude's wanting to buy presents for these three ladies

173
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,040
he is in love with at least one of them. I don't know. Yeah right he's trying to lay down smokescreen

174
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,360
but he probably doesn't even realize it himself. All right let me free everybody up from uh some

175
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
some of the pressure here. You know what Sidney and I get each other from time to time every year?

176
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,120
What? What's that? Nothing. You know why? It's not because we don't love each other it's because I've

177
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,840
already given herself I've already given to Sidney my time and my consideration. Yeah. I've given her

178
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,720
my life and your body as the greatest gift of all. Well my body my best years. You've given her your

179
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,480
physical love? I gave her my my physical sexual peak uh to our marriage and honestly I I we make

180
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,840
each other feel like we love each other every day. Yeah. I don't wait for a dumb ass like thing. I

181
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,120
buy Teresa flowers like randomly throughout the course of the year I don't need I don't need like

182
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,640
a day to be like hey dummy that's great sweet today. Hey you know what guys I'm actually thinking

183
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,400
about uh getting up in the attic and getting the Christmas tree out again. What the fuck are you

184
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,320
talking about? Love should be a once a once a year thing. Why why can't we give presents and have love

185
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,400
for each other every day? Why do we have to wait for Christmas? It's the middle of September so

186
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,840
where are the Easter eggs? Good luck. Griffin are you suggesting that we should only be allowed to

187
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:55,280
love each other? You should withhold your affection until one day. Some kind of horrible 1984-esque

188
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,800
world in which somebody was holding hands and so they had to be re-educated. Are you saying Justin

189
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,360
that we should be able to eat turkey and stuffing whenever the fuck we want? No we do it on

190
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,240
Thanksgiving because that's when you do that thing because it's when the Indians and Pilgrims got

191
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:19,280
together and sorted it out. The I think we stopped celebrating it on the day when we saw a uh a little

192
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:28,080
person stripper at uh Southern Exposure and we kind of knew after that like well we were not

193
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,640
gonna top this. She actually had one move where she painted her boobs and then pressed her boobs

194
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,960
on a shirt and then sold the shirt. I need to know. I'm hoping for gas money home that's the only thing.

195
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,320
I need to delve into this. Did you go to Southern Exposure knowing that there was going to be a

196
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,680
a little person stripper there or was it a pleasant surprise? It was a pleasant surprise

197
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,960
Trav. We just happened to go on Valentine's Day because what else are you gonna do? I'm sure it

198
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,560
was full of other loving couples. Celebrate your love and watch Love Actually and eat chocolate

199
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,760
and look at the flowers. Love Actually is a Christmas movie? Oh it's a two times a year movie Justin.

200
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,240
Unlike Love which is apparently 365 days a year. I know I'm setting the bar so high. Do you think

201
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,720
if they allowed prisoners to have conjugal visits every day that jail jail would just be like I'm

202
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,080
going to jail cool because I can fuck every day if I want. It's you know what I've just been making

203
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,280
it once a day and once a year that makes it special. Yeah they should make everybody only

204
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:38,240
have conjugal visits on February 14th once annually because can you imagine the smell?

205
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:47,440
You could hear you could hear the love sounds down the street. Oh my god sounds like a mop

206
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,480
factory in there. Your your windows would shake like someone next door was listening to mystical

207
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:01,680
it would just be just a pounding resounding bass of incarcerated meat slapping against freedom.

208
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:10,080
Oh I I've had a brainstorm. Hit me. What if so Valentine's Day February 14th is you know the

209
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:18,640
day of love six months later the day of hate. Why? Wait a minute what? Right no that's just the day

210
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,720
of just like going up to the person you dislike at work and be like hey I hate you. Let's air in

211
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,560
his mouth you stink. I think you're a big old stinky Pete and I don't like you anymore. So

212
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,960
are you saying on August 18th every year we should just be like hey buddy fuck you. Yeah but then

213
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
that's gonna get confusing because then you have those three people that you used to work with a

214
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,600
month ago that you fucking hate and you don't know how to like send them dookie I guess. I don't know

215
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,880
what the I don't know what the protocol is for this holiday that you've just invented. What's

216
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,480
the proper amount of dookie to send to someone you don't work with anymore? How many can cups

217
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,200
are out? How do you translate uh liquid cups of dookie to solid dookie? What's the measurement

218
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,080
conversion? Could we go a single week without talking about converting solid dookie to liquid

219
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:14,160
dookie? Here's another question. A few months ago I rented out my second bedroom to a friend of mine.

220
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,960
He has since moved out but has left some things behind. He asked if I was interested in a few

221
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,560
items. I acquiesced because hey new couch. The issue stems from the rest of what he left behind.

222
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,840
Several boxes, DVD and the like, musical instruments, clothes, and shoes. I've texted him several times

223
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,360
in the past three months to pick up what he wants as I have other designs on uses for that bedroom.

224
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,840
And in parentheses here it says not sex dungeon which is the surest way of convincing me that you

225
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,200
are in fact making a sex dungeon. I would feel shitty giving him an ultimatum and I don't want

226
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,360
to do something to damage our friendship such as simply selling or pitching all of it. But I also

227
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,600
don't want to feel as though my hospitality has been taken advantage of. That's from Tumultuous

228
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:05,760
in Toronto. Um your hospitality is being taken advantage of. That's precisely what's happening.

229
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,440
You have nailed it. Yeah you you really read this you read this room. I don't understand like what

230
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,560
he's left all this shit in your house is yours now. Is that the is that fucking sell it? Just

231
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,440
what are you talking about? Hey my friend gave me a bunch of shit and I don't know what to do

232
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,920
with it. Just like sell it or use it. There's or throw it away. I feel like if it is a concern

233
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,880
it is completely is not an ultimatum and not well I mean it is but it's not a horrible thing to do

234
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,960
to call him and say hey man I really need this room if you don't want this stuff I'm going to

235
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,440
get rid of it. I'm sorry this is crazy if you move you take your shit with you if you leave it behind

236
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,920
then it's he didn't pay for storage services with his shitty Davenport okay if you left it behind

237
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,080
it's it's he has no place. Have you guys met my friend shitty Davenport? Did you hear? Are you guys

238
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,200
going to the gas light tonight? I hear shitty Davenport. Um you know I had a roommate that

239
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,640
she decided that to move out and like her sister and her were getting an apartment and she ended up

240
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:18,960
just leaving a bunch of shit behind and so I threw it away. It's that easy. It's it's a super easy

241
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:27,520
thing to do. Throw it away. Step two relax. It drives me it drives me up a goddamn like I've

242
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,800
worked so hard to accrue the things that I've accrued I would never just leave it in somebody's

243
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,200
house and then write a box of DVDs that's what the hell that represents thousands of dollars in

244
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,840
value that you've accrued to like divest unless you're going full-blown divestation of your shit

245
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,600
so that you can you know study yoga in on some mountain in a country leaving it all behind man

246
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,640
yeah like my stuff I'm a yogi now doesn't make sense to me I like musical instruments what the

247
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,480
hell pretty much all my actions anymore like are based around getting physical objects out of my

248
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,920
home like I just don't want things here that don't make me happy and I worked or I used to be really

249
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,320
bad about accumulation like I I used to when I was in high school I would call like when when the

250
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,320
internet was first uh kicking off there used to be a lot of places where you could give them like

251
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,120
your mailing address information stuff like that and they would send you like free shit so you get

252
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,120
like a free I don't know fanny pack or stickers or sample of detergent or whatever and I would

253
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,240
like sign up for all that shit and now I'm doing basically the opposite where I I will mail my

254
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,680
things to you if you want them like I hope for free I just do you want my things sure we all do

255
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,360
the worst thing you could do to me is leave a box in my home that's like you these aren't yours

256
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,200
and you can't throw them away so just handle this what is your friend saying when you call him

257
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,600
him like oh yeah all right talk to you later oh I have stuff there cool

258
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,080
I don't like you need to come get your box oh you don't go call your friend say come get your shit

259
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,760
or I'm throwing it away love you happy valentine's day click life isn't as hard as you make it

260
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,720
you just call him and say you're just no don't call him wait till trash day after the trash

261
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,760
man leave you put all of it in a trash bag and put it outside and you call him and go

262
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,040
like I'm 24 and then he just and then he has to come get it and it's the right sequence of

263
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,440
clock is very exciting for him it's thrilling for you because it's fucking uh Ramones poster

264
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,640
isn't in your den anymore right could you I have a good idea is if you why don't you have a yard sale

265
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,920
or like a Jeff sale because you're selling all of Jeff's things and then you take the proceeds from

266
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,680
the Jeff sale and you take him out to a nice dinner and then afterwards you'd be like I got

267
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,200
the check and he's like that's nice of you it's actually it's actually nice of you let me put it

268
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,240
put it this way I I'm tipping him your freaks and geeks DVD set so pick up that knife and fork and

269
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,400
carve off a piece of that tuba that you used to have and dip it dip it in that copy of freaks and

270
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,720
geeks and eat it you're gonna love it this can you use the musical instrument he left to write

271
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,160

272
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,440
sold your tuba to buy this tuba so I could write you this song this smaller shittier tuba

273

294
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,880
about extremistraints.com by the way if you go to extremistraints.com it's a a massive adult

295
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,960
toy store super site if you use a coupon code MIDDLELIST you can save 20 percent um but I I

296
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,720
never I I I never thought it would come to this but I actually I have beef with uh extremistraints.com

297
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,200
uh our sort of uh our our relationship is is a partnership it's built on the fact that

298
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,840
we offer very different services but really not that not that different though because I like

299
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,440
that all of our advice is aimed at helping you get fucked like ultimately everything we tell

300
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,640
you is aiming towards that end goal that's the where yeah that's the end goal here's the here's

301
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,320
the problem though I'm looking uh at their uh they're starting to infringe a little bit I'm

302
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,480
looking at their selection of gags oh no now this is too bad this is unfortunate first off

303
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,840
they have ball gags yeah okay that's kind of our thing but go on and then they have very clearly

304
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,800
uh infringing penis gags and that's like a half of our basically yeah that's like 98 percent of our

305
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:32,720
of our of our gags and then perhaps most upsettingly they have a category called

306
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:40,880
pony bit gags and I'm sorry guys that's like practically TM all right that's kind of our thing

307
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,160
is pony gags like the pony bits and horse bits like that's kind of our shtick like what what

308
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm glad they don't have ghost gags I know because then it would be the then I think we would we

309
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,960
would have to get into some lawsuit territory um if I were to add a great cross-branding idea

310
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:08,960
yeah okay I'm gonna say three words Bob Ball gags oh no I don't think so I don't want this I don't

311
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,440
think uh my brother my brother and me officially announced that Bob Ball would want to put his name

312
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,440
or branding on something like that I'm just saying um we're gonna be rich if I'm gonna call beef out

313
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,160
on Extreme Restraints my only beef with them is that now in Google Chrome whenever I'm in the

314
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,800
search or address bar and I press the letter e Extreme Restraints is what autofills that is how

315
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,640
frequently I have visited this website that is convenience Griffin that is that you are right

316
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,520
about that so head to ExtremeRestraints.com it's with an a uh not an x as you might actually

317
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,200
there's actually a couple e's in there yeah there's a few e's in there it's a popular letter uh and

318
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,120
head there and use the coupon code MIDDLIST to save 20 uh oh good news guys if you forget the

319
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,480
it's still ExtremeRestraints.com so you are fine uh Griffin how about another yahoo sure this one

320
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,000
was sent in by Earl Parsons thanks Earl it's by yahoo answers user Harry who asks is it possible

321
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:21,920
to fall in love on yahoo answers bye everyone are there answers um there are there are um a lot of

322
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,240
people saying some pretty disparaging things to Harry I'll be honest with you not a good day for

323
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,480
Harry not a good environment I think Harry by asking this question was sort of casting a net

324
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:46,480
of sorts a sexual net available on Extreme Restraints um and I think that he did not get

325
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,080
the responses that he was looking for yeah but at the same time it can't happen that's how

326
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,920
I I'm pretty sure that's how Manteo found his suitor yeah they seem to be very happy and also

327
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:07,920
it's worth noting I have not read anything for the past three weeks so the love story of the

328
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,680
sports love story of the decade the sports love story yeah right it's like Brian's song but with

329
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:23,760
a real woman um one in six marriages guys one in six yeah Justin that's how you met online that's

330
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,520
how you met Sydney right is that you asked um why the chess pieces in chess were called what they

331
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,080
were called and she made it like shut the fuck up asshole yeah because she's on yahoo troll troll

334
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:01,440
real love um and then you voted that as top answer and it was top answer that was my way of saying

335
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,440
hello and that was like that was like your guys as you wish that was the moment um it's probably

336
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,400
happened right yeah I mean I would just everything is happening it seemed I would assume that this is

337
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,680
not an exception it seems like an awfully circuitous like why like a dating site alone is

338
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,480
like hard enough to find somebody who isn't awful isn't the worst and those have all these like

339
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,560
heuristics built into them to help you find what you're looking for yahoo answers is like a fucking

340
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,080
masquerade ball like there's no way of knowing what's going on it's a lot more like chaos theory

341
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,120

of course you can't finally fall in love on the audience you can fall in hate though

360
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,880
not believe me when I first told her I couldn't remember the last time I cried but now that we've

361
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,200
been going out for almost two years she's insisting she needs to see me shed some tears it's not like

362
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,840
I don't feel the same emotions as her it's just that nothing has brought me over the edge in at

363
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,680
least 10 years and even though she says she wants to see me cry I feel like subconsciously it could

364
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,080
turn her off do I suck it up and cry for her or do I keep my dry street going that's from

365
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,200
Krusty Aiden Colorado whatever you do if you haven't cried in 10 years make sure that when

366
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,560
you do it no one is standing directly in front of you oh man like the fire hose in UHF well not only

367
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:34,400
that but you are gonna be so bad at it oh my god yeah your face is gonna look like John Mayer during

368
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:43,920
a solo I here's the thing I got a solution for you just watch Iron Giant yeah right that's what I

369
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:51,520
was gonna say yeah just watch Iron Giant and you'll cry it'll be it'll be a masculine a masculine

370
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,720
uh tear fest I promise so there's a different and put it on lube there is a difference between

371
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:04,080
like a masculine like a gentleman's cry you know what I mean uh-huh it's it's deep the base the base

372
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:13,600

373
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,240
oh no you are going here's the thing I have to assume if you haven't cried in 10 years you've

374
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,320
been burying some things like once you turn on those tears out there you may just be like

375
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,840
digging back and back and back like deeper and deeper like I gotta see you my geometry exam

376
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,200
you know what I you hear about Stephen yeah he's never not crying now you know my jam cries all

377
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,160
the time my jam is like when I have to cry at something like the last episode of Downton Abbey

378
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,920
um I don't make any noise or like move my face at all I just let the tears just sort of like fall

379
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,800
down my cascading completely still stoic Native American looking out at a bunch of trash face

380
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,120
like yeah so proud and I'm gonna be honest with you guys this may surprise no one I cry at like

381
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,000
everything yeah dude yeah I'm a big old I was actually I was literally talking about this last

382
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,560
night because it like uh some sort of Disney commercial with Wally was in it and we were all

383
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,400
talking about how we all cried when we watched Wally I remember when I watched Wally with you

384
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,560
you cried for like 30 uninterrupted minutes like once you once sad shit in that movie started

385
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,800
happening you didn't stop crying until the the fucking credits were rolling my emotions are like

386
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,360
like right below my eyeballs and so at any given point one extra drop of emotion and I'm over it

387
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm trying this actually has to schedule time at four o'clock on Sundays to pay off the crying that

388
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,360
he earned while watching the first 15 minutes of love I remember I'm still crying while at the

389
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,920
beginning I remember when I was uh last in town and I uh we were at lunch and I was like I'll

390
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:57,200
pick up the check and you're like don't you do this to me right now oh no oh no oh no did you

391
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:04,000
see that guy a new sign at Giovanni's no come on my childhood said I wouldn't do this I told myself

392
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,160
I'd be strong strong I'm a big strong man I the worst is like if I'm up at an unreasonable hour

393
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,600
when I used to work at Best Buy and I had to be in at like five o'clock in the morning there's

394
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,640
something about like five o'clock in the morning by yourself and like a big empty half-dark Best Buy

395
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,720
that I I would just sit there and like start singing a little song to myself and weeping

396
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:36,240
just while I'm like doing all the stockpounds oh no oh here we go um yeah I there's something

397
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,680
crying is like to me finishing a cry is like waking up from a good nap and it's like okay

398
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,840
time to start my day in earnest you know what I mean it's like well the crying is over now it's

399
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,800
time for happy times I I'm actually kind of jealous of you Travis that you get that you get

400
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,600
to clean out your man yeah I fucking love crying yeah the best time to do is in the shower because

401
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,560
you're already wet and that way it just mingles no because if you cry when you're like fully

402
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,280
dressed you're gonna get all of the tears and snot all over your clothes how hard are you crying

403
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:16,240
so that so you're uh I actually like uh much like Daryl Hannah and Blade Runner or Ernest

404
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,120
in uh Ernest Goes to Jail I like to cry in the rain oh you mean Ernest Goes to Camp when he's

405
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,600
saying sure I'm glad it's raining nobody sees your teardrops when it rains holy shit check

406
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,800
you walked right into it I am not ashamed of my love for the Ernest movies um I guess I was

407
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,480
thinking Ernest Goes to Jail because that's the one where he has the doppelganger right

408
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,600
and but he's also very sad because he's incarcerated and also because his life is as

409
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,600
a janitor at a bank right and he gets electrocuted like 16 times yeah a lot all yeah it gives him

410
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:56,320
superpowers hey everybody what's that movie like I'm Ernest gets superpowers I bet after Ernest

411
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,600
Goes to Jail and Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest gets scared stupid he was really really hesitant

412
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,920
you have to feel bad for Slam Dunk Ernest because that is halfway across the video store

413
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,720
why is it called Ernest Goes to the Hoop Ernest takes it to the to the point zone

414
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,360
you got all those Ernest movies hanging out next to each other and then like way off someone's

415
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,880
looking through the essence and they're like what is this Ernest and then there's like

416
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,440
extreme with an x Ernest stunts and it's like I don't even know where that is they're looking

417
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,560
for like super Dave Osborne movies that those Ernest pops up hey this is the craziest video

418
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,400
store I've ever been to it's the best video store you know I loved I loved Ernest Scared Stupid and

419
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,040
Ernest Goes to Jail and Ernest Goes to Camp but this importance of being Ernest just was not as

420
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:56,000
funny I think the craziest thing about this video store is that it's extant um I like to because I

421
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,480
can cry completely still faced I can I could be having a car I could I could be crying right now

422
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,240
and talking to you the way that I'm talking to you with you would have no clue so my jam is I just do

423
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,480
it in public and see if I can get away with it like a dangerous like a dangerous thing like a

424
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,280
little dangerous I'll do it at best I'll do it at Best Buy but like in the middle of the day in the

425
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,440
crowded store would you describe this as a crying game not the crying game no no no it's awkward

426
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,360
there's more than the one have you ever yawned so hard that like you cried not like violently

427
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,920
crap but like some tears come out what is wrong with you that doesn't happen to you just like

428
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,760
you yawn really hard and like your eyes just like kind of water a little bit you just go with it no

429
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,040
no you already got this thing started already primed the engine might as well no I remember

430
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,840
when when I when we were young and we were at church and I would yawn really hard because it's

431
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,560
church um I always got really worried that people would look over and think that I was crying because

432
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,440
I was just like super moved by like the collection song yeah but really it's that I yawn and I was

433
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,200
always tempted to look and go no no I was yawning it's not real tears I'm not moved or anything

434
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,640
not a bit I feel nothing there's nothing behind these eyes

435
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,960
now I feel like I cry too much now you guys have made me self-conscious I'm never gonna cry again

436
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:23,040
I feel like if you don't like that if you think about going the rest of your life without crying

437
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,280
again that would actually be sad enough to make you cry for at least 45 minutes that's probably

438
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,880
true um I've got it it's actually gotten to a point now where if I see a especially poignant

439
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,920
commercial I will start crying oh but there's some commercials out there that are real doozers

440
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:46,880
uh-huh the the fucking one with the guy gets a dog and is in in a car and he drives to go

441
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,480
camping griffin griffin don't and then they get out I said I wouldn't do this they're playing

442
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,680
and then they keep doing they keep repeating oh no the dog's getting older and then at the end

443
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,560
he just gets out of tombstone from his car and kills the dog with it no the dog is dead why would

444
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,240
he get what then he smashes the dog with the tombstone my uh Sydney says that her dad used to

445
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,160
always cry at the uh at the commercial it was a mcdonald's commercial where a dad drives his

446
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,360
daughter to mcdonald's and she's meeting her friends there and he she asked him to wait in

447
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,720
the car while she goes in and hangs out with her friends and she says that was making her cry and

448
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,720
all I can think about is that's the craziest hang ever like what is this hang wait in the car I'm

449
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:40,320
too embarrassed to hang out with you with my friends inside of mcdonald's me my buds are gonna

450
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:46,960
go inside and get a cbo and I'd like you to hang here if that's cool don't ruin this for me old

451
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,680
man this is my mcdonald's time yeah this only happens once maybe twice a week I always cried

452
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,000
those e-trade commercials with the talking baby because like I think about like when I have a baby

453
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,200
if it comes out and looks really cute but sounds like an old ass dude I would be like mega bummed

454
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:12,240
out yeah wicked wicked bummed um can we can we address a timely yahoo answer okay this one was

455
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,400
sent in by steve lewis thank you steve it's by yahoo answers user billy jack h who asks

456
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,840
how can I rely on punxsutawney phil when everything around him overcast his shadow

457
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,080
do I get my own groundhog with groundhog day rapidly approaching I have some aggravation

458
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,560
towards the way punxsutawney phil comes out of its burrow but it is impossible to see a shadow

459
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,560
because there are so many people equipment and booths around him these people who run the event

460
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,160
then say he didn't see his shadow and there will be an early spring well I'm tired of relying of

461
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,440
this commercial groundhog informing me how much winter is left I'd like to get my own groundhog

462
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,840
and intend to let him to come out in a very clear non-crowded area that way I will at least know the

463
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,120
truth if we'll have six more weeks of winter or not should I get my own groundhog should I do

464
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:10,480
that this is the best thing I've ever heard I've never heard seen observed thought about a groundhog

465
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,600
in literally any other context yeah right I don't know where you would obtain one I don't know where

466
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,920
they're what they're native to no but this I'm also gonna be honest and it occurs to me that

467
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,080
it seems to me like taking it out of the context of punxsutawney phil it doesn't count anymore

468
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,920
like or else everybody would just have groundhogs he has a fucking excellent point because there

469
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,760
are there's a lot of hardware you know there are the news newscasters there bring a lot of

470
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,880
hardware to the scene how about the fucking lights the camera lights like how how's this

471
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,080
yeah god forbid they might spoil the entirely scientific process no but I'm saying but they

472
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:52,400
have built these fucking rules around this system and then they're tampering with the with the rules

473
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,640
the groundhog comes out and sees like 800 people all standing around screaming at him of course

474
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,360
he's fucking scared he's just he's a rodent he's a small creature I would be scared but the thing

475
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:10,800
we now go to punxsutawney where phil is coming out of his hole thank you oh hold on punxsutawney

476
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,960
is addressing the crowd hello everyone can you give me some fucking room could you all spread out

477
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,880
a little bit I'm having a hard time before me give phil some space to do his thing please

478
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,360
great I'm trying to get down and uh it's not gonna happen with all these uh newscasters around

479
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,000
what if they opened up the door what if they opened up the little groundhog door and he was

480
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,440
jerking off okay this is what you want to see he's like are you this is what you came here to see

481
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:46,560
are you guys fucking kidding me is it February fucking second already are you shitting me I don't

482
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,440
give a shit that it's a whole day based around me you knock you knock first because sometimes

483
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,480
a groundhog is jerking off as they all want to do do you see these little nubby hands they feel

484
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:02,000
great here's the problem with with complaining about the lights and the cameras and everything

485
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,760
if you have lights and cameras and and everything it's a celebration if you're a guy in this

486
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,280
backyard pulling a rodent out of a hole and staring at it you have to register on a list

487
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,640
yeah a government list but but at the same time what do you do when you get that minority report

488
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,840
from your from your indie underground groundhog that's like nah dog it is time for six more weeks

489
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:36,080
of winter and but the mainstream groundhog says that it's springtime what do you do who do you

490
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:43,200
send a letter to in that circumstance yeah who do you i have to here's what's going to really

491
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,240
fuck you up that we got three more weeks of winter and then nothing right tell the authorities

492
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,080
what we need we need an impartial elected frankly elected senate or or house of representatives

493
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:05,200
approved position for nine groundhogs that will come out and you know create a majority opinion

494
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,040
on what the weather is going to be because this person is a great president i don't want to alarm

495
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:17,680
you yeah but my groundhogs a statue on steve's listen according to miami marcus

496
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,600
i think they would all have to be gathered in one region because i feel like miami marcus

497
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,320
would pretty much see his shadow all day pretty much all time i think that was in will smith's

498
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,880
miami's he talked about how your shadow's always there me and marcus popping it off

499
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,040
looking down getting spooked winter is coming let's go get some carrots

500
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,200
because groundhogs love carrots thank you thank you my god saw his shadow and the shadow of death

501
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,880
i want to congratulate us on doing this for five minutes and not mentioning the movie

502
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,280
groundhog day i think we did it accomplishment and achievement and now we can all breathe a

503
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,560
little easier i watched it yesterday i did too what a fucking i watched it a thousand times

504
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:11,760
yesterday okay uh we were watching it yesterday and uh my we were watching the film about halfway

505
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,080
through sydney leans over to me and says well she doesn't lean over to me we're on a couch

506
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:24,960
so uh that's how i've instructed her to behave she she looks and she says you know the tragedy

507
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:32,640
of this movie is that no one could ever love andy mcdowell she said given a thousand years

508
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,720
you could not love andy mcdowell but i said that is 100 true and then i was watching the movie and

509
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,320
something occurred to me that had never occurred what the movie is about i read an interview with

510
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:49,200
harold ramis where he said that the movie had become very popular with buddhists

511
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,640
and when you watch the movie you realize that like he doesn't it's not about getting the girl

512
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:05,040
or even trying to live a good life um phil doesn't get out of the loop until he has awareness

513
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,840
until he's completely aware and satisfied in his own situation that's when he breaks it it wasn't

514
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,480
about oh i think you think back on that movie you think it's about him learning to like love

515
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,120
or be a good person or what or play piano it's none of those things yeah it's a little bit

516
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:27,600
about 100 immediate awareness that's that's that's deep that's deep stuff when i watch that movie i

517
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,560
also like to pretend that chris elliot's character is also looping through time and just trying to

518
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,800
like get it together and maybe get some maybe get some trim and he just like but in the final day

519
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,240
that phil gets it together and does get him some trim chris elliot comes to grips with the fact

520
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,400
that no he is he is virtually unfuckable and once he has that realization he is also freed from the

521
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,960
loop i would also like to point out that something that's not addressed in that movie that always

522
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,280
kind of freaks me out is that once he breaks the loop and wakes up the next day one no one will

523
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:09,040
ever believe him yeah two does he instantly age all the time that he spent i don't think so i he

524
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,480
just withers away to dust before annie mcdowell's horrified eyes did annie mcdowell complete her

525
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,880
loop of trying to get through a sentence sounding like a real person saying things in the world

526
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:27,440
she doesn't do that at all she never does that where is your accent from like do you think it

527
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:34,080
must also be really disconcerting to be phil on february 3rd because you know he's like crossing

528
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,920
the street without looking you're like no no it's fine it's fine there's no cars trust me ah shit

529
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,880
a guy's gonna break a plate in hayden hey break that plate i need this kid climb that tree fall

530
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,760
out he's gonna spiral into madness like it's never addressed but he he's gonna lose his mind

531
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,840
he's just waiting underneath a tree with his arms open just waiting hey does anyone kid want to climb

532
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,480
this tree any kids no i learned how to be a piano virtuoso in one day

533
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,880
i don't think i don't think he loses this watch i can rob a bank and there's no consequences

534
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:22,240
oh you're in prison prison shot shot crossfire dead chris elliot looks unknowingly we've all
