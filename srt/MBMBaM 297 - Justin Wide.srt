1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,640
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,480
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Borat, not April Fools.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,720
It is. Well, this is weird, because we're recording on April Fools,

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,880
so all we want to talk about is April Fools. I don't know when you fools will be listening

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,560
to this, but probably still in April. So every day in April is April for you fools.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
Please, no. Please, God, no. Please, God, please, please, no.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,720
We can't do goofs and jokes all month long.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
Well, yeah, if the jokes that we're doing is on the level as, like,

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,480
my wife, Borat, April Fools. That's kind of been my style today.

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,680
It's been very innocuous. Like, nobody's going to lose their fucking jobs over it.

17
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,840
You know what I mean? Nobody's going to be offended by it.

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,400
People are just going to have, like, a good belly laugh of just, like,

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
that's not my bag, baby. And that's a joke from Austin Powers.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,000
April Fools.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
I want to pitch a new version of April Fools that I told Griffin about beforehand,

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,200
and he was really on board with.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
Yeah, and I actually specifically told you not to float it.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
And I call it gay April Fools. Now, I know it's going to sound like I mean

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
gay April Fools. That is not what I mean. I mean gape Rule Fools.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,440
So, like, you set up your hilarious jape. Oh, I should have said jape Rule Fools.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
And it's too late. You set up your hilarious goo.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,640
No, it's not too late. So, we got to go back.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,520
Maybe, like, you put some Saran wrap over the turdlet, right?

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,760
So that when someone tries to use it, there's just urine everywhere.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,960
And they get really mad.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,800
What if they shit and the shit pools up and gets all over their butt?

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
The shit goes everywhere. And then you kick in the door, like,

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
hello, my name is Borat, not April Fools.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
And they try to get mad, but when they look over,

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
you're just spreading your butthole really, really wide.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
And they're like, oh, I can't be mad.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,880
This is a visceral fucking tableau that you've painted that I've just gotten

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,440
my own fecal matter all over myself because of your jape rolls.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,640
And then I look up and I say, Travis, no. And you've got your little,

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
you got your booty plum right there.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
And you laugh, right? And you laugh.

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
And we all feel better about the day.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,840
And we think about what it really means to be alive for once.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
I think I would definitely have a good laugh at that, not April Fools.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,400
Now, I wasn't sure what Gaper meant, so I took it to Urban Dictionary.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Uh-oh.

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,200
And good news, it means something completely different on the Urban Dictionary.

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,840
A Gaper, now hang with me here, is a skier or snowboarder who's completely clueless.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,960
It's usually distinguished by their bright colored clothes and a Gaper gap,

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,920
which is the gap between goggles and helmet or hat.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,120
Gapers also do the Gaper tuck, which is an attempt at being a ski racer by tucking.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
However, it is done incorrectly with the poles sticking straight up,

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,960
like thunderbolted lightning, very, very frightening.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,640
Yeah, definitely.

56
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
So yeah, that's Gaper.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,960
Now, the snake eats itself here on Urban Dictionary,

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,920
which is the new source as far as I'm concerned.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,160
I'm done with everything else but Urban Dictionary.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,920
I spent five minutes on this site and I already think it's the best thing to happen to me ever.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
A Gaper is a term used, this is the third most popular definition.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,080
It is a term used by D-Bags to degrade new skiers in an effort to boost their own self-esteem.

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,240
Yeah.

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,360
You can usually spot them by staring at others while on a lift chair

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,240
or defining the word Gaper on Urban Dictionary.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,800
So it's like, whoa, Ouroboros.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,080
They should let this functionality be in Wikipedia where you can look at the series of edits

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
and it's like, fuck whoever said Garfield is a tabby.

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Garfield is clearly a sphinx cat.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,960
Um, Justin, that's the first and third.

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,120
Is the second one relating to spread butthole or is it a portmanteau of gay caper,

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,960
which I would also be on board with?

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,960
Um, no.

74
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,440
The second one begins, and this is all I'm going to read, a skier or snowboarder who sucks.

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,920
Okay.

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Well, okay.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,480
Is usually spotted wearing clothing from 1983, but other clothing styles for them do exist.

78
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,880
And then the fourth one is like somebody who spreads their asshole way, way, way open

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,480
so you can use them like a telescope.

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,280
And then the fifth one is like, whoa, number four.

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
Hey, fucking chill.

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,840
We're talking about like cool boarders 1080 over here.

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
Like, can you slow down?

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
And number six is like, I'm with, I know me and number five had our differences earlier

85
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
on in this dictionary entry, but I have to agree.

86
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Number four, you took it to a place that I'm not entirely comfortable with.

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,640
Now I should mention my first definition dates back to January 3rd, 2006.

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
And this was before butt play was even sort of a concept.

89
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
Yeah, before butt play even existed.

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah.

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,240
If you're curious on the sidebar related to this term, there are many, many, many, many,

92
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
many, many other definitions of gape.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Just, just so many.

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,200
Here's one.

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
Gape tape.

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
Not even going there with you.

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
Go there yourself.

98
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,240
I can't.

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Gape tape, the bubblegum that you get six feet of in a sweet little plastic clamshell package.

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,160
I love it.

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
I love how much gape tape I get with a single purchase at the checkout aisle.

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Six feet of gape tape for you, not them.

103
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
This is my brother, my brother, me.

104
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
And it's an advice show for the modern era.

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm really sorry that we didn't go with the vapor fools.

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,760
It's not too late.

107
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,280
We can still talk about vapor fools.

108
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,840
I mean, the sound is going to be, we try not to blow too much into the microphones into

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
the old condensers because it's not a good sound.

110
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
But if we start talking about vaping, I'm going to get that fucking monkey on my back

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:09,920
again.

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,440
And then I'm going to just start blowing cotton directly into the ear lobes.

113
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
Yeah, April Fool's, by the way, this I know this hasn't been very funny yet.

114
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,280
That was the bit.

115
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
This is a prank on you.

116
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,760
And now we're going to start the real intro.

117
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,240
Here we go.

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,560
Hello, everybody, and welcome.

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,520
My brother, my brother, me and advice show for the modern era.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
Welcome to vapor fools.

121
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,160
Is that right?

122
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,280
Is that what you nailed it?

123
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
Listen at one.

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,760
Everybody do one joke about vapor fools.

125
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Travis, I'm going to turn the old camera, the old podcast camera to you first.

126
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,480
Smash cut, zoom in on Travis's face.

127
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,760
He's framed perfectly.

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,680
There's a boy yo yoing sound effect to let you know a joke's coming.

129
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,920
And then I feel like I've stalled long enough and Travis turns to the camera and says,

130
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,520
if you want your best vape tricks, turn the ohms all the way down.

131
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
And that's like so that's the opposite of what is.

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,200
Yeah.

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,560
See, but then it like then, you know, if someone falls for that, they're a real gaper.

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
There's two, there's two types of people in this world.

135
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,320
Yeah.

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,120
Gapers and vapors.

137
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,840
Which one are you?

138
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
Choose your side.

139
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
Test your might.

140
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,920
Gapers and vapors is probably my least favorite Dr. Seuss book.

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,760
That was one of his earlier ones.

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,440
That was by the way, also an April Fool's joke.

143
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
It's absolutely my favorite.

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,040
I learned about like the futility of war from Gapers v. Vapors.

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,640
That was actually a landmark court case.

146
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm failing a class this semester at FSU.

147
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
There is a way to routine.

148
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,320
Wait, did we say that?

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,640
There is a way to routine, wait, do we say our names?

150
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:56,800
Yeah.

151
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm Griffin, he's Justin and Travis.

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Yeah, Travis.

153
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
I'm failing a class this semester at FSU.

155
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,200
There is a way to redeem some points and pass the class.

156
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,800
The professor has this policy that if you turn in a student on social media during class,

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,640
you will receive 25 bonus points, which equals 2.5 quiz grades.

158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,880
The person you turn in loses 10 points.

159
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,760
Oh my God.

160
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,400
Wait, hold on.

161
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
If you turn in a student-

162
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
Someone's on social media, you put them on blast.

163
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,520
They get caught, they lose 10 points, you get 25.

164
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,880
You see someone like sneaking their phone below the desk or table or whatever and you're like-

165
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,960
That's fresh as fuck.

166
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:46,240
That class, no matter what it is, like viral pathology, it's a viral pathology 101

167
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,200
and also fucking Wild West gunslinging for one person who is the fucking law.

168
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
Wait, keep reading through because the mechanics of it is what confuses me.

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
This is all done, I mean, you want me to start again or-

170
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
No, no, no, just the last couple of sentences.

171
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,560
Okay, this is all done anonymously and I'm expecting not to have any serious consequences

172
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
if I go through with it.

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,400
So brothers, should I rat on the student to pass or keep my big mouth shut and retake the class?

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,480
That's from Tainted in Tallahassee.

175
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
So here's what confuses me.

176
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,440
How does it put, like you see someone doing it and then you just go to the teacher afterwards

177
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
and they're like, I saw, you know, I saw Steven on his phone.

178
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
Or are you like snapping a picture of it?

179
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,560
Or like, how do you do it anonymously with any kind of proof that this happened?

180
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,520
Yeah, you snap a-

181
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,320
I mean, you get a screenshot or I mean, if it's Tweet-O, you could give them a timestamp.

182
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
But then I'm saying, Justin, it goes all the way back

183
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
because then the guy behind you sees you on your phone looking at that person,

184
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
like on that person's phone and then-

185
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh, are you saying it's like, it's like, it's like if you open your eyes during the prayer,

186
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,840
the only people that can catch you are people who also open their eyes?

187
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,360
Exactly, exactly.

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,600
So now like, is that person gonna be like, Steve was on and you're like, no, I was watching that.

189
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,640
I was following that person's Twitter activity so that I could tell you about it.

190
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
I wasn't tweeting.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,840
I want to paint you guys a picture of me in this class and I'm failing it.

192
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,480
Probably, this was probably during my doobie year.

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,840
Yeah, everybody, I had a doobie year in college.

194
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,480
I don't like to talk about it, develop some bad habits.

195
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,280
But what if I was wearing my poncho to look like a cool Wild West gunslinger

196
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,880
and also it was my doobie year so I was trying some stuff out.

197
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,160
And what's that on my eye?

198
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,200
Oh, it's Google Glass.

199
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,200
Nobody has to fucking know.

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm watching you snap and I'm tweeting every-

201
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm gonna end this class.

202
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,080
Griffin McElroy, congratulations.

203
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,920
You have defeated my class with 320%.

204
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,680
Holy shit.

205
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
You like, and nobody else passed.

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,840
You were the only person that passed because you ate all the grades.

207
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,480
That's amazing.

208
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
How did you do it?

209
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll never tell.

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,120
And then you tip the brim of your Stetson and your Spurs chain because you walk out of the room.

211
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,880
If I'm wearing Google Glass, it's a fedora because it's attached.

212
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
Wait, it comes as a piece?

213
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Yeah, if you're wearing a Google Glass, it is attached by a fucking wallet chain to a fedora

214
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,640
that you have to wear.

215
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,680
It's what powers it.

216
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,320
Just a shame.

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,760
I mean, that's a great plan until you have 120% and everybody knows exactly how you fucking got it

218
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
and everybody starts calling you Narc Ruffalo behind your back.

219
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh, that's the worst.

220
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,120
And you go to like uncool jail where no one wants to hang out with you or invite you to

221
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,160
any parties ever.

222
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,720
Tough shit.

223
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,880
You don't have to retake the class.

224
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Okay, Narc Harmon.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm just saying I would give up a lot of social standing to not have to redo.

226
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,880
You could just throw a kegger for free and make up for those points.

227
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,440
You know what I mean?

228
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
Okay, so someone comes to you and says,

229
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,240
hey, we're going to a party at Narc Walberg's house.

230
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,960
You want to come?

231
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,120
And they're like, Narc in the funky bunch.

232
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,800
And you think they're going to go?

233
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
You think they're going to show?

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,160
I don't think so.

235
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
They're going to have a bunch of booze there for free.

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
Also, this is college.

237
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,080
I do think they're going to go there.

238
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,880
Do you know what I love most about this whole scenario is this teacher has invented a situation

239
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
where I can take his class.

240
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,920
I would audit this class.

241
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
Just to like narc people?

242
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
You're saying narc and you're painting a negative picture.

243
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,240
This is what I'm seeing is I'm fucking Roland.

244
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm the fucking gunslinger in there.

245
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
And if I see you snapping, I'll be like,

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm there to make sure everybody else is learning.

247
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,280
You know what I mean?

248
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,480
You know what would be a teach power move in this class?

249
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,760
If this was like a prisoner's dilemma kind of thing and you turn them in

250
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
and then the teacher is like,

251
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
well, I want you to know that this was the honey trap.

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm docking you 25 points for not paying attention to the class

253
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
and instead trying to narc out other people when you should have been learning.

254
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,260
Mmm.

255
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,640
Or just he docks you for not being cool.

256
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Like you just lose points for being a narc.

257
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah, that is how the prisoner's dilemma works.

258
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,080
It's like, do you want to split the punishment?

259
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Do you want to split the time that you're going to be incarcerated?

260
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,200
Or do you want to just take the guaranteed two years?

261
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
And it's like, I want them to take it.

262
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
It's like, not cool, bro.

263
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,160
Prisoner's dilemma.

264
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,660
Yep.

265
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,800
I want to circle back to something because Griffin,

266
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
I just wanted to mention,

267
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,480
when you start talking about Google Glass,

268
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,680
I thought you were saying that the person was using Google Glass to tweet.

269
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,200
And I think that would be probably like dictating a tweet to your Google Glass

270
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,640
is probably the best way to get caught.

271
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,680
Yeah, in boarding class again.

272
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,760
Mr. Johnston is so dull.

273
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
Can't wait to blaze it.

274
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,400
Hashtag 420.

275
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,600
Can't wait to blaze it.

276
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
He's got a nice fat ass though.

277
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,640
I love that fucking fat ass.

278
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,800
Hashtag scrum diddle dumpsus.

279
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,760
And then you just turn behind.

280
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
You're like, yeah, Narc Rylance.

281
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,000
I was.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,400
I was.

283
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,920
How many famous Narcs does Justin know?

284
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm actually only doing actors.

285
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,200
I can move on to authors if you'd like.

286
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Narc Twain is the best, yeah.

287
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,160
Let's address a challenging Yahoo.

288
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,640
Okay.

289
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,680

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,440
Thank you, Jiriju.

292
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,200
It's by Yajur Answers user Jeff.

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,360
Way to secure a primo username.

294
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Jeff asks,

295
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,160
in mythology and folklore,

296
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,240
what would happen if everyone in the United States

297
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
flushed their toilets all at the same exact time?

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,320
Who?

299
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Think the world would explode, yeah?

300
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,280
Who, boy?

301
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,120
Like just from too much pressure.

302
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,520
Like the whole world,

303
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,280
like the mantle of the earth would crack

304
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,400
and just there's too much stuff going down into there

305
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
and it would just kind of-

306
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,440
Listen, we can all laugh and stuff,

307
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
but like there would be a significant difference

308
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,080
in the water level of something somewhere.

309
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah, like the Pacific Ocean would just be like, bye.

310
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
I don't know how it's all gonna-

311
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,320
I'm not gonna fence myself in by saying a specific point.

312
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,800
Yeah.

313
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
But I feel like-

314
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
Well, it would be on the opposite end of the world, right?

315
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
So like the Indian Ocean then, for us.

316
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
It would probably be the Indian Ocean.

317
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,720
And that's a little ocean.

318
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,640
That's the littlest of the oceans, I think, so.

319
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,160
Where does that water even go and or come from?

320
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,920
I think that every toilet is connected to another toilet in America

321
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,200
so that when you flush,

322
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,920
that water goes into someone else's toilet.

323
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,360
But I know what you're thinking, gross.

324
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,760
But there's a filter between there, you guys.

325
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,400
You know what I mean?

326
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,520
Like we're talking-

327
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,560
This is like alternating current of toilets.

328
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,720
Every toilet is connected.

329
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,440
So you're just like, do you get to choose?

330
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,280
No, but if you can find the person, you flush a note down.

331
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,640
It's the quickest way.

332
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,920
It is weird to think about,

333
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
because all the water is the same water that was here when Earth started,

334
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,840
that every time you take a drink,

335
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,040
at least like one particle of that is from toilet water

336
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,080
when like Julius Caesar had like nasty Taco Bell.

337
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:19,600
There's one particle of that toilet bowl water in every drink you take, really.

338
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,080
Yeah, that's cool to talk about.

339
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
It's not cool to talk about.

340
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,360
It's a fact.

341
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
It's a science fact.

342
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,280
It's just a thing.

343
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,880
What if I only drink like boxed water from now on?

344
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,400
Am I gonna be safe from Julius Caesar's Taco Bell particles?

345
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,080
It's all the same water.

346
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
Yeah, it's all the same water.

347
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,160
I mean like a lot of it is melted glacier, sorry.

348
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
Yeah, I mean they're not making new water, huh?

349
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
They're not making new water.

350
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,200
It's like the same water.

351
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Until we get more of that space rain that started the Earth.

352
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,080
We're not gonna get any new water.

353
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,360
So every time you drink water, a dinosaur shit in it.

354
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,720
A dinosaur shit in that.

355
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
I can't wait for all this space rain to come and watch Julius Caesar's poop away.

356
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
That's a very empowering thought.

357
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680
It makes us all eternal in a way.

358
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,880
And we've got a little bit of Julius Caesar's diarrhea in all of us.

359
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,760
When you have nasty boy Taco Bell shits, you gotta think like,

360
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,120
this is here forever.

361
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Like I've done a permanent thing to Earth.

362
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,440
Like everybody worries about like I need to write a great novel

363
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,080
or I need to like change one person's life.

364
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,080
But every time you shit, you're paying it forward.

365
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,040
You're pooping it forward.

366
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,880
Is this what a, I had never understood the term,

367
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
but is this what a carbon footprint is?

368
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,480
Yeah, right, exactly.

369
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,800
This is also what a Jerky Boys record sounds like,

370
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,240
in case you hadn't listened to one of those.

371
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,280
Well, let's just figure this out.

372
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,200
I got a bunch of cardboard boxes in my garage

373
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,560
because I just built a whole bunch of furniture.

374
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,520
Should I just start pooping in those and then burying them, I guess?

375
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah, honestly, we should just be burying our poop in our neighbor's yard.

376
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,080
Yeah.

377
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,800
That's green.

378
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,880
That's how Dennis the Menace does it.

379
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
That's why everybody's-

380
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
And Dennis Kucinich.

381
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
And Dennis Kucinich does it that way too.

382
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
Man, I bet that fool feels like he missed his shot, huh?

383
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,240
If he just hung in there another few years,

384
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
he could probably be doing pretty good right now.

385
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,520
Well, hey, listen, I work in an office and after lunch hour,

386
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,800
one of my coworkers throws his plastic containers into the trash bin,

387
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,440
despite the fact that recycle bins are right next to it

388
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,600
and the containers are clearly marked as recyclable.

389
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
I tried mentioning this to him,

390
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
but have not been able to change his behavior.

391
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,480
I resorted to rooting around the trash afterwards myself

392
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
and separating out the recyclables.

393
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
Brothers, how do I get people to separate their own recycling?

394
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,920
That's from Vexed Vigilante in Vancouver.

395
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,760
Well, I can tell you one thing.

396
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
If you keep doing it, there's no way they're ever going to do it.

397
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,160
Yeah, it's true.

398
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
It's true, but you got to leave it back on their desk.

399
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
Oh, it says try again.

400
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
Try again, wrong tub.

401
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,120
You're out of time reversal cubes.

402
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,280
Well, can we- I hate that we have to keep going back to this well,

403
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
but can we every time-

404
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
Throw it in a well.

405
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,800
Throw it down the recycling well.

406
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,920
Do you guys remember the song that Borat did about

407
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
throwing stuff down a well?

408
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
Throwing stuff down a well?

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,720
April Fools.

410
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
I think the well I want to go back to

411
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
is you put the recycling in the correct bin

412
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
and then it turns into candy or a little toy.

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,040
Oh, okay.

414
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,080
So rewards.

415
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,640
I love that.

416
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,880
I mean, we're monkey people essentially

417
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,480
and we need reinforcement to go into our brains.

418
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,680
And so you put your can, your plastic container.

419
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,120
What are these plastic containers

420
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
that you're eating your lunch out of?

421
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,400
This is my sandwich that came in a clamshell.

422
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
What are the plastic containers?

423
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
You just throw in Tupperware away?

424
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,520
That's ridiculous.

425
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,760
There's a lot of good use for that.

426
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,280
Griffin's right because I find gamifying stuff

427
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
is such a big thing these days.

428
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,800
You need to turn this into a game

429
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,120
and make somebody like the prime recycling winner for the week

430
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
and they get something.

431
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,000
You know what I mean?

432
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
Who's the good, good recycle boy?

433
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
And they get like, maybe it's a crown

434
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,560
made out of old plastic containers

435
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,600
or they get like a scepter made of soda cans taped together.

436
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,800
And it's good because you don't have to spend any money

437
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,280
or create any more waste and you recycled.

438
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah, and you get to be my trash queen.

439
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, you could be like,

440
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,200
and you could get like a trash, maybe a trash jester.

441
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
The trash jester is the worst, right?

442
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,520
That's the, he threw all his recyclables in the trash.

443
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
So now he has to wear the trash diaper

444
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
and it's an actual diaper.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,960
And it's been-

446
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,560
It's been used.

447
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,120
I don't think it's been used.

448
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,800
I was thinking through it.

449
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
It was used by Juicy,

450
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,120
which is what I've just decided

451
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm only calling Julius Caesar from now on.

452
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,040
I don't think, I don't think it's gonna,

453
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
I mean, you're probably worrying too much about it.

454
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,240
Let's put it that way.

455
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
Listen, let's just put it this way.

456
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
There's a lot of people throw recyclable plastics

457
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,960
in the trash, huh?

458
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,040
I'll tell you what though.

459
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,320
If what I think is correct,

460
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
the only way you could know that this person

461
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
is throwing their shit away wrong

462
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
is if you see them do it.

463
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,240
At which one, I'd say throw caution to the wind

464
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,440
and as soon as they do it, be like,

465
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
hey, you did that wrong.

466
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,520
That's not where that goes.

467
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Because if you're waiting till,

468
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
you gotta, they're like, it's like a dog.

469
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,920
You gotta catch them in the act.

470
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,520
Because if you wait till later,

471
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
you're like you're missing prime shame opportunity.

472
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
You gotta say it in the moment like,

473
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
hey, I saw you do that and you did it wrong.

474
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
I've got a great idea.

475
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
No one else is gonna do it.

476
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,680
Now you have to do it.

477
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,160
I believe deep down you wouldn't have to say anything.

478
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,520
I think if you're sitting there

479
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
and when they walk towards the cans,

480
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
you have a look on your face like,

481
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
here comes a good recycle boy.

482
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,240
Yeah.

483
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,120
Just wait patiently.

484
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,800
Can't wait to be, can't wait to be proud of you.

485
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
Here comes a good one.

486
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,080
Yeah, here comes a good boy.

487
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Hey everybody, watch Dave see how it's done.

488
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,560
He's gonna show you how it's done.

489
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,680
I think we should start.

490
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,320
Oh God, before they get up to the cans,

491
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,040
start telling him a story about some asshole

492
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,480
who was just in the break room

493
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,960
that put their plastic into the trash.

494
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah.

495
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Like, can you believe this?

496
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
A real goofus.

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
Can you believe Karen?

498
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,440
Can you believe Karen?

499
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,880
Throwing her recycle, her Dasani bottle into the trash.

500
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
Like the devil.

501
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,160
Like a real gaper.

502
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,000
I think we should all be given licenses.

503
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
And when you have the,

504
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
we'll call it a good recycle boy license.

505
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,920
And it's gender neutral.

506
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,880
It's just what they called it.

507
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,440
I don't know.

508
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,720
Take it up with the EPA, I guess.

509
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,560
BOI, BOI.

510
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,280
If you're a boy,

511
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
then you get to sit on those park benches

512
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
that they made out of old cups or whatever.

513
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
And you get to read those books

514
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
made out of like reclaimed papers.

515
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
And you get to go in like,

516
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,720
you know, the tiny houses

517
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,160
that are made of reclaimed woods.

518
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,560
Anything that is made of recycled stuff,

519
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,880
you can do it until you're a bad recycle boy.

520
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,560
And then you don't-

521
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,120
Then you pass right through those things.

522
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah, you clip through those reclaimed park benches.

523
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,240
You just can't.

524
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
You can't interact with it.

525
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,240
You become a recycle ghost.

526
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,600
Does that help?

527
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Yep.

528
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,720
It doesn't hurt.

529
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,000
How about this Yahoo though?

530
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
We'll see if we can get some hurt out of this one.

531
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
And it was sent in by-

532
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
This one was sent in by Nicole Harris.

533
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
Thank you, Nicole Harris,

534
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
with a time leak April Fool's Day question.

535
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dave.

536
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Real goof for that one, who asks,

537
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,360
can you give me some summer camp prank ideas?

538
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
I see a lot of unique ideas on summer camp pranks,

539
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
and they are pretty good.

540
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
I am looking for a different kind of prank

541
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,240
than what I see when I search prank ideas.

542
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
The kind of pranks I want to do

543
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,040
are all ones that I have to sneak around

544
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,200
in the middle of the night in full camouflage

545
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
and pull the prank.

546
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
I want it to be an adrenaline rush.

547
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,160
I want to be a fucking bad boy.

548
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,120
I want to be punished.

549
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,360
I want to be an adrenaline rush

550
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
where I have to sneak around to pull it.

551
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,720
E.g. hooking an mp3 player to the PA system at night,

552
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,360
playing a song, then sneaking back to my cabin

553
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,960
without being caught.

554
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
I don't want any answers,

555
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,800
like where I put Vaseline on the door handles,

556
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,560
putting food coloring in the soap,

557
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
putting flour in a hairdryer,

558
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
anything that I don't need to sneak around to pull it.

559
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
I want to be caught and punished.

560
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,640
P.s. my camp is in the woods in Ohio.

561
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
There's a boys side, a girls side,

562
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
a pool, and a big ravine that runs through the camp

563
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,280
that has heavy vegetation and is good for hiding.

564
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,440
From Punishers.

565
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,280
I will be with a few friends as I pull the pranks,

566
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,600
so please compensate a few other people into your idea.

567
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,120
Well fuck, hold on.

568
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,520
Okay, I need to redo some calculations then.

569
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,480
Give me a second.

570
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
Let me compensate for the pranks.

571
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,680
How many kids?

572
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
How tall are they?

573
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,240
Are they blonde, brunette?

574
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
Are they good sneakers, bad sneakers?

575
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Good sneakers, bad sneakers.

576
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,040
Is one of them a little bit weird?

577
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,400
Do they wear braces?

578
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
Does any of them have asthma?

579
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,360
Have they been caught before?

580
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,960
Do they also share your proclivity

581
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
for being caught by adults and punished?

582
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,080
What songs are on your MP3 player?

583
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,360
What kind of camo makeup do you have access to?

584
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
What kind of vegetation is in the ravine?

585
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
How deep is the ravine?

586
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,560
Has anyone died in the ravine before?

587
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,400
Could you bury a body in the ravine?

588
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
How like dense is the soil?

589
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,680
How loose is the gravel?

590
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
What kind of security system do you have?

591
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
Who's the best bunk in all of Camp Blasiatta?

592
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
Bunk three, that's right.

593
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,400
Bug juice, where does it come from?

594
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Does it come in a jar?

595
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,280
No, it comes from who you are.

596
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,080
There's a Yahoo answerer here

597
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,720
who's provided a few suggestions.

598
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,040
One suggestion is Vaseline on a doorknob.

599
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Jedi, that's their username.

600
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
Jedi, it's like you didn't even listen.

601
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,440
But here's their description.

602
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,480
Maybe they went back in

603
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
and edited that into the original question.

604
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
Like, hey, hey, I see what you're doing.

605
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
Vaseline on a doorknob.

606
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,120
This is their description for it.

607
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,560
Putting a little Vaseline on a doorknob

608
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
makes it virtually impossible to open.

609
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,760
If you're gonna pull this prank,

610
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,480
don't place it on the doorknob inside a room.

611
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
You don't wanna make it impossible

612
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
for the room's occupants to leave

613
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,720
if an emergency occurs.

614
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,800
Well, okay.

615
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,960
Oh shit, the chainsaw strangler's inside.

616
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,760
Let's get out of here.

617
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,880
Squeak, eek, eek, eek.

618
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,080
Aw, fuck.

619
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,560
Aw, got me again, Timothy.

620
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,120
Wait, is the idea that you just can't get a grip on it?

621
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,920
Yeah, you can't.

622
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,640
Well, you should know this.

623
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,320
What sort of, like, infant can't crack that?

624
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Like, it's Vaseline.

625
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,160
Just wipe it off.

626
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,360
Well, Justin, you should know this.

627
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
Like, you know why that is,

628
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,600
why jam is such an effective weapon

629
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,640
in your fight for justice.

630
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,600
I mean, yeah.

631
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,040
I just always assumed jam

632
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,200
increased the grip of the doorknob.

633
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
Like, you couldn't let go of it.

634
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
You stuck to it with preserves.

635
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,240
You don't know what jelly is.

636
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,800
Me?

637
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,600
That's one thing.

638
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah, that's one thing.

639
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,880
Well, I was raised in a very religious household.

640
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,240
Travis went to a Montessori school

641
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,480
where that kind of behavior was not allowed.

642
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:18,980
No.

643
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,560
You know what would be a really good prank?

644
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
What's that, Travis?

645
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,400
Sneak around.

646
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,680
Move all the clocks and calendars

647
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
and everybody's phones forward a day

648
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,160
so when it comes time for the parents to come,

649
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,960
everybody thinks the parents forgot to pick everyone up.

650
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
But really, you just move time forward

651
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
24 hours on everybody's devices.

652
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
Then you go out to the flagpole

653
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,040
in the center of the camp

654
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,720
and you pull your pants down

655
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,640
and just have your butt out there

656
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,360
and just wait for somebody to come spank you.

657
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,880
I was getting there.

658
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh, sorry, sorry.

659
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
And then you have Christopher Lloyd

660
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,920
pretend to be the head of a new camp

661
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
and you say,

662
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,920
your parents didn't even want you.

663
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,520
Come stay at this camp with me

664
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,760
so that everyone comes and stays at the camp with you

665
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,800
and over time,

666
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,520
you eventually become sort of like a religious figure, right?

667
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
And maybe you start your own college

668
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
and you have everyone pretend like they're at college

669
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
but really, it's not a real college

670
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,000
but then in the end,

671
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,480
you stand in front of some kind of accreditation board

672
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,920
and it becomes a real college

673
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,880
and then you bend over

674
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
and you spread your butt really wide.

675
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,800
I'd see it.

676
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,320
You know, J-Long.

677
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,480
More like Justin Wide.

678
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,980
Wait.

679
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,960
Hi, I'm Justin Wide.

680
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,240
The porn Justin Long.

681
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,760
I'm also just,

682
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,800
I'm just Justin Long.

683
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,120
I went with that for my porn Justin Long name.

684
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,640
I'm Justin and Al.

685
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
I also love porn.

686
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,680
And hamburgers.

687
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,320
And hamburgers.

688
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,920
I'm Justin Dong.

689
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
Get out of here, Justin Dong.

690
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,480
You're too on the nose.

691
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,520
That's not even funny.

692
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,400
That's not even funny.

693
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,600
Justin Dong.

694
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,240
Any other fun rhymes with Justin Long

695
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,880
or should we hop over to the Money Zone?

696
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,680
I've been sitting here,

697
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,120
I was stalling trying to think of more

698
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,200
but I don't actually have any more so.

699
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Okay, well, let's get paid.

700
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,600
Can I talk about Trunk Club?

701
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,120
I wish you would.

702
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,680
Please do.

703
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,840
I would like to tell you about Trunk Club.

704
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,200
I am a member.

705
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
I got some jeans from Trunk Club

706
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,280
and I shit you not.

707
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,480
They are the greatest jeans I have ever worn.

708
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
You know how sometimes you see people wear jeans

709
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,600
to a function, to like a formal thing?

710
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,920
Lin-Manuel Miranda wore jeans to the White House

711
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,840
and I was like, how does he do it?

712
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,120
And I'll tell you how he does it.

713
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,560
Good jeans.

714
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,040
Yeah, these ain't no stank ass jeans.

715
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
These aren't your,

716
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,320
these don't have carpenter hoops on them.

717
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,400
No, these are like adult jeans.

718
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,240
Which is a thing I didn't even know

719
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,200
was physically possible until I went to Trunk Club.

720
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,040
They hooked me up with some jeans,

721
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,560
some like fancy socks, a really nice shirt,

722
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,600
and they had everything.

723
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
It was really cool.

724
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,840
No exaggeration.

725
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,080
I went and had a great time hanging out with my stylist.

726
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
I got to go to an actual like brick and mortar like place

727
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,560
and try on clothes.

728
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,520
But here's the thing.

729
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
The beautiful thing about Trunk Club

730
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,720
is you can have that experience without going anywhere.

731
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
They're gonna talk to you kind of like,

732
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,960
they're gonna talk to you, kind of figure out

733
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,280
what your deal is, what you're into,

734
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,840
what kind of things you might need clothes for,

735
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
and then they send them to you.

736
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,880
You try them on.

737
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,600
You see what you like, what you don't like,

738
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,280
and you send back what you don't like,

739
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,720
and you only pay for what you keep.

740
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
It's an amazing deal.

741
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,960
It'll help you.

742
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,000
Maybe you've been trying to figure out

743
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,520
how to dress more like an adult

744
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
or really get your fashion game on point,

745
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
but you don't even know what stores to go to.

746
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,760
Trunk Club is for you.

747
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,480

757
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,680
So go to trunkclub.com slash my brother.

758
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
You got me thinking about jeans.

759
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,840
I just had an amazing business idea.

760
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,340
Okay.

761
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
You know Jinkos?

762
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,540
Yes.

763
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
I learned this week that Jinkos,

764
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,160
you know they got that wide leg.

765
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,600
Yes, I am aware.

766
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Keep all kinds of secrets in there.

767
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
Did you know that the measurement

768
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,680
for the pant hole at the bottom

769
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,640
where your foot lives

770
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,720
is exactly as wide as the hip?

771
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
So if you were like a size 32 Jinko,

772
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,720
each leg hole is going to be 32 as well.

773
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,880
Here's the business idea.

774
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,440
Okay.

775
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
Cut off each pant leg,

776
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,680
and all of a sudden you have three

777
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,840
equal length, equal size denim skirts.

778
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,040
Okay.

779
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,640
Business idea.

780
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
You buy Jinkos,

781
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,640
cut them up into three skirts,

782
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
and then you resell them for triple profit.

783
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,240
Also, there'd probably be like a sweet

784
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,720
eight ball and dragon and stuff on there.

785
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,280
Yeah, that's the thing.

786
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
That's the point about Jinkos no one talks about.

787
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,240
They talk about the big legs.

788
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,520
What about the embroidery?

789
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
Do you know what Jinkos stands for?

790
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,040
What?

791
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,120
Judge none, choose one.

792
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,080
It's fucking cool.

793
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,280
It doesn't mean anything.

794
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,600
Anything is fucking really cool though.

795
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,640
That's my idea I came up with for Infinity Dollars,

796
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
and it sounds like you guys don't give a shit

797
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,640
about tripling your money.

798
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,760
How much money do you have right now?

799
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Triple it.

800
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,680
Join my Jinko Army.

801
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,880
Whoa.

802
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,480
Join my army of Jinko skirts.

803
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron if I can.

804
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,160
Hell yes.

805
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,080
I'm gonna get hungry though.

806
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,520
Yeah, that's probably true.

807
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,560
Blue Apron is amazing.

808
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,520
It's changed my life.

809
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,240
I cook like a few times a week now,

810
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,960
and I used to not cook at all because I didn't know how.

811
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,800
But using Blue Apron, I've learned to cook,

812
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,440
and in doing so, I've created dozens and dozens

813
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,880
of delicious meals.

814
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
So for less than 10 bucks a meal,

815
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,800
Blue Apron will deliver all the fresh ingredients

816
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
you need to create home-cooked meals.

817
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,040
Just follow some easy step-by-step instructions

818
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,760
that they provide.

819
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,200
All the ingredients are farm fresh.

820
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,640
They're in season veggies most of the time,

821
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,360
and good quality meats, and absolutely delicious.

822
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,920
Every meal can be prepared in 10 minutes or less.

823
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,440
You don't gotta go to the grocery store.

824
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,840
They can change the ingredients based

825
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,360
on your dietary preferences.

826
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,400
And they make it a breeze to discover and prepare dishes

827
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,520
like what are some of the hot ones that you guys have made?

828
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,120
I made like a fried chicken,

829
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,920
but what was weird is that the coating

830
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,440
didn't have egg in it at all.

831
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
It used like Greek yogurt and vinegar,

832
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
and it was amazing.

833
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,080
I had never had fried chicken like that before,

834
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
and it was so much healthier.

835
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,640
I had it in a ramen with ground pork.

836
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,280
The triple, the triple, holy shit, that was good.

837
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,160
Are you kidding me?

838
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,280
Those are the best things I've ever eaten.

839
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Right now, you can get your first two meals for free.

840
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,080
Just go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

841
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,720
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

842
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm not, this is not, I'm not talking out of my ass

843
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,480
because they're supporting us financially.

844
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,440
It's literally, it's literally changed my life.

845
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,520
It has given me like stuff to do like a few nights a week,

846
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,880
and it's really fun.

847
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
Like you don't have to stress whether or not

848
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,120
you've got the right shit.

849
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,480
You've got the right shit.

850
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,240
It's easy, and you learn how to cook.

851
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,120
It's awesome.

852
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,600
To give you an idea, here are some meals from this week.

853
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,760
Crispy chicken cutlets with sugar snap peas,

854
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,640
stir fried honey garlic shrimp with snow peas,

855
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,000
cheeseburgers on English muffins with Roscoe's potatoes.

856
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,680
Like, and there's even more.

857
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
There's also vegetarian options.

858
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,160
There's stuff for kids.

859
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,640
It's great.

860
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,360
What's Roscoe gonna do without his potatoes, though?

861
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,240
He's gonna cry.

862
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,720
He's gonna cry.

863
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,080
Who's gonna eat those for dinner?

864
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,520
Anyway, go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

865
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,480
Well, let's ask him.

866
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,080
Hey, it's me, Roscoe the Potato Man.

867
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,880
What are you doing with the potatoes?

868
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,160
You don't seem to understand.

869
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,640
The potatoes make up my body.

870
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,800
I got a Jumbotron message to Grace from Jake.

871
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,720
Didn't want to explore the canon of Roscoe the Potato Man, huh?

872
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,920
No, I, nah.

873
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,600
The potatoes, I don't know if you heard the last bit, and maybe this will change your mind

874
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,200
about whether or not you want to dig in.

875
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,160
But the potatoes make up the form of his body.

876
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,080
So this one's to Grace from Jake.

877
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,360
I got lots of eyes.

878
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,720
So wait, Griffin, is he like potatoes sewn together?

879
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,680
Is he like Oogie Boogie and he's like a sack with potatoes in it?

880
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,080
No one quite understands the dark magics that hold all my potato body together.

881
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,360
But I'm saying, do you look at him and he's just a chain of potatoes forming a body,

882
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,680
or is he like a sack boy with potatoes in it?

883
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,120
Ah, no one's quite sure.

884
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm pretty hard to look at.

885
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,400
Speech is energy.

886
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,840
Thoughts are energy.

887
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,880
This stuff reverberates around the planet, and you're letting him-

888
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,040
This is Julius Caesar's diarrhea.

889
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,840
Cart Blanche to just spread this like metaphorical Julius Caesar's diarrhea, like all across the-

890
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,080
What are you letting who spread it?

891
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,680
These ideas are persistent.

892
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,880
By allowing Griffin to continue to establish the rich fiction of Roscoe the Potato Man,

893
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,280
you are-

894
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,080
That's not my name.

895
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,640
What is it?

896
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
Roscoe the King of the Potato Kingdom.

897
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,400
It's a bit repetitive, but all my potato subjects-

898
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Hey, y'all ever heard of the Fry Guys?

899
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,480
They defected from the Potato Kingdom.

900
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,520
Roscoe, do you have a sidekick that we can maybe spin you and that sidekick off into

901
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,560
like its own podcast just about Roscoe?

902
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
I got Spuddy Buddy.

903
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:28,960
Perfect.

904
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,360
He's a dog.

905
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,920
The worst part, the most dangerous part about this is that we're going to let him go on

906
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,320
long enough that he's going to say something funny enough to include it in the actual podcast,

907
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,560
and then we're stuck with like all the buildups.

908
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
Spuddy Buddy was pretty great.

909
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,200
I know.

910
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,760
This is all gold, and this is all making the final cut.

911
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,680
It's all Yukon gold.

912
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Hey, fucking watch it, buddy.

913
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:00,320
Let's talk more about my body.

914
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,440
Now, check it out.

915
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,840
What I got here, I got a big brown potato for my hand, but what's that coming off of

916
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,160
it?

917
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,960
Fingerlings.

918
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
I mean, that's what I would have guessed.

919
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,600
I mean, if I had to guess, that was the guess I would have made.

920
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,760
I'll wear a shirt made out of tinfoil.

921
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,960
It's weird that Jake wrote all this to Grace.

922
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,080
Yeah, it's a very special relationship.

923
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,760
You want me to read this one?

924
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,320
Absolutely not.

925
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,360
Yes, I do.

926
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,720
I can't read human English.

927
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,760
It'll be ridiculous.

928
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,960
I'm a collection of living potatoes.

929
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,760
Do you guys need to know what time it is?

930
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,720
Because I'm powering like six or seven different clocks for a science project.

931
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,960
Dorothy and the tin man and the scarecrow like walked past Roscoe the potato man.

932
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
They're like, he's like, wait, the wizard could...

933
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,520
No, they were like, no, we're good.

934
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,080
We're good here.

935
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,360
You go ahead.

936
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,960
They said, we can't fit you in the car.

937
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,000
And I was like, what car?

938
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,800
It's not a car.

939
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,880
They just kept on going.

940
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,760
I couldn't go anywhere though because I'm forever attached to the ground by a bunch of vines.

941
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,040
I need the vines though to keep me alive.

942
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,760
Happy birthday, Grace.

943
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
Grace, we've been dating for over five years now and I know it'll only keep getting better.

944
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,840
Thanks for loving the weird and goofy guy I am and accepting me into your heart of hearts.

945
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,360
I love you so much.

946
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,800
I hope you enjoy hearing the brother's sweet, sweet voices.

947
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Reading this special message just for you.

948
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
The love of your life, Jake.

949
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
Oh, isn't that a little baked sweet potato there, isn't it?

950
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,720
Hi, everybody.

951
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,680
This is Jesse Thorne.

952
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
I want to apologize.

953
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,440
The last five minutes you've heard were put into the air without my permission.

954
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,360
And I want to especially apologize to Grace and Jake who generously gave to this network in hopes

955
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,520
of getting a promotion on their favorite podcast network, My Brother, My Brother and Me, which is

956
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
a show and not a podcast network.

957
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
Sorry, been day drinking.

958
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
Anyway, it's Jesse Thorne here.

959
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,880
And I just really want to apologize to Grace and Jake for the substandard quality of this

960
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,080
Jumbotron message and also the surrounding bit, sort of a Julius Caesar's diarrhea coating

961
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,880
on what should be a beautiful maraschino cherry of a message.

962
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,520
So in closing, I want to add my happy birthdays to Jake's happy birthdays.

963
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,920
And in doing so, subtract the happy birthdays of Grace, the potato boy.

964
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,200
I didn't listen.

965
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,560
I skipped around a little bit.

966
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,680
Again, day drinking.

967
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,480
Anyway, this has been Jesse Thorne reminding you to listen to all the other shows on our

968
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,440
network, especially mine.

969
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,280
Guess it's time for me to die now.

970
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,680
Well, goodbye, Roscoe.

971
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,280
Sounds like I am.

972
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
Listen, Roscoe been around long enough to know when he's not wanted.

973
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,520
I have fucking empirical evidence that that is a lie.

974
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
I've been around a lot longer than you, Justin.

975
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,920
Yeah, that's right.

976
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,640
I know your name.

977
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,560
I'm going to go feed myself to some hungry kids.

978
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
The hard part about doing this- Oh, he's selfless, isn't he?

979
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,800
You didn't expect that turn, did you?

980
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
You didn't think he would sacrifice his life to put some food in the bellies of the working

981
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,120
man.

982
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:25,600
But here I go off to die to fill up some bellies with my own starchy belly.

983
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,320
The hard part about doing this show in audio is he can say this.

984
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,320
I don't know if he's actually leaving the room because the character of Roscoe, the

985
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
potato kid- I'm not leaving the room.

986
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm hopping to a big old pot of boiling water.

987
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,600
It's comically large, but here I go.

988
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:38,880
Justin.

989
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,600
This is it.

990
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm standing on the edge.

991
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,360
Justin.

992
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,640
Standing on the edge now.

993
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,800
Travis, I'm not going to apologize to Roscoe.

994
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,120
I'm just going to dip my little fingerling toes in and just test- Oh, no!

995
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Oh, that's the hot water.

996
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,080
Justin, don't let him feed those hungry kids.

997
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,040
It's going to feel-

998
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,360
In the interest of saving our listeners, the sonic assault of hearing Roscoe boiled a lie.

999
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,000
Travis, I got a request, would you mind turning my head potato 180 degrees real sharply?

1000
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,280
And so-

1001
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,680
So I can't-

1002
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,640
Will that kill you?

1003
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Yeah, it'll kill me real quick, but I don't want to feel what happens next.

1004
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,400
I will do it because Justin drove me to do it.

1005
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,160
I don't want to do this, Roscoe.

1006
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,440
Okay, Justin, he's got his big, strong, ape-like fingers wrapped around my neck.

1007
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,740
So-

1008
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,400
He's got his gape-like fingers wrapped around-

1009
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,680
Listen, are we to believe that you're made of potatoes and that you have, like, a nervous system?

1010
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,880
Is that what you're saying?

1011
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,960
We've established all this, Justin.

1012
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,040
This doesn't sound like an apology, so Travis, I want you- Can you give me a countdown?

1013
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,960
I need to think about my potato chip.

1014
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,000
Where do you want me to start?

1015
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,840
Just three.

1016
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,560
Okay, three, two-

1017
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,440
Oh, I had a lot of-

1018
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roscoe, I'm sorry.

1019
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,720
Please continue to be a fixture of our hit podcast.

1020
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,320
Our webby losing podcast, my brother, my brother and me, please.

1021
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,680
I just- I'm glad that, Travis, you've spared me because I just thought,

1022
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,320
it would be funny if I called my kids tater tots.

1023
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Ty is a pedantic person.

1024
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,520
I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-off-y way.

1025
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,960
Jairo.

1026
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,920
Yiro.

1027
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,880
Sacrebleu.

1028
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,920
Sacrebleu.

1029
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,880
Ayers Rock.

1030
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,520
Uluru.

1031
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,920
What you are witnessing is real.

1032
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,160
The participants are not actors.

1033
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,200
They are actual litigants with real cases.

1034
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,960
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court.

1035
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,640
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

1036

Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

1037
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding coming up in a couple months.

1038
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
Congratulations, Justin.

1039
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
Thanks, and now here's a question from a listener.

1040
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,040
I'm going to be a bridesmaid in a wedding coming up in a couple of months.

1041
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,200
The bridal party has been messaging about what to do for the bachelorette party.

1042
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,880
We're considering going out to some bars and getting a hotel room downtown.

1043
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,320
The pregnant maid of honor chimed in to say she thinks that sounds great

1044
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,400
as long as we're okay sharing a hotel room with a three-week-old baby.

1045
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:15,840
No.

1046
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,560
She wants to bring her newborn and her daughter-in-law to the party.

1047
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,560
Bring her newborn to the bachelorette party.

1048
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
How do I respond?

1049
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,840
That's from Sensible in Seattle, and I literally need to think about this for a second.

1050
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,760
Okay, I thought about it and then finished.

1051
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,240
Okay, why don't you start?

1052
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,040
Okay, assuming you're Griffin.

1053
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,360
No, no, no.

1054
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,560
I thought about it and here it is.

1055
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,160
No, like I don't want to sound anti-baby or whatever, but this is a bachelorette party,

1056
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,760
and they just want to turn their, let their hair down and get fucking buck wild

1057
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,560
and forget about the, you know, the problems of the day

1058
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,760
and just want to like have the wildest party that this person's ever gonna have.

1059
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,200
And not only that, but to Griffin's point, it'd be one thing if it was just like

1060
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,080
we're getting a hotel suite and that's where the party is,

1061
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,600
but if you're talking about also like bar hopping and ending up at a hotel room downtown,

1062
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,800
that child should not be with you.

1063
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,280
I don't want to sound like a dick because I get it.

1064
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,680
Like it's hard, it's hard planning around this stuff, but like

1065
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,800
this is, that seems like a weirdly passive aggressive like,

1066
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
oh, you're trying to party, huh?

1067
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,400
Trying to have like the biggest and best party of your life.

1068
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,040
You're like having a party that you want other people to plan

1069
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,320
so you can tell stories about it and be surprised by like how wild it got, huh?

1070
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,280
Okay, cool.

1071
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,520
Well, here's like a three week old baby that's like probably gonna keep,

1072
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
keep things from getting too buck wild.

1073
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,520
Like I don't want a bunch of like fucking hot dicks slapping against hips in here

1074
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,680
because I got this baby, this one here, 21 days old.

1075
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,400
Check it out.

1076
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,880
Unless.

1077
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,360
No, there's not an unless for that.

1078
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,920
What if the baby can hang?

1079
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,840
Generally speaking, it's probably too early to have your baby out and about.

1080
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,720
I mean, you could use a safety angle like that, right?

1081
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,520
Like really, a three week old baby should not be, you know, out and about.

1082
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,720
Their little dumb nervous systems haven't even heard about anything yet.

1083
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:10,960
Yeah.

1084
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,760
So they're like so, not their nervous system, sorry, their little dumb immune systems,

1085
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,360
like haven't heard about anything yet.

1086
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,560
And their nervous systems, if their nervous systems are exposed to some like

1087
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,440
fucking full blown magic mic XXXXXL hanging brain,

1088
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
they're not gonna, they're gonna see that and be like,

1089
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,880
I haven't, don't really have the nerves to like really process these yet.

1090
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,120
Interesting.

1091
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,880
Is this, Justin, you are a father.

1092
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,360
Is this a scenario in which this person,

1093
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,400
you know, having a child that's only three weeks old,

1094
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,480
they have not yet acclimated to the fact that they don't get to do

1095
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,920
as much stuff as they did before they had a baby?

1096
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,760
Hey, I'm gonna tell it, I'm gonna teach everybody,

1097
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,200
Bill Cosby's out, so you need a new fatherhood kind of guy and it's me.

1098
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,240
So here's my first funny observation about what you learn as a dad.

1099
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,640
Rule number one and only rule, don't fucking tell moms what to do ever.

1100
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
Let's, I love babies.

1101
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,720
I love them dearly.

1102
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,560
My friends here in town having babies, I love being around those babies,

1103
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,640
but I get this feeling when I'm around a baby and it's the same feeling I get,

1104
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,480
and this is gonna be weird, but hang with me,

1105
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,680
whenever I go to like, and not that I go to these often,

1106
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,280
but like a gun range where it's one false move around this thing

1107
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,920
and that's it for my, like my life is ruined.

1108
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,720
And it's hard for me to really let my hair down.

1109
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,880
It's hard to get blitzkrieg'd when you know like,

1110
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,560
there's a thing in this room that if I goof around too much with,

1111
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,720
that's the ball game.

1112
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,960
Yeah, that's, yeah, fiend.

1113
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,400
Fiend on the whole thing.

1114
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,120
That's a wrap, that's a wrap on Griffin.

1115
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,080
Do you know what I mean?

1116
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,960
He's had a good, hey everybody, that's a wrap.

1117
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,520
At a gun range,

1118
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,720
It's a series wrap on Griffin, let's have a big round of applause.

1119
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,000
At a gun range, I don't think like, I'm pretty confident

1120
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,960
that there's not gonna be a fateful whoopsie,

1121
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,640
but the fact that the thing that is there

1122
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,520
could cause a fateful whoopsie, a career ending whoopsie doodle,

1123
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,000
and I feel that same way around babies,

1124
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,120
and it's hard for me to like,

1125
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,840
there's always that reserve in the back of my mind of like,

1126
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,720
you need to keep one part of your consciousness

1127
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,360
just dedicated to the survival of that.

1128
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,560
I think the bigger issue that you're still gonna run into

1129
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,000
is that this maid of honor

1130
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,760
has not accepted the reality of being a parent,

1131
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,880
and what that means is like,

1132
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,040
it, one of like, the thing,

1133
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,720
like there's so much good about it,

1134
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,360
and the one thing that is definitely true

1135
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,160
is that you are about to not be able to say yes

1136
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,920
to whatever you want to say yes to.

1137
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,800
Like, there are going to be things that just fucking suck

1138
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,960
because you can't go to them, and it blows,

1139
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
but that's it, like that's the thing.

1140
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,800
Like, that's the, that's the treatment you're getting.

1141
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,120
Unless, unless have you guys

1142
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,200
seen the Bruce Willis movie Surrogates?

1143
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,200
Uh-huh.

1144
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,720
I saw the Spanish language version

1145
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,480
that I bought in Honduras.

1146
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,040
It was actually an off-screen camera version

1147
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,520
that I bought for $3 outside of the grocery store.

1148
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,560
A Super Marque, though.

1149
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,400
So you get it.

1150
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:27,920
I get it.

1151
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,240
I haven't, I haven't seen it, but I think it's about like,

1152
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,560
you climb, they, like you can control people

1153
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,880
while you're not, it's like,

1154
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,000
I think the plot of the movie Surrogates is Bruce Willis

1155
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,360
is in a, like some sort of chamber,

1156
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,240
and he controls like a fake version of himself,

1157
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,280
which I know you're wondering, like,

1158
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,600
if I was controlling an artificial Bruce Willis,

1159
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,480
I would just like, just jerk myself off like constant,

1160
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,280
like nonstop, like 24-7, but I, this doesn't,

1161
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,760
I haven't seen the movie Surrogates,

1162
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,560
I haven't seen the movie Surrogates, but I,

1163
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,840
Maybe for your bachelorette party,

1164
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,080
just rent and watch the movie Surrogates.

1165
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,280
Surrogates, yeah, could be one option.

1166
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,560
That would be pretty good.

1167
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,680
You could do also one of those things

1168
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,680
where it's like an iPad rolling around on wheels,

1169
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,160
but I think the Surrogates-

1170
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,280
Of the movie Surrogate?

1171
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,060
Yes.

1172
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,240
This is my dear friend, Jennifer.

1173
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,320
We've been friends since we were kids,

1174
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,640
and she is my beautiful maid of honor.

1175
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,280
That looks like an iPad with the movie Surrogates on it,

1176
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,720
rolling around on a remote-controlled car.

1177
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,680
Yeah, exactly.

1178
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,800
I love you, Jennifer.

1179
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,480
Jennifer, do you remember that time that,

1180
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,000
yeah, that was, yeah, that was it.

1181
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,160
That's just a scene of Bruce Willis jerking himself off.

1182
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,720
Yeah, I know.

1183
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,440
It's my favorite Jennifer trait.

1184
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,840
It's my favorite quality of Jennifers.

1185
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,720
What if you ever hire a male stripper dressed like Super Nanny?

1186
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,760
And he's also very good at taking care of babies,

1187
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,240
so after he's done with his thing,

1188
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,440
he gets dressed back up, maybe in some comfortable sweats,

1189
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,200
and he takes care of the baby.

1190
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,560
This is good for everybody.

1191
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,040
But you need-

1192
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,320
Who's gonna be taking care of the baby

1193
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,960
while he's doing his work up there,

1194
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,320
while he's slapping his-

1195
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,240
I mean, they do take naps.

1196
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,760
The babies do take naps.

1197
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,200
Oh, I thought you meant male strippers.

1198
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,800
What?

1199
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,480
Male strippers take naps.

1200
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,400
They probably get worn out afterwards,

1201
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,760
plopping that dong around.

1202
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,800
It's exhausting.

1203
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,960
I have never seen a male stripper do a thing,

1204
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,040
and it's not from any closed-mindedness of myself.

1205
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,800
I've just never been afforded the opportunity.

1206
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,080
But in my mind, and based on just sort of the conversation

1207
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,280
and the open, free dialogue that the three of us have had today,

1208
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,120
it sounds like we all assume that they just kind of get up there,

1209
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,120
they just kind of get up there,

1210
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,160
and then they just kind of do a left-to-right situation.

1211
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,600
Whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap, whap.

1212
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,640
As if they were-

1213
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,680
Until they get tired.

1214
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,440
And then they take a nap.

1215
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,620
There's a quick fiver and then they're back to taking care of your baby

1216
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
I guess it makes sense. I

1217
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,340
Want to just I want to put a button in something because I don't think this has been particularly hysterical

1218
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,560
but it is like it's a tough one and

1219
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,840
I I think that the same rule would apply if you were the baby's father as well

1220
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,900
I would hope that's like yeah, it's like you just it's like

1221
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,000
it's it's

1222
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,840
There's so much good about parenthood and and and I think one of like the the scariest hardest to accept things is also like

1223
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,060
one of the most

1224
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:29,860
beautiful things about it is that you are saying like I'm not the center of the universe anymore and it's like and it's very

1225
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:35,640
Hard because what you end up doing when that happens is like putting a lot of other people who you would have

1226
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,620
sacrificed for before like including, you know doing things that you really want to do like and are very important to you like

1227
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:47,000
Can't just can't happen and like that's the that's that's the way of it

1228
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,860
And it's it's ultimately really rewarding but it's just like that's not the way it works

1229
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:58,780
Anyway, you can't just do whatever you want. By the way that whole bit where we took on a question like dealing with like fucking

1230
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:08,360
Motherhood and how to handle like etiquette at a bachelorette party that we were so qualified to talk about that whole thing was April Fool's joke

1231
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:15,060
So just can't believe you fell for it. Just kind of covering up thought that we were really talking some shit out of our asses about

1232
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:22,140
Travis put this question on here. We had fell into a beautiful traffic Travis. Was this your elaborate Gabriel fools joke?

1233
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,140
I can't believe you fell for it you fools you you goofus is your real gapers or the gapers now

1234
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,300
Look to your left. Look to your right if someone's not gaping

1235
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:38,660
You're the gaper if you ran into a gaper today. They're the gaper if all you run into is gapers. You're the gaper

1236
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,860
Hey, let's do it. Let's talk about something that we're even remotely qualified to talk about let's do yahoo

1237
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,620
Okay, this guy who was sent in by

1238
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:52,020
Riding high so we can see you. Thank you. So it's by yahoo answers user Gary the human being

1239
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,100
well

1240
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,460
Who I'm working a little hard there Gare

1241
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:03,980
Yeah, this is like the easiest turning test ever our ghosts stuck with whatever haircut and outfit

1242
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,260
They had when they died or can they customize their look and gear?

1243
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,700
Hmm

1244
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:16,540
For just 500 Nintendo coins they can get a new hat. Yeah, it'll be

1245
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,600
The trick is you got to find the neighborhood. You gotta find the barber in the town. It's usually right next to the safe place

1246
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,240
You got to kill you got a haunt and kill a barber and be like, ah sick. I'm so glad you're here

1247
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,800
I was thinking about like doing like a size six guard on the sides and then scissor cutting and thinning out on top

1248
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:39,500
So get to it. And if you find the ghost magazine spread throughout the wasteland you can get new tattoos. Hey, I saw

1249
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,600
The specter of death

1250
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,200
Today and he was like the only way to be set free from this ghost prison is to give Jerry a haircut

1251
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:54,700
So let's what do you say? Let's hop on it. You have to though, right because otherwise every like

1252
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,600
Discovery history channel show the person would be like, I'm there at the top of the stairs

1253
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,380
With somebody in like a pretty sweet like they had like a faux hawk

1254
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,880
It was pretty great and they had on just the coolest t-shirt

1255
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,120
It's a graphic tee and they were like I died here 200 years ago

1256
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:20,280
Yeah, somebody is like as a joke in 2016. They're like cleaning out their closet and they're like guys check it

1257
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,680
I found this hyper color t-shirt. I found these fucking goggles that I bought from Hot Topic and guys

1258
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:30,380
Jinko jean skirt this shit is oh shit slip. Click. Click. Click. Click. Oh, no

1259
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,360
What if you're what if you're what if you are at a fucking

1260
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:42,640
You're in a toilet situation and you have your pants pulled down on your ankles because you just want to feel free and you pee

1261
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:50,360
And then like a sudden immediate coronary dead and then it's like, oh no, I'm like my dick is up forever. No

1262
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:57,800
You have the number one evidence that I have that ghosts are allowed to change their clothes is you think about how many people?

1263
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,040
Over the history must have died while pretending to be Santa Claus

1264
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:07,920
Yeah, you don't see a lot of Santa ghosts roaming around right like they're allowed to change their clothes

1265
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:14,520
Mm when it's suck if like how it worked is when you became a ghost you just automatically were in the clothes that you are

1266
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,720
Most identified with as a human being like that's why like you see them in like Civil War

1267
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,360
Uniforms and stuff even if they died in their long john

1268
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:28,120
So then you die and you come back and you're like him the ugliest dress shirt you ever owned and you're like is this what?

1269
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:34,560
Everyone thinks of me. Is this you don't remember that cool jean jacket. I had this is how I'm gonna be remembered forever

1270
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,440
What if it or what if it's during your fucking jean jacket phase and it was like this is when you were happiest in your

1271
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,280
Life, but this is when you were most free is when you got that jean jacket if you can change your clothes

1272
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,840
But you can only do it once every 25 years

1273
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,920
Oh my god

1274
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:56,520
Cuz then you like have to pick whatever style you think is gonna continue to be relevant and then everybody's easy like damn Daniel

1275
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,080
Daniel still at it again with the white pants

1276
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:07,760
What if the only way you got to change clothes is it by convincing living beings to destroy their clothes?

1277
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
So you could get new ghost

1278
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,680
Please burn those pants. I love those pants. Please bring them

1279
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:25,240
It's like the actually the number one sort of writing tip that I've gotten that has made it so helpful for me to craft my fiction

1280
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,480
Is just kill your jinkos, you know, there's no sacred calves here

1281
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,160
Just kill those jinkos Justin

1282
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:39,120
I really liked your idea of 25 years a change because you die in 1971 and you're wearing some dumb goofy 71 shit

1283
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,480
And then it's 1996 and you're like, oh, thank god. I've been waiting for this definitely jinkos

1284
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,200
But I'm thinking about I I had my dad kill a Gameboy pocket the other day and

1285
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,440
I'm gonna be able to definitely carry like maybe two or three of those bad boys in these jinkos and this is a look everlasting

1286
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
so and then it's fucking what what's

1287
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,800
1996 was 25 and one 2021 and what it'll be there like

1288
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,960
What's again?

1289
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,840
Jinkos? Yeah, it's all it comes back around times

1290
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,920
Times a flat circle and it fits in a jinko, you know, it'd be great

1291
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,160
This is probably why you see the every ghost is in old-timey clothes because they went through like three cycles of this and they're like fuck

1292
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,440
I'm just gonna do

1293
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,480
Fucking suit like what am I what am I even trying to I can't predict this shit

1294
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,440
I couldn't predict it when I was alive. Why the fuck did I predict it now?

1295
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,560
But and then you put on the suit and it's like this is you're good for 25 years, right?

1296
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,680
It's like yeah, and then you look down and your boxers are caught in your zipper

1297
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,640
That's the worst part of being

1298
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,920
The editor of vogue is that you're haunted by a lot of unfashionable ghosts who are like hey, hey

1299
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,820
Hey, hey, say hyper colors back in put it

1300
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,140
Say it's high again. Say it's hyper colors hot again. Say it

1301
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,700
You know coming back pump shoes

1302
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,580
Put the Reebok pumps are back

1303
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,780
Wouldn't you like to go to the ghost clothing store?

1304
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,840
Well, like the guys finds that they're like, did you want to take this out or should we kill it for you here?

1305
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,220
This this poll looks fantastic on you. Did you want us to burn it in front of you or oh

1306
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,340
All right, that's gonna bag

1307
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,820
I

1308
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:25,720
Think that's gonna be the end of the podcast because it's time for another episode of shower bros
