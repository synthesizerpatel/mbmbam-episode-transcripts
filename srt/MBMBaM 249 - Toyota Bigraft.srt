1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,920
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,040
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm your sweet baby, baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And babykins? That's a new thing.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,760
Well, everybody. Blartwatch, Blartwatch is back. I'm on Blartwatch.

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,240
Blarty in the USA. Did we have a maiden voyage for the SS Blartwatch?

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,080
I'm pretty sure we Blartwatched before. This is Blartwatch 2. The game has done

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,320
changed. Second weekend, Paul Blart Mall Cop was in a rough fight for second place with Furious 7.

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,120
It's in the 13 to 14 million dollar range. That's how Blart is right now. It's gonna clear the 40

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,600
million mark. It's domestic total by the end of the weekend, so it's gonna be a big picture,

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
a big win for- And that's on a budget of how much?

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,280
Eight dollars. Kevin James, the whole team stands to gain a lot of money.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
Everybody volunteered for that except for Kevin James and his only stipulation on his

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
writer is that when they were done filming all of his scenes in the movie, they were gonna go

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,080
to yogurt land and he was gonna get a cup of frozen yogurt. Ended up costing eight dollars

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,080
because it was a considerable amount of yogurt. When I saw the billboard for Paul Blart Mall Cop

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:10,320
2 and it said always bet on Blart and I laughed legitimately, a hearty belly laugh, and automatically

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,720
$15 was deducted from my bank account. He got your money on one or the other.

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Yeah, and they were like that laugh ain't free. Now just to check in, you know Blart's not just

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,320
about money, it's also a work of art and I think- A work of Blart. A work of Blart, thank you,

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,200
I left the door wide open for that one. So just do you want to check in real quick, real quick on

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:41,280
what the, what are the critics saying about Paul Blart? Just, just, let's see, Andy Webster says,

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,480
you won't find much offensive in Kevin James's, Rick James's slick innocuous song Paul Blart Mall

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,000
Cop 2. It's, it's, it doesn't believe in the worthiness of its hero, should why, why should

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
we from Kimberly Jones? Kimberly Jones apparently wanting a little more action. A little bit of

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:09,440
pathos sounds like. Pathos for Paul Blart. Very deep, the hero's journey. This is Ivan Morales

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,680
from Cine Premier says, the only thing about, thing that stands out about this film is how hard

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,800
it tries to be an average comedy. Now that review is in Spanish, so in case you're curious how

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,520
Blart is playing with the Spanish-speaking audiences, the answer is not well.

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Wait, it's, wait, its biggest problem is that it tries really hard to be an average comedy,

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,120
like it was a super above average comedy, it's like we gotta tone this down.

35
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,240
Lost in translation here. Mike McHalehill from the Observer in the UK probably has the, the,

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,560
the best review. He says, this isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
The most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts.

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
So it kind of sounds to me like all these reviewers are biased and they're probably

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,160
either being paid off or they're just, you know, they just have sort of a preternatural bias

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
for Big Sandler.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,440
Wait, well, but what if he means when he says it's a fly's fart of a film,

42
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,520
he means really funny to think about.

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Yeah, that's a good point, Travis, I didn't even think about that.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,680
Now, just to, just so we're clear, full disclosure, we do have a, a positive review

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
here from Simon Weaving, who says, no more than an excuse for James to play out his affable

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,440
brand of humor, mixing physical slapstick with verbose running commentary of both grandiose

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
and self-deprecating observations on life and himself.

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
Words too big, too big for Blart, those words are.

49
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,960
See, all the reviews should just be like, at least Native Americans didn't walk off

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
the set of this one.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Paul Blart too.

52
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,640
Yeah, they're ahead of the curve.

53
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,760
Now, a lot of people are, are not critics, you know, a lot of people are just common

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,200
folks, like user Billy Barnett at Rotten Tomatoes, he says, I just saw this last night

55
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
and it's better than the first one.

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,600
These critics are insane, don't trust them.

57
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
The very first response is, having the runs is better than having full on diarrhea too.

58
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm not sure what that means.

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
Wait, hold on.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
I thought those were synonymous, have I been wrong about diarrhea my whole life?

61
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,320
I thought they were, they're apparently different.

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
But I don't get, is he saying that like it's still bad, it's just not as bad as

63
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,120
the first one?

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
Because then the point still holds up, it's still better than the first one.

65
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,240
There is one submitted quote from the film, submitted by Lucas B. five days ago, and it

66
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
is this, it's a Paul Blart line, match.

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,200
Where did all my ham go?

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I swear I left it right here.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,360
I had three hams and now I only have one ham.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
You're going to UCLA.

71
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,960
Wow, okay, is that to himself in a mirror?

72
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,920
That's the iconic.

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,800
Nothing sums up the plot of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 better than the line, you're going

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,760
to UCLA.

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,960
Yeah, going to UCLA.

76
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
4% of critics liked it, 49% of audiences liked it.

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
See, that's my real America.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,560
Let's get into some advice.

79
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Yeah, this is an advice show for the modern era where we don't just monitor the coming

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
and goings of Paul Blart, but we will be bringing you those throughout the show, and throughout

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,040
the show, by that I mean not just this episode, but for the entirety of our show.

82
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,400
We'll continue to follow the actions of Paul Blart, but we also give advice to people.

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,960
So let's do that.

84
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I can't wait until the third Paul Blart where he fakes his own death, and at the end

85
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,400
Alfred just sees him sitting at a Venetian cafe, you know, and they make eye contact,

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
and then he farts really loud.

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
And he farts on a fly.

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,920
He farts and a fly comes out of his butt, and then that fly farts too.

89
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,600
And then it zooms in on his face, and the fly looks right into the camera, and it's

90
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,440
a vignette effect, and it zooms in right on the fly's face, and he goes, you're going

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
to UCLA.

92
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,520
Cut to black.

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
They opened that on your birthday, Griffin.

94
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
Best birthday ever, yeah.

95
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,240
Let's get into the advice.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,200
How was it?

97
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm assuming you went.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,040
It was pretty good.

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,120
I wish the theater wasn't full of people jerking off.

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,720
That was a weird touch.

101
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
Okay, now I will get to the advice.

102
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,760
No more Blart.

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,360
How early is too early to start yard work?

104
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
I live in a neighborhood of garden homes that are fairly close to one another.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't have a large yard.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,160
It still requires regular maintenance, but because it isn't a project that takes more

107
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
than an hour or two at most, I prefer to get in early so I don't spend a whole day doing

108
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:26,880
it.

109
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Sometimes I do this on Saturday, but I usually have at least one free day during the week.

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,720
This is starting to turn into like an SAT puzzle question, okay.

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,280
Because he referenced two days of the week?

112
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,320
Two days of the week.

113
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,680
I don't know when those are.

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,040
So my question is this.

115
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,240
How early can I start while being courteous to my neighbors?

116
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,680
And that's from Terry.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
Well, you got to go door to door, knock on everybody's door and make sure they're not

118
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,200
about to start recording a podcast.

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,920
That is a service that my neighbors do not provide to me.

120
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,720
The good news is that there's never a time that people are happy to hear people doing

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
yard work outside their house.

122
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,200
I've never once heard someone mowing a lawn or using a leaf blower and thought, oh, good.

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,320
Awesome.

124
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Unless your neighbor's dirty, dirty tall grass, hairy, and you get sight that he's

125
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,280
about to, he's dealing with it fucking crazy.

126
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,080
You're just psyched to find out what's in there.

127
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,600
Maybe there's an old tricycle.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Hey, if you see my wallet-

129
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
One of those like turtle sandbox things.

130
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
You guys speak for yourself.

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,040
Every time I hear one of my neighbors revving up their engines, I get out there with a big

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,880
thumbs up and I say, you go get them.

133
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,520
You're doing it next door, Paul.

134
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,960
I knock on their door afterwards and they're all sweaty from mowing and I say, hey, I just

135
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,440
wanted you to know because not a lot of people are going to stop and say it.

136
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
This looks great.

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,360
You did a good job.

138
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,360
And then they look in their hand and I somehow slipped a glass of ice cold iced tea into

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,760
their hand.

140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,720
They don't know how I did it, but that's what being a neighbor is all about.

141
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,920
But there's no, you didn't give them a cup.

142
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
You've just poured a glass's worth of iced tea onto their hand.

143
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
It's actually frozen and I say act fast, then I walk away.

144
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,200
That's good.

145
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
That's what they're doing.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,560
Give them a chore.

147
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,800
Yeah.

148
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,280
I think that 9, 9 a.m.

149
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah.

150
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,640
Wake the fuck up.

151
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
What are you doing sleeping past 9?

152
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,040
What are you what are you doing?

153
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,880
Theresa and I are up like every day at 730.

154
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,840
And I told someone this the other day and they were like, you know, a 28 year old adult

155
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,560
person by all intensive purposes.

156
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,880
And they said, oh, I never get up before 11.

157
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,080
What?

158
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,200
Like, what the fuck?

159
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
What you're missing so much shit.

160
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Nobody.

161
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,880
I don't care how fucking old you are or how late at night you had the previous evening.

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,440
Nobody has any excuse to sleep past the end of the McDonald's breakfast menu.

163
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
If you have slept and then if you wake up and McDonald's is serving lunch, you fucked

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,640
up somewhere.

165
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,360
What if like your baby was up all night like crying and you just got her to sleep and like

166
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,400
you just want to sleep in a little bit?

167
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,960
Like, is that not permissible where you go a little bit?

168
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,120
A little bit a little bit is fine.

169
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm talking not past nine o'clock.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,800
That's crazy, though.

171
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,840
That doesn't make sense.

172
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,560
You have so much life to live.

173
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,160
Yeah, there's so much to do.

174
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
I want to have the energy to do it all day.

175
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Maybe now I'm not speaking for myself, but I'm the one who gets yelled at when our neighbors

176
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
are mowing at 9 a.m.

177
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
My wife wants to sleep in a little bit.

178
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,600
I guess we're getting into a much broader question here.

179
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,800
And that is of, let's say, 16 hours of the day.

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
You got to be up for 16, right?

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,560
And then you get your solid eight and then you're down and then you get you get your

182
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,360
next 16.

183
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
What are the 16 best hours of the day to be conscious?

184
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
The golden 16.

185
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,960
Because I think like I think it's it's hold on.

186
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
Let me map this out real quick.

187
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,160
I want to say it's like 7 to 11.

188
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,560
I see.

189
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
I was going to say 8 to 12.

190
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
8 to 12 is fine, too.

191
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,880
It's close enough.

192
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
But I go with 7 to 11 and I feel like I never miss anything.

193
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
Hey, here's the okay.

194
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
Here's the real thing.

195
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,360
And I guarantee there are some of you listening scientists, inventors, engineers.

196
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
Why haven't we invented a quiet lawnmower yet?

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Like everybody hates the sound of the lawnmower.

198
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,080
Make a quiet lawnmower.

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
I'll step in here, Travis.

200
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,960
They were for a really long time.

201
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,160
There's already one invented.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,520
It's called the manual lawnmower.

203
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,920
Remember?

204
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,560
Remember?

205
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay.

206
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,800
And why aren't we using that anymore, Justin?

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,840
Because it sucks.

208
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,400
It sucks.

209
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,840
It's really, really wicked hard.

210
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,800
Well, then let's make a quiet one that we just pull a switch or maybe something that

211
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,520
does itself.

212
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
We've got robots.

213
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,680
One that does itself?

214
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,880
You mean a goat?

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
Are you speaking about a goat?

216
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,880
Because we invented those a very long time ago.

217
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,760
We took a deer.

218
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,560
We took a sheep.

219
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,080
We said, y'all two, fuck.

220
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,200
And then you did.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,160
And a goat came out.

222
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,040
Y'all want a Yahoo?

223
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,600
Yeah.

224
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,840
I would like more of this goat story, but sure.

225
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
That's all there is to say.

226
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,320
Deer, fuck that sheep.

227
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
And he said, all right.

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm going to enjoy it, too.

229
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,160
Maybe it's an antelope.

230
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,760
Which came from?

231
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,400
Never mind.

232
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,720
This one Yahoo answer was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

233
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Recognize that game.

234
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,400
Take a moment.

235
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Recognize it.

236
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,920
Respect it.

237
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
Appreciate it.

238
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,400
You don't know what you got until it's gone.

239
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,440
For later generations.

240
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Put it away.

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
Don't use it all up.

242
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,840
Thank you, Rachel.

243
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jess, who asks, he's lying to me about boats.

244
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
Boats.

245
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
This is in the singles and dating category.

246
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,160
Jess asks, so my boyfriend for the last few weeks has been talking about buying a boat.

247
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,080
He will tell me about all these boats for sale and their prices and location.

248
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,000
Says he is going to go look at them, but always after that says nothing more.

249
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,120
He is only looking at them on this one site.

250
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
Last night he was telling me about some boat for sale.

251
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,200
I wanted to see it, so I searched for it on the site and it didn't exist.

252
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
I then looked for all the boats he had told me about.

253
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,640
Not there.

254
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,160
My boyfriend does sometimes lie, but I don't know why he would lie about this.

255
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,120
It's so weird.

256
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
But I have noticed he will use these boats as an excuse when I'm supposed to see him.

257
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
Like I'll say I'm coming over and he'll say he's driving to go look at a boat.

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Oh, I wish you had called 10 minutes ago.

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,880
I know it's appointment to go see a boat.

260
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,120
I know I'm supposed to make dinner and I know I promised by totally spaced and made a boat

261
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,620
appointment.

262
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,480
Is it possible he's saying butt?

263
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,100
What?

264
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,840
Like he's searching a website for butt, so he's gotta go see a butt?

265
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,280
To buy and then telling his girlfriend about him in like detail?

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
Does it make any more sense that he's talking about boats?

267
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,320
Honey, I would love to come to your sister-in-law's birthday party,

268
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
but I saw a butt on the internet.

269
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,400
I've gotta get a closer look at it.

270
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
I made an appointment to go buy it.

271
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm thinking about investing.

272
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,320
It's a great market.

273
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
Values are only gonna go up.

274
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,720
Think about the fun we could have with that butt.

275
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,520
It's not just for me.

276
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,480
This is for you and me.

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
This is for both of us.

278
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
You always spend time on the butt.

279
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,000
Remember when you used to tell me that the happiest times you could remember were at

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,800
your grandma and grandpa's lake out on their pontoon butt just zipping around.

281
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
Remember I'm trying to recreate that for you.

282
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,960
This is wonderful.

283
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,560
This is the perfect crime for getting out of things that this person clearly doesn't want to do.

284
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
There's no way he's gonna get caught.

285
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
One thing I am curious about is this line.

286
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,920
I wanted to see it, so I searched for it on the site and it didn't exist.

287
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,640
Then I looked for all the boats he had told me about, not there.

288
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
What are those?

289
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,120
I work on the web, so I'm very interested in web technology.

290
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,960
I'm very interested in web technology search engine analytics.

291
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,760
I'm really curious about the heuristics she would use to search for these boats to prove they don't exist.

292
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,880
She just searched boats my boyfriend talked about and hit enter and nothing came up.

293
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:10,720
There was a blue one and it had a propeller and he said we could have cool times out on the river.

294
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
Search boat river propeller.

295
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Gotta put in quotes, cool times on the river. No boats available. This is so bizarre.

296
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Maybe I need to put plus signs between it.

297
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,880
What if he is just inventing makes and models of boats to cover his tracks?

298
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,920
I'm gonna go check out a float master 6000.

299
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,840
It's actually the fish getter X.

300
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,600
It's a new model and it got a really good price.

301
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,520
How much? $20, $80,000?

302
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,600
Can't you just picture her clicking through the site trying to find them and one by one as she enters search turns and nothing comes up.

303
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
It's like zooming in on her face.

304
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,720
It's like realization dawns and she can see a Kaiser Sose moment.

305
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
There's no such thing as a Toyota big raft.

306
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I feel like such a fool.

307
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,680
On the bulletin board there's like a Toyota flyer and over here there's a picture of Tom Sawyer on a raft and she starts putting it all together.

308
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
Wait a minute and Mr. Big from Sex in the City.

309
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,440
Hold on, hold the phone.

310
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,320
Hold the phone.

311
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,400
There's no boat.

312
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,960
There's no such thing as boats.

313
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,200
Maybe we've all been.

314
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,440
I've definitely been out on boats before, Travis.

315
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
I have to stop you right there.

316
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Have you?

317
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Oh my god, no.

318
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,280
It was a dream.

319
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
I got a question for you guys.

320
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,480
I just passed the bar exam but one of my best friends from law school didn't.

321
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,640
I know from law school that she's smart and a hard worker but this is the second time that she's failed the exam.

322
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:53,520
Is there a way to talk to her or hang out with her in such that my whole situation doesn't just rub in that she's having problems with this test?

323
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,080
What's the best way to be a supportive friend here that's from credentialed in the Carolinas?

324
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,480
It's just a very hard test.

325
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
Anybody can fail that.

326
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
I could fail that.

327
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,040
Franklin and Bash passed it.

328
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
Who?

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,880
Well, think about it.

330
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,040
Both Franklin and Bash.

331
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,720
I don't know who you're talking about.

332
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,920
You know, from the hit TNT series Franklin and Bash starring Mark Paul Gosselaar and another guy.

333
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,160
Sure.

334
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,800
Wait, wait.

335
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,960
I've almost got it.

336
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,240
Nope.

337
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,800
No, no.

338
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,200
Brecken.

339
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,120
That is the boat of TV shows.

340
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:43,760
I think that if you're looking for a way to support your friend who didn't pass the test you just passed, might I suggest imparting some of the wisdom and knowledge that you used to pass the test you passed to help her pass this test that she wants to pass?

341
00:17:43,760 --> 00:18:01,200
Are we looking at a montage scenario where it's like we're going to do this together and it cuts to sessions of you sitting in what's probably like an old looking library because that's where law stuff is and you're pounding your fist and she's kind of going like, I don't get it.

342
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:12,080
You take off your jacket and you spin the table and you cross saddle it and then you just look at it and you say, so habeas corpus and then it's another shot they've moved on.

343
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
And then there's like one where you're-

344
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,040
And then pretty soon she just nods and you see her scribble down, law, exclamation point in her book.

345
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
I get it.

346
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,600
And then Sean Connery from Finding Forrestal shows up and he's like, you're the new man now, dog.

347
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
You're taking her old place.

348
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,040
I think he's an important part of any montage.

349
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
You're a lawyer now, dog.

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,800
And his last film was an animated movie called Food Fight and I don't think he wants that to be his swan song so he'd probably get back out for it.

351
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:47,760
It's really uncomfortable when there's like a bikini car wash super sexy teen montage and then all of a sudden Sean Connery is there and he's like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

352
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,560
Nice.

353
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,200
Look at it.

354
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
I can both shake it and stir it.

355
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
Watch it spin.

356
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,040
I mean my boat.

357
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,920
Look at my boat.

358
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,160
I possess jam because jelly doesn't shake like this, I think.

359
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
Science has proven that jelly doesn't shake like that.

360
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,640
Do you like how my boat fills out these jean cut off shorts?

361
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
What are we saying?

362
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,880
His boat.

363
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Is the bar exam something you can only take a certain amount of times and like if you fail a third time, you're done?

364
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,640
I think it costs like $25,000 to take so I'm sure there's somebody who's like, oh another stab at it, huh?

365
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,360
Yeah, bring it on.

366
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:33,680
Because at a certain point, like if you fail it, and I'm not saying that she should give up or anything or anyone should give up, but how many times do you fail something like that before you're like, you know what, maybe.

367
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,120
Like this isn't my scene.

368
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,240
Well, what are you supposed to do?

369
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,680
You've already gone to law school, Travis.

370
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,680
You're a lawyer now.

371
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,440
Maybe go to where whoever failed her and just be like, I object.

372
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,880
And then quoted them some laws that they didn't know about that makes your friend pass the test.

373
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,280
If we can get that guy approved officially as Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street, I think we can swing this.

374
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, probably.

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,280
Oh yeah, just hand the judge a dollar and but on it you've written, please make my friend pass the bar exam and he's like, well, it's right there in black and white on the dollar.

376
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,160
I'll allow it.

377
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,720
I'll allow it.

378
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,600
And then everybody cheers.

379
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,800
Isn't it funny how if you give a judge $1 bill, it's moving and if you give him $25,000 bills, it's a federal crime.

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,080
I don't understand.

381
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,760
I don't understand the logistics.

382
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,440
Come on, Obama.

383
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:31,360
I mean, it's with this suggestion, it's one I haven't given in a while, but why don't you tell her to pack her bags and move away and go to a state where the bar exam is super duper easy.

384
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm saying maybe a Florida, probably a little bit easier to pass it down there.

385
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,680
I'm saying maybe definitely a Missouri.

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
Oh, that's an easy bar.

387
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,920
Maybe Montana.

388
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,680
I think there's only 20 people there.

389
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Yeah, Montana, there's like one law and it's don't kill.

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,720
And so that was pretty easy.

391
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
It's pretty easy to enforce it in Montana.

392
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Just get up there, write don't kill on a sheet of paper, hand it to the nearest judge.

393
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,360
Boom, bang, bang.

394
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,840
You're a lawyer.

395
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,200
Do you know why they call it the bar exam?

396
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
Beat the last state lawyer in a fist fight.

397
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,080
Uh-huh.

398
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,760
You know why they call it a bar exam is because there's a bar you have to clear and that bar is going to be at a different height from state to state.

399
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
If you're in New York, fuck that.

400
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
They got billions of laws up there.

401
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
Montana, one law, no killing.

402
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,840
You guys want a Yahoo?

403
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,520
Yes, please.

404
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,200
Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by level 900 Yadru Answers Druid Drew Davenport.

405
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,880
Stumbled through that one.

406
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
My apologies, Drew Davenport.

407
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ronkey who asks.

408
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
That's a great name, Ronkey.

409
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,280
Ronkey asks, how do I make myself have a sex dream?

410
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
I love having sex dreams.

411
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,480
No, I think they are better than the real thing.

412
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,240
But they happen so rarely.

413
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
I want to have a sex dream every night.

414
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
How do I force myself to do this?

415
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,200
You know, but if you have a sex dream every night, you'll start to really look forward to the dreams where like your teeth just fall out.

416
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
After your teeth fall out, do you do some weird oral stuff?

417
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,160
I hope that's in the question and not coming from my baby brother's mouth.

418
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,560
Wait a minute.

419
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,120
Yeah, sorry.

420
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,000
That came from the internet.

421
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Couldn't every weird dream just be a prelude to...

422
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
Okay, here's what I'm saying.

423
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
You know all the classic dreams, right?

424
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,440
Maybe they are just...

425
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,640
If we let them play out, maybe they're preludes to sex dreams.

426
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Okay, so all your teeth fall out.

427
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,080
Amazing oral action.

428
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,120
You've got the dream where you're naked on stage at your school auditorium.

429
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,920
That's obvious.

430
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,760
I see an orgy coming, you know?

431
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,560
No, you got it the first time.

432
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, was it right the first time?

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
I see a Ronkey coming.

434
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,360
I see the black suits coming.

435
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Men in black.

436
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,720
What about being chased through an abandoned amusement park?

437
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,360
That's mine.

438
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
It happens, I don't know, three times a week.

439
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah, and then you stop at a roller coaster and the thing is chasing you is gone, and then you fuck that roller coaster.

440
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,240
Okay.

441
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,560
Go for it.

442
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,920
Or you fuck a cotton candy machine, and there it is.

443
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,680
We've all thought about it, and it's debunked.

444
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,880
What if I fuck the cotton candy machine and the roller coaster gets jealous?

445
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,720
That's a good point.

446
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
Wow, you know, the dream where you're flying?

447
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,480
Good news, somebody's about to be touched by an angel in a sexual way.

448
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
In the bathing suit area.

449
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,360
Been a while since I've seen that show.

450
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,920
I do not think that there's a lot of flying, and there's very little lovemaking, if memory serves.

451
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't think Della Reese is like airborne, just like wailing on a guy.

452
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
Just cruising around looking for flesh and meat.

453
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,200
Looking for cloud peen.

454
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,280
Looking for sky boats.

455
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,880
Look at the boat on that one down on the ground, honey child.

456
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm gonna go down there and swoop it.

457
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm gonna swoop that boat.

458
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
Swoop that boat.

459
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,080
My husband was just abducted, was just sexually abducted by Della Reese.

460
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
Again.

461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,040
Again.

462
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,760
God damn it.

463
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,160
When will the cops do something about this?

464
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,800
What are you gonna do?

465
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,440
Bust an angel?

466
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,080
You can't.

467
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
Busted by an angel.

468
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,280
How do you make yourself have a sex dream, though?

469
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
Just stay asleep longer, Justin, is what you're suggesting, right?

470
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,400
When you feel yourself waking up, you edge it.

471
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,480
You hang in there longer, and then the sex will start.

472
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,200
You just gotta wait.

473
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,480
You gotta wait for it.

474
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,120
Can you also not just do a little, oh, what's the thing where you're doing conscious dream it,

475
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,040
where you're in control of it?

476
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
And you can be like, oh, I see where this is going.

477
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,960
And then you just kind of self-edit and jump forward 20 minutes in the dream

478
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,800
to when the sex is going on.

479
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,760
You're talking about time traveling inside your own dreamosphere to get to the good part.

480
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,680
You're talking about a fucking, like, Mr. Skin dream edit is what you're suggesting.

481
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,920
Yeah.

482
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
This is boring exposition.

483
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,760
I want to see some dicks, and I want to see some butts, and I want to see all of it.

484
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,720
I want to see some boats.

485
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,320
I want to see some docks and some boats, if you know what I mean.

486
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,160
I think you do.

487
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:21,520
Yeah, I love skipping the good parts, and that's why I want to go straight to the money.

488
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,760
Want to tell you folks about Pro Flowers.

489
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,320
They are a service that is going to take care of you for Mother's Day.

490
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,160
I actually got a beautiful package of Pro Flowers flowers in the mail.

491
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
They were looking good.

492
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
Lovely vase.

493
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,640
Really nice.

494
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,680
Translucent pink and some beautiful flowers and a box of candies.

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
These are good deals.

496
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,240
You're going to be able to get 100 blooms with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

497
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,040
You can make the day extra special by upgrading to a premium vase and chocolates for just

498
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,880
$9.99 more.

499
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
You got to go to proflowers.com, and you're going to use the code MYBROTHER.

500
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
Teresa and I did this for her mom last year for last Mother's Day.

501
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,520
We used Pro Flowers and sent her the 100 blooms and the chocolates, and she really loved them.

502
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,960
They lasted a long time.

503
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
These flowers stay fresh.

504
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,480
They cut them real fresh, and they put them out before they've bloomed.

505
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
They're still fresh for two or three weeks after that.

506
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
A hundred is a lot of flowers.

507
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,320
They're going to see how many flowers they're getting, and they're going to fucking barf.

508
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,480
If you want to put some in your teeth and tango around like in the movies,

509
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,360
you can do it a hundred times.

510
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,400
Do it a hundred times.

511
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,360
You can do it 20 times before you'd even fucking notice.

512
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,400
You're going to get sick of tangoing.

513
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
That's the Pro Flowers guarantee.

514
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,920
Go to proflowers.com, look for the blue microphone, click on that.

515
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,400
It's in the top right corner of the website, and type in MYBROTHER.

516
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
Go now.

517
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
Take care of this right now.

518
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,160
I also want to thank Nature Box for supporting the show this week.

519
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,240
Nature Box's snacks are all made with zero artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners,

520
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,680
zero grams trans fats, and no high fructose corn syrup.

521
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,080
Get out of here, fructose.

522
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,680
I don't even know what you are, but you sound like science, and I don't trust science.

523
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,480
If you grab, you can go to Nature Box, and you can grab sriracha roasted cashews,

524
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,800
white truffle popcorn, and peanut butter nom noms, or maybe some Big Island pineapple,

525
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,760
or some barbecue kettle kernels, or some Greek blueberry Greek yogurt pretzels.

526
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
I've got these snacks stuck in my head like a beautiful song.

527
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,920
I really like the lemon tea biscuits.

528
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,520
They're real buttery.

529
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,000
I love them.

530
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,560
The Asiago cheese crisps are the greatest snack I've ever had in my entire life,

531
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,160
and that is no smoke up your butts on your boats.

532
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,560
If you want some smoked snacks, I'm sure they got those too.

533
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,760
Just go to naturebox.com.

534
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,680
Check out their selection of vape juices.

535
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,280
Go to naturebox.com slash MYBROTHER, and you can get a free trial box

536
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,960
of their favorite snacks, and then you can pick up some of your own.

537
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,360
I cannot tell you how many listeners have picked up Nature Box, gotten on board,

538
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
and have absolutely adored it.

539
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,360
So go to naturebox.com slash MYBROTHER right now, and get a free trial of your favorite snacks.

540
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,040
I got a message for Sarah, and it's from Jesse, who says,

541
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Sarah! Sarah! Hey Sarah! Happy birthday!

542
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,160
You are the love of my life.

543
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
You make every day better than the last.

544
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,080
Your beauty rivals even the most glorious stallion.

545
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,480
But let's be real, no one is winning that contest.

546
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,680
I hope you had a wonderful day.

547
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,880
You're my favorite person, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

548
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,760
Love, Jesse.

549
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,400
That's the sweetest and goddamn-

550
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,520
Also, I sit three seats behind you in math class.

551
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,480
We've overspoken, but you are the virginal canvas on which I shall paint my masterpiece.

552
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,600
One day our souls shall join together forever and eternity.

553
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Got a message from Mark here from Minna.

554
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,360
Happy birthday, Sarah. That was horrifying.

555
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,040
And you sound like a really great person, but not as great as a horse,

556
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
which Jesse will be the first person to admit.

557
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,960
Got a message from Mark from Minna.

558
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,280
Says, happy birthday, buddy.

559
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,000
And then she said, I'm sorry that Justin misread this,

560
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,400
and it should say happy anniversary, buddy.

561
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
Sorry that he's such a dullard.

562
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,560
What did you say?

563
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
I said birthday.

564
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,880
Living with you has been amazing, even if we still can't wake up in the morning.

565
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,840
So there you go.

566
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,400
What?

567
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Some people don't like to get up in the mornings, Travis.

568
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,040
Are they trapped under some kind of, like, spell?

569
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,200
A bookcase fell on them in the sleeping times.

570
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,520
They could send one email, and this is the one.

571
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,040
Thank you for supporting me through my dumb PhD studies.

572
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,800
I couldn't have gotten this far without you.

573
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm incredibly excited to eat delicious food, travel the world,

574
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
and be disgustingly happy with you.

575
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
Justin, something in the taco voice.

576
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm not aware of a taco.

577
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,720
That's a different brand in our cross-media empire.

578
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,680
Give him a piece of it.

579
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
It'll be cross-promotion.

580
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
Cross-promotion, okay.

581
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,560
I hope you had a fantastic anniversary, darling.

582
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,040
That sounded kind of weird.

583
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,440
Yeah, well, it's hard to get into if I'm not in character.

584
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,840
It takes 15 minutes just to get there.

585
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,360
Edit that out.

586
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
Oh, hey there, everybody.

587
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm Guy Branum, and welcome to Pop Rocket,

588
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,120
a new weekly show picking over the pop culture we all love to love.

589
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,800
With me to talk TV, film, music, and anything else entertaining

590
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,440
are journalist Margaret Wappler, academic writer and DJ Oliver Wang,

591
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,120
digital strategist Wyndham Mitchell, and comedian Santina Muha.

592
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
It's an intellectual and incredibly snark-filled discussion

593
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,560
about pop culture by five cranky Hollywood 30-somethings.

594
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,600
No name-calling, no rudeness, just straight talk and a lot of role play.

595
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm only 30-something for another year.

596
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,080
Me too.

597
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
And I don't tell anybody I'm 30-something.

598
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,720
Pop Rocket comes out every week from MaximumFun.org.

599
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,680
I work at Arby's.

600
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,880
Oh, shit.

601
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,800
I'm not laughing at you.

602
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,200
I'm laughing because now I'm uncomfortable.

603
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Arby's is the-

604
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,400
Experiment's only natural defense.

605
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,520
Arby's is the official fast food partner of my brother and me.

606
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,240
As everybody knows,

607
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,840
we've been working together to create great jokes for many years.

608
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,280
At Arby's expense.

609
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,560
Well, it's more of a-

610
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,480
I think of it as a collaboration.

611
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,920
Arby's keeps me at Arby's and we do Arby's material.

612
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,280
I think Arby's is great.

613
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,360
And I really like the Big Montana.

614
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,720
You're trying to whitewash your Arby's history right now,

615
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,760
and I'm not gonna let you.

616
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,040
Okay.

617
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,080
You've been heinous to Arby's and the people who are employed by Mr. Arby.

618
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
I've never said anything bad about Arby's employees.

619
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,800
I think the real solidly are folks who do a great job working at that restaurant.

620
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,880
And I frequent Arby's.

621
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,720
I'm a frequent customer there.

622
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
Really into the jalapeno hash browns.

623
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,280
Or, sorry.

624
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,840
Justin, just blink twice if there's an Arby's person holding a gun to you right now.

625
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,720
Hash puppies.

626
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,360
Uh, okay.

627
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,320
I work at Arby's.

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,480
Part of my job is to visit guests in the lobby and make sure everything is to their satisfaction.

629
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,040
You apparently-

630
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,520
What?

631
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,360
This is apparently a pilot program.

632
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,200
I'm assuming that experience has never happened to me.

633
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
Oh la dee dah.

634
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,280
Welcome to our bondos.

635
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,120
Cafe Arbando.

636
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,360
Often there are a lot of occupied tables near each other,

637
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,120
and it can get a little repetitive and awkward to say,

638
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,400
hey, how's it going?

639
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Over and over to every guest.

640
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,920
Do you have any tips on how to change it up and be less awkwardly repetitive with my customers?

641
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,280
That's from muddled in management.

642
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,640
If I was doing this, my first thing that I would say is,

643
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,400
hey, you're eating inside an Arby's.

644
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,120
Are you okay?

645
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,920
Is everything going-

646
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,800
How are you doing?

647
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,720
No, like, but really, how are you doing?

648
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
How are you doing?

649
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,120
Hey, it's gonna get better than this.

650
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,480
Certainly.

651
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,120
Are you cool?

652
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,240
Statistically speaking, it's gonna get better than this.

653
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,200
I don't understand why you have to go from table to table, person to person,

654
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
asking each and every person the same thing when you could just yell to the room,

655
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,280
how's everyone doing?

656
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,600
And they all respond in unison, pretty bad.

657
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,480
By a round of applause, I'm greasy on your fingers.

658
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Who here is a sloppy beef boy?

659
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,040
All of you.

660
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,600
I feel like I'm not, I wanna be clear,

661
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm not saying anything negative about people who would eat Arby's food.

662
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,800
I am among those people.

663
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,400
I'm questioning the people who look at Arby's and think,

664
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,360
I gotta get in there.

665
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,960
I hope there's an available table.

666
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
I hope there's no way-

667
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,520
I hope there's a table at Arby's.

668
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,880
Babe, did you make a reservation?

669
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,280
At Cafe Arbando's?

670
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,200
Do you guys remember, actually remember the last time that you ate

671
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,280
physically inside a fast food restaurant?

672
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,160
Do you remember the last time you actually sat down and did that?

673
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,200
Has it been in your, like, adult life?

674
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,640
I mean, on a road trip, probably.

675
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,840
Like, stop at the McDonald's, though, and eat inside the McDonald's?

676
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,760
I mean, sometimes it's dope.

677
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,360
Sometimes they got Wi-Fi.

678
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,400
Sometimes a man comes to you and says,

679
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,920
Griffin, I just wanna check in, make sure you're doing okay.

680
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
Have you experienced a free Wi-Fi?

681
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,040
I say, yes, I have.

682
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,520
And he's like, here, have a pumpkin pie.

683
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,560
I'm like, what the fuck?

684
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,280
It's April.

685
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,280
I've actually had that experience having to wheeze the Wi-Fi off

686
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,680
of my local Fazoli's, which is amazing,

687
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,760
because they'll keep bringing those breadsticks.

688
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,240
They change shifts pretty frequently.

689
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,080
They don't know how long you've been there.

690
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,720
Because people keep biting their fingers

691
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,960
as they hold out breadsticks to them.

692
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,120
Excuse me, sir, would you like a free-

693
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,880
Oh, God, you got the tip of my thumb.

694
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,380
Oh, God.

695
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,260
The turnover rate of Fazoli's is enormous,

696
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,660
and the turnover rate on Fazoli's employees' hands

697
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,620
is even even bigger.

698
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,460
My local Fazoli's has a new policy,

699
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,740
where they don't have someone going around

700
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,780
with a breadstick basket.

701
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,780
You have to go to the counter, hands empty,

702
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,020
pockets out turned, and just say,

703
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,820
hi, I'm a breadstick boy, and I am-

704
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,100
What's this, please?

705
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,860
What's this, please?

706
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,420
Me hungy, I guess.

707
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,620
I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you.

708
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,100
You're clearly working very hard behind the counter.

709
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,180
I just wanted to say, me hungy.

710
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,420
Peas.

711
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,980
Me hungy.

712
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,540
I think that the opportunity

713
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,020
that Question Master has here is great,

714
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,700
because I think this is the kind of scenario

715
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,340
where customers enjoy a little bit of levity.

716
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
They realize the situation's kind of weird

717
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,060
to have the management of Arby's be like,

718
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,860
so you get to come up with different phrases,

719
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,620
and the one that popped into my head is,

720
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,700
how are you enjoying your sandwich journey?

721
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,300
That's a mouthful, though.

722
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,660
I see you're on a beef path.

723
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:41,620
I see you got an extra large diet, Dr. Pepper.

724
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,420
He's my favorite companion on the beef path, too.

725
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,060
You got yourself a little beef sherpa, I see.

726
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,900
Can I offer you any words of encouragement or experience?

727
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,180
Or guidance, perhaps, on your beef journey?

728
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,580
Oh, man, just a few bites left.

729
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,780
You're almost through this,

730
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,620
and then you won't have to be in an Arby's anymore.

731
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,220
You can go home, see your wife and kids,

732
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,620
really think about the choices you've made with your life.

733
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,980
Maybe tomorrow's a new day.

734
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,380
You're almost through this.

735
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,660
Maybe this is the turning point.

736
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,780
You can do this.

737
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,380
I see you're eating our meat stack,

738
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,740
which is a real thing.

739
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,380
What is it called?

740
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,420
Tower of Meat?

741
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,860
They have a thing that's like the-

742
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,620
I've been paying my rent every day at the Tower of Meat.

743
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,380
I think they call it a ham column.

744
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,900
I have worked a lot of different places,

745
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,940
and take it from me, I've tried it both ways.

746
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,380
You will be immeasurably happier at any job you do

747
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,460
if you decide once you walk in those doors

748
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,620
that you are completely sold out

749
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,180
and 100% a huge booster of whatever business you work at.

750
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,460
Nothing puts people, one, at ease more,

751
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,580
and two, sort of like is fascinating

752
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,060
than a person who's like deep into it.

753
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,340
What I'm saying to you is go get to Wikipedia,

754
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,140
read up on some Arby's history.

755
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,300
Are you enjoying that sandwich?

756
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,500
Do you know on this day in 1972,

757
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,340
that's exactly when Jebediah Arby's in 1874

758
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,260
founded the first Arby's in a dirty, unused garbage pit.

759
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,820
He created that sandwich.

760
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,220
Originally it was buffalo beef.

761
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,420
Not a lot of people know that.

762
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,380
Roast buffalo.

763
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,660
Okay, enjoy your sandwich.

764
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,420
I love that.

765
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,300
I think it's a much more fun way to go through your work day

766
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,900
if you decide that you love the place that you work at.

767
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,740
A lot of people in jobs that they don't consider

768
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,300
to be their full-time career for their life

769
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,060
will kind of have a sort of antagonistic relationship

770
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,940
with the places they work.

771
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,460
I'm saying if you decide to make the decision

772
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,220
that you love the place you work at,

773
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,340
it really does immeasurably improve your work day.

774
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,820
When I worked at Best Buy, I was sold out.

775
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,380
Store 573 on top.

776
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,100
That was me.

777
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,660
I was pushing the Best Buy brand in a major way.

778
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,460
So early 20s Justin's philosophy was

779
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,660
don't chase your dreams,

780
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,700
wait for just make your dreams come to you.

781
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,220
It's a very Buddhist way of looking at

782
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,740
minimum wage employment, Griffin.

783
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,300
I am here at Best Buy today,

784
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,060
and today I will love being at Best Buy.

785
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,180
Man, how long did that-

786
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,380
The best of the situation.

787
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,500
Have you ever told the story of when that fire died?

788
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,220
That fire inside you for the Best Buy brand.

789
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,820
Let's see.

790
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,460
Because nothing gold can fucking stay, pony boy.

791
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,860
Every one of these relationships

792
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,700
with a big business you've ever been in

793
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,180
ended with a, we'll say, turmoil.

794
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,420
Well, yeah, at Blockbuster I was fired

795
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,540
for stealing a copy of Fight Club,

796
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,220
which seemed like a very Tyler Durden thing to do.

797
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:46,740
Even though you stole many-

798
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,340
They said that in the exit interview.

799
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:48,740
Yeah.

800
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,980
You stole many other VHS cassettes,

801
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,580
which I will not announce on the show

802
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,260
for fear of embarrassing you, Showgirls.

803
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,260
Now, hey, I had my friend Tommy Red

804
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,540
tape Showgirls off HBO

805
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,900
because we were on vacation when it ran.

806
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,540
You just, oh, and you just stole

807
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,620
a Blockbuster video box and label

808
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,980
for it to make it look official.

809
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,900
Well, I needed the extended version later,

810
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,300
but anyway-

811
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,500
For sure.

812
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,620
Best Buy, I, let's see, how do I,

813
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,420
oh, I was not moving at a pace

814
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,340
that was acceptable to the managers

815
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,300
around the show floor

816
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,380
when they wanted me to go around and hand out-

817
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,900
The cracks were beginning to show.

818
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,100
The cracks were beginning to show.

819
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,620
And they said, when you're on that show floor,

820
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,380
you need to move like your ass is on fire.

821
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,020
And then I said, okay.

822
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
And I moved like my ass is on fire

823
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,900
right out the door.

824
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,700
No notice at Best Buy, just kind of left.

825
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,620
Oh, it's, it's harder if you,

826
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,540
if you prolong it, it's,

827
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,820
when it's real love,

828
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,580
if you prolong the, the split,

829
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,220
oh, it just-

830
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,340
They didn't know what they had

831
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,380
in a young Justin Macro.

832
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,900
They didn't know that I would someday

833
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,580
go on to invent podcasting.

834
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,060
They didn't know that.

835
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,620
Yeah, sure.

836
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,860
God love them.

837
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,500
You guys want a Yahoo?

838
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:57,800
Yes.

839
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,060
This Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

840
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,540
Thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user.

841
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,460
It's not loading.

842
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,940
Let me refresh.

00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,620
It's still not loading.

844
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,180
Pretty cool website.

845
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,060
Make up a name, it doesn't matter.

846
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,220
Germs.

847
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,680
Germs.

848
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,620
Germs asks, butt emergency.

849
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,740
Anyone who knows how to make a butt look hot,

850
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,540
answer this.

851
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,820
Serious answers only.

852
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,220
My senior, my senior year starts-

853
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,900
Gonna have to go out and paint the deck.

854
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,580
Get a fresh coat of paint on the starboard

855
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,380
and port sides.

856
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,180
My senior year starts in less than a week,

857
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,860
and since I haven't worked out for a while,

858
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,780
my butt is starting to look flat.

859
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,540
Does anyone know any butt lifting

860
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,740
and firming exercises

861
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,100
or anything around those lines?

862
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,780
For one week.

863
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,380
Power blast it.

864
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,580
I was just about to say maybe

865
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,580
some kind of alternative means,

866
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,420
like a duct tape

867
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,740
or perhaps some sort of superglare.

868
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,020
How would that-

869
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,540
You can't just say shit, Travis.

870
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
That's my new motto for the show, by the way.

871
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,380
You can't just say shit

872
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,380
and almost always specifically Travis.

873
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,060
You gotta start the tape

874
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,500
at the bottom of the butt cheek, right?

875
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,540
And then kind of lift

876
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,700
and then pull the end of the tape

877
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,580
to your shoulder.

878
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,580
And it's kind of like suspenders for your butt, right?

879
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,420
And that lifts it up a little bit.

880
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,340
Or you just wrap each butt cheek

881
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,580
in some tape to kind of fill it out a little bit.

882
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,500
Now it's going to be uncomfortable,

883
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,660
but we all know that beauty is pain.

884
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,180
Am I right, everyone?

885
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,460
Nothing tastes as good

886
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,860
as butt suspenders feel.

887
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,420
Wait, what?

888
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Butt suspenders one is sweeter

889
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,180
than butt suspenders earned.

890
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,780
Now, Travis, does it lift and separate the butt?

891
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,180
Because that seems to be a big thing for fashion.

892
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,340
Well, it depends on which way you want to go, Justin,

893
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,140
because you could always do

894
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,220
a cross your back kind of scenario, right?

895
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,660
Hot cross buns.

896
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,060
Hot cross buns.

897
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,780
Or you could do it

898
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,620
where it pulls the butt together

899
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,540
making it into one giant cheek,

900
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,860
which isn't popular now,

901
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,340
but I think that if you pay attention in 2016,

902
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,860
we're going to see a big move

903
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,620
towards just one big butt cheek.

904
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,260
Is it just one party that this person's going to?

905
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,140
Is that what's going on?

906
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,420
It's their senior year of high school.

907
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,300
Thanks for paying attention.

908
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,260
The whole senior year?

909
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,460
Just a graduation or?

910
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,340
Their senior year starts in less than a week.

911
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,380
Okay, see, I was going to say,

912
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,500
if it's a prom-like event,

913
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,180
what you can do is buy a new butt

914
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,700
and just leave the tags on it.

915
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,460
And then once you're done with it,

916
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,260
you just return it.

917
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,980
You just return it.

918
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,860
But you got to be careful

919
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,380
because if you spill anything on that butt,

920
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,340
they won't take it back.

921
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,460
Trust me.

922
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,020
I'm looking for a more organic,

923
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,260
healthy option,

924
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,140
like I always am,

925
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,660
for permanent butt perfection.

926
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,060
So like an exercise,

927
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,380
something to really confuse and explode my glutes.

928
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,420
You know in Ace Ventura?

929
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,220
You know that scene in Ace Ventura?

930
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,060
Where he makes his butt talk?

931
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,220
I bet that would be a pretty good workout.

932
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,260
But you're going to have to be

933
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,900
a lot more forceful than Mr. Kerry was.

934
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,540
And the thing is,

935
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,540
you're going to have to go on for a long time.

936
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,260
You're going to have to do

937
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,500
like a staged reading of Dune.

938
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,780
Like the entire Dune series with your butt.

939
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,300
You can't just be like,

940
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,500
let me ask you a question.

941
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,460
That's not going to do it.

942
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,020
You got to start like from the beginning.

943
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,580
Now Justin,

944
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,260
does it have to be a staged reading?

945
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,700
Does the sight of the crowd affect the results?

946
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,740
Well, it's going to help give you the motivation,

947
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,860
not to give up.

948
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:26,260
And now a rare concert performance of Justin

949
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,660
using his butt to read all of Dune.

950
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,140
I will kill him.

951
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,380
Not a drop of rain ever falls on a rack ass.

952
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,620
But let me tell you,

953
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,980
when I read the Liturgy of Fear,

954
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,540
there's not a dry eye in the house with my butt.

955
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,820
My girlfriend and I are embroiled in an apartment hunt.

956
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,140
We found several that suit our needs,

957
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,260
but just a couple of hundo out of our price range.

958
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,900
She proposes we begin negating the leasing agents

959
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,860
in an effort to make them want to lease to us.

960
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,860
And this sounds like an interesting prospect to me.

961
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,900
The question to you is,

962
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,980
how would we go about this?

963
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,540
Do we insult the apartment or the agent themselves?

964
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,820
Is peacocking recommended?

965
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,380
Thanks.

966
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,180
That's from Randy for Rentals in Richmond.

967
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,140
Oh man.

968
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,020
We need to shut this down.

969
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,260
A couple of things to unpack here.

970
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:17,700
First off,

971
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,220
everybody's, you know what?

972
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,340
If you want negging,

973
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,540
I have something for you.

974
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,580
It's called like the world most of the time.

975
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,340
Like don't neg people.

976
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,140
We're all humans.

977
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,900
We're all trying to get through this thing together.

978
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,020
I don't think there's a context

979
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,580
which I would ever neg a human being

980
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,020
about their own situation

981
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,300
that is wholly ineffective and cruel and terrible.

982
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,140
RE peacocking.

983
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,020
You can do that,

984
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,380
but don't have an agenda.

985
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,060
Just do it for you.

986
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,220
I peacock for me all the time.

987
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,340
By which I mean I actually put-

988
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,380
I peacocked 24-7.

989
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,020
I put rainbow feathers in my boat

990
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,140
and I just walk around like that.

991
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,420
If you're going apartment hunting,

992
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,780
bring the peacock along.

993
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,460
Hey, where can my peacock stay in here?

994
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,980
Is this a peacock-friendly apartment?

995
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,380
I doubled down

996
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,340
and my fursona is that of a peacock.

997
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,500
So I'm getting it left and right.

998
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,620
Please don't tell my wife.

999
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,260
My fursona is that of a peacock and I own a peacock.

1000
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,060
So I'm both a human-sized peacock and a regular peacock.

1001
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,180
Yes.

1002
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,700
J-Town, let me ask you a question.

1003
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:17,940
Yeah.

1004
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,700
You have bought two homes now, right?

1005
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,420
Yeah.

1006
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,220
And two peacocks.

1007
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,340
One per home.

1008
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,220
In movies and TV shows,

1009
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,620
they always show people like scheming to walk around

1010
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:27,940
and be like,

1011
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,340
oh, I don't know about this archway

1012
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,940
and I'm not really happy with the door.

1013
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,020
To try to get money knocked off?

1014
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,620
Is that a real thing that real people do in real life?

1015
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:39,700
What?

1016
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,860
The thing is when you're looking at houses,

1017
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,620
you're very rarely looking at it with the person selling it.

1018
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,580
So like your agent-

1019
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,380
That sucks.

1020
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,340
That's shitty.

1021
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,300
Boo to that.

1022
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:49,940
That sucks.

1023
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,220
You call that a bathroom?

1024
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,060
Uh, now, when we bought our new home,

1025
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,140
we bought it for sale by owner.

1026
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,500
So the owner showed us around the place.

1027
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,060
So I did punch a hole right in the guest room wall.

1028
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,340
How much do you-

1029
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,260
Look at how flimsily this is made.

1030
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,420
And you broke your hand.

1031
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,140
This window just breaks right away when I put my butt on it.

1032
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,260
I farted in every room of this house.

1033
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,100
How much of a discount are you willing to offer me?

1034
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,180
I'm just wondering if there's a scenario

1035
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,180
where you'd walk around with the real estate person

1036
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,340
being like, ugh, what the fuck is this?

1037
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,380
Look at this floor.

1038
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,100
Oh, gross.

1039
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,460
This bathtub.

1040
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,980
And they'd be like, well, would you do $1,200 a month?

1041
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,500
I think that you just have a gross misunderstanding

1042
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,700
of how that process works.

1043
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,300
Yeah, none of that is going to be-

1044
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,420
None of that's accurate.

1045
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,220
Also, like in renting, I've rented, I don't know,

1046
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,820
12 apartments in my lifetime.

1047
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,260
A lot of apartments.

1048
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,340
I don't know that I've ever been in a scenario

1049
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,500
where I was able to haggle a price.

1050
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,100
I think they say like, this apartment is $1,200 a month.

1051
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,460
And it's just like, okay.

1052
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,580
Let me ask you a question.

1053
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,700
Do you ask?

1054
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,380
Have you asked?

1055
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,060
Have I ever asked if it could be cheaper?

1056
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,300
Yes.

1057
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,940
You know, Justin, I haven't.

1058
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,980
There you go.

1059
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,500
The invitation was never there.

1060
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,900
They never said like, now what we're asking for

1061
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,900
is $1,200 a month.

1062
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,780
What do you think?

1063
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,220
They specifically say, Travis, you will pay me $1,200.

1064
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,500
I will take that money and it will be mine after that.

1065
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,340
Yeah, I like the straightforwardness

1066
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,860
of this arrangement.

1067
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,300
When I was living in Chicago,

1068
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,060
I shortchanged our landlord by $100 every month

1069
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,220
for six months without realizing it.

1070
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,340
Didn't say shit.

1071
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,700
That's what I call a power move.

1072
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,500
They didn't say shit either?

1073
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,060
No, I don't think they realized.

1074
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,900
It was like the first time they'd rented it out.

1075
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,260
And I don't think they, I don't know.

1076
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,180
Maybe they couldn't count that high.

1077
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,060
I don't know.

1078
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,340
They were really sweet landlords.

1079
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,460
I liked them a lot.

1080
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,540
But I stole $600 from them.

1081
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,500
Thank you.

1082
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,700
It's expensive in Chicago.

1083
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,260
I needed it.

1084
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,820
Could you pretend to be a ghost expert?

1085
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,660
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,940
In which I'm saying you show up your whole persona.

1087
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,060
Maybe your fursona.

1088
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,100
Maybe you're a fox witch.

1089
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,820
I don't know.

1090
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:08,420
Your whole persona is that of like a wizened magic user.

1091
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,500
Somebody who really understands the ethereal point.

1092
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,460
A magi.

1093
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,060
A magi, if you will.

1094
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,740
And you show up and you say,

1095
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,740
this home is pulsing with spectral energy

1096
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,620
and you're not gonna get a dollar over 700 for it.

1097
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,580
Trust me on this one.

1098
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,260
But I will make it my life's goal to,

1099
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,180
I'll go on Yelp and tell everybody

1100
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,540
this is a very, very positive part of it.

1101
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,940
I will Yelp review an individual house.

1102
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,700
I'll make you a deal.

1103
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,700
I wanna write a review for 1019 Washington Boulevard

1104
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,180
real quick.

1105
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,180
I want you in that house.

1106
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,380
And I am a magus.

1107
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,980
And let me tell you, it is pulsing with spectral energy.

1108
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,740
Two out of five would not live there.

1109
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,100
But if you do go,

1110
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,340
make sure to try the Parmesan bread bites.

1111
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,220
They're delicious.

1112
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,820
The previous owner had them in the refrigerator.

1113
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,900
I don't know if they were four guests,

1114
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,140
but I did take them and I enjoyed them.

1115
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,460
I don't know if he's gonna keep putting those in there

1116
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,980
or what's the situation.

1117
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,380
I say you do one better and you say,

1118
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,780
I'm not gonna pay a goddamn cent to live here,

1119
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,100
but I will be the ghost super for the whole building.

1120
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,740
Oh, like you'll help them move on

1121
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,900
or you'll protect the rest of the building from ghosts.

1122
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,380
I think it means like

1123
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,700
if there's a ghost related plumbing issue,

1124
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,540
ghosts get stuck in the pipes and God damn it.

1125
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,260
That's half a clogs that you deal with.

1126
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,940
Plumbers aren't ready for that shit

1127
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,420
because you didn't just knock a stick of deodorant in there.

1128
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,220
No, they're just taking caribous and shy guys and stuff.

1129
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,180
That's actually how rental prices in San Francisco got so bad

1130
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,780
is because they started letting a bunch of

1131
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,100
spectral supers live there

1132
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,860
and then they gotta make that up somewhere

1133
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,780
and you as a non-magic user

1134
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,980
are the one paying the price for that.

1135
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,660
It's government subsidizing.

1136
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,220
Subsidized spectral supers.

1137
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,820
So at the end of the day,

1138
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,260
take some night classes,

1139
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,620
like become a magus,

1140
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,100
be able to like take care of yourself

1141
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,940
and then you can get those discounts.

1142
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,260
I think Matthew Lesko sells a class on it

1143
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,940
if you wanna like I think it's something

1144
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,940
like you could make $10,000 a year

1145
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,860
just by being a ghost super,

1146
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,820
something along those lines.

1147
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,300
Check it out.

1148
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,340
Something like that.

1149
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,060
Open your eyes.

1150
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,780
And your heart to ghosts.

1151
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,020
Man, it's been a while since we talked about ghosts.

1152
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,580
It's like putting on a comfortable pair of jeans from college.

1153
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,740
You talked about Packing Your Bag as a Move Away.

1154
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,300
It's a real classic episode, a lot of hits.

1155
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:27,940
Yeah.

1156
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:28,660
A lot of the hits.

1157
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,060
Thank you for listening to our comedy podcast

1158
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,500
from Brother My Brother and Me.

1159
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,100
If you'd like to see us live,

1160
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,300
you can do just that.

1161
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,860
If you live anywhere near Seattle or Vancouver,

1162
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,540
we're coming there in late August,

1163
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,340
believe the, what is it?

1164
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,180
The 29th and 30th respectively to those two cities.

1165
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,380
We are also going to Portland,

1166
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,500
but tickets to that have sold out.

1167
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,220
If you're in Portland,

1168
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,340
you didn't get tickets to that show,

1169
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,660
come up to see us in Seattle.

1170
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,780
It's not that far of a drive.

1171
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,780
I have to drive that far

1172
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,100
literally every time I wanna see a concert

1173
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,140
with anybody I enjoy.

1174
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,020
So go for it.

1175
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,940
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Seattle

1176
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,340
is the address for the,

1177
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,100
as you may have guessed, the Seattle show.

1178
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
bit.ly forward slash van,

1179
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,460
MBMBAM is the Vancouver show.

1180
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,180
Those are both assigned seating.

1181
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,740
Okay, so don't sleep on that.

1182
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,260
Go get tickets.

1183
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,340
There are still some good seats in Vancouver,

1184
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,780
but you're gonna wanna act fast

1185
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,460
because they are going quickly.

1186
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,780
I wanna thank John Roderick in the long winters

1187
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,740
for the use of our theme song,

1188
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,700
It's a Departure off the album,

1189
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,900
Putting the Days to Bed.

1190
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,940
You can find that album on iTunes or Amazon,

1191
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,220
wherever it is you buy music.

1192
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,500
And again, I just wanna wish great luck

1193
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,660
to John Roderick for his Seattle City Council campaign.

1194
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,860
I hear it's going very well.

1195
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,140
I'm seeing some promising things on the AP wire.

1196
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,660
And this isn't like a bullshit.

1197
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,180
He's not doing this as a publicity stunt.

1198
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,980
No, it's not a goose.

1199
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,900
It's a real campaign.

1200
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,860
He's got some good ideas.

1201
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,900
I'm very excited for him.

1202
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,580
We also wanna add,

1203
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,060
if you enjoyed this episode and past episodes,

1204
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,620
why not hop on over to iTunes?

1205
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,060
Maybe subscribe, rate, review, that kind of thing.

1206
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,660
It'll take you about three minutes.

1207
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,060
And it really helps us in like the iTunes rankings

1208
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,180
and everything like that and bumps this on up the charts,

1209
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,540
which we always really appreciate.

1210
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,140
And it makes us feel good.

1211
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,620
We appreciate your positive feedback.

1212
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,420
There's a ton of other podcasts on Maximum Fun as well.

1213
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,460
If you haven't listened to them,

1214
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,580
if you haven't listened to them, it's all free.

1215
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,100
And it's all terrific programming.

1216
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,260
We all have other shows.

1217
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,100
The three of us played D&D with our dad

1218
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,780
in a show called The Adventure Zone.

1219
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,420
Justin has a medical history show with his wife, Sydney,

1220
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,460

00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,700
And then there's other great shows like Jordan and Jesse Go

1224
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,940
and Stop Podcasting Yourself and Throwing Shade

1225

1226
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,020
and so many other terrific programs.

1227
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,460
It's all at MaximumFun.org.

1228
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,100
We're actually 39 reviews away from 3,000 on iTunes.

1229
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,380
Let's do that this week, guys.

1230
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,500
That'd be great.

1231
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,220
That'd be pretty tight.

1232
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,980

At this point, there's probably only 10 of our listeners

1237
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,580
that haven't already done it.

1238
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,940

It's by Yahoo Answers user, Alexander, who asks,

1247
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,900
is Santa Monica Studios gonna make Kratos kill Jesus?

1248
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,020
I don't want Jesus to die in the future God of War games.

1249
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,060
You Christians agree?

1250
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,540
