1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,480
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me,

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:01,040
I'm that sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media, Luminary Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
Just sounds like you're scatting.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
Do you know who did that?

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,000
Scatman.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
John Williams, that's right.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
John the Scatman Williams.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,080
John Williams, feet the Scatman.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,360
Happy birthday, John Williams, turned 86, still cranking out the hit.

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,800
What is this intro?

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,480
Wow, it is an intro about the Olympics. Folks, the time to sign up for the Olympics

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,920
is drawing close. You don't have much time left if you want to sign up to do an event.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
Some of the events are already ended, so those would be a little tougher to get into.

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,040
Yeah, they can retroactively get you in. Talk to Troy.

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, talk to Troy at the gate.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,760
He's got the red backpack and talk to him and say,

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,440
I want to do the big jump.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,920
And Troy will say, well, they already did the big jump.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,760
And then you say, please.

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
And he says, all right, get up there.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,440
Then you do it the best anyone's ever done it.

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,480
They go and they take the gold medal away from Germany.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,080
And they're like, sorry, Griffin did better at the big jump.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,120
He was a walk up.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,880
And then you tell everybody the story about Troy and Troy is fired.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,760
Because rules are rules, Troy.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
But they can't take your gold away from you.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,960
They cannot take it.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Well, they can take it away from whoever did legally win it and give it to the walk up.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,280
And there's really no time limit.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,800
I actually got Kristy Yamaguchi's gold medal from, what was that?

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Nagano, I think.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
And this was like three weeks ago.

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,520
It's amazing how few people take advantage of all the rules loopholes in the Olympics.

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:37,920
There's a lot.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,880
I was reading a book by Matthew Lesko about all the rules that are just left on the table

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,080
that nobody claims.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,360
If you hold an event in your backyard and call it the Olympics and you win one of the events,

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
they have to give you a gold medal, like an official one.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,680
Did you know that?

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
And then you can just turn around and you shouldn't because it's a nation's pride.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
But you can just go sell that dang thing for probably like 200 bucks.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
No problem.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,040
Did you know that you can go and compete in the Olympics as your own sovereign nation?

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,000
Now, here's the thing.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
Let me be clear.

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
It's not as easy as it sounds because you do have to establish your own government

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,600
and your own Magna Carta or declaration or what have you.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,720
It does have to be recognized by the UN.

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,840
But you can just go and be like the nation state of Griffin and just compete as Griffin.

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
I've been thinking a lot about what event I want to do this year

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
because I did miss the big jump and it's such a hassle finding Troy

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,680
because sometimes he doesn't have the fucking backpack on.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
And I think I might do Tony Hawk's downhill jam.

61
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,440
And this is his new event that he has going on based on the very good 2006 video game.

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,920
And it's sort of a mix of jump, ski, slalom, stunt.

63
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
And then halfway down, there's a half pipe.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
And then at the end, you withdraw the rifle you've had on your back the whole time

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,320
and you shoot some cans out of the air that Tony Hawk throws up there for you.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,960
I love it.

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,480
That's interesting.

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm going to be-

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Oh, also you have to cross country ski to the top of the hill,

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,360
but that's not really part of the race.

71
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,640
That's just to get there.

72
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:22,880
Right.

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm actually going to be speed running Taboo the sixth sense for the NES.

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,680
Interesting.

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah.

76
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,560
And that's a tarot card simulator, so it's not necessarily going to be competitive.

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,640
I guess you have to wait for the medals to be distributed in the coming years

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,720
as you see who's reading of the cards was the most accurate.

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
Right.

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,560
So it takes a while to get it, but it's an investment.

81
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
And it's so subjective, the scoring on that one.

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,160
I feel like I'm always getting boned.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
That's why I like the downhill jam.

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,120
It's just me, my board, my cross country skis, my guns, and Tony's cans.

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,200
I think this time, my wife and I have been training,

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,040
Teresa and I have been training really hard in the competitive couples asynchronous napping.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,360
Yeah.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,440
Where it's like, I'm going to nap now and then I'll get up

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,080
and I'll take care of the baby and then you can nap.

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,040
Yeah, and the longer you can spread that out, the better that is for you.

91
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I thought I was going to end up on the podium

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,240
because I went down at like 9am one day, early nap.

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
And Rachel didn't nap until 11pm.

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,600
And what happened?

95
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
I didn't win anything.

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,520
Travis, thanks for fucking rubbing it in.

97
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
Well, you started the story.

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
Yeah, I know.

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
And then I didn't have an ending for it.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,760
And I didn't think anybody was going to call me on my bullshit, but here we are.

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,440
I might also do curling.

102
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Yeah.

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,160
Yeah, I forgot that this occurred until this is kind of a persistent delight

104
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
that pops up every time the Olympics comes around,

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
is that there's one called Skeleton, which is fun.

106
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,040
There's like bobsled and downhill alpine and skeleton.

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,120
That's just like xylophone playing, but it's your own ribs.

108
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Yeah, right.

109
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
You got to play your own ribs.

110
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,880
No, what's great about it is it's basically like bobsledding,

111
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,960
but it's the tiniest possible sled.

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah.

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,880
So it's like this heightened awareness of like,

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,040
yeah, I will just name it after the thing that I'm going to destroy as I'm going down.

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,760
Somebody looked at bobsled and said, not dangerous enough.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,200
Well, I have this luge.

117
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,840
No, no, no.

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
I want to be a centimeter off the ice with nothing around me.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,560
I wanted a sport where if I sneeze while I'm doing it, I will perish.

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
That sounds very, very fun to me.

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,720
Hey, I thought of a really fucking good parody song this morning

122
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,160
while we were watching the Olympics.

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
Can I tell you it?

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,400
Yeah, please.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,880
It goes like, so I'm a parody-dor.

126
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm a lusher, baby.

127
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm a lusher.

128
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm a lusher.

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,880
Sorry, the microphone I have sometimes has trouble with the quality and fidelity.

130
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,600
So I'm worried that you're hearing it and you actually think I'm doing a Pitch Perfect version

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,960
of Beck's loser.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
But instead of saying loser, it's lusher.

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
And then what's the next line?

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
So why don't you thrill me?

135
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,000
Because you're so excited to be out there.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
So Al, get at me.

137
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Al takes our calls.

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
He was in our TV show.

139
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm assuming he would take our call, right?

140
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
I have to imagine.

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Hey, brothers, I have a moral dilemma.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
I was talking to Al Jarreau, actually.

143
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
He's getting into the game.

144
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
I think he passed away.

145
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
Let your losing down.

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Let your losing here to stay.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
Make it easy, easy.

148
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
Let your losing down.

149
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
Hey, brothers, I have a moral dilemma.

150
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,400
You don't get to do your Al Jarreau enough.

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,640
My fucking dope ass Al Jarreau.

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm so glad.

153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
I need 393 episodes.

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
You can hide your light under a bushel.

155
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,480
To finally get to do my fucking great Al Jarreau.

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm just so glad.

157
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
It has brought such a tickle to my heart

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,520
that you were able to do your Al Jarreau finally.

159
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:19,920
Yeah.

160
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,200
We lost Al Jarreau, oh my god,

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,320
exactly one year upon you hearing this.

162
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
Holy shit.

163
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,640
It's exactly one year ago.

164
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,840
What a touching tribute we've been able to have.

165
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
This is our touching accidental tribute to Al Jarreau

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,480
who is very good at singing.

167
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,160
Hey, brothers, I have a moral dilemma.

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
I have been debating whether or not

169
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,040
to put a Nintendo Switch on my wedding registry.

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,240
My fiance is on board as she is the one who suggested it.

171
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,280
So nobody's there.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,520
My problem is that I feel if people see an expensive toy

173
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,040
on there like the Switch,

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
they'll feel we really don't need anything

175
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
and not give us as much presents.

176
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm sadly against putting one on for this reason.

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Am I making too big of a deal out of it?

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
That's from fiscal fiance.

179
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
You can work around this just by asking

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,360
for like a $250 GameStop gift card on your registry,

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
although I don't think that necessarily skirts this dilemma.

182
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Could you ask for a gift card for an exact price of the Switch

183
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
for like Target or Walmart or something?

184
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
There's other places you can, yeah, for sure.

185
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
I mean, you know me, I'm brand loyal.

186
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,280
Once you're in the fuck, once that GameStop.

187
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,880
Once you're in the fuck.

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
Once you're in the what?

189
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,720
You said once you're in the fuck and then you stopped.

190
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
Once you're in the fuck of GameStop.

191
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,840
I'm just saying once you're in the fuck,

192
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,040
I can't really get out.

193
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,400
Hey man, I'm at GameStop.

194
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Well, how's it going?

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
I'm deep in the fuck.

196
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
It's brutal over here, man.

197
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
Way down deep.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm just saying, you sling enough reservations,

199
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,600
you sling enough Game Informer subscriptions,

200
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
you can't just get that out of your blood, you know?

201
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
I mean, I did legit last night have a dream

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,840
where I worked at Best Buy again.

203
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
I have that about once a week.

204
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah.

205
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,280
I haven't worked at Best Buy since 2008.

206
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,360
It has been a solid decade.

207
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
It's the lunar cycle, bruh.

208
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
Those blue shirts coming.

209
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,080
So you could say that your dream is to work at Best Buy again.

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Literally.

211
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,520
No, it's often an anxiety dream.

212
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
I got you.

213
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,800
In which everything has gone wrong

214
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,320
and I've had once again to turn to the big blue embrace.

215
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes, I think it's fine to do a cute one on your registry,

216
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,360
wedding or baby or what have you,

217
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
because a lot of times I look at somebody's registry

218
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
and I think, God, I don't want to get them something so poor.

219
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Like this is all so poor.

220
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Even though I'm not getting it,

221
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,080
it bores me to like look at the page and think about it

222
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,680
and then click it like, oh yeah, you can steam all your shirts.

223
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,080
Every time you steam a shirt, you could think of me.

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,320
No, just like, but like switch and be like,

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,840
hey, that's fun, thank you, looks like a fun gift, I'm excited.

226
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Most of it feels so perfunctory.

227
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,280
Like you see like a thing for like, oh, we need nipples.

228
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
And it's like, I can get you nipples.

229
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,080
And that point is just like, yeah, I got you some rags.

230
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,320
And I know you need, and that's not a joke,

231
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,000
you need hundreds and hundreds of rags for a baby,

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
not so much for a wedding.

233
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,400
I forgot what the question was about.

234
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
But if I see a switch on there,

235
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,480
I know that if you were, that's the only thing on there

236
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
that you really want to get.

237
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
The other stuff you need to get.

238
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,440
And I think I would be, I mean,

239
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
I'd probably want to split it with some folks

240
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
because it would probably be one of the more expensive items

241
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,960
on the list.

242
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,560
But like, I would know that I'm getting you something

243
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
that you're going to be very excited about,

244
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
which is like the point of gift giving.

245
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
I do understand this question though,

246
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
because like I have encountered this many times in my life

247
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
where someone will say like, so what do you want?

248
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,840
What can I get you?

249
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,600
And you say something like, you know, pretty out there,

250
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,880
pretty like, I'll tell you what I want.

251
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,840
What I really, really want, a couple of chia pets.

252
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,880
And they're like, no.

253
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
And I'm like, oh, that was what I wanted.

254
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,960
But I guess you know better.

255
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
I think the switch is also helpful here

256
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,840
because it is such a strong experience for two players.

257
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,880
Anywhere that you and your new spouse are out and about,

258
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
you can enjoy some Puyo Puyo Tetris

259
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
or what have you, some Superclips.

260
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
There's the Dr. Phil marriage counseling game.

261
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
That one's really hot.

262
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,760
It's rated M.

263
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Who will let go first?

264
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
It's rated M for mature

265
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,280
because of just all the cussing that Dr. Phil does.

266
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
You gotta fucking love each other.

267
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
I don't know what Dr. Phil sounds like.

268
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh man, I know it's gonna fix your marriage.

269
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
I've got it all figured out.

270
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,640
You gotta plug in the Yoshi amiibo.

271
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,240
Mini games.

272
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Do you know on the back in the day

273
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,600
when we were trying to get this show going,

274
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,840
I made business cards for my brother,

275
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
my brother and me that I left all over town.

276
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,600
And it had a web address where you could listen to the show

277
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,600
and it had a quote ascribed to Dr. Phil.

278
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,520
And the quote was,

279
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,960
it's like listening to three invisible Dr. Phils.

280
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,200
That was my, I said, I did that.

281
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,520
And I was like, good enough for a business card.

282
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,440
Let's go ahead and get 500 of these

283
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,040
and get the word out about this show.

284
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,840
And I guess you look at us today and I guess it worked.

285
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,440
So what I'm saying to you is do exactly that.

286
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
I showed a friend that business card

287
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
and they expressed concern that he might sue us

288
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,280
for attributing a quote to him that he did not say.

289
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,480
And my response was, can you think of the publicity?

290
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,280
How amazing would that be?

291
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,440
Yeah, the best possible thing.

292
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
I didn't put this switch on your registry.

293
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,760
I think it's fine.

294
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,400
I don't think, and if anybody sees this and says,

295
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,840
well, I'm not gonna get them a present,

296
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,120
you uninvite them from the wedding

297
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
because they sound like a real square

298
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
and it sounds like they hate Mario and his brother Luigi

299
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,240
and their best friend Yoshi.

300
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,280
Do you think Yoshi is equal best friends

301
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
with Mario and Luigi?

302
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,520
Or do you think it's the kind of thing

303
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,920
where like Mario is friends with Yoshi first

304
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
and like, yeah, he gets along with Luigi,

305
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
but if push came to shove, you know whose side he'd be on.

306
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Okay, who is Mario's better friend, Luigi or Yoshi?

307
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
Let's take a moment and think about this.

308
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
Oh shit, or Toad.

309
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
Where does it fall, okay.

310
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,520
Toad is not, Toad is nobody's friend.

311
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,920
Toad is tolerated because they need him around harvest time

312
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
to pull all the onions out fast.

313
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,480
If Mario is the Vinny Chase of the Mario World entourage,

314
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
yeah, absolutely, I'm not doing this with you.

315
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Then I think Luigi's drama, right?

316
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,200
Cause they're brothers.

317
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,720
You're saying Luigi's like the heat

318
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
that everybody's all in demand for.

319
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,520
That's Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, Mario's Vinny.

320
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,320
Johnny Drama, his older half-brother

321
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,440
who once had a TV show, but now is in demand.

322
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
Oh, can Bowser be turtle?

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
No, I think Bowser would probably be.

324
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
He looks like a fucking turtle.

325
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,640
Might be Paramy Jivins.

326
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,160
Can we not have Paramy involved in this project?

327
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
I don't think Paramy's in this project.

328
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,880
No, Paramy's fine.

329
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,360
He's in the Bizarro version of Jeremy Piven?

330
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,080
Awesome, dude.

331
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,400
And so then the question is, is Toad E or is Yoshi E?

332
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,160
I think Yoshi would be E and Toad would probably be turtle.

333
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
I'm just gonna start reading the next Yahoo.

334
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,040
But don't you think-

335
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,480
And Travis can continue going.

336
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,400
And the cross talk will be unbearable.

337
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,640
But here's one-

338
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,840
But then who's the director guy?

339
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,000
From Merritt Palmer.

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,280
Thank you, Merritt Palmer.

341
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,560
It's from Yahoo Answers User Collection who asks-

342
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
Walsh might be Waluigi?

343
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
How to get Pac-Man dots off monitor.

344
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,440
These, and then a bunch of periods.

345
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,840
I want to eat these.

346
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,920
This is a great point,

347
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,280
as long as we're gonna talk about video games

348
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,240
a whole bunch this episode.

349
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,240
I have a trouble playing Pac-Man's little quest

350
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,400
that he goes on, and Ms. Pac-Man.

351
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,120
Sometimes, Griffin, I can't tell if you're still reading the Yahoo

352
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
or if we've spiraled into Griffin's brain now.

353
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,760
No, we're in here, in here in my mind.

354
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,280
Because I watched the Pac-Man eat all these dots

355
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
and I'm excited for him,

356
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,400
but you do it enough and you start to get jealous

357
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
because you start to wonder what do they-

358
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,040
What do they taste like?

359
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,840
What do they taste like?

360
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,440
What is the texture like?

361
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,920
How is he not, is he not getting full?

362
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
I've made him eat so many of these dots.

363
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Are they not filling?

364
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
Are they like little pop chips?

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,360
I always assumed they were like corn pops,

366
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,640
like the cereal corn pops.

367
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,160
That's what I imagine they tasted like.

368
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,240
You get jealous from seeing the dots

369
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
and then soon that turns into anger

370
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,560
and then you just run Pac-Man right into those murderous ghouls

371
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,080
just so he can feel this thing of death

372
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,160
and you can feel some sort of release

373
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,440
from this cycle of jealousy that you're stuck in.

374
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,200
You don't know how to get to the dots,

375
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,520
but at least you know Pac-Man is not going to eat them all

376
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,800
before you figure it out.

377
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,640
Right, you need to leave those dots.

378
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
Do you think the dots are maybe

379
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
like some kind of prescription medication

380
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,400
that Pac-Man has to take?

381
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,280
I cannot imagine a dosage, a doctor in the world

382
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,440
that would prescribe a dosage that's just like

383
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,160
as many as you can eat before the ghosts kill you.

384
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,280
Can I ask a question?

385
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,340
Yeah.

386
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,400
Can I do a smash on the monitor to get the dots out?

387
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,320
How do you mean?

388
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,080
Think of the arcade cabinet for Pac-Man.

389
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
Okay, slow down, slow down.

390
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
Okay, you have start button, you have coin slot,

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
you have Pac-Man move stick,

392
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
and that's more or less it,

393
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,680
and then you have the art and you can't eat that,

394
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,520
and then you have the monitor

395
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,840
and that's where the game lives inside of that.

396
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,340
Yes.

397
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,160
And it just seems like if this person wants to get the dots off monitor,

398
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
you need to get in the monitor somehow.

399
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,800
So if you wait, and I think you do it at the beginning of the level

400
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,880
when there are the most dots and the fewest ghosts,

401
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
because that's the problem.

402
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,640
You can do a big smash right on the monitor

403
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,040
and get all the dots out and be careful of the ghosts.

404
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,840
That's the only problem I plan as I'm seeing it right now.

405
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,040
If I smash up the monitor with my big fist and then I get those.

406
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,160
If you wreck it.

407
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
Yeah, and I get those dots out,

408
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
are the ghosts gonna get me?

409
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
Is Pac-Man gonna get you?

410
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
If I was Pac-Man, I'd be very upset that you did that

411
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,200
and took my dots away.

412
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Yeah, you got into this natural environment

413
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,560
and you took his food away, and Pac-Man's a big wild beast.

414
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,040
You know, fuck, I've been watching a lot of Blue Planet

415
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,560
and you make an excellent point, Gervin,

416
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,320
in that yes, Pac-Man wants to eat the dots,

417
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
but the ghosts want to eat Pac-Man.

418
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,920
I should be rooting for the ghosts here.

419
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,000
It's the circle of life.

420
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,560
Yeah, those ghosts have to eat and obviously they didn't

421
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,080
and that's why they already died.

422
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,520
And we should even talk about the fact that

423
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,160
how did Pinky and Blinky and Inky and Stinky and all them

424
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,400
get killed in a terrible passion?

425
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
Then the game never really explores that.

426
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,360
Like they were just like-

427
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,760
They're actually the ghosts of every Mario and Luigi

428
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,840
who's died in a Mario game.

429
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,400
Whoa.

430
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Whoa, damn.

431
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,840
Yeah, crossover.

432
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,640
Hank, big news.

433
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
I don't wanna talk about Pac-Man anymore.

434
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
What about, but I didn't even get to my whole thing

435
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
about Adam Sandler's pixels, Justin.

436
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,040
I didn't even get to talk about pixels.

437
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,320
Isn't you say that?

438
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,760
Doesn't that cover it?

439
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,260
Yes.

440
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
Back when I was about seven, I was at a dinner in my hometown.

441
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,320
Just the one in in there.

442
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,600
One more again.

443
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
Back when I was about seven, I was at a diner in my hometown

444
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,280
and I was enjoying a crisp tasty water with a lemon wedge.

445
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey folks, this is a quick break from me to you.

446
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
When you get a drink at a restaurant,

447
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
even if you're getting a soda,

448
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,120
go ahead and ask a lemon wedge in there.

449
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
You're gonna be shocked at how much that spices up

450
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,120
that cola or water.

451
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
It's a real treat.

452
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,560
And sometimes it may look a little funny

453
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,440
if you ask for it with that coke,

454
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,640
but trust me on this one.

455
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,840
I remember taking the lemon wedge out, tasting it

456
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
and saying to no one in particular,

457
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,720
I love lemons.

458
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,920
A complete stranger leaned over to me and said,

459
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,880
if you eat too many lemons in a day, you'll die.

460
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,560
And then turn back to their meal.

461
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,200
To this day, I can't enjoy a nice lemon

462
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,680
without the thought of imminent death looming over me.

463
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,800
Why did this complete stranger say this to me?

464
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,480
What do they know that we don't?

465
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,240
And how can I finally get back to my pre-lemon fearing days

466
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
and that's from lemon dread.

467
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
The thing about it is,

468
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,680
if you eat too much of anything, you'll die.

469
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,280
Because how are we defining too much?

470
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
And I would submit it's the number it takes to kill you.

471
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,680
Like that's too much lemons would kill you.

472
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,080
So yes, but too much of like waffles.

473
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,480
Not me.

474
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,720
Serrano peppers, marmalade.

475
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,920
I could eat a million lemons and not-

476
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
You could eat a million lemons.

477
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,600
How many lemons?

478
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,920
Okay, do you think you could eat enough lemons

479
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,320
to kill you before you passed out?

480
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,160
This is a weird line that I don't know

481
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,840
necessarily what to explore.

482
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,640
This body horror, this seven-esque gluttony.

483
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
Man of earth's fears.

484
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,340
Yeah.

485
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,740
What?

486
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
Okay, this person said this

487
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,840
to plant a flag in your memory with their face on it

488
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,480
so that one day you would write into an advice show

489
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
and talk about this strange thing

490
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
that they said to you one time.

491
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,720
They are your constant.

492
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,800
They are a performance artist is what they are.

493
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
This is a very-

494
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,120
You are their most successful exhibit

495
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,000
because I don't think you need to worry about eating a lemon

496
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,800
and passing away from it.

497
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,440
I literally don't know what else to say about this question.

498
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,160
Do you guys-

499
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,800
Do you have any memories from childhood of someone-

500
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,000
I remember once, so I took Ritalin

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,400
and then later different versions of ADD medication growing up

502
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
and I remember once a health teacher,

503
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
mind you, now this is at the time when health teacher

504
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
was synonymous with gym coach,

505
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,280
but a health teacher telling me in elementary school

506
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
because I took one of my pills without a drink,

507
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,160
told me that if I continued to take pills without a drink,

508
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,920
it would get stuck in my throat and give me throat cancer.

509
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,920
How did that-

510
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,640
Wow.

511
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,800
That's a good health teacher.

512
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Yeah, that's maybe the worst possible subject teacher

513
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
to tell you that falsehood.

514
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes.

515
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,840
This is the same health teacher I believe that

516
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
because I used to write notes on my hand in ink

517
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,800
that I would get ink poisoning.

518
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,760
Hand cancer.

519
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
I would get hand cancer.

520
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,400
Sort of a one arrow in their quiver it sounds like.

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,040
I wish you had told me how you responded to this person.

522
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,280
That's the thing I really want to know from this story

523
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,120
because if somebody told me this,

524
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,160
I think I would just try to make myself as small as possible

525
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,000
until the situation resolved itself.

526
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,000
They probably react in the same way every child does

527
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
appropriately when a stranger talks to them

528
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,840
and it's silence and returning to your business.

529
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,160
People got to be careful what you say to kids.

530
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,200
They remember once I was at Bob Evans farm

531
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,160
and an old man-

532
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
Once I was at Bob Evans farm-

533
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
You have to start that thing and take a run up to this thing.

534
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,760
I got to start over.

535
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,720
I lost my mo.

536
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
I once was at Bob Evans farm

537
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,680
and an old man couldn't get his change

538
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,800
out of the soda machine.

539
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,080
And I went over and I was probably 10

540
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,240
and I went over and I helped this old man.

541
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
I got his change out and I handed it to him.

542
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,640
And he said, thanks young man.

543
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,920
I'll dance at your wedding.

544
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,760
And I was like fucking so tripped out

545
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,480
for the rest of the day.

546
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Like, what does he know that I don't?

547
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
Why would he say this to me?

548
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,520
How will this old man find me?

549
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
How will he know I'm getting married?

550
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
I didn't give him my name.

551
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,680
How will he notify me?

552
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,600
And for, I would say like, I mean, I remember,

553
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm 37 years old now.

554
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
I remember this moment like with perfect clarity

555
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,720
where I was when this adult said this weird shit to me.

556
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Can we please just like say normal things to kids

557
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,280
and reduce our idioms and our metaphors

558
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,240
when talking to children?

559
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
Did he turn into a beam of light after he said that

560
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
and shoot into the heavens?

561
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,520
No.

562
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
Did you see him at your wedding?

563
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Drank his, drank his cherry Coke.

564
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
Oh, he would have been long dead.

565
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
He was an old, old man

566
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
and I was not married for two decades later.

567
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
So I'm sure.

568
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,760
Okay, but be honest with me for a second, Justin,

569
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,280
for a second on your wedding day,

570
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,280
if you look, 100% guaranteed, no question,

571
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,400
this is also another vivid memory

572
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
is being towards the end of the ceremony

573
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
and having the fleeing thought like, huh, didn't see him.

574
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,440
All right, well, enjoy your change, I guess.

575
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,160
And then Sydney transformed.

576
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,760
Yeah, my crane, why?

577
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,600
Is it?

578
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
That's what that song is about.

579
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,400
Is it a possible, I think maybe just,

580
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
definitely don't talk to a strange child

581
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
who says something at a restaurant

582
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
in the booth behind you.

583
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,480
Like, I love lemons.

584
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,280
That was the thing that activated this person's mind

585
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,800
to say like, my turn to speak.

586
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,920
Like, that's wild.

587
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,560
We were at a grocery store yesterday

588
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,800
and they had a cart at the front that had,

589
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
I had never seen these before.

590
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,840
They had a two, like a plastic seat in the front

591
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
so that you could strap two kids into.

592
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,000
It elongated it by about a foot and a half.

593
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,040
So piloting it is a utter disaster.

594
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,240
And it's designed for two children,

595
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
but Charlie saw it was like, hell yeah, yeah, absolutely.

596
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
I think I'm gonna ride in that weird carnival shopping cart.

597
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
And we didn't want to

598
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,480
because they're miserable to push around.

599
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
And also she's one child

600
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
and I couldn't deal with the pressure

601
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,000
of people looking at me like, huh, two seater for one kid.

602
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,800
Interesting.

603
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,080
So we were arguing with her for,

604
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
it felt like about three hours trying to get her out.

605
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,720
And this other woman who had a daughter

606
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
roughly Charlie's age leaned over to Charlie and said,

607
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
actually that one's got a flat tire.

608
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,560
And that worked instantly.

609
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,680
And that woman is my true homie for life.

610
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,120
I tried to give her a blood debt

611
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,680
and she was, I didn't know exactly how it worked.

612
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,440
So I ended up just kind of walking away.

613
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
But like, I will never forget this person.

614
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,280
And that is a rare instance where like,

615
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,680
maybe this person of what I'm getting at

616
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,800
is maybe this person saw something on your parents face

617
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,120
where it's like, again with the fucking lemons.

618
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
This kid always eats lemons and it's so weird.

619
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
And the person at the other table was like,

620
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,160
no problem, I have got your back.

621
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,800
But they didn't.

622
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Let me take care of this one for you.

623
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
I have just the right thing to say.

624
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,520
And then they went back to their home

625
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,800
and they looked in the magic mirror

626
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,080
and they said, am I free yet?

627
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
Am I free from the curse?

628
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
Have I saved another child?

629
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,960
They went back to their orange farm.

630
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
It was like, fuck yeah, I did it again.

631
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,440
Another one.

632
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,680
No, we got another one guys.

633
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,760
We're gonna be king of citrus mountain before you know it.

634
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,800
Are you saying that oranges and lemons

635
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,560
are competitors in some way?

636
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,200
They occupy two completely different

637
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,440
sort of eating experience fields.

638
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,960
What I'm saying is if the custom was to have an orange slice

639
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,040
on top of every fancy drink you ever had,

640
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,120
that'd be a pretty good day for the orange people.

641
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,560
We've got blue moon.

642
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,760
How do we expand?

643
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,760
We could get into water.

644
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,640
No, everybody knows what goes, wait, yeah?

645
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
I've got an idea.

646
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,840
What if little guerrilla marketing.

647
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,040
Yeah, we tell people.

648
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,880
I go from soda fountain to soda fountain

649
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
just yelling that lemons are bad.

650
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
Yeah, it sounds a pretty good idea, Mark.

651
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,760
Get out there, Mark.

652
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,560
Get out there, Mark.

653
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,920
You start and we'll follow you.

654
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,800
Grassroots, Mark.

655
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,160
Street team.

656
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,880
You're gonna take a quick break now.

657
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
Get our duckets in a row.

658
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,280
That's not saying, anyway, it's somebody's-

659
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,920
I liked it though.

660
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,360
It was almost a turn of phrase.

661
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah, I want to tell everybody all about me on these me on these.

662
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,360
They make underwear for TMI, man.

663
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah, I don't get it.

664
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,760
Yeah, what's TMI?

665
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,240
Too many ideas.

666
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,760
So that's worse.

667
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,880
That's worse.

668
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,960
Yeah, so no, no, no.

669
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
Hold on now.

670
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,360
Give us another one.

671
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,160
We got to move on.

672
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,200
We got to move on too many.

673
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
And I don't want to have to do another make good like last week.

674
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
Me on these offers the just the most comfortable underwear of all time.

675
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,400
They also offer matching pairs, which are a unique fun gift for you and your Valentine

676
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,400
or you and your whoever your best, best bud.

677
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,360
You and your boss.

678
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,880
No, no, your boss.

679
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
No, no, no, your principal.

680
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,560
They are the perfect balance of comfortable fit and exciting prints to help you and your

681
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,440
Valentine look great.

682
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,920
Don't spend another Valentine's Day giving the same old gift.

683
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,280
Check out me on these.com and find the best match for your match.

684
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,640
We have a couple of matching pairs from me on these, and it's a lot of fun.

685
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,200
Wait, hold on.

686
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,320
We do?

687
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,520
No, I mean, okay.

688
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
And they're really fun to wear.

689
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,040
I also like right now, actually, I'm wearing their lounge pants, which I don't think are

690
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,280
included in this particular bullet point, but I can't say enough about these very comfortable

691
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,840
lounge pants.

692
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,800
All of it's made from the softest materials on Earth.

693
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,360
They're talking three times softer than cotton soft.

694
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
This Valentine's Day, get your partner a fun, thoughtful gift that's comfortable for the

695
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,040
both of you right now.

696
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,800

That was really good, Griffin.

You did a great job.

711
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,840
Good job, Griffin.

712
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,360
Oh, come on, please.

713
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,560
Please, you flatter me.

714
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,960
Trav, do you want to read this one?

715
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,920
Sure, I do.

716
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,560
Postage rates have gone up again.

717
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,640
That's all it says.

718
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,680
Weird.

719
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,160
Anyways, Let's Stamps.

720
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,600
Let's move on to the next one.

721
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:03,840
Yeah.

722
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,040
My name is Greg Williamson with a special message on my brother.

723
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,920
My brother and me.

724
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,320
Postage rates have gone up again.

725
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:12,640
Bye.

726
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Letstamps.com keep your rates down with postage discounts up to 40%.

727
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,360
Discounts you can't even get at the post office.

728
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,000
Buy and print official US postage for any letter, package, and class of mail using your

729
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,440
own computer and printer.

730
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
Then the mail carrier picks it up.

731
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,240
No more trips to the post office.

732
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,080
Wham bam.

733
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,880
Totally done.

734
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,280
Easy.

735
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
You won't have to worry about letters anymore.

736
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,880
Well, I don't spend that much time worrying about letters.

737
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,280
Oh, it's like every day, three hours a day in one solid chunk.

738
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,000
Start to finish one o'clock to four o'clock every day.

739
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,440
What am I going to do with these letters?

740
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
And now I know.

741
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,920

742
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,080

Click on the microphone at the top of the home page and type in my brother.

748
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,560
That's Stamps.com.

749
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,520
Enter my brother.

750
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,080
What?

751
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,720
Enter my brother.

752
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,200
Just gross.

753
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,040
No, I meant like an Osmosis Jones way.

754
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,200
I have a message here.

755
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
Oh, it's about Sedgwick.

756
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
You know what I said, Nick?

757
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,360
You said Sedgwick.

758
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,560
No, I didn't.

759
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,600
I said Sedgwick.

760
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,480
Thank you, Travis.

761
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
It's a dream folk band.

762
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,560
Start over.

763
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:28,960
Start over.

764
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,360
I fucked it.

765
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,640
Why do I have to start over?

766
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,440
You're the one that sucks.

767
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,560
Yeah, I'm the one who fucked it up.

768
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,120
So I'm not starting over.

769
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,880
What word did I leave off on?

770
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,520
Band.

771
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,120
Based in Chicago, Illinois.

772
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,640
Sedgwick is a dream folk band based in Chicago, Illinois.

773
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,560
Using their roots in folk music and influences from alt rock and electronica, Sedgwick explores

774
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,480
emotionally stirring themes via complex vocal harmonies and sweeping symphonic soundscapes

775
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,880
that has been described as haunting, evocative, beautiful music by WGN Radio.

776
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,280
Listen to the album, Collapse Now, and find Sedgwick on social media.

777
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,600
That's at S-E-D-G-E-W-I-C-K.

778
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,080
Band.

779
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,760
That's their Twitter handle.

780
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
Listen to Sedgwick's full-length studio album.

781
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,800
I did say full-length.

782
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,640
And you also did say Sedgwick that time.

783
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,680
That was Sedgwick.

784
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,720
That one was Sedgwick.

785
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,600
It's Sedgwick.

786
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Listen to Sedgwick's...

787
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,960
Listen to Sedgwick's full-length studio album, Collapse, on Spotify, SoundCloud, iTunes,

788
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,760
and find out more at Sedgwickmusic.com.

789
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,360
Okay, I figured out the problem.

790
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
Listen to Sedgwick's full-length...

791
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,240
Sedgwick.

792
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,480
Sedgwick.

793
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,640
Do you like music?

794
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,440
Sedgwick, we're very sorry.

795
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
Sedgwick sounds like you're saying Sedgwick with a baby accent.

796
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,280
And I understand that now.

797
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,080
I get it.

798
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,120
And that's not on Sedgwick.

799
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,240
It's a great name.

800
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,000
And this music does sound evocative and powerful.

801
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,760
It's just we fucked it up.

802
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,680
And then we kind of went down our own little hole.

803
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,560
We made the hole, and then we were baby people, and we made a hole.

804
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,520
You'll remember it now.

805
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,440
It's Sedgwick, not Cedric.

806
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
And I'm not speaking with a baby accent.

807
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,200
They're two different words.

808
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,160
I have a message here for Jessica, and it's from Graham, who says,

809
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,440
Dearest Magpie, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

810
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,440
I'm so lucky to have you as my partner, best friend, wife, and baby mama.

811
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,440
Why are we all incapable of reading these like normal human beings?

812
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
My best friend, wife, and baby mama.

813
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
I'm grateful you said I will all those years ago.

814
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,120
Thank you for being mine, for the family we've chosen and built,

815
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,400
and for all our days together.

816
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,160
Love forever and always.

817
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,800
G.

818
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,360
P.S.

819
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,920
Great job.

820
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,320
I didn't even say that part right.

821
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,200
Okay.

822
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
Okay, Jessica, Graham, congratulations on your momentous love,

823
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,280
and it's the kind of stuff that's gonna move mountains.

824
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
That's all I have to say about that.

825
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,440
And it's, I'm really glad that Jessica, when asked,

826
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,480
will you help me hide this body, said I will.

827
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,360
Yeah, sure.

828
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
She's always down.

829
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
She knows the best spots.

830
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,040
She knows the game.

831
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,360
Griffin, read this one too.

832
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,040
You just keep doing such a good job reading.

833
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,320
Let me prepare, let me moisten my instrument.

834
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,520
Oh, God.

835
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,760
Were you reacting to your own phrase there?

836
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,040
Yeah.

837
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,840
Here's one for Jay, and it's from Tosca, who says,

838
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,000
hey, Jay, happy belated candle nights.

839
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
Those are pretty belated candle nights.

840
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Thank you for being one of my,

841
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,400
thank you for being one of my close friends,

842
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,480
and introducing me to these good, good brothers

843
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,280
and the adventure zone.

844
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Looking forward to more gaming hijinks, dumb references, and memes,

845
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,120
childhood crime stories, and hotel wrestle battles.

846
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,000
Love you, dork.

847
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,560
P.S., is this why you wanted me to read this one?

848
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,200
It is, yes.

849
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
Oh my wa mo shinderu.

850
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
That's, you are already dead,

851
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,160
and I believe it's from Fist of the North Star.

852
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,200
Okay.

853
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
That one, that one, that's fine.

854
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,200
That one's fine.

855
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,160
That one's not, yeah.

856
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,640
Oh my wa mo shinderu.

857
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry, everybody.

858
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
Did you include that so that one of us would say it

859
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,080
and then get dunked on on Twitter by people who are like,

860
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,280
nah, that's actually,

861
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,080
you've mispronounced the Fist of the North Star quote so badly,

862
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,720
and now I'm boycotting the show.

863
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
I'm Hal Loveland.

864
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm Danielle Radford.

865
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,560
I am Michael Eagle.

866
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,160
And we are the hosts of Tights and Fights,

867
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,920
Maximum Fund's newest podcast dedicated to all things wrestling.

868
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,800
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks, the women's revolution,

869
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,240
Sasha Banks, the brand split, and Sasha Banks' wigs.

870
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,640
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

871
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

872
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,400
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

873
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,840
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

874
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,720
New episodes Thursdays on Maximum Fund

875
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
or wherever you get your podcasts.

876
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,760
Oh yeah.

877
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,240
Dig it.

878
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,120
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Morgan Davey.

879
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

880
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,360
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

881
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,720
Sorry, something has gone wrong, but I'm going to refresh it.

882
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
And then it's still wrong.

883
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,920
So I'm going to say this is Flo from Progressive Insurance.

884
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,160
If you could speak as soon as you were born,

885
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,840
what would you first words be?

886
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
You've just been born.

887
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,480
What are your first words you say?

888
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,360
Thanks.

889
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,880
And Justin, I know that this is something hot on your mind.

890
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,360
Yeah.

891
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,920
Is it strange that we haven't discussed the fact

892
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,600
that in like five days or four days,

893
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,360
you and Sydney are expecting?

894
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
It's nobody's business.

895
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,600
I guess that's, I mean, it's going to be our listeners business

896
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,960
because we're going to have a live show for you next week

897
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,880
because Justin's taking some time off.

898
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, just for the baby stuff.

899
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,040
Yeah, new baby coming.

900
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,520
New baby coming.

901
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,280
Drops this Tuesday.

902
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
I wanted to do, I wanted to reveal it on Insta,

903
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,840
but I guess.

904
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
All right, are you going to do like a name reveal?

905
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,240
Like a Kim Kardashian den?

906
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,760
It's actually Jeremy Jivens.

907
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,880
Yeah, that's very exciting.

908
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,960
So what is the, if you speak as soon as you're born

909
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,080
and you are able to speak and you've just been born

910
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:18,080
and you pop right out and then what's the first words?

911
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,360
What if babies could do this?

912
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,000
What if babies had nine months to think of like

913
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,520
a dope entrance line, but then they couldn't speak again

914
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,680
for, you know, 18 months or whatever

915
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,720
following sort of the natural order of things.

916
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,040
Oh man, wouldn't that suck if you popped out and you're like,

917
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm so happy to boo here, fuck, I blew it.

918
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,720
Yeah.

919
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
What if they just popped out and said,

920
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,360
I like it, do what?

921
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,440
Oh my God, Travis, it's the best answer.

922
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,520
It's fair, it's a very good answer.

923
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,480
Ah, shit.

924
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,840
Before we jump in, I wanted to read a couple of these answers

925
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
because this is the most disappointed I've ever been

926
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,880
in Yahoo, I think, and that's saying something

927
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,120
because even when I'm not doing this podcast

928
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,840
or interacting with this website,

929
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,800
I am experiencing what I would call just sort of

930
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,160
a constant low frequency disappointment at Yahoo Answers.

931
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
This is the best answer.

932
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,160
It was voted best answer.

933
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,200
It's from Abby who says, please put me back in.

934
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,520
I don't want to come into this world, you can't make me.

935
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,640
That's the best answer.

936
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,600
Two answers down, Jim G, not the best answer.

937
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,960
Sorry I'm late, I hit some traffic in the birth canal.

938
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,520
Hey mom.

939
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,400
Hey mom, I like the hey mom at the end.

940
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
Wait, hey mom's very good.

941
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,120
Because that makes it seem like the baby is addressing

942
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,320
the doctor first, like, yo, sorry I'm late.

943
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,600
Oh, hey mom.

944
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,520
It addresses two different audiences.

945
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,800
It's a pretty good little joke construction there, Jim G,

946
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
but it's not the best answer.

947
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,680
No, Abby's is.

948
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,040
The best answer is the first one every 90s comedian

949
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
would think of, put me back.

950
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,800
It's not, it's nothing.

951
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,200
What if you, I think, okay, for this example,

952
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,560
I would have to think like me now as a baby being born,

953
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,400
because if the baby was just born,

954
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,440
sure they could speak English,

955
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,480
they wouldn't know what anything is.

956
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,800
So that doesn't work for the joke construction.

957
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,320
So I would wait for some good entrance line, right?

958
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,920
That I could respond to where like, they would say like-

959
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,400
That's good.

960
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,160
Okay, he's coming.

961
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,400
And I'd pop out and be like, that's what she said.

962
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,280
You know, something like that.

963
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
Okay, so kind of like what up at the moment.

964
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,520
Yeah.

965
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,480
That's, I like that.

966
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,720
Something where I can respond, like pop out and be like,

967
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,760
I'll have what she's having.

968
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,560
You know, something like that where I can really respond

969
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,240
and nail the timing.

970
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,800
Yeah, if your mom is like moaning from labor pains

971
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
and then you come out and you're like, I'll have what she's having.

972
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,680
Like that would be pretty funny for a baby.

973
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,520
That could be funny as fuck, dude.

974
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,360
President Bartlett's first words on the West Wing are,

975
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,720
I am the Lord your God,

976
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,120
thou shalt worship no other God before me.

977
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,960
Would that be a good opening salvo for a baby?

978
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,200
Yeah.

979
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,720
That would be very commanding.

980
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,120
You would run the room at that point, I think.

981
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,160
What if it's three triplets all trying to deliver their jokes

982
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
at the same time, but the cross talk makes it unbearable.

983
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,400
And then it would be kind of like,

984
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,240
listening to my brother and me as these babies show up

985
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,480
and they're all like, my wife, I'll have what she's having.

986
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,280
I'm the Lord your God.

987
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,320
Like, oh, guys, oh, guys, guys, can we break these up?

988
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:22,960
Can we separate these?

989
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
Can we do one joke per joke, please?

990
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,200
Because you do kind of a Joey Gladstone thing,

991
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,440
like cut it off and you're looking at the umbilical cord.

992
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,880
Oh, I like that.

993
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,920
Is that fun?

994
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,000
What if you went really topical?

995
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,240
Because like here's the thing, you're only going to do it once

996
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,600
and you popped out and like,

997
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,440
did you guys see The Late Show last night?

998
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
And you just made it like really specific,

999
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,240
but a good conversation starter too, a good icebreaker.

1000
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,600
That's good.

1001
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,600
I think I know what mine would be.

1002
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,400
First, I'm going to look at the webcam in the nursery,

1003
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,360
make sure the baby's not asleep.

1004
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,320
Okay, he's not.

1005
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,440
I think the seed hits the egg and then I exist while I'm taking...

1006
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
Wait, hold on, let me think about what I'm saying.

1007
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,040
Uh-huh.

1008
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,360
What?

1009
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,960
No, listen, life begins at conception.

1010
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,320
No!

1011
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,880
Hey, listen, one thing we want to establish here on our podcast.

1012
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,520
Okay, hold on.

1013
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,800
What is it?

1014
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,920
With 393 episodes in, it should be clear by now.

1015
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,120
The one thing I want is for our podcast to be entered as evidence

1016
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,960
in a Supreme Court deliberations.

1017
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,160
What do you want to go ahead and establish here, biblically speaking?

1018
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
Surprise, you finally got to the twist.

1019
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,640
You finally got to the twist of our podcast.

1020
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,320
Every 390 fucking episodes, it's the twist, the turn.

1021
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,440
I'm just saying, I have the thought, I know what I'm going to say,

1022
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,560
and then it's just waiting.

1023
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,640
The long, dark, damp wait, and it's just like,

1024
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,240
oh, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

1025
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,440
And then out I come as soon as the crown is out.

1026
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,800
I think I'm not even fully delivered.

1027
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:00,720
You hear me yelling, my name is Kid Rock!

1028
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,640
And then I'm like, is Kid Rock still cool?

1029
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,120
And then the baby magic wears off, I can't talk anymore.

1030
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,640
But I didn't know.

1031
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,760
No, Kid Rock, we don't really fuck around with Kid Rock.

1032
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,840
That would be so dope if you got that far,

1033
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,960
and then when you were two and a half, or three, or however old,

1034
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,520
your first words were, Kid Rock!

1035
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,280
That's such a long time for the drop to come, but it's so worth it.

1036
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,520
It's so, well, it's kind of worth it.

1037
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,880
It's a little bit worth it.

1038
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,960
Could you get to, what about, I see you tremble with antisa,

1039
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,840
and then three years later, patience.

1040
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,960
That could be very good, too.

1041
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,920
I think that your Tim Curry impression,

1042
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,760
I think you'd have time to get good at it in there.

1043
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,840
What a fun, I just love make and believe, don't you guys?

1044
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,360
Just saying, we got these brains for reasons to make up imaginations.

1045
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,920
Beautiful, thank you, Griffin.

1046
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,000
Thank you, God, for the imagination you gave me.

1047
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,280
Thank you.

1048
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,200
What about, I'm the baby, gotta love me.

1049
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,680
I'm the baby, gotta love me.

1050
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,720
That's so good.

1051
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,760
Yeah, that's the one.

1052
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,160
I've showed enough videos of Baby Sinclair and Charlie at this point

1053
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,400
that she's probably the only three-year-old on planet Earth

1054
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,680
that's deeply into dinosaur clips on YouTube.

1055
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,800
Why would you do that?

1056
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,200
As an experiment, I think.

1057
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,160
She got a Baby Sinclair toy for Christmas that we got off of eBay.

1058
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,480
It's gotta be one of five left, right?

1059
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:28,960
Yeah, definitely.

1060
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,120
That's the one toy I tell her to take really good care of.

1061
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,160
Because Daddy probably can't find another Baby Sinclair.

1062
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,640
But Justin, Baby Sinclair is a character purely based off of being a baby

1063
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,080
who A, does not get along well with not the mama,

1064
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,880
and two, is kind of a monster.

1065
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,240
If you think she has not come to me and say,

1066
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,040
Daddy, let's play the game where I bang on your head,

1067
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,440
and then you say, if you bang my head one more time,

1068
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,800
I'm gonna throw you across the room,

1069
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,240
and then you throw me across the room.

1070
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,320
No, sweetie, we're not playing dinosaurs.

1071
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,760
Does that happen in dinosaurs?

1072
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
That happens in dinosaurs.

1073
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,240
He throws his child?

1074
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
He throws his child across the room.

1075
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,160
I've been a dev for about 14 months now.

1077
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,800
That's kind of day one stuff.

1078
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,560
Yeah, I'm not saying I'm 100%-ing this, but...

1079
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,400
It's in one of the great clips.

1080
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,200
I mean, if you look at one of the great clips of...

1081
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,480
Oh, okay, yeah, just found it.

1082
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,200
It's the first result.

1083
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,480
Here you go.

1084
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,040
We're just gonna...

1085
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,360
This is probably the third time we've sent clips

1086
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,760
of the hit TV show Dinosaurs to each other.

1087
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,960
If you wanna follow along at home,

1088
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:39,680
youtube.com slash watch question mark V equals U for JTG5V capital X, capital Y, capital Q.

1089
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,480
And you can see clearly here at the...

1090
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,280
It's very obvious at the 17th second mark,

1091
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,480
Baby Sinclair is thrown across the room by daddy.

1092
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,560
Baby Sinclair is fine,

1093
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,000
but that does happen in the hit TV show Dinosaurs.

1094
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,160
Does the baby dinosaur and DJ Jazzy Jeff ever run into each other in the air?

1095
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,200
Like, it happened again.

1096
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
That would be so fresh.

1097
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,920
And they trade, but he would be killed, right?

1098
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,520
DJ Jazzy Jeff would not last long in this dinosaur-filled world.

1099
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,720
I don't necessarily think he's got the skills required

1100
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,240
to not be destroyed by the dinosaur's powerful jaws.

1101
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,320
So should we do another question?

1102
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,840
Absolutely.

1103
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,840
Hi brothers, I'm very quiet at work and I haven't been there for long.

1104
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,800
I'm also much younger than everyone else at only 23.

1105
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,440
I sometimes think that my coworkers don't know how to take me.

1106
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,240
In a slow part of the day today,

1107
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,040
my adult coworkers out of nowhere started assigning everyone

1108
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,120
SpongeBob characters based on their personalities.

1109
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,200
Jesus fuck, oh my god.

1110
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,360
When they got around to me, one of my coworkers yelled,

1111
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,240
Krabby Patty, and everyone just agreed?

1112
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm so concerned as to what this means,

1113
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,120
because Krabby Patty isn't a character, thank you.

1114
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,520
It's just a sea hamburger?

1115
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,280
Should I quit now?

1116
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,920
What do I do?

1117
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,680
And that's from confused Krabby Patty in Kansas City.

1118
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,200
That is very confusing.

1119
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,600
I would not know how to take this information either.

1120
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,520
Now, is your real name something that rhymes with Krabby Patty,

1121
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,880
like Stabby Daddy?

1122
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,760
And then it's the rhyme that is just kind of undeniable.

1123
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,840
And maybe the boss's name is Bungbob,

1124
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,960
and so he of course got that designation.

1125
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,840
Bungbob is a pretty good name.

1126
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,440
It doesn't rhyme with sponge, but it's still pretty good.

1127
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
Yeah, but I think it's a slant rhyme.

1128
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,800
I think it's pretty good.

1129
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,320
Wouldn't Sponge Rob rhyme better with SpongeBob?

1130
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,440
I think I'm mistaken.

1131
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,560
What about Bungrob?

1132
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,680
We rented, there used to be a costume shop in town

1133
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,000
for a theater thing once.

1134
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,800
We rented an unlicensed SpongeBob square pants costume.

1135
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,240
And it was listed in the catalog as Sponge Robert.

1136
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,360
Which I think is like, nice, good try.

1137
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,120
Please, Sponge Robert was my father.

1138
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,600
I'm Bungrob.

1139
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,880
You know, actually, there is no true one Bungrob.

1140
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,560
It's a title passed down from father to son.

1141
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Yeah, that's why at the end of every season

1142
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,960
of SpongeBob Squarepants,

1143
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,920
he goes through a regeneration and he's voiced by a different actor.

1144
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,520
The problem is, it does sound like they were dunking on you

1145
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,880
for being crabby.

1146
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,360
The problem is, if you had spun around on them and be like,

1147
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,200
excuse me, the crabby patty is a burger, not even a character,

1148
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,960
you would have like reinforced pretty hard, I think,

1149
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,160
the crabbyness part of the crabby patty.

1150
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,240
We should probably address the fact that this sounds

1151
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,880
like an incredibly toxic work environment.

1152
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,400
That is another thing.

1153
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,520
Yes, and that's not so much a funny joke

1154
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,120
as much as it is sort of a unfortunate reality.

1155
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,760
And not just because for the obvious,

1156
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,040
that's definitely hard, but it also sounds like on some level,

1157
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,920
these people are uncreative and unfunny and unfunny.

1158
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,360
Which SpongeBob character is everybody?

1159
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,320
You can't stop working at a place

1160
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,480
because the people in it are uncreative and unfunny.

1161
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,960
Like you will be job hopping for great money.

1162
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,040
You will be job hopping for quite a while.

1163
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,640
I don't know, now I'm self-employed

1164
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,800
and work with myself and I love it.

1165
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,440
I'm self-employed, I work by myself

1166
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,520
and the people I work with are funny about half the time.

1167
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,120
I do not think that that is a good metric.

1168
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,080
Wait, is that us?

1169
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,280
Hold on.

1170
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,000
No, me, the self-dunk.

1171
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,960
Oh, I get it.

1172
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
There's three of us, so if we're all funny half the time,

1173
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,760
the show's always funny, run the math.

1174
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,000
This is a, it's actually funny 150% of the time.

1175
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,280
I don't know.

1176
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,800
Now who's the Krabby Patty?

1177
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,600
Okay.

1178
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,760
This sucks, right?

1179
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,520
This is like a broader question about like,

1180
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,680
I work at a workplace where people are bullies,

1181
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,080
I think a little bit in this very innocuous,

1182
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,120
like passive aggressive way,

1183
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,800
but like, that's what it is, right?

1184
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,000
Like it's very rare that somebody is like pantsing people

1185
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,880
at the place they work.

1186
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,240
They just like set up these social hierarchies

1187
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,240
that not everyone gets the benefit of.

1188
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,120
That fucking sucks.

1189
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,400
This is like the office, right?

1190
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,640
Like if I worked in the office, the office, the office,

1191
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,440
and I saw Dwight getting all of his things taken

1192
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,760
and picked on and bullied all the time.

1193
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,800
Put in jello?

1194
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,760
Put in gelatin.

1195
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,800
Jim, can we not?

1196
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,400
Can we all stand up for Dwight for a second

1197
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,280
and ask Jim to not?

1198
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,440
Can you not put Dwight's stapler in some jammy shake,

1199
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,040
which is of course what the British called jello and gelatin.

1200
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,680
And of course I only watched the British version.

1201
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,600
I'll tell you the most frustrating thing

1202
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,880
about this poor question asker being called Krabby Patty

1203
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,400
is they sent a picture of themselves

1204
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,960
and they are a human sized starfish.

1205
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,400
And it seems to me like it's just right there.

1206
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,280
It's just right there.

1207
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,240
There was already somebody at work named Gatrick

1208
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,840
and you just can't.

1209
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,200
This is my friend, Gatrick Bypass.

1210
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,920
And would it be even worse if they were named Patrick

1211
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,640
and they were like, we're just gonna keep calling you Patrick

1212
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,000
and then they didn't get to play.

1213
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,760
They didn't get to play with me.

1214
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,360
Never play by the way people in a work environment

1215
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,720
or any environment really, the who would everyone be

1216
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,760
because inevitably in every media property

1217
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,160
there's always one jerk or asshole or disliked person

1218
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,680
and you're gonna come around to be like,

1219
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,200
and who would that person be?

1220
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,240
And it's always mean, always mean.

1221
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,840
If you do Game of Thrones in your office,

1222
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,720
you got enough people there,

1223
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,400
eventually you're gonna run out of the humans

1224
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,120
and somebody's gonna have to be a very mean dragon.

1225
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,320
Or the Uncomfortable Throne.

1226
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,560
I'm talking about how shitty that chair is.

1227
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,840
It's a shitty throne.

1228
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,520
You think it's just like, I'll kill everyone's family

1229
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,040
and make them do horrible crime

1230
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,720
and I'm gonna take over and get that big chair

1231
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,680
and the power that comes with it.

1232
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,360
And you sit in that chair after doing all that stuff

1233
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,760
and you're like, oh man, can I get like a sumo beanbag?

1234
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,560
Do you have those yet?

1235
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
And the other thing I've learned from,

1236
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,880
and this is just a side note of Game of Thrones,

1237
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,040
if someone tries to make you the Hand of the King,

1238
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,920
you're gonna die.

1239
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,360
So just say no, just don't do it.

1240
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,480
Just say no, don't do it.

1241
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,640
Listen, can you say, instead of Krabby Patty,

1242
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,720
can I be Goliath from Gargoyles?

1243
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,080
The T-shirt Gargoyles.

1244
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,440
And they'll say like, what?

1245
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,000
And you say like, yeah, either Goliath or Lexington,

1246
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,720
one of those two from Gargoyles, the TV show Gargoyles.

1247
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,760
I wanna be that one.

1248
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,840
And they say, but like, that's not really what we're doing.

1249
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,160
We're doing like a SpongeBob one.

1250
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,640
And then you, you know, roar.

1251
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Maybe you show up the next day dressed up

1252
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,200
as cosplay from Gargoyles.

1253
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,800
And it's like, oh yes, it's me, Krabby Patty, I guess.

1254
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,600
Even though I'm clearly Lexington from the Gargoyles.

1255
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,560
Obviously Lexington.

1256
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,840
You know how I'm always perched on top of the cubicles?

1257
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,920
Yeah, perched on their cubicles and be like,

1258
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,080
I can be Bronx too if you want.

1259
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,720
How many other Gargoyles get Griffin name?

1260
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,000
Is that top of your head?

1261
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,720
Wait, hold on.

1262
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,080
Is that top of your head, Griffin?

1263
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
Yeah, I mean, they were all named after Burroughs and shit.

1264
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,920
My voice sounds exactly like Jonathan Frakes.

1265
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,840
Well, he wasn't actually a Gargoyle in that show.

1266
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,640
I don't remember.

1267
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,520
Somebody didn't watch the deleted scenes.

1268
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,760
Oh, he got bit by a Gargoyle turned into a Gargoyle.

1269
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,720
On the Blu-ray.

1270
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,000
Okay, I see.

1271
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,960
My memory of Gargoyles stopped when they were still back in the past.

1272
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,200
So you talking about them being in present day New York.

1273
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,240
I was like, wait, what the fuck?

1274
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,880
I forgot that.

1275
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,000
That's the pilot, bud.

1276
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,200
I know, but I forgot all about that.

1277
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,440
And I was like, why would they be named after the Burroughs

1278
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,480
in fucking old timey England or whatever?

1279
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,400
And only now do I remember looking at the Gargoyles TV series,

1280
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,760
Wikipedia, that it all took place in New York.

1281
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,120
Except for fucking Goliath.

1282
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
He was just like, I'm still Goliath.

1283
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm still Goliath.

1284
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,840
Well, he's talking about Goliath Street,

1285
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,200
which is where all the big strong souvenir shops are.

1286
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,760
Okay, we need, let's end, let's finish the episode thusly.

1287
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,680
Thank you so much for listening to,

1288
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,320
where did, did Justin go pee in the fiction?

1289
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,960
We lost Justin.

1290
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,680
Oh, that's like, yeah, what is it in the fiction?

1291
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,800
Justin has, he's disapparated back to Hogwarts.

1292
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,160
Yes, he did a Hogwarts spell.

1293
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,120
No, he lost his thing.

1294
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,200
But Travis and I are jumping in here

1295
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,560

1296
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,920

What else did we lose in the fire?

1308
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,640

Schmaners is going to be performing there.

1324
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,880

1325
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,080
but you can get tickets,

1326
