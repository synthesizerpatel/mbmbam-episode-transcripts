1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,440
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's another opening, another show.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm living for this limelight, and I'm your middle-est brother.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:06,240
And I'm a Broadway baby, coming down to walk the streets,

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
check out my baby feets, I'll be in the show.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,920
Anyway, I'm Griffin McElroy, I'm a Broadway baby, and it's time.

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,840
Boys, the calling has harkened once again. The clarion calls calling us back up to the big stage,

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,880
isn't it, boys? I tried to walk away, but that old phantom of the opera's pulling me back in.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
That fucking phantom's got the lasso. Sing to me.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,440
We've been watching this show, Encore, on the Disney Plus network. It's on TV.

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,840
It's the one with Baby Yoda in it. Maybe you've seen this green guy. Everyone loves him.

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,040
And in it, they make old people.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,480
There's just no way.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,480
There's no way to talk about it without using pejoratives, but they're not young folks,

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,040
but they used to, and when they were-

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,560
They used to be, thank you, Griffin, you were about to say that, but it's such a good point.

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,920
Let's not gloss over that.

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,480
When they were that, they did high school theater productions of Oklahoma, of Annie Get Your Gun,

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,520
of whatever, and now Disney and Kristen Bell, Kristen Bell has a gun.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
Kristen Bell's complicit, 1,000%.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,440
She's holding the gun, and she says, hey, older folks, now you're gonna go do Annie again.

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,960
And Annie from Annie is like, I'm 45. I can't sing, I can't, this guy can't be a character

27
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,480
whose first name is Daddy because he's an adult, and he runs a Brazilian jujitsu dojo here in town,

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
so he can't do that.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
Griffin has twice now mentioned that they are older folks, and the thing is, that's not us,

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
that's not a judgment call on us.

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,200
It is the whole point of the show that these are people who are at least two decades removed

32
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
from high school doing high school production.

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,360
And they used to be young, and they get a high school musical, not high school musical,

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
but a musical in high school.

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,880
No, musical high school has its own show over there.

36
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,240
High school musical has high school musical, the musical musical high school,

37
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,680
and that's a different thing on Disney+.

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,200
This is encore where Kristen Bell at gunpoint forces adults to revive shows

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
in like five days that they did as teens.

40
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,160
Now, why do I say at gunpoint?

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,560
That's not just me writing fan fiction.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
It is unfathomable to me.

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,160
Un-fucking- I don't care if Princess Anna showed up in her Rolls-Royce and said,

44
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,080
get in the car, we're doing Wizard of Oz again.

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
I don't give a shit.

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,560
No, no, absolutely not.

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,360
For TV?

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
Are you fucking with me?

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
Not for a prize.

50
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,960
This isn't a competition.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,880
You don't win fuck all.

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,640
This is a show, and I say this, no, I don't say it with love.

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,280
This is a show that trades on burned out stars.

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,760
It trades on adult sadness because the point of the show is,

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,880
wouldn't it be great to relive your glory days

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,200
of Annie get your gun from high school?

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,520
And people are like, yes, please.

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
I will leave my job for a week.

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
I will ignore my children

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,920
so that I can remount my high school production

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
of your good man, Charlie Brown or whatever.

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,400
Unfathomable.

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,360
There's a couple that broke up and the young woman in the couple,

64
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,920
her name in high school was Amy, A-M-Y,

65
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,440
and she dated this guy who said it would be kind of cute and funny

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,880
if she changed the spelling to A-M-E-I-G-H.

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
That is on her medical diploma

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
because she's an OB-GYN who now goes by that name

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
that that guy in high school gave her.

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,000
P.S. not over it in any way, shape or form.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
They're back in the mix, back in the show.

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,960
They're so deep in the stink again,

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,200
and she tells the director this story

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,960
and the director, sweet director,

75
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,640
sweet Broadway director has to be like,

76
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,640
oh, well, that's a, he must have really left an impact.

77
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh, no.

78
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
This boy has Broadway sparkles in his eyes again.

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,160
Gotta get on this show.

80
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I will gladly kneel before Kristen Bell

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,760
and give my life up under her hands and I'll be-

82
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
What show, Griffin, would you wanna-

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,720
Well, I still remember all the fucking colors

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,040
in Joseph's super jacket.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh, really?

86
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,640
Because I was in that show

87
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,320
and I can't remember a goddamn one.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,520
I couldn't remember them then.

89
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,360
Well, Travis, it's red and blue and yellow and green

90
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,360
and blue and indigo and violet and-

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
I think ochre was in there?

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
And ochre and white.

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,280
Ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre, ochre.

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,160
And white.

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
And so much of it ochre.

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,200
I, you know what?

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,160
There's a big ochre patch right in the middle.

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, moth.

99
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Moth, moth, moth, moth, moth, oker.

100
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,560
Speaking of okers, I think it would be fun

101
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,640
if I was like, hey Kristen, I wanna do Shrek Again

102
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,840
where I got to play Shrek.

103
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
And she'd be like, is that true?

104
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,040
Shrek Again is the movie about when Shrek dies

105
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,440
and they send him back to Earth to be Shrek one more time.

106
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,680
Yeah, I love that flick.

107
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,200
You know what I dream out?

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
I dream out the time my high school drama teacher

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,800
made us do an episode of Friends for a drama project.

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Yeah, I'd like to see that, I think.

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,760
I think I'd dream out that,

112
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,680
or maybe the same teacher in the same class

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,120
made us do an episode of Will and Grace as a drama project.

114
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
That might be, that might be a good one.

115
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,160
Are you doing a pre-sale on tickets, Travis?

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,800
Cause I do not wanna miss this.

117
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,280
Or I could do that time I did a monologue

118
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,800
based on cut together parts from Fight Club.

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Oh, Trev, I need to be in the front row for,

120
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,600
I need to be in the splash zone for that one, please.

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,880
So go ahead and snag me a couple comps.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,840
You got it.

123
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
Have you ever wondered what the rules of Fight Club are?

124
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Wonder no more.

125
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,000
I would probably remount that time

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,320
that I did a staged lip sync to Sweet Home Alabama

127
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,480
while wearing a flannel shirt

128
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,200
and with a little bendel over my shoulder

129
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,680
with a cardboard sign that said Next Stop Alabama.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,200
And I think I would remount that powerful,

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,440
Now I'm sorry, Justin, that was in college.

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,800
You can't.

133
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Written and directed by Forrest Gump

134
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,360
from the hit soundtrack, Forrest Gump.

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,200
And I would love to remount that thing

136
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,760
where I would pace back and forth on stage

137
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
for three minutes with my fucking arm out.

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Just, I didn't, hey, and also was in high school,

139
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,040
didn't understand literally anything I was saying.

140
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,920
Neal who?

141
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,840
No idea.

142
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,960
What or what?

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,260
Can't imagine, no clue.

144
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,420
Very good, very good.

145
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,880
Anyway, this is the last episode.

146
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,120
We're all about to go Broadway babies,

147
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
so let's send them out in style.

148
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,160
That's great, I'm ready.

149
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you guys ready?

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm ready.

151
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,200
I've become a great lover of craft breweries over the years

152
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
and with this interest,

153
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,920
I've collected some really neat drinkware

154
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,360
to enjoy my fancy beers.

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,040
I have even recently gotten a job at a shop

156
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,200
that sells drinking horns, pewter tankards,

157
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,700
and every manner of beer glass.

158
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,960
My question is, how douchey is it

159
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,760
if I bring my own cool drinkware

160
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,120
to other people's houses for me to use?

161
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,640
I feel silly drinking from a horned skull mug at home

162
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,600
as if I'm putting on a show for myself.

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,340
Would my host think that their glasses

164
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,040
aren't good enough for me?

165
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,800
I just want to use my fun cups.

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I am in my mid-20s and a female ailing in Austin.

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Interesting, okay.

168
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,000
If you feel silly doing it at home,

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
my rule of thumb for most stuff,

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,420
if you feel like a real goober at home,

171
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,960
that's not going to be reduced

172
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,840
by doing it in front of other people

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,920
because when you're in front of other people,

174
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,920
it's like being alone with an audience.

175
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,160
Yeah, I guess, Griffin,

176
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
but that doesn't hold true of things like, say,

177
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,860
I don't know, karaoke,

178
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,400
which would be, I think, weird to do by yourself

179
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
and totally acceptable to do with friends

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or, say, a conversation or ping pong.

181
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,820
There's lots of things that if you do by yourself,

182
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,120
it's okay to feel silly.

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Opening Christmas presents.

184
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,340
Listen, listen.

185
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,840
This person is hovering in between.

186
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,320
They're both aware and unaware at the exact same moment.

187
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,240
It's a quantum impossibility.

188
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,780
Listen to this bit.

189
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,280
I feel silly drinking from a horned skull at home

190
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,560
as if I'm putting on a show for myself.

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Okay, interesting.

192
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,880
Let's stop for a second.

193
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,560
Let's pick up stakes.

194
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
Kristen Bell shows up.

195
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
Get in the car.

196
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,960
We're taking this show to your friend's house.

197
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,840
See, if you do it for other people,

198
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,560
then you're putting on a show for them.

199
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,640
It is a show about this cool cup that you have.

200
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
Yes, this is true, Justin,

201
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,320
because this is, let's scale this back

202
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,600
and instead of saying a horned mug,

203
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
let's just say a fun coffee mug that you picked up,

204
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,060
a novelty coffee mug.

205
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,020
As soon as you start walking it around, say, an office,

206
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,000
trying to get people to notice

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,980
how interesting your mug is, now it's an issue, right?

208
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,080
But if you just have a fun mug that makes you happy

209
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,920
that you drink out of, that's fine, right?

210
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,480
Let's, okay, we're gonna get lost

211
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,020
if we go step by step

212
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,840
through every imaginable drinking apparatus.

213
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,080
I think we can all agree on bringing your own drinkware

214
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,040
to someone else's house is pretty fucking wild.

215
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,880
Yeah, you can't do that.

216
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
It's wild.

217
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,540
It doesn't matter what it is.

218
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,640
Because that would not extend to anything.

219
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,800
I brought my own chair.

220
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Like, no, you go to the person's house.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,840
I would appreciate that.

222
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Actually, that would be nice.

223
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,320
Well, maybe if they ask you to bring a folding chair,

224
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,440
like if it's an outdoor thing.

225
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
But you come to the house, you use the thing.

226
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,140
Here's what I would suggest.

227
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,800
Have people over to your house

228
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,680
where your fun drinkware is for a fun drinkware party

229
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
and get used to the idea

230
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,480
that this fun drinkware is practical, is usable,

231
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,640
is something everyone can enjoy.

232
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
Or-

233
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
I think you're gonna be thrilled

234
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,000
by the way that your relationship

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
with this drinkware changes

236
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,640
when you have to stand over the fucking sink

237
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,880
for an hour washing all of it.

238
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Yeah, because none of it's dishwasher safe.

239
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,640
This horn is fun.

240
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,000
Fucking get my arm,

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,560
get my little scrub daddy in there for 20 minutes,

242
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,880
getting all the nooks and crannies of the cornucopia.

243
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,920
You could also, when you're over at your friend's house,

244
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,640
just keep dropping glasses, shattering them.

245
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,280
And then you say, these glasses aren't horn shaped.

246
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,880
The horn shape is designed-

247
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,880
I thought you were gonna say these special glasses

248
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,240
until you have no choice but to say,

249
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,080
listen, I have cool drinkware at home.

250
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
I'll be right back.

251
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,600
That's what I thought you were gonna say too.

252
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,580
I drop my glass sideways really hard

253
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,640
into all your other glasses.

254
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,000
So now it's time for the horns.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
Oh, you could just bring your own horn to the party,

256
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
but don't use it,

257
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,560
but tuck it in the back of their drinkware cabinet.

258
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
And then the next time you go there for a party,

259
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
say, oh, I'll just use this glass

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
and pull it out from the back of their cabinet.

261
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,240
And they'll say, I don't remember that being ours,

262
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,640
but it is in our cabinet, so go for it.

263
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,360
Yo, if somebody's over at my house

264
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,440
and they pull out a drinking horn

265
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,680
from a secret cupboard in my kitchen,

266
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,400
I will swat it out of their hand

267
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,360
because it's almost certainly some sort of demon's curse.

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, that's true.

269
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,240
And you cannot convince me otherwise.

270
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,840
Yahoo?

272
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,660
Yeah, I got one here.

273
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,880
It was sent in by the prospector Merritt Palmer.

274
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,720
Thank you.

275
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,880
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

276
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm going to call them Puma.

277
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,880
Where are my Pumas?

278
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,740
Socks. Not thick.

279
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,360
Not my shoes.

280
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,720
Anyway, Puma asks,

281
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,240
how to win every time, no matter what, on chess.

282
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,040
I'm tired of getting checkmated.

283
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,220
The game would be so much more fun for me

284
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,580
if I was able to win no matter what move my opponent makes.

285
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,480
The possibility of me getting checkmated

286
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,960
makes the game super boring,

287
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,820
but knowing how to win no matter what

288
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,660
will make it fun for me.

289
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, I'm going to give away my big secrets here.

290
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,760
Okay, okay, listen.

291
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
I have never-

292
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,360
Let me do your thing.

293
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,640
Hold on, let me do the Travis Chess Corner theme song

294
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,760
one second.

295
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,560
One night with Travis and you'll be good at chess.

296
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
He's got the moves and he'll show them to you.

297
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,600
Thank you.

298
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,200
He's a special chess master like Bobby Fischer.

299
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,920
And if you watch out, then he'll fish you too.

300
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,840
Cincinnati, Midwestern City.

301
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,800
Oh, sorry, go ahead, Travis.

302
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,760
So I've never lost at chess ever in my life.

303
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,780
And do you know why?

304
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,560
Because I don't worry about winning or losing.

305
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,960
I worry about intimidation.

306
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Because if you intimidate the other person,

307
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,220
you'll never lose even if they beat you, right?

308
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,680
Because you might, the pieces on the board

309
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,000
might tell one story,

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,700
but the experience is going to tell another.

311
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,460
They won't remember who took who's king,

312
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,780
but they'll remember that you were pretty scary

313
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,620
there at the table,

314
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,520
and they're not going to want to mess with you again.

315
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,480
That's how I win at chess.

316
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,800
It's a mental game. You're talking, of course.

317
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,920
Not of the ending,

318
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,080
but of the victory of playing a beautiful game.

319
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,800
Indeed, Justin, indeed.

320
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,520
Indeed, a beautiful chess.

321
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,960
When you move the knight and the other person says,

322
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,560
ah yes, I had hoped you would.

323
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,520
And no one cares whose knight they are.

324
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,240
It is a dance at that point,

325
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,260
black and white intermingling

326
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,120
in what we in the chess industry call the beautiful game.

327
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,080
Indeed, indeed.

328
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,220
And maybe you knock the board over.

329
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,040
You could also flip that shit.

330
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,880
That's not-

331
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,960
You flip the board and you yell,

332
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,140
the game's over, I win.

333
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,640
Maybe, while you stab a big pin in their leg.

334
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,400
I've destroyed the beautiful game.

335
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,860
It was too beautiful.

336
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,160
And I also think I might've gotten you in the tendon.

337
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,000
Are you okay?

338
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,580
I got you in the tendon,

339
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,220
but it was worth it to witness my destruction

340
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,160
of the beautiful game.

341
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,080
And then you eat, maybe not the king,

342
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
cause that's too on the nose,

343
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,360
but like a bishop, eat a bishop.

344
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,800
It's all about, if you really wanna win every time,

345
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
there's no-

346
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,460
Every time.

347
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,460
There's no rule baked in to the chess bylaws.

348
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,080
On a tournament level, you're gonna have a hard time.

349
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,680
If you go up against Magnus

350
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,400
or whatever the hell that guy's name is,

351
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
you're probably not gonna do good.

352
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,240
But against any other Joe Schmoe off the street,

353
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,840
if you're, you do it Monopoly style, baby.

354
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,800
This is Laser King.

355
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,760
This is Laser King.

356
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,600
What's that?

357
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,960
Oh, that's how we play it in my house.

358
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,780
Laser King?

359
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,620
Yes.

360
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
And also, you're gonna have a hard time believing this,

361
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,360
but there is no rule in the book

362
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,960
that says that a dog can't play chess.

363
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,280
So you could do that.

364
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,120
Yes, yes.

365
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
You could have him challenge your dog

366
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,200
and then say, oh, well, it plays by dog rules.

367
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,880
When you start losing,

368
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,880
have your golden retriever, Peppa, run over

369
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,520
and take their king with their mouth.

370
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,560
And you say, oh, game, game, set, match.

371
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,920
Because it doesn't say in the rules that,

372
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,840
hey, respect my dog.

373
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,680
Yep.

374
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,560
Shoot a rubber band at their queen.

375
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,400
Yes.

376
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,800
And if you get her, that's it.

377
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,620
That's it.

378
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,880
Maybe seduce their queen.

379
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Oh, I like that.

380
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
Yeah.

381
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,560
Aw, dude.

382
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,320
It doesn't always have to be violent, you know?

383
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,400
Sometimes it can be the beautiful game of seduction.

384
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,960
Down, you're down some points.

385
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,560
Read your pawn from the Bible.

386
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,240
It turns into a bishop.

387
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
It evolves like a Pokemon.

388
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
Yep.

389
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,180
Get your pawn a horse.

390
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,640
Boom, that's a knight, baby.

391
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,360
Take another one, take a knight to the iron church

392
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,280
or the gymnasium.

393
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,340
Have them pump some iron.

394
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,160
Now they're a fucking rook, baby.

395
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,520
And maybe they get checkmate

396
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
and they do you in, dirty.

397
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,520
And they're like, you have lost the game.

398
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,620
And you're like, uh-oh, look over there.

399
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,600
And your queen and a bishop are boning down.

400
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,300
And now that's the king.

401
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,140
Right.

402
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,840
Ooh, when they take your king, say,

403
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,840
oh, joke's on you, this is a matriarchy.

404
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,640
And then your queen zips in.

405
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,480
Oh, that's good.

406
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,600
And your king kills their king.

407
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,720
They take out your queen.

408
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,080
You reveal that one of your pawns is the queen.

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
It's a Padme situation.

410
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,440
Yes.

411
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,260
Eat shit.

412
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,440
Yes, they take your king and you have them arrested

413
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,480
because killing kings is illegal.

414
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,440
You can't kill kings.

415
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,400
That's called assassination, my friends.

416
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,560
And it will not be allowed.

417
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,400
It's the year of our Lord 2019.

418
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
You can't just kill a king and get away with it.

419
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
You're going to the Hague.

420
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,480
That is a good, this won't help you win necessarily.

421
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,120
But when someone gets you in checkmate,

422
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,280
what they're saying, this, you know,

423
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,120
Shammat, right?

424
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,680
It comes from the Persian, the king is helpless.

425
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,640
So what they're saying is, that's it, I've trapped your king.

426
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
I think you should be like, come on, motherfucker.

427
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,560
If you think you're so fucking tough,

428
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,840
let's do fucking, you say the king is helpless,

429
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
let's fucking see.

430
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,520
You don't know my king.

431
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,960
You don't know what he's capable of.

432
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,640
I've got the fucking Stallone.

433
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,520
This is the first blood king.

434
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
He's taken all your dudes.

435
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
If you think the king is helpless, Shammat,

436
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
come on, motherfucker, let's go.

437
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,920
You should just take a finger,

438
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,880
place it on top of your king,

439
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,080
push him down real hard, real hard,

440
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,560
until he burrows below the board.

441
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Yes.

442
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Oh, did you have him trapped?

443
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,760
Or was there an escape tunnel?

444
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,180
By the way, this isn't even the king,

445
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,480
it's a pod-may situation.

446
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,320
Nice.

447
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
It's 2019, have him airlifted out.

448
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
Oh, he's trapped.

449
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Okay, well he calls in his air force

450
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
because he's a fucking king,

451
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
and it's going to get him over here to safety.

452
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,400
And now he's surrounded by a secret service.

453
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,460
When I was in, I have another question.

454
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,620
When I was in fifth grade,

455
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,500
I fell out of the bleachers at morning assembly.

456
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,700
Oh, man.

457
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,180
I was afraid of people laughing at me.

458
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,300
So when I got to the bottom,

459
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,580
I pretended that I was dead.

460
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,900
Oh, man.

461
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,520
Jesus, this worked.

462
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,460
The kids did not laugh at me.

463
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,940
But then I had to go to the hospital

464
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,020
and get many tests taken.

465
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,420
Oh, my God.

466
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,180
I never told my family the truth,

467
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,220
and to this day,

468
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,780
they believe that I have a serious fainting issue,

469
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,500
and it is now and forever listed in my medical history.

470
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,940
Oh, my God.

471
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,860
How can I come clean and tell my family

472
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,100
that I faked my own death to avoid embarrassment?

473
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
That's Lauren from Kentucky.

474
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,180
Oh, Lauren.

475
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,880
This is a lot, Lauren.

476
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,000
That's a lot, Lauren.

477
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,660
That's a whole heck of a lot.

478
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,340
My brothers might disagree with me, Lauren,

479
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,620
but you're in too deep now.

480
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,660
Why have you waited this long to come clean?

481
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,180
You can't come clean now.

482
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,340
You're in too deep.

483
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,180
Why would you come clean now?

484
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,300
Oh, because the guilt?

485
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,380
You've lived for this long?

486
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,100
You gotta just, Lauren.

487
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,080
No, this is a very, very high stakes

488
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,820
Boy Who Cried Wolf situation,

489
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,840
where, you know, what if you beef it?

490
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,420
And they're like, oh, that's just Lauren fainting again.

491
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,140
Yeah, what if you have an actual fain?

492
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,700
Then they're just gonna leave you there.

493
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,540
What?

494
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,700
Wait, hold on, boys.

495
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
If they believe, if Lauren's family believes

496
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,980
Lauren has a fainting condition,

497
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,580
and then Lauren faints,

498
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,420
you think they're gonna go,

499
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,900
that's just Lauren being Lauren,

500
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,020
and leave Lauren fainting on the ground?

501
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,380
I guess, no, that's a, I mean, that's a fair point.

502
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,540
I'll probably carry Lauren to safety.

503
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,860
Oh, Lauren.

504
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,580
Well, she just faints sometimes.

505
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,180
Lauren, this is rough stuff.

506
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,180
You gotta say something.

507
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,140
You gotta get this one done.

508
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,200
Lauren, don't listen to us.

509
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,180
Do this thing.

510
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,680
Stand up, and stand in your truth, and say,

511
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,220
cause it'll, maybe for them it'll be a funny story.

512
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,620
Unless they have had to, you know,

513
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,640
unless they have catered to you

514
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,500
in some sort of special way for your entire life,

515
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,820
which I, you know, I hope is not the situation.

516
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,540
They carry pillows around you all the time.

517
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,680
Yeah, that would not be ideal.

518
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,820
I think you gotta get out in front of,

519
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,200
well, not in front of, on top of this one.

520
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,740
You should stand up at the next family gathering,

521
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,120
and say, hello, everyone, I have big news.

522
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,440
I cured my fainting disorder by eating organically.

523
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,280
Yes.

524
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,540
Amazingly enough, by eating only organic foods,

525
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,020
I cured my fainting issue,

526
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,780
and I would like to do sort of a speaking tour about it.

527
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,740
I guess that kind of gets even deeper in the line,

528
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,580
doesn't it? Yeah, it does juice out.

529
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,820
Just kind of just another layer,

530
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,740
cause then you gotta eat organically all the time.

531
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,940
It's even worse.

532
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Hey, Lauren, I just saw you eat at Twinkie.

533
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,600
Are you gonna be okay?

534
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,780
Travis, you wanna know something weird?

535
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,780
When I was thinking of the next step of that joke,

536
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,220
Twinkie was gonna be my food,

537
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,020
as well, I guess that's the least organic, I guess.

538
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,380
Yes, I would say so.

539
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,220
I think the plastic that wraps the Twinkie

540
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,100
is more organic than the Twinkie itself.

541
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,980
But listen, if the makers of Twinkie are listening,

542
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,660
I do love them.

543
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,260
Yeah, huge fans over here.

544
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,820
Know thyself, you know?

545
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,480
Lauren, take their asses to Applebee's,

546
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,300
and just say it, because it's rough stuff.

547
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,100
I like, this is one of a subcategory of questions

548
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,100
that I always enjoy, which is questions

549
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,260
where the subtext is,

550
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,160
PS, my family and anyone who knows me

551
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,680
will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

552
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,740
listen to your podcast.

553
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Cause there's no way, there's no way

554
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,900
someone's listening to this,

555
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,940
and they're like, a Lauren from Kentucky

556
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,180
that fainted on the bleachers in fifth grade

557
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,280
and almost died?

558
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,620
There's no way that there is another one of those.

559
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,600
So you're basically also saying,

560
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,600
you've limited yourself as a point of origin

561
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,300
for sharing this show.

562
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,100
You'll never be able to share the show with your family.

563
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,920
And that's really the bigger tragedy,

564
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,100
if you think about it.

565
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,660
How about another Yahoo?

566
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,340
Yeah, I'd like that Trav, thanks.

567
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,820
Oh, you're Griffin.

568
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,660
Wow.

569
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,340
Why'd it just happen?

570
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,260
I just did the wrong one.

571
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,080
I did the wrong one.

572
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,940
You said the wrong dang one of us, didn't ya?

573
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,540
Oh boy, I get, there's a lot of you guys.

574
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,040
That's fair.

575
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,700
Whenever someone is in Huntington

576
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,920
that is not like a close friend of the family,

577
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,220
I always know, because when they come to greet me,

578
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,220
they're like, Mr. McElroy, it's like, oh fuck you.

579
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,660
Say it, say my name, say my first name,

580
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,420
say which one I am, say which one I am.

581
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,600
Jareth.

582
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,540
Michelle sent this one in, thanks.

583
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,600
It's from Yahoo Answers user Jordan, who asks,

584
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,060
is there a not weird way to wear a pocket watch

585
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,140
with modern day casual clothes?

586
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,860
I prefer to be always wearing a t-shirt

587
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,580
and will never be seen in casual attire in public

588
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,380
without a full zip hoodie, even in the summer,

589
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,660
and I wanna wear this really cool pocket watch I have.

590
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,220
Any ideas that don't look weird

591
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,960
or make anyone conversing with me think,

592
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,460
well, look at this weirdo, or something of that nature?

593
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,900
Hang it off the zipper.

594
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,740
That could be a look, right?

595
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,180
Yeah, Justin. The zipper of the jacket?

596
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,220
Yeah, yeah, if you attach it directly to your hoodie zipper,

597
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,060
is that something?

598
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,820
Well, yeah, and then when it's zipped all the way up,

599
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,560
depending on the length of the chain,

600
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,860
maybe it's just like-

601
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,940
Replace the string that tightens the hood with the chain.

602
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,660
That would be a look, right?

603
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,220
That would mean something.

604
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,460
It would be something.

605
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,300
It would be something.

606
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,580
The problem is, Justin, you would need

607
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,580
either a second pocket watch or some sort of counterweight,

608
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,900
some sort of ballast to keep the chain

609
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,780
from being just ripped from the hoodie.

610
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,820
So maybe, and maybe this is good,

611
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,220
this is our all-day carry,

612
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,580
and this, Justin's just opened up

613
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,240
a lot of exciting cargo opportunities,

614
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,460
some very exciting sort of Death Stranding play

615
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,820
we can get into right here.

616
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,460
On one side of my hoodie chain,

617
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,020
I've got my pocket watch, of course,

618
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,600
because I don't wanna be late for any of my appointments.

619
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,840
Plus, you never know who you have to hypnotize.

620
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,940
Exactly.

621
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,620
Hanging from the other side perfectly

622
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,080
weighs exactly as much as my pocket watch.

623
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,660
I could have, you know, a gigapet.

624
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,820
I could have, you know, a phone battery.

625
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,620
I could have some lifesavers.

626
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,600
A sandwich.

627
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,140
Sandwich would be,

628
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,660
I think it's gotta be fairly non-perishable.

629
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,020
A big knife.

630
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,140
A big knife, Travis, that's cool.

631
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,660
Sheathed or unsheathed?

632
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,500
Loose.

633
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,820
That's a loose knife.

634
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,660
A loose swing of knives.

635
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,280
And when you walk in a room, you can say,

636
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,620
it's cutting time.

637
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,460
It's cutting time.

638
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,340
Let me check my watch.

639
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,660
Yeah, it's cutting time.

640
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,620
That's good. It's cutting time.

641
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,620
I love questions that have fun jump-offs for improvisation.

642
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,700
Right now, is our bit just naming things

643
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,900
that weigh about as much as a pocket watch?

644
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,180
Cause I feel like we could be on this merry ground

645
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,400
for quite some time.

646
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,660
Just keep the pocket.

647
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,720
Don't attach the chain to anything.

648
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,580
Put it in your pocket, loose.

649
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,620
And then if you need to look at the time,

650
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,940
you grab the end of the chain

651
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,180
and you slowly draw it out of your pocket.

652
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,760
Then you hold it up in front of your face.

653
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,800
You look at it.

654
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,940
Then you put the whole thing back in your pocket.

655
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,340
Make it a show.

656
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,180
Make it a thing.

657
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,820
Leave it loose in your pocket with your keys and wallet

658
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,340
and just wait until you go through a metal detector.

659
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,820
And have three other pocket watches in each pocket.

660
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,100
You have anything else metal?

661
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,220
I mean, are pocket watches metal?

662
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,540
Oh, I got a few of those.

663
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,380
Wait, is this one?

664
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,660
What about this one?

665
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,240
Is metal the hard stuff from trees?

666
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,700
Or, I can't even remember.

667
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,100
Is that the cave stuff or is it the tree stuff?

668
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,100
Let's take a quick break.

669
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,940
Okay.

670
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,820
I'm sorry, do you have another joke

671
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,700
about things that weigh as much as pocket watches?

672
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,060
Another pocket watch.

673
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh, a compass.

674
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,620
Okay, yeah, no, let's go money zone.

675
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,740
The compass thing really landed.

676
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
On the leath-o-meter.

677
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,460
Our first sponsor this week is Squarespace.

678
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,460
If you have a big idea, don't sit on it.

679
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,820
Don't keep it in your heart.

680
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,420
Get it out there into the world unless-

681
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,260
Ow!

682
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,980
Sorry, I sat on my big idea.

683
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,460
Unless it could hurt other people.

684
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,300
Oh, I see.

685
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,020
Folks, please don't harness the incredible power

686
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,340
of Squarespace with its ability to showcase your work,

687
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,940
sell products and services of all kinds,

688
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,060
or promote your physical or online business.

689
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,660
Do not harness this to do wicked in the world.

690
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,100
This is a plea from us.

691
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
This technology's too powerful, folks.

692
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,980
They got beautiful customizable templates

693
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,260
created by world-class designers,

694
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,900
analytics to help you grow in real time,

695
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,800
and nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

696
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,560
And if you use that as a tool to destroy those around you,

697
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,220
people are gonna get hurt, folks.

698
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,420
This is serious.

699
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,500
Stop goofing around with Squarespace in a reckless way.

700
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,380

off your first purchase of a website or domain.

709
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,860
Squarespace.

710
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,340
Fucking be careful.

711
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,160
Squarespace is partnered with a third-party group

712
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,780
called Shitbomb, and the other day I tweeted,

713
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,100
who lives on the internet, on my PC,

714
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,180
shit, bob, square, space,

715
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,920
and I feel like it didn't get enough attention.

716
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,780
So I just wanted to drop that in here in the episode.

717
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,880
This has been another segment of Travis's goofs

718
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,060
that didn't land on,

719
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,080
Travis's Secondhand Goof Shelter.

720
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,620
Hey, this is a gently used goof.

721
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,500
For 25 cents a day, you can adopt one of Travis's

722
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,880
failed Twitter goofs.

723
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
Keep it out of the rain and storm

724
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,620
of not being especially good.

725
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,100
I figure if I brawl in the audience, I'll find the target.

726
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,180
I wanna tell you about Quip.

727
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
What you got in that mouth?

728
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,780
Teeth, tongue, the tip of the lips.

729
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,180
Nope, that's outside of the mouth,

730
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,900
but Quip is gonna handle all the inside stuff.

731
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,420
Seriously, what's on there?

732
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,340
Look at your teeth.

733
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,460
Now look at my teeth.

734
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,580
See the difference?

735
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,300
It's because I Quip, I Quip, baby.

736
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,980
I have good brushing habits because of Quip,

737
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,940
and if you have bad brushing habits, what?

738
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,460
With your plaque, if you've got little bugs in there,

739
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,980
little, if you've got dirt and sticks in your teeth,

740
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,080
then Quip is gonna help you get good brushing habits

741
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,000
in the new year, or probably, if you have dirt and bugs,

742
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,720
probably start immediately.

743
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,860
Anyway, it's a thoughtful and practical gift.

744
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,180
It's an electric toothbrush.

745
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,180
They got refillable floss and toothpaste with Quip now,

746
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,340
and it helps you make your good habits real simple.

747
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,660
It's got sonic vibrations and a timer with 30-second pulses

748
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,500
to guide your routine, and they have this floss dispenser

749
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,900
that has pre-marked strings,

750
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,220
so you always use the exact right amount,

751
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,020
and they'll deliver Brush Head's floss and toothpaste refills

752
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,660
every three months for you.

753
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,920
So there's over three million happy customers,

754
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,740
so maybe get some holiday gifts with Quip.

755
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,180
Just go to getquip.com slash my brother to save on gift sets

756
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,020

758
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,580
That's your first refill free

759
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,260
at getquip.com slash my brother,

760
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,980
getquip.com slash my brother.

761
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,180
Hey, if you like your podcast to be focused

762
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,140
and well-researched and your podcast host

763
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,100
to be uncharismatic, unhorny strangers

764
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,660
who have no interest in horses,

765
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,380
then this is not the podcast for you.

766
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,540
Again, what's your deal?

767
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,340
I'm Emily.

768
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,180
I'm Lisa.

769
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,700
Our show's called Baby Geniuses.

770
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,820
And its hosts are horny adult idiots.

771
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,780
We discover weird Wikipedia pages every episode.

772
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,040
We discuss institutional misogyny.

773
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,100
We ask each other the dumbest questions,

774
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,020
and our listeners won't stop sending us pictures

775
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,860
of their butts.

776
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,660
We haven't asked them to stop, but they also aren't stopping.

777
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,660
Join us on Baby Geniuses.

778
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,880
Every other week on MaximumFun.org.

779
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,340
Can I derail the show with a special segment?

780
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Yeah. Sure.

781
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,540
I need complete silence.

782
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,420
Come and sit with me now in the candlelight.

783
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah, this Christmas we're gonna do right.

784
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,420
Hang some lights on the tree.

785
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,380
Yeah, that's a Christmas to me.

786
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,620
Put your arm around the fire.

787
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Yeah, I don't want any more, no.

788
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Yeah, you're calling me a liar.

789
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,620
But I'm gonna go out for a jog.

790
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
That's a Christmas to me.

791
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,620
You and me and her and a tree.

792
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Running about birds and the bees.

793
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
That's a Christmas to me.

794
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,620
So this is my new segment, That's a Christmas to Me.

795
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Thank you to Adam Sakiyama for that lovely orchestration.

796
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
This is That's a Christmas to Me,

797
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,620
a haunting segment that I'm looking forward

798
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,620
to sharing with you guys.

799
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,620
I can't wait to see you.

800
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,620
I can't wait.

801
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,620
I need something to fill me with the fricking spirit.

802
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,620
Here's the way this game works.

803
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,620
I'm going to read to you three hallmark Christmas movies,

804
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,620
synopses, casts, titles.

805
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Two of them are real films.

806
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,620
One of them comes from my mind's eye.

807
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,620
Now for anyone, maybe this is your first time

808
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,620
hearing the segment, Griffin and I have historically

809
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,620
been very bad at this game.

810
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,620
Or one could argue, I am very good.

811
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
Okay.

812
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,620
And by I, I mean.

813
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Sydney.

814
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,620
My wife, Sydney.

815
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,620
Yes.

816
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
And also to a lesser extent, me.

817
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
Here we go.

818
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
A Charming Christmas.

819
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,620
Tiffany, Lori Loughlin, has made a name for herself,

820
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
crafting the most intricate and sought after holiday

821
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
themed charms at the Carlsberg Bracelet Company.

822
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
When Mr. Carlsberg decided to move on,

823
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Tiffany assumed she'll move into the top spot.

824
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
That is until David, Gabriel Hogan,

825
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,620
is brought on to modernize Carlsberg's operations

826
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620
by mass producing the charms that the company

827
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,620
has been hand making for over a century.

828
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,620
David is tasked with learning Tiffany's craft,

829
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
which he realizes may be harder to replicate

830
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
than he first thought.

831
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
As the deadline for Christmas production looms

832
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
and sparks fly, the pair realize there may be a way

833
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
forward they never anticipated,

834
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
both for the company and each other.

835
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
God.

836
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
Damn, that's good.

837
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
It's called A Charming Christmas.

838
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,620
That's very good.

839
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
Hats off to Christmas.

840
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:56,620
Mia, Haley Duff, the loyal and hardworking manager

841
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,620
of her small town's Christmas hat shop,

842
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,620
her small town's Christmas hat shop is blindsided

843
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,620
when her boss of over 10 years asks her to train

844
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,620
his son, Nick Antonio Cupo, for a vacant

845
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,620
upper management position that Mia had been coveting.

846
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Though Nick is a handsome, successful New York

847
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,620
business consultant, Mia finds training him frustrating

848
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,620
until Nick takes an interest in Mia's son, Scotty.

849
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Shawn Michael Kyre, helping Scotty

850
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,620
with a pumpkin carving contest.

851
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,620
However, Mia's faith in Nick quickly diminishes.

852
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Wait, a pumpkin carving contest?

853
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
A pumpkin carving contest?

854
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
Quickly diminishes when Nick fails to show up

855
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
at the contest.

856
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
To protect her son from further disappointment,

857
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
Mia tries to keep Nick out of her and Scotty's

858
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
fragile life, and Nick must decide if staying

859
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
in the small town of Wilsonville is worth giving

860
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
up the big city perks he once had in New York.

861
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,620
As Mia struggles to find a way to convince Scotty

862
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,620
to return to physical therapy so he can walk again,

863
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
she soon realizes that Nick may be the Christmas

864
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
miracle she has been waiting for.

865
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
That is called Hats Off to Christmas.

866
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Oh wow.

867
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
That's for sure.

868
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
Juice, I think the world of you and Sydney,

869
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,620
that one's real because your two minds' eyes

870
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,620
are not capable of generating something like that.

871
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,620
I agree with, from the start, you say Haley Duff

872
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
and immediately I'm like, that's not a Justin

873
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
and Sydney poll.

874
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
That's Earth.

875
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,620
That's life did that to us.

876
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Best Christmas party ever.

877
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,620
Jeannie Stanton, Tori DeVito, throws the best

878
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,620
Christmas parties every year for her company,

879
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Petra's Parties.

880
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Things are a little different this year as Petra

881
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
is retiring and looks to the next generation

882
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
to take over.

883
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,620
Jeannie thinks that she has her new job in the bag

884
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,620
until Petra's charismatic nephew Nick, Steve Lund,

885
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,620
shows up as seasonal help and his natural talent

886
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,620
and confidence clashes with Jeannie's team,

887
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,620
stern work ethic, and traditional values.

888
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
The pair battle it out for the top job with

889
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
unmistakable chemistry and symmetry,

890
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,620
but when the new owners of the legendary Terrell's Toys

891
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
put the bottom line before Christmas spirit,

892
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,620
threatening to pull the plug on Terrell's Toys'

893
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
annual Christmas party for the community,

894
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
Jeannie and Nick are forced to work together

895
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
to throw the greatest Christmas party ever.

896
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,620
The first and third movies are the same movie.

897
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
They're all three the same movie.

898
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,620
They're all three about a talented woman

899
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,620
being displaced by an unqualified man.

900
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,620
Am I correct?

901
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,620
And by all three, we mean literally every movie

902
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
on the Hallmark service.

903
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Yes, well, yes.

904
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Well, there's time travel ones, too.

905
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Yeah, you're right.

906
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,620
I have my answer.

907
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,620
To remind you, the titles are A Charming Christmas,

908
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,620
Hats Off to Christmas, and Best Christmas Party Ever.

909
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,620
I will count to three, and then you two

910
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
will both say the title of the fake film.

911
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,620
One, two, three.

912
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
A Charming Christmas.

913
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
Oh, boy.

914
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Continuing his streak, Griffin McElroy, you have done it.

915
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,620
A Charming Christmas is a fake film.

916
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,620
King of Games.

917
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Fake film.

918
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,620
Best Christmas Party Ever is real,

919
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,620
and Hats Off to Christmas is incredibly real.

920
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,620
Hey, Hats Off to Christmas, you can't have

921
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,620
a pumpkin carving contest in the fucking shit.

922
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,620
I almost cut it.

923
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
This is, honest to God, I almost didn't include it

924
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
in the synopsis because it's like, well, they'll fucking know.

925
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,620
I mean, I know not to do that, but they didn't know

926
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
not to do that.

927
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Also, you can't six sentences in be like,

928
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,620
oh, by the way, the kid might never walk again,

929
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,620
and this dude didn't show up for his pumpkin carving contest.

930
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,620
Like, okay.

931
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Maybe the guy thought it was a joke.

932
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Well, certainly.

933
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,620
No, it's December.

934
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,620
I thought you were kidding.

935
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,620
It's December.

936
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
There's no way there's a pumpkin carving contest.

937
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
You can't get pumpkin.

938
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Everything's snow now.

939
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
What are you talking about?

940
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
I literally couldn't buy a pumpkin now if I wanted to.

941
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
If I wanted to, I could not buy a pumpkin.

942
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Did you get a bunch and save them for two months?

943
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
No, they're all soft and gushy.

944
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,620
The perfect time to carve them.

945
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,620
They're really easy to carve.

946
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
Thank you, Justin, for this gift, and thank you, Sydney.

947
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,620
It's a kind gift.

948
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
How about another question?

949
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,620
Yes.

950
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,620
Is that where we're leaning?

951
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,620
Okay.

952
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,620
I'm a college student with a drawing professor

953
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,620
that's really, really into Crocs.

954
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,620
He wears Crocs in the class and has an Instagram

955
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,620
dedicated to showcasing different Crocs slash Croc-related memes.

956
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,620
As a thank you present at the end of the semester,

957
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
our class has contemplated purchasing him a pair of white Crocs,

958
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,620
signing our names with a permanent marker,

959
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,620
and presenting them as a gift.

960
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
That's nice.

961
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,620
However, none of us know what shoe size he wears.

962
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
What's a non-creepy way to find someone shoe size

963
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:34,620
without also obviously revealing you're about to buy them plastic shoes?

964
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,620
That's from Covert Crocs in Kansas.

965
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,620
We will get to the nugget of the question in a second,

966
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,620
but if I may question asker,

967
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,620
if you're going to be signing them,

968
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,620
do you need to get them in the professor's shoe size?

969
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
Do you think he's going to wear them?

970
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,620
You have imagined a reality in which this guy's like,

971
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,620
everybody check the kicks.

972
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Signed by all my studiantes.

973
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
So sweet, beloved.

974
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,620
Anyway, let's mosh.

975
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,620
Anyways, time for some frolf.

976
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:13,620
Anyways, I now pronounce you man and wife.

977
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,620
Anyways, I'm going to miss my grandma very much.

978
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Ashes to ashes and all that, let's rock.

979
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,620
Crocs life.

980
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Croc life.

981
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:29,620
Could you, for an earlier holiday of some sort,

982
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,620
get your professor a Brannock device and have just say like,

983
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
yeah, use it.

984
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,620
He puts his foot in it to measure it right then and there.

985
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,620
And he's like, I'm going to use this, I guess.

986
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
It's a bad plan.

987
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
Did you look up what it's called?

988
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
A Brannock device?

989
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,620
You just knew that?

990
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
Everybody knows that, Travis.

991
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
What am I going to call it?

992
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
A shoe measuring tool?

993
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Yeah.

994
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,620
Travis, I'm very literate and I don't even have a keyboard.

995
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,620
So how would I search the name of such a device, Travis?

996
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
Oh, you're right.

997
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Wait a second.

998
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,620
I don't, Trav.

999
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,620
Have a keyboard.

1000
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,620
I just wait for the internet to show me stuff.

1001
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,620
You know me.

1002
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,620
The oracle.

1003
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620
I don't even have a keyboard to type stuff in.

1004
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,620
One way would be to go to your professor and tell him you're

1005
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,620
conducting a study on the connection between size people's

1006
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,620
genitalia and shoe size.

1007
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,620
Interesting.

1008
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,620
And then you get both the answers for the study.

1009
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,620
And two pairs of crocs.

1010
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,620
You get kicked out of class, probably.

1011
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
I'm realizing now.

1012
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
It's kind of foolhardy.

1013
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,620
I don't think that would be appropriate.

1014
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,620
Mine's not appropriate.

1015
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Well, you could just say, you don't need to measure their

1016
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,620
weenie, you know?

1017
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
You do.

1018
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,620
You have to at least say, you have to get an estimate.

1019
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
A guesstimate, maybe.

1020
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,620
You do have to get an estimate on genitalia size.

1021
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,620
You're going to need to get it in metric.

1022
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,620
Which, yes.

1023
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,620
Now, what about, you have to get it in shoe size.

1024
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,620
I'm just going to throw this out here, because if it was a foot,

1025
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,620
if your genitalia was a foot, what would its favorite ice cream

1026
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,620
flavor be?

1027
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
And it is.

1028
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,620
You could break into their house.

1029
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,620
Don't chirp at my foot, dick.

1030
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,620
I pressed my cricket button, but didn't turn the soundboard on.

1031
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,620
So I don't think that's on the recording.

1032
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,620
So I think it's just going to be Griffin shouting,

1033
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,620
don't chirp at my foot, dick.

1034
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
Anyways, break into his house.

1035
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,620
We'll get it in post.

1036
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,620
And check his other shoes.

1037
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
That works.

1038
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,620
Shoe wrestling.

1039
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,620
Shoe wrestling?

1040
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,620
Play a game of trade shoe.

1041
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,620
Play a game of tradie shoes, or battle shoes.

1042
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Oh, yeah.

1043
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,620
This is where you take your shoes off and try to hit them

1044
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,620
and knock them out of the victory zone.

1045
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,620
Yeah, you could do flip shoe.

1046
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Flip shoe's good.

1047
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Stink guesser.

1048
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,620
I'm glad there's so many games with shoes in it.

1049
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,620
Oh, make it.

1050
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,620
Oh, OK.

1051
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,620
I think this is actually a thing.

1052
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,620
But like a team building exercise where everyone piles

1053
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,620
one of their shoes in the middle of the floor,

1054
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:14,620
and then you try to figure out whose shoe matches who, right?

1055
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,620
That could be a good thing.

1056
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
That's a bad team building exercise, Travis.

1057
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
Well, it's more of a getting to know you thing of how well

1058
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,620
do you know each other's shoes.

1059
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,620
But would they not be wearing the matching shoe

1060
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,620
on their other foot?

1061
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,620
Justin, any ideas?

1062
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
I already did mine.

1063
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,620
It was good, and it worked already.

1064
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,620
So the person already knows the shoe size.

1065
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,620
Oh, OK.

1066
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,620
Yeah, the genitalia survey.

1067
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,620
They went with that one, weirdly.

1068
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,620
You know what?

1069
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,620
You can't go wrong with a good nine and a half.

1070
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,620
It falls pretty close to the middle,

1071
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,620
and a good nine and a half is going to do it.

1072
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,620
The only way that a nine and a half would not be the right

1073
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,620
shoe size is if they wear a 10 or larger,

1074
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,620
or a nine or smaller.

1075
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,620
Other than that, though, nine and a half is going to get them

1076
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
every single time.

1077
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,620
No, you don't understand, Justin, you stupid idiot.

1078
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,620
A nine and a half is so close to the middle of shoe size.

1079
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,620
Is it?

1080
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620
OK, a 10.

1081
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,620
Thank you.

1082
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,620
A 10, a nice average 10.

1083
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,620
You put that on there, it's probably going to fit.

1084
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620
It's close enough, don't you think?

1085
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
Here's what you do.

1086
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,620
When you hand them the box with the signed Crocs inside,

1087
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,620
the signed Crocs box, just make sure there's a gift receipt

1088
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
in there so they can exchange them.

1089
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,620
Yeah, I doubt the Crocs company is going to want any pair

1090
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,620
of Crocs back, though.

1091
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
I think every time Crocs sells-

1092
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Especially if they're signed.

1093
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620
Admittedly, that's going to be an issue.

1094
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,620
Yeah, that's not going to be great.

1095
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
I have a Yahoo.

1096
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,620
This one was sent in by Graham Robock.

1097
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Thanks, Graham.

1098
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,620
It's from Mastermind587, who asks.

1099
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Oh, I love their questions.

1100
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,620
Why isn't there restaurants anymore?

1101
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,620
Are like the old western saloon.

1102
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,620
Yes.

1103
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,620
You know restaurants that are made like the old western saloon?

1104
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,620
Well, not anymore.

1105
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,620
For example, the atmosphere is very stylistic.

1106
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,620
The restaurant has pictures, wallpaper, nice fancy clock,

1107
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
and they have really fine looking tables,

1108
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,620
and the piano is at the corner for the pianist.

1109
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,620
There's a nice carpet on the floor.

1110
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,620
I mean, with Chain Restaurant, even Olive Garden,

1111
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,620
you don't get this kind of stuff anymore.

1112
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,620
So that's what a saloon is.

1113
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,620
But, okay, I've watched many a cowboy movie.

1114
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,620
I've never once seen them walk into carpet, ever.

1115
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,620
Even the rest of it aside.

1116
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,620
Well, there's them some right pretty pictures

1117
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,620
you got hanging up on the wall,

1118
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,620
with your wallpaper and the nice fancy clock there, Jed.

1119
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,620
I like this table, I sure could kill a man upon it

1120
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,620
if he cheated me at cards.

1121
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,620
Where's your spittoon?

1122
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,620
Are you kidding?

1123
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,620
I have fucking carpet in here.

1124
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,620
Get the fuck out of here.

1125
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,620
You're right, that one's on me.

1126
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,620
Now dance, pow pow.

1127
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,620
Oh my god, I shot up your carpet.

1128
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,620
I feel terrible.

1129
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,620
I'm sorry, I'll get this replaced ASAP.

1130
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
Oh boy.

1131
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,620
I bet this was special order too, it's so nice.

1132
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,620
Let's ignore the fact that this person has no idea

1133
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,620
what saloons is.

1134
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,620
Okay.

1135
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,620
But why aren't there restaurants anymore

1136
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,620
are like the old western saloon,

1137
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,620
is a question that I would also like answered.

1138
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,620
We tamed the west.

1139
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,620
You know, you go into, I mean, here in Huntington, West Virginia,

1140
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,620
we got Logan's Roadhouse, Texas Roadhouse,

1141
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,620
that's carrying on the tradition.

1142
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,620
Yeah.

1143
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,620
Right, you can throw peanuts right on the dang floor.

1144
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
It's not the same.

1145
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
Not the same.

1146
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,620
But it's got like, for one thing,

1147
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,620
there's a lot of anachronisms, right?

1148
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
There's air conditioning,

1149
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,620
there's probably refrigerated food and ice.

1150
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,620
I like it in saloons in the movies and TV shows

1151
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,620
with cowboys in it, where they sit at the bar

1152
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,620
and they just sort of grab a bottle of warm brown stuff

1153
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
and give them a big cup of that.

1154
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,620
And I guess they just know what that is

1155
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,620
and like drinking it.

1156
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,620
Nobody orders in fingers anymore.

1157
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,620
Nobody says like, give me two fingers

1158
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,620
of your best sipping whiskey, right?

1159
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,620
That's pretty cool.

1160
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,620
That's pretty cool.

1161
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,620
We need to order like that again.

1162
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,620
You know what, maybe that's it.

1163
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,620
Maybe it has nothing to do with decor,

1164
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,620
but rather the atmosphere in general.

1165
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,620
I've never walked into a restaurant-

1166
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,620
The spirit of the west.

1167
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,620
Because here's the thing.

1168
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,620
First of all, I don't need a door that goes

1169
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,620
from the top of the doorframe to the bottom.

1170
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,620
Only the middle third, for some reason,

1171
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,620
and it needs to swing open in the middle.

1172
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,620
That's all we really need.

1173
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,620
Hey, stop.

1174
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,620
What is up with that door?

1175
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,620
Yes.

1176
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,620
Hey, that's almost like saying,

1177
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,620
I'm going to afford a real door someday.

1178
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,620
I know there should be a door here.

1179
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,620
I put a toy door in as a joke for my friends.

1180
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,620
Oh, I thought this door would be bigger

1181
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,620
when I ordered it.

1182
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,620
Guys are throwing each other through this dang thing

1183
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,620
all the time.

1184
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,620
I just wanted two little toy doors

1185
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,620
so I could save up enough for a good door, a real one.

1186
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,620
It basically says that when someone walks up to it,

1187
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,620
they just need to see their face and their crotch down.

1188
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,620
That's it.

1189
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,620
I don't need to know what's on their chest.

1190
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,620
But I've never walked into, for your example, Justin,

1191
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,620
at Logan's Roadhouse, and had the player piano stop

1192
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,620
and everybody turn and look at me.

1193
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,620
That should be customary, absolutely.

1194
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,620
Do y'all think, back in cowfolk's days,

1195
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,620
they would be sitting around in a saloon

1196
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,620
with the joke door, with the spit canister,

1197
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,620
with the warm brown stuff, with the fights and poker

1198
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:44,620
and probably smoke and probably stinky people in general.

1199
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,620
They were all probably sitting around like,

1200
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,620
gang, we can do better than this, right?

1201
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,620
Yeah, this sucks.

1202
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,620
Hey guys, I get it.

1203
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,620
It's the Wild West and things are rough

1204
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,620
and a lot of things haven't been invented yet,

1205
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,620
and that's too bad.

1206
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
I can't wait for that stuff to get invented,

1207
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
but I'll for sure be dead before that happens.

1208
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,620
So can we just be a little cleaner in here?

1209
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:16,620
Can we hold ourselves to a slightly nicer standard in here?

1210
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,620
I always think about that in cowboy movies,

1211
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,620
whenever a cowboy gets excited or is trying to calm everyone down

1212
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,620
and they shoot their gun up in the air,

1213
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,620
that you have to think the owner of the saloon is like,

1214
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,620
God damn it, it rains.

1215
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,620
Like you just shot a goddamn hole in my ceiling.

1216
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,620
Even if it didn't rain,

1217
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:36,620
we're all just trying to have a nice time

1218
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,620
and you've just discharged a firearm.

1219
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,620
Yeah, you shot the piano.

1220
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,620
Do you know how hard it is to get a piano in the Old West?

1221
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,620
It's hard, they're heavy.

1222
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,620
They don't have airplanes yet, guys.

1223
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,620
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1224
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,620
We're not gonna have air conditioning in here,

1225
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,620
so just perish that dream away.

1226
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,620
But in lieu of that,

1227
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,620
can we not just piss on the floor, right?

1228
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,620
Yeah, and if any of you want to wear shorts, you can.

1229
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,620
Just shorts, guys, you don't need chaps.

1230
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,620
It's hot as frick out here, okay?

1231
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,620
Shorts and a t-shirt, that's fine.

1232
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
That's fine.

1233
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,620
If you guys want to dress more comfortably,

1234
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,620
and I'm looking at everybody,

1235
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,620
because some of the ladies in here got like 18 layers.

1236
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,620
Just shorts and a t-shirt, everybody.

1237
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,620
We'll all be happier and nicer.

1238
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,620
Same names.

1239
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,620
But scrub your nuts.

1240
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,620
It smells so bad, guys.

1241
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,620
It smells so bad.

1242
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,620
I'm in here, and I would love to have a Diet Coke.

1243
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,620
I can't.

1244
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,620
I'm going to have the warm brown stuff.

1245
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,620
That's apparently the only fluid they have back there.

1246
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,620
But when I drink this warm brown stuff I don't want,

1247
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,620
could I not smell your nuts?

1248
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,620
Can you just give them a scrub?

1249
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,620
Chaps are like the saloon doors of pants.

1250
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,620
It says, yeah, I know I should be wearing pants,

1251
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,620
but I'm going to leave my balls out here for everyone.

1252
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,620
By the way, it was to ventilate cigar smoke,

1253
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,620
and because the cowboys would carry saddlebags,

1254
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,620
and they'd have to go in and out,

1255
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,620
so the fact that the doors swung bidirectionally

1256
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,620
is very practical.

1257
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,620
That to me seems like an after the fact justification

1258
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,620
for dumb doors.

1259
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,620
For bad doors that they cut too short.

1260
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,620
No, it's perfect.

1261
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
This is a new style from Paris.

1262
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,620
I measured none and cut once.

1263
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:32,620
Hey, could you build me a new door?

1264
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,620
It's going to be like three weeks.

1265
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,620
Do we get more wood?

1266
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
We're in the desert.

1267
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,620
There's only eight trees in America.

1268
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:44,620
I could go to Home Depot in 120 years.

1269
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:48,620
I'm going to wait here for 120 years until Home Depot

1270
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,620
crops up here and I'll run right over.

1271
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,620
You always get the size of the coffins right.

1272
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,620
Well, I measure for those.

1273
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,620
Those are people's size.

1274
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,620
Easy.

1275
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,620
It's a size 10.

1276
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,620
It fits most corpses.

1277
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,620
Some of them we got to scrunch up a little bit.

1278
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,620
And some of them we got to put bricks in the bottom

1279
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,620
for them to stand on.

1280
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,620
It's fine.

1281
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,620
It's funny.

1282
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,620
Funny joke.

1283
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,620
And we take funny pictures with them,

1284
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,620
because it takes two hours to take a single picture,

1285
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,620
and we like it that way.

1286
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,620
Now spit in that bucket that's right next to where

1287
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,620
you eat your food.

1288
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
I'm not dipping chaw.

1289
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,620
Do I still have to spit in the bucket?

1290
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,620
You do.

1291
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,620
It's customary.

1292
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,620
But you can throw your peanut shells right on the floor.

1293
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,620
Then I'll vacuum the carpet later.

1294
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,620
Anyway, our sequel 101 Ways to Die in the West

1295
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,620
is coming out next fall.

1296
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,620
Hope you all come out and see it.

1297
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,620
These are just a sneak preview of some of the jokes

1298
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,620
that we're going to have.

1299
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,620
We just fully put Peter Griffin in this one.

1300
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,620
Like he's fully in it.

1301
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:53,620
If you got a little free time and maybe a few free coins,

1302
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:58,620
we want to let you know that our game, our board game,

1303
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,620
the Adventure Zone Bureau of Balance,

1304
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,620
is going to go on presale.

1305
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,620
When is it exactly?

1306
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,620
On the 11th.

1307
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,620
So in two days.

1308
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,620
On Wednesday the 11th.

1309
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,620
It's a cooperative storytelling card game

1310
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,620
that expands on the Bureau of Balance,

1311
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,620
the Adventure Zone Balance universe.

1312
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,620
You don't need a DM to play it.

1313
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,620
It's rules light and easy and fun to learn.

1314
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,620
We partnered with two other studios to do it.

1315
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,620
And if you go to theadventurezonegame.com,

1316
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,620
you can find out more information.

1317
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,620
That is also where the pre-order will be.

1318
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,620
Listen, we've played it.

1319
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,620
It's super fun.

1320
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,620
You're going to love it.

1321
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,620
Yes, it's good.

1322
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,620
Also, we've got the Candlelight Show coming up.

1323
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,620
If you haven't already, email us your questions.

1324
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,620
And that includes Yahoo's with Candlelight's

1325
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,620
in the subject line.

1326
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,620
We've got a bunch of new merch up in the merch shop.

1327
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,620
You can go to mcrorymerch.com.

1328
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,620
What else, boys?

1329
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,620
Well, I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1330
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,620
for the use of our theme song.

1331
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,620
It's a departure off the album,

1332
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,620
Putting the Days to Bed.

1333
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,620
You're going to have a great time listening

1334
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,620
to this one with the kids.

1335
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,620
I also want to thank Maximum Fun

1336
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,620

1337
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,620

And check out all our other stuff at mcrory.family.

1343
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,620
Oh, Justin and I are doing the besties again

1344
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,620
with our friends Russ Frushtick and Chris Plant.

1345
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,620
It's a video game podcast that we used to do

1346
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,620
a long time ago for Polygon.

1347
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,620
Now we're doing it with Spotify.

1348
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,620
And you can check it out, well, wherever.

1349
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,620
We put up a few episodes

1350
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,620
for whatever podcast platform that you use.

1351
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,620
But yeah, after that, it will be Spotify exclusive.

1352
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,620
So go check it out.

1353
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620
And how about that final?

1354
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,620
Yes.

1355
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,620
Yes.

1356
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,620
This final Yahoo was sent in by Madeline.

1357
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:51,620
It's Yahoo Answers user NERBAL who asks,

1358
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,620
How do I tell my wife that I ate her fancy soaps

1359
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,620
that she bought for the bathroom?

1360
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,620
My name is Justin McElroy.

1361
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,620
I'm Travis McElroy.

1362
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,620
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1363
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,620
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1364
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,620
Kiss your dad.

1365
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:23,620
Square on the lips.

1366
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,620
Maximum fun dot org.

1367
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,620
Comedy and culture.

1368
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
Artist owned.

1369
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Audience supported.

1370
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,620
I've got a message for you.

1371
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,620
Hi, it's me, April Wolf, the host of Switchblade Sisters

1372
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,620
and co-writer of the new horror film Black Christmas.

1373
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,620
And I'm Katie Walsh, film critic

1374
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,620
and occasional host of Switchblade Sisters.

1375
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,620
We're here to announce that for one episode,

1376
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,620
we will be doing something a little different.

1377
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,620
Much like Jeff Goldblum and David Cronenberg's The Fly,

1378
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,620
I will be going through a truly disturbing transformation.

1379
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:53,620
April will transform from the interviewer into the interviewee.

1380
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,620
I will be asking her all about her new film Black Christmas,

1381
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,620
her writing process and ongoing existential dread.

1382
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,620
But I will also be discussing John Carpenter's perfect masterpiece, Prince of Darkness.

1383
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,620
You guys seen any movies you like?

1384
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,620
So tune in to Switchblade Sisters for a one-of-a-kind episode

1385
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,620
with April Wolf and me, Katie Walsh.

1386
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,620
See you then.

1387
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:30,620
Only the corrupt are listened to now.
