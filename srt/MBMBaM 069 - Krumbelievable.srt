1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Live from Seattle, baby, we hear the blues a-callin',

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,440
tossed salad and scrambled eggs, all three of us here in beautiful Washington,

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,400
tossed salad and scrambled eggs. What the hell are you talking about?

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,840
All three of us here for my brother, my brother, and me in sunny Seattle, beautiful weather.

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,320
I don't know what people are talking about with the cloudy and the rainy.

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,480
I it's been gorgeous. It's just been sunny, funny summer. Yeah,

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,520
it is. And all three of us are here gathered around one microphone.

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm Justin McElroy live from Seattle. I'm your oldest brother.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm just kicking it in Seattle just with my two brothers.

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,280
Best people around. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm live from Seattle. Now, Travis,

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,320
if you are live from Seattle, I do not currently see you. Yeah, what's going on?

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,160
I'm in the other room. I'm not with you guys. I'm here for a different event.

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,440
Okay, you're staying in a much nicer hotel. Yeah, I'm here for the former Saturday Night

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,520
Live lookalike convention. That's very good. Say hi to Reggie for me.

19
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,040
I was just like Charles Rocket.

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,800
I don't know that there is a nicer hotel in the hotel that we're staying at because

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,280
we have the four regular pillows on our bed, you know, stacked too deep, too wide.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,160
But then we have another too fast, too furious. We have another pillow that is sort of a sliver

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,360
of a pillow, just sort of like a suggestion of a pillow. And I'm not a pillow for the pillows.

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,600
I think it might be like it might be like a little baby pillow. So the other pillows feel

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,560
like they've accomplished something in their life. But I don't I don't know what to do with

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,960
it in my body. Like, do I tuck it between my legs because it's even too tiny for that.

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,520
It's hard to say. Does your hotel does your hotel have a pillow menu?

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,920
No, no, no pillow menu. This is, of course, an advice show for the modern era where we take

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,560
your questions and we turn them alchemy like into wisdom. Let's get away before we start.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,720
Justin. Yeah, I put up that cursive thing and I need you to apologize to me.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
OK, I will I will admit you're a good cursive. I don't think that is how that is, though.

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,520
I don't think that is how it is. I do it with a flamboyant flair. But that is how the easy

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,120
you look like. You look like a meth addicted hooker's mouth. It looked like a C with a bouffant.

34
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,120
But it is correct. That is that is maybe not so over the top. But yeah. Yeah. You're not

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
all winners. Yeah. Written language over the top. Yeah. It's kind of your whole style.

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,120
Well, you like to zazz your pizzazzle with all your writing.

37
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,960
Probably. So let's get right into it. I was having lunch with three people I respect and admire.

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,560
They all start criticizing a close friend of mine, not knowing she is my friend.

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,480
The criticism is distasteful and unjustified. What should I do in this situation? Should I

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,360
keep my mouth shut and move on or defend my friend and lose respect from my other friends?

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,680
That's from Jake. You think this is a veiled way of saying that we insulted his friends?

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,600
He doesn't know if he should stop listening to our podcast. Because if that's the case,

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,320
like I'm not I don't apologize for anything. Oh, wow. I mean, what I say, I say what I mean,

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,360
take no prisoners. It says shit. And he means it all 100% of the time. Wait, did you say the

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
elephant session? It means that 100% or did you say all of that? Are you referencing Timothy?

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,640
All of Timothy all of that says what he means. It means what he says. Stop his cowboy hat to you.

47
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,880
It says good day. Timothy Olyphant is faithful 100%. He's got your back.

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
Just a real quick shout out to Timothy Olyphant. Thanks for everything, big guy.

49
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:28,800
I think that you should it is actually a very admirable quality, I think to defend

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,960
anybody who's being attacked and isn't present. And it's it's something that I think we all fall

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:43,360
down on. But yeah, it's certainly the the I know I do, but it's certainly the the the right thing

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
to do or the respectful thing to do to try to defend people or at least not attack people who

53
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,600
aren't at a place. Although I would say from personal experience, if the person doing the

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,480
like the backstabbing is is drunk. It's it's best to just let that one go by. Because I got into a

55
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,800
screaming match with a girl on her birthday once for defending another one of my friends. And

56
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,240
it was it was it was a bad scene. It was a real bad scene. I'm not sure that it's the right.

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
It might be the right thing to do, but I don't know that it's the pragmatic thing to do. Like,

58
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,800
I didn't have I haven't had so many friends lately. And I think it's because I keep getting

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,640
in this situation and I trade in the three friends for one friend. And then it's like,

60
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,520
I'm down two friends. Mathematically speaking, I don't have the two friends I would have had if I

61
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
had stuck with the three instead of the one. You know, you got to keep in mind how many friends

62
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,600
can I keep in my life at all times and have the maximum number of friends. I think I think what

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,440
you need to do is you have to sit back and say, is this one friend worth these three friends?

64
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,480
And it sounds like if they're being distasteful and unjustified, like they don't really sound

65
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,960
like great people. But you're not thinking of it pragmatically. It's all about pragmatism.

66
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,920
This episode, you guys, because that's three warm bodies, three for maybe maybe their one friend

67
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:16,000
is gigantic. Oh, and that's why the three friends were picking on like a situation. Yeah, I am.

68
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,440
I think that it's a fine opportunity to practice decency, which you should try to defend people,

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,200
even if they're not your friends. So don't make that like, I don't know. Don't make that a huge

70
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,120
part of your decision making process. But what if it's Osama bin Laden? You still want him to

71
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:42,080
defend Osama bin Laden? I think friendship is sacred. With terrorist leaders? I don't think

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,720
that they're friends. What are they going to say about Osama? His ass is dead. Yeah. What are they

73
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,960
going to say about Osama bin Laden that is distasteful and unjust? That hasn't already been

74
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:59,920
said in an infinite number of Toby Keith songs. I think that the answer is yes, but to not get

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,680
belligerent about it. There's a polite way to defend people without turning it into an us

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
versus them type situation. And usually if you say something like, well, actually, you know,

77
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,440
I'm pretty good friends with them and they're all right. Everybody around you will get the hint and

78
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,960
not keep talking shit. If they do, it's turning into a whole different situation. Yeah. You know

79
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,440
what I mean? Like then you just need to get out of there, maybe smack a few faces on your way out

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,760
the door. Yeah. As you run with your hand out into the smacking position. Or it's also would be

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,320
great if you didn't say anything and then later somehow made sure they found out that you're

82
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,640
friends with this person because then they retroactively feel guilty and that goes down.

83
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:52,240
What's up? The twist dating. Why? You didn't see this coming. Hey, is it? Is it possible to get my

84
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,400
hopes up for a first date without ruining things? Is there a happy medium between two high expectations

85
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,360
and pressure and being hopeful and excited about the possibilities of that relationship? That's from

86
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:11,520
form spring. Oh, God. What do you mean by ruin things? Like are you? I peed myself. Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,400
Like are you rolling up and being like, marry me? Oh, damn it. Ah, fuck. You look great. I peed my

88
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:28,800
I put pee in my pants because you're so beautiful. Um, um, no, no. You have to go in jaded. Totally.

89
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,840
No, not that. Just totally cash talking about cashmere baby. Cause you don't want to freak her

90
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,760
out. You don't want to freak yourself out. The best way to get to know somebody is in a no,

91
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,000
a low to no pressure situation. And you can't craft that for yourself. You go in thinking

92
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,800
things about wedding bells. I actually babies and wedding bells. I completely agree. Griffin.

93
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,040
I think that first dates in and of themselves are like booby traps that are set up to make you fail.

94
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,520
Yeah. Literally. Yeah. Good one. But I think that I said some dismissiveness there.

95
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,640
I think that it is a built in high pressure situation. You know, like everything about it is,

96
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,560
is like built to be awkward. And if you bring your high pressure situation into her low pressure

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,920
situation, you get a tornado and thousands die. Very sensitive Griffin. Think about it.

98
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,080
What is it? People are friends on the East coast. Travis right now is batting down the hatches.

99
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,640
I'm, I'm in the midst of, of the storm. That's why I said tornado and not hurricane. Thanks guys.

100
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,880
But it's pretty much all the same thing. They made weather like there's bad weather everywhere.

101
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,000
I can't talk about bad weather. Hurricane made the made tornadoes. That's the fucking scariest

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,960
thing I've ever heard. Baby, baby tornadoes. It's spun off the hurricane the day after tomorrow.

103
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:58,080
Oh, like it all happens at once. Earthquakes. Yeah. Hey, and then the earth core starts,

104
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:06,400
stop spinning. Speaking of this hurricane, I hope everyone is, um, is safe and is, it is,

105
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,800
I guess by Monday, this will all sort of blown over for, for our us friends. Maybe not some of

106
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,200
our friends in Canada. Um, but I hope you were fine. It sounds like the, the death toll is

107
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,920
relatively low. I didn't want to mention one that I saw. One of the very few deaths, um, was listed

108
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
in the news as a, and I don't want to be disrespectful here, was listed in the news as a,

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:37,200
um, a 55 year old surfer that died. And to me, it just screamed like, that's a full on,

110
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,200
that's a full on Bodie situation. That guy can't live in a cage, the cage of, of going into that

111
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,760
dark twilight. And he just, I have to imagine that that is like lifeguard lingo. Like there's a dude,

112
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,520
there's a lifeguard on the beach radioing other lifeguards saying, Oh, I'm going to need some

113
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,880
support out here. We got a full on Bodie. We got a full on Bodie. Like this, like the chopper,

114
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,560
they wouldn't list him as a 55 year old surfer unless he was fucking carving the waves right then.

115
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,240
I actually, I read it his little bit in the New York Times. Cause I got, I got news where you're

116
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,200
55 year old. You're not a pro. It's not your career. I read it a little bit in the New York Times.

117
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,760
They actually said, um, 55 year old radical surfer. So I think that they added that extra

118
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,960
thing to let you know. What is it? Do I have something on my teeth? I was trying not to

119
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,000
distract, but no, no. Which one is it? Oh, let me see. Smile. No, the other one. This guy? Yeah.

120
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,680
One of your canines. Okay. Yeah, you got it. Great. Um, don't surf in hurricane. Can we give

121
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,240
out general advice for surviving disasters like this? General hurricane advice. Um,

122
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,880
there's no laws anymore. No, everything's fucking on the table. Grab, snatch and grab. Snatch and

123
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,680
grab. It's all yours. I've also learned from so many, um, like weather horror movies. Don't wear

124
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,960
a Hawaiian shirt and put down your video camera. Oh my God. You'll be sucked into the vacuum.

125
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,280
Those two things will kill you. Also, this is a great time to listen to Jimmy Buffett back catalog.

126
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah. Because if you don't now you'll die and then you'll never have heard it.

127
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,000
The, uh, the, uh, and he's got lots of songs about surviving this sort of thing and that's a pretty

128
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,720
good attitude throughout. Um, you, uh, you should remember, uh, above all that, um, hold on. Shit.

129
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,240
I forgot my thing. Hold on. Love conquers all. No, not love conquers all. True love waits. True love

130
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,600
waits. So don't get hurricane nasty. I know hurricane nasty is sweeping the Gulf coast.

131
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,160
This is my windiest nap. It's dirty with four R's. It's quite a storm.

132
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
Oh, is there a good hurricane pickup line?

133
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:55,600
Um, I want to batten down your hatches. I mean, yeah, but I guess I want to, I don't want to turn

134
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,720
this into, I don't want to turn this into a high pressure system. We better, we better go to the

135
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,080
grocery store and before it gets raided and buy condoms to have sex with. Okay. A little on the

136
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:18,640
nose, baby. I think, um, or we could just raw dog it. Hey, there's a hurricane coming. We should

137
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:26,400
probably bone. Have you ever made sex in a swirling vortex? Maybe that could be now.

138
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,600
Wouldn't that be the tree? Like I don't want to get weird, but wouldn't that be the dream?

139
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,680
If you were sucked into a swirling vortex, like made coitus, like, whoa,

140
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,320
this is the most intense experience of my life. Check it out. Poseidon.

141
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,720
Hmm. Thunk. That was me. I was getting enslaved to the cyber building. I mean,

142
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,600
killed in. Cow. Couple having just totally righteous. Another couple having totally

143
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,880
righteous sky sex. Get a net, Bill Pullen. We got to save them. What about that 55 year old

144
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,160
pro surfer? It's too late for him. Too late for him. He's surfing, surfing the sky. Maybe the 55

145
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,280
year old surfer was trying to save a sky sex couple. And that's what, like, I've got to carve

146
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,520
into the storm and save them or get a better look at least. I'm 55. I got nothing. How hard do you

147
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,320
think miserly was playing in that dude's head as he surfed a hurricane? What a cool way to go out.

148
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,000
That's what he was thinking. He didn't think he was going to like wake up the next day. A 75 foot

149
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,160
wave tower door is like worth a done. Uh, how about a Yahoo answer for us? Justin, don't,

150
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,760
Justin's like looking at my computer right now. I don't want him to. Oh, I won't look. I don't want

151
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,800
him to look. Um, okay, here it is. Yeah. Don't look at the question because this is, this one's

152
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,280
pretty important for you not to look at. Okay. This was sent in by Daisy Gray. Thank you, Daisy.

153
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,040
It's about Yahoo answers user rashie who asks, is it bad to run to girlfriend in the rain like in

154
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,360
the movies? Okay. I just left my girlfriend's apartment seeing her and my daughter. Well,

155
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,080
tomorrow morning I'm going off to college for basketball only about 40 minutes away, but still,

156
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,640
and I want to surprise her one last time. I want to run to her in the rain like in them

157
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:15,040
corny movies. She loves that stuff. I already got Skittles her favorite candy and it's pouring rain.

158
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:23,920
Should I do it? Would that be stupid? Wait, hold on. Hey buddy. Have you guys seen the notebook?

159
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:34,960
I love that scene where, um, that, that one guy, who's that one guy, Ryan, Ryan, Philippine, Ryan

160
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,240
Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, man, there's a lot of sexy ass Ryans out there. They're doing good. Uh,

161
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,960
Ryan Gosling runs up to that other chick is like, Hey, even before he gets to her,

162
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,120
he just throws a pile of Skittles in her face. Just like throws a handful. Like if you're a bird,

163
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,960
I'm a bird Skittles. Take them. Whoa. Did you just, uh, did you just quote the notebook?

164
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,800
Is that, was that a notebook selection? You know, the tricky thing about running in the rain is

165
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,360
where do I park my car? Where's far enough? How far away is far enough, but not too far.

166
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,040
And by the time you get there, you're just like tired. You're like, you're like,

167
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:21,920
Oh, hi. I puke, puke up all the Skittles you ate on the way over. I need your Skittles. I needed

168
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,440
the carbs. I'll be like, you get there to her and you, you put your hand in your pocket and you

169
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,280
pull out crazy core Skittles. And you're like, I'm sorry. All they had was crazy core. And she's

170
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,320
like, I don't care. I love the idea of like completely contextless running to someone in

171
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,960
the rain. Like you run up to them and then what? Like you run up and you're like, Hey,

172
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,640
you're talking about a stranger. No, but like he's leaving for college later. And so like,

173
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,560
he's like, I want to run up to her and say what? Like, make sure that you're there when I leave

174
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,120
tomorrow. So wait a minute. Did he say his girlfriend and his daughter and he's going

175
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,640
to college, play basketball? Yeah. Hey, if you want a grand romantic gesture, take your daughter

176
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,000
with you. Take your daughter to college here. Maybe like getting a part with the both of them

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,200
and don't be a Debbie absent father. If you want like grand gestures, that'd be a good start.

178
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,800
Oh, maybe the Skittles are for the daughter to like ease the pain.

179
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,760
He doesn't say he's going to college to play basketball. He's going to college for basketball.

180
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Oh, you think he's going to like Duke and he's like, I just love them blue devils so much.

181
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,720
I actually think he's going to study basketball. Like a basketball doctor. Yeah. I'm Dr. Basketball

182
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,440
Jones. Step into my office. Your hoops are all wrong. Let me show you about free throws.

183
00:17:52,560 --> 00:18:01,040
I wrote my thesis on two points. My prescription sick dunks. I see your problem here. You seem to

184
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:09,440
affect the funk on a nasty though. I'm running out of things. I know about basketball. Charlotte

185
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,520
Hornets aren't a team. Have you met Dr. Jones? He's he's an odd duck. He wears Reebok pumps

186
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:24,160
with his tweed. I like those are still thing. Yeah. Pumps are Reebok still a thing. Reebok.

187
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,600
I think my is still around. That's a company anymore. You know, you just snatched them up.

188
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,760
You know, that in these songs is so popular right now. Are they saying all the kids with

189
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,840
the pumped up kicks? Is that about Reebok pump? I'm pretty sure the song you're talking about

190
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,400
is written by all American rejects. Thus cannot be qualified. I don't think it's written by,

191
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,440
I think it's written by the, the, the sick meanies or something. Some sort of righteous any name.

192
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,200
What did you just say? The Richard Grieco's. There it is. The Sky Surfers. Oh, the Sky

193
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,240
Surfers. Yeah. Uh, no, we're not the Richard Grieco's anymore. We lost our base. Now we're

194
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:04,560
just Grieco. Ah, Richard Grieco. The Richard Grieco experience. Hey, this Monday, my wife and

195
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,920
I will find out if we are indeed going to be parents. We're excited at the possibility and

196
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,400
have started trying to plan ahead things to get one area. We're stuck in as a baby themed room.

197
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,120
We wanted something different from the normal animal themed room. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Animal

198
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,040
themed room or a single with eminol and felt that the wise brothers three would provide us

199
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:37,200
with some great thoughts. That's from confounded in K C I'm going to throw out and this is kind of

200
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,720
meta, but what about a baby themed baby themed room? Oh man. And you just paint babies all over

201
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,080
the walls. Yeah. And like with signs like you are this, like I love that. I think that's important

202
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,800
for human beings to know what and who they are pretty much instantly so they can start growing

203
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,080
and learning from it. Like I think you learn from yourself. Maybe, maybe instead of a baby,

204
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,440
it's like a zygote or like a fetus and you're like, you were this now get better. Oh, I like

205
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,400
that. What if you put, what if you took it as an educational thing and you put just a ton of objects

206
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,440
in the room that would say maybe like out loud, perhaps with one of the greeting card sound chips,

207
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,840
they would say out loud what they are, but they would all do it at the same time and they would

208
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,400
do it 24 hours a day. Chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair, chair,

209
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:41,600
chair, bad, bad, bad drums, hidden pot, pump shoes, pump shoes. Why did you hide your pot

210
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,000
in the baby's room, dad? You had to touch one of them that just said baby, baby, baby and just be

211
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,760
Justin Bieber. Oh, that would be, that would make for probably a unibomber. How was my babyhood?

212
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,520
I will tell you. Not great because I'm looking at that lamp and it's screaming in my brain. So

213
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,000
it could be better. All I could think of when I blew out the building was well,

214
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,040
that's one building of things that won't be screaming at babies today. Building, building,

215
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,240
building, building, building, building, windows, windows. I have to kill the building,

216
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,760
but now it's screaming pit, empty pit, empty pit, empty pit. It's just like my heart, heart, heart,

217
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,840
heart. What about a Steve Guttenberg themed room? Gutten baby. Yeah, that would be, or just let's

218
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:42,000
go full whole hog and we'll go three and a half minute a baby and three and three quarters men

219
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,640
and also a baby. Who's the three quarters man? The goods. All right. I'm pretty sure he was

220
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,760
listed in one of the original men, right? And it was Steve Guttenberg, Steve Danson, Steve, Steve

221
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:03,120
Danson and Paul Rudd in his, in his acting debut as the baby. He was awesome as the baby. There

222
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,640
were fucking, there were three dads in that shit, right? Yeah. Yeah. Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg,

223
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Paul Rudd and Paul Reiser. Paul Reiser, Peter Sarsgaard and Stellan Scarsgaard.

224
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,680
Hey guys, can we get together and fucking pick one? Yeah, just pick a thing. Just pick a,

225
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,040
you can't throw K's in there. It's, it's one name or the other. Um, what about a Scarsgaard

226
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,760
themed room? Oh, you've got a baby. You got a baby in the room. Did you, did you Scarsgaard

227
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,400
everything? Which is the Scarsgaard in the true blood? Is that Stellan? Stellar, Stellam Scarsgaards.

228
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,360
Stellam Scarsgaards needs to stop taking pictures on magazines with like him pulling the front of

229
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,080
his pants down. Like, Hey, maybe we'll see some pubes. Like I don't want, actually I'm checking

230
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,520
out at H-E-B and I'm buying like bacon and dates. Like I don't want to see your almost pubes, Sarah.

231
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,840
And I certainly don't want my baby to see them. Bad idea. I vote down. Your idea. Okay. Yeah.

232
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,120
V-TED. V-TED. What about, um, cause now that I'm thinking about Gutenberg, I'm just thinking about

233
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,240
short circuit. What about just like an all short circuit themed room? Right. What if we went over

234
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,960
the top and said just a robotic room? See, this is something I could get behind. Cause that's. I like it.

235
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,640
That's, robots had such a big influence on me and my life. Um, uh, uh, vis-a-vis short circuit

236
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,040
and, uh, iron giant. Um, robots are important. And I think you need to, I think, I think the next

237
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,160
generation of children is going to have a very good reason to be scared of robots. Right. So if

238
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,240
your baby's half robot or at least can sympathize with them or communicate with them, it'll help.

239
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah. Uh, I don't want, yeah. You don't, you don't want your baby to be a robo-phobe. You got to get

240
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,000
them in early. You got to get them in deep. Can you, if you make a baby themed, uh, like a baby,

241
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,320
a robot themed baby room, can you make an exoskeleton for your baby? Because I think that

242
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,280
would like an animate. Okay. We've seen in a lot of science fiction exoskeletons used to give, um,

243
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,560
disabled people, the ability to, uh, or people with disabilities,

244
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,600
the ability to walk. I'm saying, could that technology apply to babies?

245
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,160
Is this example based purely out of Robocop?

246
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,760
See, he, you're saying Robocop. I'm saying it's more of like a Power Rangers Megazord

247
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,360
situation. Gundam, maybe an Evangelion. Yeah. What if you raised your baby and convinced him

248
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,400
he was a robot like that, like an AI situation and you convinced him that he was a baby robot

249
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,760
like, Oh no, when you die, you're not going to go, you're not going to heaven. So

250
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,680
I have seen bicentennial man. You are going in the garbage.

251
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,560
I don't think that's what happens in bicentennial man. Yeah. Yeah. Williams dies. The last shot is

252
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,800
him in the garbage. God. It's the only travesty is that robot Robin Williams can be found in the

253
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,560
garbage. Robin Williams can't legally be thrown on the scrap heap of Hollywood. That's the best we

254
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:08,000
got. RV is the scrap heap of Hollywood. Hey Robin, stop it. I hate that guy.

255
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
Does anybody ever just refer to him by just his first name? That was just so strange to me when

256
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,280
you said that. You have to call him Robin Williams. I call him Rob, just because we so tight.

257
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,680
Bob Williams. Um, and sometimes I call him, uh, uh, the most hair suit man in the world. Yeah.

258
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,840
But it's a little long form. Or Mork. Mork. He loves that. He loves that. He loves that stuff.

259
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,600
He loves that. He loves that stuff. Hey Mork. Oh, that's a good one. Justin.

260
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,560
Was that your, was that your, sorry. Was that your Robin Williams man? I only got like one voice.

261
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,040
Yeah. Hey, I start all right. Impression. Yeah. You got a Paul Rudd. Yeah. Oh, that's a good one.

262
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:05,200
Justin. Hey, I started a new job in April supervising employees who have been working

263
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,280
longer than I've been alive. I'm well qualified, but I also happen to be a young, somewhat petite

264
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,800
blonde female. How do I present myself in a way that lets people know that they can't take advantage

265
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:25,040
of me? Gmail. Robot exoskeleton. Exoskeleton. Exoskeleton is the, obviously the, it's the

266
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:32,160
obvious answer, but I assume she would have thought of that already. Right? Um, you know,

267
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,720
I think if you, if you go in with that attitude, um, then it's going to create a real contentious

268
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,640
workplace, um, situation. I, I, I'm of the opinion that the best way to supervise people

269
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,440
is to be as, uh, Dale Carnegie said, lavish in your approbation and hardy in your praise.

270
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Are you kidding me? No. With this Carnegie cast. No. What does that mean? You keep turning us into

271
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,680
a Carnegie cast. I, I'm just telling people that that book turned my life around. Just don't

272
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,320
approbate anybody. You know, like that word. You know, lavish with your approbation. Yeah. Don't,

273
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,440
don't drown these fools in approbation. Don't be mad because I've won friends and influenced people.

274
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,880
Don't hate. Don't hate. Celebrate. Define approbate for me right now. And I swear to God, I will give

275
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,160
you $5 out of it. The word was approbation. What does it mean? It means praise. Does it mean it? It

276
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:31,040
means approving of people. Like approbation? Yeah, like approbation. Fuck that. No. Yep. Why doesn't

277
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,160
Dale Carnegie just say like, Hey, tell him good job and pat him on the back. Tell him good job. Pat

278
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,680
on the back. Good job. Cause he was at the lot. Cause he's dead. He can't say anything anymore.

279
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:48,480
Wow. Way to really bring it down. He died surfing in the hurricane. Yeah. You win. Okay. I was right.

280
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,400
Yeah. Um, the, uh, yeah, I just think that if you go and say like, you guys aren't going to take

281
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,040
advantage of me, then it's going to create a bad work environment. It's not going to be the kind of

282
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,480
work environment. I would be more concerned with like setting a good role model and leading them

283
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,920
rather than worrying about people taking manage you. Cause I like that they're going to like ask

284
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,400
off extra days work, take advantage of you. Like they're all going to slack off and not do their

285
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,080
job. Like what does it mean? Take advantage of, I'm, I'm confused by the parameters. Well, she

286
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,280
can't answer your question because she's not on this call. Words on a screen. I understand. I

287
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,480
understand the concept. I know how that works. I'm wanting you guys to tell me what you think it is.

288
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,640
Yeah. I like that kind of stuff. Like just not showing up for work and then being like, what fire

289
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,440
me? You can't, I've been doing this longer than you've been alive. Or steal, like stealing rubber

290
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,600
bands, stealing all the rubber bands. What are you doing with those rubber bands? Ah, they're all

291
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,480
mine. Ha ha. I'm making a child. Rubber baby. Rubber baby man. Just love that song so much. Gotta

292
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,200
make a human. So it's like maybe taking advantage of leaving rubber baby in her chair without

293
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,800
warning her. Oops. And with a sign that says we wish rubber baby was our boss. Yeah. Rubber baby

294
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:08,080
would do better than you. Have you? You shouldn't be my manager, rubber baby. He's very, he's bouncy.

295
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,360
He, um, he smells like an old newspaper. He's very quiet, but he's very resilient. And you can play

296
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,120
hoops with him. Like with him. Like with him. Like you're on him to him. You can play basketball to

297
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:31,280
him. The one baby it's okay to drop. Um, I, I think that I, I understand your worry, but, but I think

298
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,880
if you work, focus on having a good relationship with these people, that's going to be your best

299
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,480
bet. Cause especially for people who've been doing this for so long, you're not going to whip them

300
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,040
into shape. Like you're not going to whip them into submission. Um, and, and I, I don't think

301
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:51,040
you should look at, uh, working with them or, or trying to, um, appease them as, as, um,

302
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,760
as a, as a loss. I think it was just plain good, good leadership. I agree. You should have an

303
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,800
unsheathed samurai sword open on your desk. That is absolutely right. That when someone comes in

304
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,160
to ask you a question, no matter how benign the question is, just slowly stroke the hand. Yeah.

305
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,520
Just stroke that wazai kihi and just let her know what's up. Um, if this were like, oh, sorry,

306
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,960
Travis, go right ahead. I was just going to say, I think a good rule of thumb for pretty much

307
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,920
every situation like this is if you respect yourself, if you have confidence in yourself,

308
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,360
then that will carry over to them. If you go in afraid that they're going to take advantage of

309
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,240
you, if you go in feeling underqualified because you're younger than them, that's going to be the

310
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,840
image you project. But if you go in saying I deserve to be here, I deserve to be the supervisor,

311
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,440
they will, uh, they will respect that. If this were a Reese Witherspoon movie,

312
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,520
Mm-hmm. She would have her gay best friend who doesn't work there come into the place and do

313
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,480
something wrong and then she would fire him in front of everyone. What do you guys do like that?

314
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,560
Oh, and he would like cry? Like? Yeah, like, how could she be so mean? I have a sick kid!

315
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,040
I got a sick baby! I don't understand why the friend has to be gay. I just thought that she,

316
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,800
well, like later she's, he's going to help her out with like her relationship. Is this Timothy

317
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,280
Oliphant? Can I imagine? Yeah. If you, actually, if you imagine Timothy Oliphant as a gay man,

318
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:21,760
you have to go to jail. The man only wears cowboy hats. He wears cowboy hats in the shower. Like,

319
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,280
yeah. And if you picture Timothy Oliphant in the shower in a cowboy hat, you have to go to jail.

320
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,240
Those are, we have an Oliphant laws. Uh, I don't want to go to jail.

321
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,680
Oh, I'm almost sure Isaac Asimov wrote the Oliphant laws. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Um,

322
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:49,280
a law one cowboy hat. Law two, draw. Um, how about a Yahoo answer question? Please. This one was sent

323
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,760
in by Daniel McKinney. I'm almost certain Justin just looked at it. It's by Yahoo answers user

324
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Garland Garcia, who asks, is it legal to have sex with trees on your own property?

325
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, oh my. Now the top answer is unless the tree can be seen by a passerby, it's not illegal.

326
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,480
It's not as if there's a precedent to making it illegal. Despite the foolishness of the question,

327
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,040
I've decided to address it seriously. And I, I appreciate that. John Lennon,

328
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,000
just your username. Yeah. I don't think that that's accurate. No, yeah, sure. If you have a higher,

329
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,640
here's, what's terrifying about this question and why I decided to discuss it. No, by accurate,

330
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,640
do you think I meant the answer or the fact that that is John Lennon or the fact that there's no

331
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,400
precedent for this? I know. I agree with that part. I don't agree with the fact that it's

332
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,280
John Lennon. He's a ghost in the machine, but he's trapped in Yahoo answers forever. And he just

333
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,240
wants out so bad. Please let him on another site. He can't find his way out because it's a labyrinth.

334
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,480
Yeah. Take it from me. Our show is really about trying to find John Lennon's ghost hidden in Yahoo

335
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,760
answers. Hidden in the hedge maze of terrible methods. This is the closest we've ever gotten.

336
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,400
Is this gentleman's concern that a tree would report him to the police? For tree,

337
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,440
say for arboreal sex crimes. Uh-huh. I don't think that that's a concern. Then what other law,

338
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,040
besides just being completely indecent in public, which is a law, no matter what you're having sex

339
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:20,480
with wrong. Go wrong. Go. Here's what I'm saying. Here's what's upsetting. If your fence is high

340
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,120
enough, people could be fucking trees. People could be fucking trees. They could have trees

341
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,480
fucking them or each other. They could have grown the trees into a position that makes it look like

342
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,480
they're having sex. I'm talking about branches and the bird holes and the fucking man, a nasty mess.

343
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,240
A nasty mess. So wait, is your concern that this is like rampant? I'm saying who knows? If you walk

344
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,800
by a house with an eight foot fence, you just go ahead and assume that they are fucking something

345
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,120
they should not be. Yeah. And spray paint on the fence. Tree fuckers go home. Yeah.

346
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,320
And then just spend every night worrying about white ash beetles. Yeah. Termites. I mean,

347
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,480
I think people are stumping on the reg. You do think people are stumping right now somewhere in

348
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,120
this world. Okay. Now I get the t-shirts. Uh, stumpers have wood. Yeah.

349
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:19,920
Um, it upsets me that we can find loopholes in our legal system to allow this kind of thing.

350
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,160
Aren't law supposed to keep you from doing really upsetting things? Isn't that the whole idea?

351
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
I want the fucking law and order special victims unit to like kick in the door and be like,

352
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,040
hey, sex police, don't move. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing

353
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing

354
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,760
the door and be like, hey, sex police, don't move. Why do we even have special? Tree fucker.

355
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,240
Yeah. Why even have the SVU if they're not going to stop shit like this from happening?

356
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,160
Cause psychically it's in my brain. Like there's a tiny, here's what you guys may not realize about

357
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,640
my brain is just by saying that word, saying like tree fucker. Now in my brain, there's a constantly

358
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,280
a 24 seven until the day I die, a tiny man, fucking a tiny tree in my brain. And he's just

359
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,360
shouting tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker, tree fucker, or tree man, penis intercourse,

360
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,080
intercourse, intercourse. Like it can't be stopped. Please stop the noise, but you can't stop. I want

361
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,240
fucking ice tea to kick in the door and be like, stop SVU. And he can't do that in your brain.

362
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,920
He's got to hold on. I got to incept him in there and get, get him out. Brain iced tea.

363
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:31,680
Guys, Griffin, Griffin's eyeballs are bleeding. I think he incepted too much.

364
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,400
Don't have sex with trees.

365
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,240
Don't have sex with.

366
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,200
There's guys.

367
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
If only to avoid the horrifying half human, half tree babies.

368
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,000
And also the dick splinters. Stop it.

369
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,560
Listen, you motherfuckers, dryads have to come from somewhere. I want them to walk the earth

370
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,520
and this is the only way to get it done. It may not be pleasant. It may not even be,

371
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,920
it's questionably legal, but if we're going to have someone to bestow upon us,

372
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,160
like special tree powers.

373
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,800
Dryad magic.

374
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,080
Dryad magic, yeah.

375
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I would like to imagine that dryout babies are just completely like boring and normal people.

376
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,280
And you see like a half human, half tree and you're like, give me your wisdom. And he's just

377
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,520
like, dude, I work at the plant. I got nothing. No pun intended.

378
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,800
I work on my shit models.

379
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,520
When you guys were younger, did you ever read the taking tree?

380
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,360
Take the tree.

381
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,800
Give me that sap.

382
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
Oh, I'm sad in my brain.

383
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah, me too.

384
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,480
This sucks.

385
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,080
Just ruined a children's book for everybody.

386
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,480
This sucks.

387
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,200
How many other children, I've done Horton Hizze Who and I've done The Giving Tree.

388
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,480
What else can I ruin today?

389
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,360
Yeah, you told the show, the podcast.

390
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,720
Yeah. Hey, my girlfriend and I have a long distance relationship for almost nine months

391
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,400
now. And we're both about to be college freshmen at different universities.

392
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,200
As of the past few days, however, she has determined that she wants

393
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,480
to back out for a semester or two and go home to build her confidence.

394
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,320
I think this is a huge mistake, but don't know how to correctly approach her about it.

395
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,400
I want to be supportive at every corner, but at the same time,

396
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
I want to make sure she's making the right decision.

397
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,840
Worried in Wilmington.

398
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,040
You know, worried.

399
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,800
It's a funny thing about being supportive.

400
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,480
It's that once the person makes the decision, you support them.

401
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,040
Interesting.

402
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,840
Yeah, I know.

403
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,800
You back them up.

404
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
You just do the thing the word says.

405
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,040
Right, because if you say like, I don't think you're doing the right thing, you're messing

406
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,240
up, you're going to be perpetually messing up in my eyes.

407
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,560
I don't think that's supporting the person.

408
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,840
Like, she's a big girl.

409
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,880
Like, she knows what she's doing.

410
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,200
Okay, so if you're just trying to be supportive, I agree with Justin.

411
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,480
However, there is a certain amount of like, like teaching someone to drive.

412
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,680
If they're swerving towards a tree, you grab the wheel and you, you know,

413
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,600
you guide them away from hitting that tree.

414
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,600
No, you got to be supportive and you got to respect their decision to drive you into a

415
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:07,920
tree.

416
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,160
Well, guys, seriously think about this for a second.

417
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:19,200
How, how many times have you, how many times have you made a decision and then someone

418
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,880
tells you a big serious decision and someone tells you, you know, it's the wrong way to

419
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
go and you've changed your mind against your own free will.

420
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,440
Like, it's, it's something that you didn't want to do, but that person changed your mind.

421
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,120
That never, ever happens.

422
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,320
The only time we take people's advice is when it's justification for what we already want

423
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,800
to do.

424
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,520
That's not true.

425
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,560
I think that's an excellent point.

426
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,360
No, no, people, I think it's absolutely correct.

427
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,520
When people ask for advice, what they want is someone to support them.

428
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,480
And if you really care about her, I say you just support this decision.

429
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,560
She's smart enough to make her own choices.

430
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,600
Like she knows her own, her own life and her own mind.

431
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,800
I just don't think you're, I don't think talking, trying to talk her out of things is the way

432
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,040
to go.

433
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,480
I think there can be a bias that you can have in your own brain where like when you have

434
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,920
a tough decision like this, you can be leaning towards one or the other, but I think you're

435
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,760
still susceptible to advice.

436
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
I think that's kind of a messed up way to look at things.

437
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,360
Well, no, especially in this case, she didn't ask for his advice.

438
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,960
She didn't want his opinion.

439
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,080
That's true.

440
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,760
She didn't say like, Hey, if someone's asked, the reason I point this out is that if she

441
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,680
was asking for your advice and she was kind of like on the fence, one or the other for

442
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,000
sure.

443
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,400
Like tell her what you think, but trying to convince someone to do something they don't

444
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,600
want to do, I think is going to be a huge source of undue stress in your relationship.

445
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
Let's get specifically into this question though.

446
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,840
She wants to go home to build her confidence.

447
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,920
I think that there's, instead of giving her advice, I think that you can help her do that

448
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,520
and still get her to go to school, still get her to keep up her regular school schedule

449
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,280
because this is the kind of thing where it's not like a, I'm not saying it's the right

450
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,720
choice for everybody all the time, but if you think it's the right choice for her and

451
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,960
assuming that you know her pretty well, I think it's your duty to try and influence

452
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,080
her decision.

453
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:11,680
I just worry that going home and backing out of school isn't a good way to build confidence.

454
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,640
Not at all.

455
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,720
It seems like she's afraid to start this next step of college and so she's just not

456
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,920
going to do it and that is not confidence building at all.

457
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,320
So that's what concerns me, is that it's not the idea of you saying it is a bad idea,

458
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,240
it's that it is a bad idea.

459
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,680
And if it's, you said you're going to different universities, if it's because she doesn't

460
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,760
want to leave you, you need to.

461
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,600
That's not good at all.

462
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,120
That's not good.

463
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,000
Well, is she, is her staying, like is the place she's staying in near the university

464
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,720
that he's going to?

465
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,840
I don't think, that was not made explicitly clear.

466
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,600
But if that is the case, then that's, that is definitely something you need to interject

467
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,360
and be like, hey, don't do this for me.

468
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,480
Like, this is, this is a super important thing that you have to do and don't do it

469
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,840
for this relationship.

470
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,440
I think that in all things, if you're looking for a way to approach it and actually like

471
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,440
bring it up, asking questions is better than making statements.

472
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,800
If you're like, why do you think, why do you feel you need to do this?

473
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,600
What do you, what's your plan?

474
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,400
You know, that kind of thing is supposed to going, this is a bad idea.

475
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,520
I don't think you should do it.

476
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,760
Like, cause then that's you.

477
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,320
But asking her questions will help her to realize if it's something she really wants

478
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,040
to do or not.

479
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,600
Um, yeah, it's a, it's a sticky, it's a sticky situation.

480
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Um, but I, I just don't try to impose your own thoughts because she's looked at this

481
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,160
at different angles, but there's ways to, what I would do if I were you is really talk

482
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,760
to her about it and really figure out what's really at the root of it.

483
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,960
Try your best to understand it because if you, if you understand what she's feeling

484
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,360
completely, then you are going to see things her way.

485
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,920
You will, you will see why she is staying there.

486
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
Um, and then you can kind of go from there.

487
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,160
But I would first, I think your first step is to try to, uh, to, um, um, understand

488
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,640
where she's coming from personally.

489
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,920
That's what I think.

490
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,760
You know what I think?

491
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,040
What maybe we should do a Yahoo.

492
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,280
Yeah.

493
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,800
Can we do the one about the tree sex again?

494
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,680
Yeah, sure.

495
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,080
No.

496
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,320
This, hey, sex, the tree sex.

497
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,040
What's up with that?

498
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,800
Um, how about this one?

499
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,880
This one's sent by Galiayali.

500
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,360
It's by Yahoo!

501
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,040
Interest user Jordan Crum.

502
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,160
Remember that last name, everybody.

503
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,880
Jordan Crum.

504
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,360
My last name is Crum and I'm running for 4-H president at my school.

505
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,280
I need good slogans for my posters.

506
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,040
4-H is green and for the planet.

507
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,560
Please put more than one slogan.

508
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,520
Oh, don't worry, Jordan.

509
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,920
Done and done.

510
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,680
Crumble believable.

511
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:47,920
Fuck.

512
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,640
You beat me to it.

513
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,080
Can we send it to that song?

514
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,400
I wish that that wasn't always in my head all the time.

515
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,120
24 seven and just that like two seconds of music.

516
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,840
Unbelievable.

517
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,640
Unbelievable.

518
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,360
Unbelievable.

519
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,240
Unbelievable.

520
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,080
Time to pull the crumbilical cord.

521
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:14,400
Yeah.

522
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,520
And secede.

523
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,240
Pull it.

524
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,640
Pull it.

525
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,040
Cut it.

526
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,840
Cut the crumbilical cord.

527
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,880
No, I like pulling it better.

528
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,440
I'll get out of this.

529
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,400
I'll get out of this one.

530
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,800
He's not like that.

531
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,920
We are cartoonists.

532
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,400
Crumb it.

533
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,560
Jesus.

534
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,480
Um, uh, uh,

535
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,200
come and I'm looking at you.

536
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,840
Give me something.

537
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,640
Look at my eyes.

538
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,440
Crumb.

539
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,080
Crumb.

540
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,560
Crumb.

541
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,360
There's nothing I don't want to say that isn't.

542
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,920
Put it on your earmuffs, everybody.

543
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,000
Come.

544
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm coming.

545
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,760
Uh, let's see some of the, uh, uh, some of the really,

546
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,040
some of the really stellar answers here.

547
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,640
Uh, several slogans for crumb for fourth president are don't be.

548
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,200
No, I'm sorry.

549
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,440
What?

550
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,840
Crumb for fourth president.

551
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,160
Okay.

552
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,400
The third president down the line.

553
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,720
Okay.

554
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,600
Don't be glum.

555
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,560
Vote for crumb.

556
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,360
Fourth president.

557
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,960
Not so great.

558
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,000
Not a good start.

559
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,400
Don't be going to be glum, but give a ho ho hum.

560
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,120
Vote for crumb.

561
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,240
Fourth president.

562
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,740
Nope.

563
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,320
That's not it at all.

564
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,760
Who are you voting for?

565
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,280
Ho ho hum.

566
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,480
Crumb.

567
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,040
Crumb.

568
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,120
Tip of canoe and Tyler too.

569
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,480
I give out chewing gum.

570
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,520
If you vote for crumb.

571
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,640
For no, no, that's all these things make me want to not vote for crumb.

572
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,360
Make a rule of thumb vote for president crumb.

573
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,320
That's if he's president crumb.

574
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
He doesn't need your vote to be fair.

575
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,640
President crumb sounds like a warlord.

576
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,040
And I love don't become numb.

577
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,920
Vote for crumb.

578
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,120
He will lead us alive.

579
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,320
Our school will thrive.

580
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,360
What the fuck?

581
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:03,040
To a glorious revolution over Lord crumb and the, and the floor of the cafeteria.

582
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,480
We stay with Brad.

583
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm seeing in my, I'm seeing in my mind like a chubby version of beans from even Stevens

584
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,920
at that kid.

585
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,640
Only he's in the Obama poster, the hope poster.

586
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,480
When he said hope, it just says crumb.

587
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,040
Fuck Justin Russo.

588
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,360
Make that.

589
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,640
Hey Justin Russo.

590
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,280
Make that t-shirt.

591
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,920
It sits on you.

592
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
By the way, those suggestions came from George.

593
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,560
He's a college professor of education at four universities in Illinois, New York, South

594
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,240
Carolina, and the district of Columbia.

595
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,440
He likes making slogans.

596
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,640
So if you go to college in one of those four states, you should probably move somewhere

597
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,280
else.

598
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,400
Dude was in DC.

599
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,520
Why didn't he give Obama some of his help for 2012?

600
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Like Obama, yo mama, vote for fourth president.

601
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,280
What is fourth president?

602
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,880
You make it sound like fourth meal.

603
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,680
President Obama, he killed Osama, fourth president.

604
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,960
Get him, give him your votes.

605
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,360
Let's keep this country alive.

606
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,320
It must thrive.

607
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,520
Obama.

608
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,160
Is there a who's Harry Chrome angle we're not approaching?

609
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:06,960
No.

610
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,480
Okay.

611
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,240
All right, that's good enough for me.

612
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,680
Hey, you're a history, you're a college professor of education.

613
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,400
You're fired.

614
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,520
Go find another state.

615
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,120
That happened to him three times.

616
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,680
Your slogans are terrible.

617
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,600
Do you think he teaches politics?

618
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,800
Oh no, I think I bet he teaches education about politics.

619
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,600
I bet, I bet that he knows every single slogan has ever been done in any presidential campaign

620
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:37,120
and he has compiled that information to create these surefire winning machines.

621
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,720
You gotta come up with something snappy.

622
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,600
I like Ike.

623
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,240
That's great.

624
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,720
Yeah.

625
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,000
I chum crumb.

626
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,480
Yeah.

627
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,040
Is that good?

628
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,640
No.

629
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,160
Big chum crumb.

630
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,960
Big chum crumb.

631
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,640
I think it's time to accept that you don't have a successful political name.

632
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,280
Yeah, you don't.

633
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Can we change it to like Broderick?

634
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,640
Yeah.

635
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,120
Rock Broderick, president and king.

636
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,760
Rock Broderick, sexual desire.

637
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
What is this voice that you're doing?

638
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,800
What about, what about if you ditch all the president shit?

639
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,120
What if you focus on your sexual potency?

640
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,760
Yeah.

641
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,560
Crumb.

642
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,160
He is adequate.

643
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,520
He'll get the job done.

644
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,000
Crumb.

645
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,200
He'll do the electric slide with you at the dance.

646
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,680
Crumb.

647
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,600
Crumb, sporting boner since 2006.

648
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,240
Crumb's got more boners than he knows what to do with.

649
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,120
Fourth president.

650
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,920
Crumb.

651
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,480
He'll help you with your long division.

652
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,600
He's got that shit down.

653
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,320
He's in fourth grade.

654
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,400
Yeah.

655
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,680
I mean, the trick for winning a presidential election with Travis, I'm sure you know all

656
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,840
about is to find your sort of your area of expertise in fourth grade.

657
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,440
Like, are you a basketball star?

658
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,760
Because if that's the case, and like, Crumb makes all the points for the big team.

659
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,240
Slam dunk.

660
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,840
I would suggest just a series of, how about a series of pictures of him as a basketball

661
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:11,760
star, as a chemist, as President Obama, but just the exact same facial expression.

662
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,600
His arm around Barry.

663
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,720
We caught him together, Barry.

664
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,120
Got him.

665
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,400
Couldn't have done it without you.

666
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,680
And you couldn't have done it without me.

667
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,680
Crumb, fourth president.

668
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,880
Oh, fuck, you're so good.

669
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,920
He's in fourth grader.

670
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,760
Yeah, but he's also sexually potent.

671
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,840
I'm trying to, I'm bringing all of our birds into roost.

672
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,560
Oh my God, Griffin.

673
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,160
That answer was put onto this question 13 hours ago.

674
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,600
I know, it's not piping hot.

675
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,280
George is still out there helping people.

676
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,440
Wait.

677
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,800
He must be stopped.

678
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,080
Crumb just put this.

679
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,960
Okay, guys, this is such a rare opportunity.

680
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,760
Crumb just put this question up 15 hours ago and there are still three days left to answer.

681
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,280
If you can find this question and start giving him some crummy suggestions.

682
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,560
I love it.

683
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,680
Okay, we just tapped into it.

684
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,080
You're crummy as president.

685
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,480
Yeah.

686
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,200
Well, I know, I know.

687
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,400
I think it has to be his name's Crumb, but he's not crummy.

688
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:08,880
Vote for him.

689
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,680
Don't be a dummy.

690
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,200
His name's Crumb.

691
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,000
He's not coming.

692
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,080
He's not coming.

693
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,880
Next question.

694
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,440
Don't tell.

695
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,400
Don't tell.

696
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,280
Listen, I'm saying get your mom, get a fucking Elmer's glue stick, get some sprinkle sparkles

697
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,440
and just fucking make that slogan happen.

698
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:25,760
Yeah.

699
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,520
Picture you high-fiving Barack Obama holding Osama bin Laden's head.

700
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,600
Fantastic.

701
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,480
Guaranteed win.

702
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,960
So hey, I run a lot.

703
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,400
Just a fact.

704
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,240
And because of that, I'm usually wearing short shorts around my house and just in general.

705
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,760
I love them because they're so comfortable and easy to wear.

706
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,480
Everyone I know that isn't a runner hates them and sometimes they're even appalled by

707
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,240
the fact that I'm wearing them.

708
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,280
Stop going to funerals in your short shorts.

709
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,000
What I'm asking you is why do people hate short shorts?

710
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,800
I love them.

711
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,840
David, North Carolina.

712
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,120
You know what bothers me about this show?

713
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,920
We say pretty clearly, I think, in all of our promotional materials, our TV ads, our

714
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,000
Super Bowl spot, we say it's an advice show for the modern era.

715
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,760
David has come to us not seeking advice.

716
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:25,200
He has his decision about short shorts is cast in iron.

717
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,120
I think this is an opportunity.

718
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,920
I think it's like one of those things where no one goes to a psychiatrist because they're

719
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,560
afraid they have narcissism, like they go because they're depressed because nobody realizes

720
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,840
how awesome they are.

721
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,400
Yeah.

722
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,080
I think that that's what this is.

723
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:46,720
I think that that's what this is. David has not asked for advice, but I feel David needs

724
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,200
advice.

725
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,320
How short are these shorts, Doc?

726
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,160
That's my question.

727
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,360
What are we talking about here?

728
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,520
Are we talking about some Daisy Dukes?

729
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,840
Are we talking about some Jordan Crums?

730
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,280
Like, how short are these?

731
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,200
Oh, in order for that joke to make sense, you have to see the picture of Jordan Crum

732
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,400
that we're both looking at right now.

733
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,640
His t-shirt is so long, I can't even see it.

734
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,240
It looks like he's like a girl in a poison music video right now.

735
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,360
There's sparks everywhere.

736
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:21,760
I would also say that short shorts in this situation sound like a uniform for running.

737
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,360
So you should probably relegate it to that time and only that time.

738
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,520
Yeah, just wear them while you're running and no other time ever.

739
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,720
That's like if I were a 55 year old surfer and I just rolled around in a wetsuit all

740
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,520
the time.

741
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,160
It's like all the time or floated around in a wetsuit until the Coast Guard came by.

742
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,920
I'm not sure I'm even cool with it while it's running because when I run, when I express

743
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,760
myself through movement and I see a gentleman pass by, which they're keen to do because

744
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,040
I'm not the fastest runner, and I see them wearing those short shorts and it sounds like

745
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,760
their thighs are high-fiving over and over again.

746
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,520
Well then you just do a slight wave and say, please don't try to see my balls.

747
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,400
Yeah, like I can, I can't not see his balls.

748
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,280
Like they're in, they're my, they're in my everything at that point.

749
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,880
Like in that brief moment where they pass by and they always touch me.

750
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,640
They always just brush up against and I feel their moist leg.

751
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,680
They're moist balls.

752
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,920
No, not, no, not his balls.

753
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,200
No, don't be crass.

754
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,160
His almost balls.

755
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,680
Okay.

756
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,560
Still is no, no zone, but like his almost balls.

757
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,400
Why are you not wearing them?

758
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,640
Why are you wearing them any other time?

759
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,000
There it's a running uniform.

760
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,680
Like I don't wear my cleats for sports inside the house.

761
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,520
My sport cleats.

762
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,880
I'm saying don't wear them at all.

763
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,160
I'm saying when I get done with my desert horse race, I take off my job purse.

764
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,560
Yeah.

765
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,280
Yeah.

766
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,680
Oh, and David, just so we're clear, people don't hate your short shorts.

767
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,960
People hate your legs.

768
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,000
They don't want to see all the things.

769
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,360
They don't want to see your pasty, sweaty getaway sticks.

770
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,680
Yeah.

771
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,840
What kind of legs are we talking about here?

772
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,080
Are we talking about like some daddy, long legs, lanky ass, pale and pasties or are we

773
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,920
talking about, or are they jealous?

774
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,200
Are we talking about legs that look like Robin Williams fingers?

775
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,440
Maybe we're talking about legs that go all the way up and everybody's just jealous.

776
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,840
Are we talking about some Michael Sarah's or are we talking about some Bruce Valanches?

777
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,000
They're both bad.

778
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,360
Like, I don't understand what you're saying.

779
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,480
I know, I'm trying to gauge what kind of...

780
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,960
Have you ever seen a dude's legs and gone, aw yeah?

781
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,960
Except for Timothy Olyphant, obviously.

782
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,720
Other than Timothy Olyphant, yeah?

783
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,120
Yeah.

784
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,760
Go to jail.

785
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,920
Do not pass go.

786
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,400
I haven't...

787
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,840
I don't think that's a good look for a dude.

788
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,480
I don't think a...

789
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,120
I haven't seen a...

790
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,000
I haven't talked to a lady who appreciates a good leg.

791
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,560
I think that's...

792
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:55,840
I like...

793
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,360
I know ladies like buns.

794
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,320
Yeah, they like a tight bun, but I guess you get that by running.

795
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,400
So you want him to run in assless chaps.

796
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,080
Or just run in jeans, everybody.

797
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,000
Can you just hide your fucking gross legs?

798
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,520
Nothing like the comfort and ease of jeans.

799
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,480
Yeah, because you can...

800
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,480
Jeans, you can get some cargo jeans going and you can tuck bottles of water in there.

801
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,800
You can put your Zune and your bottle of water in there.

802
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,640
And your bag of cheese nips.

803
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,080
Yeah, bag of cheese nips.

804
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,640
Maybe a Gameboy, because it gets boring out there on the street.

805
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,960
Like, how's your run going?

806
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,840
Good, catching them all.

807
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,240
You hungry?

808
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,800
I got nips.

809
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,320
If it helps, you can wear your short shorts underneath the jeans.

810
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,760
Yeah, that makes you feel better.

811
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,720
You just need to feel that mesh close to your scrote.

812
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,760
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first, quick housekeeping stuff.

813
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,360
We are at mbmbam.com.

814
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,040
That is the letters of my brother, mybrotherandme.com.

815
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,880
You probably figured that out.

816
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,640
Our Twitter is at mbmbam.

817
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,200
Griffin, can you tell them how they can reach out to us, how they can reach us?

818
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:15,120
You can email us at mbmbam at maximumfun.org or just mbmbam at gmail.com,

819
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,040
if that's how you like to do what you do.

820
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,120
Or you can just shout at us on Twitter.

821
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,000
We're always looking.

822
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,720
We're always looking out for that hashtag and that at sign.

823
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,680
And if you need a more direct way, you can call Griffin at 1-900-HOT-PANTS.

824
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,840
Hot pants with a Z.

825
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,880
Hottest pants.

826
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,280
Don't call that number, though, because it's probably something bad.

827
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,240
I want to thank John and Roderick in the long winters for the use of their theme song.

828
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,080
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which, just go buy that.

829
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,200
We're in Seattle right now.

830
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,480
I've just been thinking about just hunting him down like an antelope,

831
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,240
like some sort of wild creature.

832
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,560
Well, then you tag him and release him back.

833
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,000
Tag him and release him, but thank him.

834
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,680
I just want to thank him personally for it.

835
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,160
Thank you.

836
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,480
Hey, John, thank you for the use of your song.

837
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,280
It's so good.

838
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,840
I'm sorry, people have asked, what's our closing song?

839
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,360
Oh, it's off Girl Talks Feed the Animals.

840
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,920
It's Play Your Part Part Two, the very ending of it.

841
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,040
Thank you, Girl Talk.

842
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,080
Play Your Part Part Two.

843
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,360
And thank you to everybody who talked about us on Twitter this week.

844
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,960
Always Amy H.

845
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,520
I always devoted in her talking about us.

846
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,400
Rocks in his head.

847
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,200
I appreciate that.

848
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,440
Ryan Winslet.

849
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,360
Galen, our bold hero.

850
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,200
Bird Lord.

851
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,800
Krista Whalen, as always.

852
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:41,600
I want to thank Ashbrook K, now that I look at it again,

853
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:47,120
who wondered if the quake would get mentioned on this week's My Brother, My Brother and Me.

854
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,440
And sadly, it will not.

855
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,480
Thanks to Ham Doctors.

856
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:58,800
We met Oni Davin and our friend Lindsay here in Seattle.

857
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,480
So thank you to both of them for being so sweet.

858
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,160
And speaking of people we met, we met Emily Carroll,

859
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,480
who you can find at Emily Terrible on Twitter.

860
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,520
She does the best art.

861
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,560
I was super nervous.

862
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,840
I was actually super nervous because it's like you make the best art,

863
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,000
but now you're talking to us.

864
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,240
She made an NBNBAM art.

865
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,040
She made an art.

866
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,160
I'm sure everybody saw it.

867
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,000
It's well got blowed up worldwide.

868
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,720
But if you didn't just track her down.

869
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,520
It's in the forums.

870
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,280
It's in the forums.

871
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,640
You can find it at Maximumfun.org and then just click forums.

872
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,880
And I want to throw out a special thanks to Joel Siebert,

873
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,520
who also thought that all checks had to be in cursive.

874
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,200
So I'm glad that he was there with me.

875
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,400
Thank you, Joel.

876
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,040
Uh, if you'd like to have us talk about a special event in your life

877
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,880
or your corporation that wants us to promote your product.

878
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,680
Or if you're a lonely gentleman and you want to-

879
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,040
Still haven't done that personal ad.

880
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,840
You want to get a person-

881
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,560
If you want us to boost your sexual confidence.

882
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,560
So you can go to school.

883
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,680
So you can go to school finally.

884
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,280
Then we can do that for you.

885
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,600
Listen, I'm so hungry right now.

886
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,520
Max, you got to give the address, stupid.

887
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,240
It's Maximumfun.org, right?

888
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:08,880
Not.com.

889
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,440
There's a.org.

890
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,080
Maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron.

891
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,360
And we will blow your shit up.

892
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,920
It's affordable.

893
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,560
It's, it's, we'll talk all about you.

894
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,840
Only nice things.

895
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,360
Unless you raise our ire.

896
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,640
And we'll just, we'll blow your shit up on our podcast.

897
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,720
And we will literally say anything you want.

898
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,280
We will, we will suck anything.

899
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,280
We'll say anything for what?

900
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,080
For money.

901
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,800
Say the last thing.

902
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,760
I'm so hungry.

903
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,800
Your show's over.

904
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,400
Aw, 69.

905
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,080
Aw, guys, it's episode 69.

906
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,960
It's already, somebody open a window.

907
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,440
Griffin, fucking say the last question.

908
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,520
No, I want to talk more about episode 69.

909
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,080
I'll read it.

910
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,120
I can see your computer.

911
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,480
But listen, episode 69.

912
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,560
I feel like this is a good, this is a good moment.

913
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,240
Cause I think that we pleased our consumers and they pleased us.

914
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,760
And so I just want to thank.

915
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,400
No, I want to thank every, this is the time for thank yous.

916
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,920
And I want to thank every single one of our listeners for engaging.

917
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,120
We couldn't have done it without you and you couldn't have done it without us.

918
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,880
Yeah, you have to have us.

919
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,040
Just keep, just fucking remember that.

920
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,680
You're nothing without us and we're nothing without you.

921
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,760
So thanks for, let's just, let's just rub each other's gents.

922
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,640
They're gentles.

923
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,680
Just rub some gents.

924
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,600
Thanks everybody.

925
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,720
This final Yahoo was sent in by Galiayali.

926
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,680
Thank you, Galiayali.

927
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,240
It's by Yahoo!

928
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:36,480
It's user Hottieheart25 who asks, I have canker sores in my mouth.

929
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,640
Is it bad to eat spicy Doritos?

930
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,760
I'm Justin McElroy.

931
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

932
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

933
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,240
This has been my brother and my brother and me.

934
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,280
Kiss your dad.

935
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,080
Square on the lips.

936
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,760
Keep your heart three stacks.

937
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,800
Keep your heart.

938
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,960
