1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:46,960
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,600
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,600
McElroy. I almost said youngest brother. What? That's incorrect. You want to trade this time?

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,800
I don't know. Let's try it out. Justin, take it from the top. Okay. Hello everybody,

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
my brother, my brother, and me, advice show. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:17,040
middle brother, Griffin McElroy. I'm your youngest. No, fuck, god damn. Come on, sell it. I'm your

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,840
youngest brother, Travis McElroy. That's right, put that fucking diaper on. So this is my brother,

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240
my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era, like I said. I am actually the oldest one,

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:36,160
and the rest of it is confusing. But I've been working on a personalized license plate. I was

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,120
on the can earlier today, and I thought, I'm going to see what I could do, what kind of damage I could

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,880
do here at the West Virginia WV, because they don't only let you search- Did you say West Virginia WV?

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,040
The West Virginia DMV, sorry. They don't only let you search for available plates. They actually

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,800
generate the plate so you could kind of see it and visualize it. It's kind of the secret. Once

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,560
you type it in, you're already three-fourths of the way there, because that's the secret.

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,720
That's how they close the sale. They let you see it, and you're like, well, I can't not do it. Now

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,080
they went to all the trouble of generating this image. So the first one I tried, and it was

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,280
available, and by that point I was fucking hooked, was Mambo No. 5. Mambo No. 5. No, in this case,

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,400
is a shortened version of number. I saw you toot this image, and I thought you had misspelled

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,160
MBMBAM really bad, but no, it's Mambo No. 5, like the Lubega song. Yeah, so I was thinking

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,240
about that, and thinking about how very good of a license plate that would be. And it is a very

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,080
good license plate. Very funny. If I saw that on a... You'd get stoked, right? I would get pretty

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
stoked, and I'd roll down my window, and I'd make the Grey Poupon joke, and then I'd ask him,

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,840
are you just cranking baga 24-sev? And the answer to that would be yes. Well, hold on. If you saw

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,440
the license plate Mambo No. 5, what percentage of chance do you think would be in your head that it

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,560
might actually be Lubega? Very high. Very, very, very high. And what are the odds that Lubega would

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
be driving behind you, see that license plate, and then be thrown into a rage that you've stolen his

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,360
identity, and then he drives you off the road, and you die? Five percent? I do what everybody's

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,640
listening to the program right now. Just take a minute for yourself to imagine Lubega at the DMV

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
in the state which he lives, explaining to them what he wants his personalized license plate to

34
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,040
be. Because there is like a 30% chance that that actually did happen, so that's very exciting for

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,320
me. A lot of good percentages. A lot of good statistical sort of analysis this episode so far.

36
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,600
So after that, I started thinking about like, well, Mambo No. 5 is very funny. What about Scatman?

37
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,640
Is Scatman just one that I could just grab? And the downside of that one to me did appear almost

38
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,640
immediately. I'm going to draw in a diverse crowd with the Scatman license plate. Yeah,

39
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,200
you're casting two wide nets with that one, it feels like. I'm surprised that that one hasn't

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,240
been snapped up by like a sort of a reverent proctologist. I'm actually willing to bet, and I

41
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,440
don't know much about the demographics of either, but I'm willing to bet that the one you might not

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,360
be referencing might actually be bigger at this point than the one you're actually trying to

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,680
reference. Travis is saying, and he's dancing around it, but there are more people who are into

44
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,840
poop sex and poop play than there are people who are into the song Scatman. Or just into Scat in

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,920
general. I don't know, like I'm saying, I don't know what the Scat fandom looks like. Travis is

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,640
saying we've hit a point where there are more people into poop play than there are people into

47
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,920
this cool way of making music with, you know, syllables and plosives and stuff. Perhaps. I

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,080
don't want to, I'm not throwing my hat over the fence on this one, you know what I mean? I'm

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:58,720
saying that. You're not throwing your scat over the fence. Now, I do want to mention that there,

50
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,480
that is for the standard license plate. You can get a patriotic background that has two to six

51
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,720
characters, and there's also a 9-11 never forget background that has two to six characters.

52
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,920
Tough to thread that ironic comedy needle, though, is the problem.

53
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,880
Yeah, it is, that couldn't think of a good 9-11 one except where it said never forget,

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
I could get the license plate that said okay. So that's just kind of like, you got it, no problem,

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,760
10-4. Agreed. I've been sitting here for the last 10 seconds trying to think the answer to this

56
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,760
question. I think you might be able to help me out here as you are an experienced license plate

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,160
smith. If you were going to get a license plate that said parrot head, what do you think is the

58
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,120
right shortening of parrot to make it read clearly the first time through? Otherwise, I might see PRT

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
head and be like, you're part head? Yeah, of course we all are. Dumb license plate,

60
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
run them off the road and then you die. Here's what I think I would go with,

61
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,600
Trav, because I was generally thinking about this, PRRT-HEAD.

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
That's what I thought, too. That's what I was thinking as well, because I thought PROT

63
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,720
looks like Prothead, P-A-R-T, part. Yeah.

64
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
It has to be PRRT-HEAD. Are we doing emojis on these things now?

65
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
No. Can we get hashtags?

66
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,880
If I could get a hashtag, my momma number five license plate would be off the chain.

67
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
I would have already gotten it. If I could get a hashtag in there, because that would-

68
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Jesus Christ, of course, because it stands in for number. I thought you were saying the

69
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,200
license plate would be hashtag momma number five. I am just going to start putting that

70
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,800
randomly on tweets. What are you doing with that license plate? I pulled you over because

71
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,280
you were going 200 miles an hour in a school zone. First of all, what the fuck, but also

72
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,520
like hashtag momma number five. What's it mean? I'm trying to get it trending. That's

73
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,200
not how that works at all. But you're talking about it, aren't you?

74
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,560
Here's the thing. I don't know if this just service isn't big in West Virginia or something.

75
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,640
You can get anything. You can get anything you want. DTF, I could get it now.

76
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,040
Because they don't know. They don't know what that is.

77
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Dougie Love, I could get it now. As someone, Fernon on Twitter suggested me iPhone 95. As

78
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,600
long as I was in that period, I might as well check out the creators of Blue.

79
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,440
What about RKY?

80
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
It's just there. I can just get it.

81
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
RKY MRTN.

82
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,680
Yeah, that's possible. Hey, I just had a great idea.

83
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm just a fan.

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,000
Here's a good idea for a public service commercial for teens. It's all these cars and they're

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,520
driving way too fast in a city and all their license plates say like hashtag number five,

86
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,720
hashtag squad goals and stuff like that, a bunch of hashtags, but it's real dangerous.

87
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,560
The cars are crashing and stuff. Who's a respectable person these days? Who do people

88
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,280
really look up to?

89
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,160
Alan Alda.

90
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,800
Alan Alda walks from the side of the frame after one of these hashtag cars crashes and

91
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,640
says something like, the things you tweet, Twitter is real life dangerous or something

92
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,480
like that. Just let kids know, you're really putting a message out there and you need to

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,360
be smart about it.

94
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
You're using hashtags fast and loose. You need to be careful because hashtags can get

95
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
away from you and pretty soon your whole tweet is hashtags and you forgot to put an actual

96
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,800
message in there.

97
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
That's another thing Alan Alda, I want him to teach me about.

98
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,880
RKY Can you fathom that with a single click,

99
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,160
my license plate could just say cool dude. Like that is just an option.

100
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,480
Travis Well how?

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,400
RKY Cool dude.

102
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,360
Travis Well how?

103
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
RKY Just cool dude.

104
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,800
Travis You can't have eight letters? I thought it

105
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,440
had to be seven.

106
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,480
RKY No, it's eight characters. Cool dude. You could just say cool dude.

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Travis I have no joke. I have before seen a license

108
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
plate that said cool dud.

109
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
RKY Oh, that's no good.

110
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
Travis I'm pretty sure that's not what they were

111
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,440
going for, but that is a cool dude.

112
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,280
RKY That is a word.

113
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,920
Travis One problematic thing with the cool dude

114
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:06,800
plate though is that C00L dude looks indistinguishable and I'm not fucking going to prison for the

115
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,080
crimes of cool 00L dude. No way.

116
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
RKY For the leet cool dude.

117
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,040
Travis No way.

118
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,560
RKY What about king of road? King of fraud? Is

119
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,040
that on there?

120
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
Travis King of fraud?

121
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,120
RKY That's literally a peep.

122
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,360
Travis What are you talking about?

123
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,400
RKY Yes, that's what I'm wanting. I'm just a

124
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,920
big fan of the show and I would like that reference.

125
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
Travis You could just get it to say frogger. I

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,400
could just get frogger on there. I could just get it.

127
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
RKY Juice, Justin, let me hit you with this,

128
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,200
Seinfeld.

129
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Travis Hold on.

130
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
RKY That might be the best one because

131
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
Travis It's available.

132
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
RKY There's infinite ways to read it and all

133
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,280
of them are good. One, is that Jerry Seinfeld in that car? I got to find out. I don't know

134
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,560
who that is, but it's not Jerry Seinfeld. Two, I'm

135
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
also a fan of this television show.

136
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,080
Travis Justin, look and see if W-V-G-O-V-N-E-R is

137
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,640
available.

138
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,200
Justin W-V-G-O-V-N-E-R.

139
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,080
Travis Yeah, I could just get that.

140
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
RKY Just bless Virginia Governor.

141
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,640
Travis This is his car.

142
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,080
RKY Wait a minute. Please get Seinfeld, please. I

143
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,480
don't care. I'll literally pay you how much money it

144
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
costs to get Seinfeld on your license plate. It

145
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
will be an issue. We'll have to bleep out. We just

146
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,840
won't release this episode because people will be

147
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
able to track you down, I think, pretty easily. But

148
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Seinfeld, I think, should be your license plate,

149
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,280
Justin.

150
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,080
Justin Man, Seinfeld's very good.

151
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,520
RKY Ooh, it's a temptation, huh?

152
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,440
Justin God, it's really good. The problem is

153
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
they're all so good that I don't know. I feel like

154
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
I'll get it and instantly have thought of 30 better

155
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,520
ones, but that's a problem for me.

156
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
RKY Man, I had no idea West Virginia was just

157
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,240
fucking Wild Wild West in terms of license plate,

158
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
what they'll let you put on it.

159
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,080
Justin Question. When you get a license plate and

160
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,720
then get a different one, does the original one go

161
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
back in circulation or is it, like, retired? Because

162
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,960
then, Justin, you could just keep getting different

163
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,280
ones.

164
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,640
Justin Yeah, just cycle it out.

165
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,120
Justin Yeah, like your URL collection you've been

166
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,160
building over the years.

167
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,280
Justin Yeah, man.

168
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,720
RKY Let's ruminate on this. Maybe we circle back.

169
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,920
I think we should start doing advice.

170
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
Justin Okay, here's our first question. I got my

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
nipple pierced and then got a job at a grocery store.

172
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
Any suggestions on how to protect tender body parts

173
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
when working a physical job? What do I say when

174
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,560
coworkers see me wince and look concerned? That's

175
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,000
from Bashful in Brooklyn.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,080
RKY Can I real quick? I had two closers for this

177
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,120
episode, and this one is Jermaine, and so I'll just

178
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,920
do it now. It was sent in by Seth Carlson, and the

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
question was simply, what gauge are Dave Navarro's

180
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,600
nipple piercings?

181
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,960
Justin I can really sympathize with this one.

182
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,760
This one I'm really familiar with.

183
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
RKY I would love to hear why that's true.

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
Justin Well, in my preteen years, no, probably

185
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,320
teenage years, our parents secured for me somehow,

186
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
it was probably a free promotion sent to the radio

187
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,760
station because that's how we ended up with a lot of

188
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,120
our earthly goods in those days. It was an Anaheim

189
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
Mighty Ducks shirt, and the shirt was nylon with an

190
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Anaheim Mighty Ducks patch where your heart would

191
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,120
be, but it's also where my left nipple was, and the

192
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,760
embroidery of that patch caused me basically

193
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,360
infinite nipple distress. So I'm like so on board

194
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,520
with this one. It's a problem.

195
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,480
RKY I remember when our parents also bought,

196
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,320
our parents just like, I guess they didn't give a

197
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,200
shit about our nippular health. We went to the

198
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,560
beach one time, bought us some cheap ass boogie

199
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,840
boards from like Wings or something like that, and

200
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,360
I fucking buffed my chest, I buffed my torso down

201
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,400
to a perfect flat shine. Somebody else could have

202
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,040
used me as a boogie board after what this boogie

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
Justin Your belly button was like Kyle XY, which is

204
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,960
the only thing I know from Kyle XY.

205
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,320
RKY This was a water sports wet stone, essentially,

206
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,480
for boys, and it just, it sharpened me down, and it

207
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,400
was, and which is great because you know what the

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,560
ocean is? A bunch of salt water. Get that in your

209
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,840
your flattened nips areas, and it's just a bad

210
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,200
vacation in general.

211
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
KYLE You know the funny thing about Wings and the

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
bad quality products at America's Wings and Eagles

213
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
and all the other beach shops? Now that I'm like a

214
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
little more established adult, when I go to the

215
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,400
beach, sometimes I'm willing to pay a little bit

216
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,880
more for a higher quality product, and they simply

217
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
don't exist. There's no place that's marketing

218
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
itself as like the better upscale.

219
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
Wings.

220
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,800
KYLE Once you're on the island and you're living

221
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
on island time, these are all you have, and like

222
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
it's this weird block in my brain where there's just

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
no reality. I'm gonna allow myself to like buy a

224
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
boogie board on Amazon and remember to do, it feels

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,640
wrong somehow.

226
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,880
RKY It's not correct, yeah. So protection of your

227
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
tender body parts when working physically. So I

228
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,000
imagine you're carrying a big crate of, you know,

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
avocados or whatever, and you're using your,

230
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
everybody knows that you lift from the nipples, and

231
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,680
so like the box is just there and pressing up

232
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,160
against your region. Is it always tender? These are

233
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
things I don't know about nipple piercings, but is

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,080
it always tender or does it heal eventually?

235
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,160
KYLE I mean, it's tender by nature, right? Like

236
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
not by nature, for sure.

237
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,680
RYON Do you think it would be possible to

238
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,800
convince your bosses and maybe your co-workers that

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,760
it is not a nipple piercing, but in fact shrapnel

240
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
from an explosion that doctors advised you was

241
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
safer to just leave there?

242
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,600
KYLE It just got me. This grenade, oh, I got out

243
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,880
of the way. It just got me. It got me like the least

244
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,440
an explosion could get you. I just got it. If I'd

245
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
been just a little bit faster, I would have got

246
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
out of the way, but it just barely nicked me right

247
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,240
there.

248
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,360
KYLE I hear you saying, Philip, pick up the

249
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
fucking boxes anyway. Get over it. But let me tell

250
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
you, this other thing is the reason that the

251
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,400
grenade got me is because I was being a hero in

252
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,840
some way. I don't know.

253
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
RYON I was vaguely hero-ing.

254
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,560
KYLE I was being heroic. I don't want to get

255
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,200
into the details. They're almost as painful as

256
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,760
this sort of impromptu nipple piercing, but...

257
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,360
RYON This daily reminder.

258
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
KYLE Yeah, of my heroism.

259
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,720
RYON Did you see Kindergarten Cop? Because

260
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,880
more or less, grenade went into Kindergarten. I

261
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
threw it out of the room. I thought I was clear.

262
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,120
I was barely in the door frame. Just a little bit.

263
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,960
It was enough to catch it right there.

264
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,800
KYLE Apparently, nerve right there runs right

265
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
through my heart. Can't remove it.

266
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,640
RYON Can't remove it. Got a special ring put

267
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,800
in there. Ring powers my super suit. It's a little

268
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,680
bit offset, the ring is, my power ring. It's not

269
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
like Iron Man's where it's right in the center.

270
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,480
Mine's a bit offset.

271
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,920
KYLE Long story short, can't stock milk. Metal

272
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,560
will get cold.

273
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,120
RYON Can't stock milk today.

274
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,680
KYLE Sorry.

275
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,120
RYON Sorry. I was a hero, though, so I'm going

276
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,280
to need worker's comp for this one.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,960
KYLE I wanted to convince Blockbuster I was

278
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,520
allergic to Windex so I wouldn't have to do

279
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,560
cleaning at the end of the night.

280
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,600
RYON Jesus, I'm glad you're my brother.

281
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,160
KYLE God, they really let go of a really

282
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,600
cheery employee, Justin.

283
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,400
RYON I'm glad you're my brother, Justin, and

284
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
that you're not working against me in some way.

285
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,840
KYLE With stratagems like that, I'm glad

286
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,520
you're on my side and not an opponent of some

287
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,840
sort.

288
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
RYON That's got to be a move where you say,

289
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,200
I'm allergic to Windex, and the thought in their

290
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,280
brain has to be like, I don't believe that, but

291
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,200
also why would someone go to the trouble of

292
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,160
lying about that?

293
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
KYLE I also convinced them for a year I didn't

294
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,640
know how to vacuum, because it would get to be

295
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,920
1130 and we would be like, time to vacuum, and

296
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
I would tell them, I don't know how to vacuum.

297
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
And no one was going to take that last half hour

298
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
to teach you how to vacuum.

299
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,960
No one's going to Finding Forrester you through

300
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
vacuuming.

301
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,840
So it's just going to be like, well, fine, I'll

302
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,720
do it again.

303
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,200
And I don't know, it made for pretty chill

304
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,920
evenings for me.

305
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,040
I restocked the candy.

306
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
And let me tell you, that's thirsty work.

307
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,720
KYLE Thirsty for candy?

308
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,440
RYON Yeah, sure.

309
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Y'all want a Yahoo?

310
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,320
KYLE Yes.

311
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
RYON This one was also sent in by Seth

312
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,320
Carlson.

313
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,360
Seth Carlson sent in like 800, and a lot of them

314
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,840
are very good.

315
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,400
Thank you, Seth.

316
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,680
So Yahoo Answers user Stephen asks, what is the

317
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,920
third choice in tic-tac-toe?

318
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,080
The game Knots and Crosses, imaginary, made up,

319
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
whole cloth, a fabrication.

320
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
The game Knots and Crosses is obviously a simple

321
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,440
game involving zero and X, or circle, or O.

322
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
The game tic-tac-toe sounds like it ought to have

323
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,960
tics, tacks, and toes, not circle and X.

324
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
What's the third symbol?

325
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,960
We've all played this great game.

326
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,080
KYLE Sure.

327
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,680
RYON This game of strategy, and you're not

328
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,600
playing the board, right?

329
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
You're not playing the hash.

330
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,160
You're playing the person on the other side of the hash.

331
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,240
But is there an element to tic-tac-toe that we've

332
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
never considered?

333
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,320
Which is to say the toe.

334
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,920
It's in the rulebook.

335
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,560
If you really find the tic-tac-toe rulebook and

336
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,720
crack it open, you'll learn about the toe.

337
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,840
And I'm wondering if this is a procedure that we can

338
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,960
bring into the game to maybe make it not so shitty.

339
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,040
I don't know that I've won or lost a game of tic-tac-toe

340
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,720
in the last decade.

341
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,520
And I'm wondering if that's because there's a sort of

342
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
a central component missing, which is to say the toe.

343
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
KYLE Is it also possible, Griffin, that maybe

344
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,680
what we've lost over time is a hyphen, and originally

345
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,720
we were supposed to be playing with tiny round candies

346
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,240
and severed toes?

347
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,160
RYON Now, how did this get to be the conversation?

348
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
KYLE Because it's like tic-tacs.

349
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
RYON All right.

350
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
All right, now I understand.

351
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
It's entirely possible, Travis.

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
KYLE I mean, or else where do tic-tacs get their

353
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,600
name?

354
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,480
You know what I mean?

355
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,800
You know?

356
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,440
RYON Let's just, Travis, take me on one on one

357
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,760
right now.

358
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,400
We don't need the board.

359
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
Just fucking mind palace it with me, okay?

360
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
I put an X in the middle.

361
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,040
KYLE Well, fuck.

362
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,960
KYLE It's over.

363
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
RYON You've already lost.

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,640
KYLE It's done.

365
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,480
I put one in the top left corner.

366
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,760
I put a circle.

367
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,640
Top left corner.

368
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,280
RYON Okay.

369
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,880
KYLE Okay, I put an X, I put an X at the shit.

370
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,000
See, you've countered me.

371
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
There's no coming back from that.

372
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
RYON Wait, Griffin, I have an idea for what the

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,480
toe is.

374
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,520
Okay, let's start over.

375
00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,920
Start over.

376
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,400
Wipe the board.

377
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,880
Wipe the board.

378
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
KYLE Okay, okay, okay.

379
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,480
Can I still start?

380
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:02,880
RYON Yeah.

381
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,920
KYLE I put an X in the center.

382
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,480
RYON I put an O in the center.

383
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:08,800
Toe.

384
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
KYLE Now, hold on.

385
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,520
RYON Yeah.

386
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
KYLE You're saying the toe is an essential fucking

387
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,760
combo breaker fucking cancel.

388
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,160
It's a move cancel.

389
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,560
RYON One of the additional lost rule is that

390
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,160
once per game you can deploy that uber powerful toe.

391
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
KYLE Is it one toe per player?

392
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,800
RYON Yeah.

393
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,760
Each player gets one toe.

394
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,240
KYLE Okay.

395
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,040
Check this out.

396
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,840
Round three.

397
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
I put an X over the center.

398
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,680
RYON Fuck.

399
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,640
Okay.

400
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,600
Wait, what if the lost rule is like everybody just doesn't

401
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,480
finish ranking the board and the circle, the middle square is

402
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
supposed to be both an X and an O and you just fill in the

403
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,320
outside square.

404
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,920
KYLE Let me hit you with this.

405
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,480
RYON Okay.

406
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,240
KYLE In the case of a draw, both players are killed.

407
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,520
RYON I love this.

408
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Stream team tack toe.

409
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
KYLE So Travis, again, that's the only rule.

410
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
Let's try this one out, not the cancel one.

411
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,480
RYON Well, hold on.

412
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
KYLE If there's a draw, we're both going to be

413
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,600
killed, okay?

414
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,160
I put an X in the center.

415
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
RYON Wait, but what happens if I lose?

416
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,120
KYLE I put an X in the center.

417
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,800
You'll be killed and I'll live.

418
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
RYON I see.

419
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,000
Bottom left corner.

420
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,960
KYLE Okay.

421
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
I put an X at the middle left.

422
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,440
Now really think hard about what you want to do next here,

423
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,760
Trav.

424
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,520
RYON One of us can walk away from this or-

425
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,640
KYLE Middle right.

426
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,360
Middle right.

427
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
KYLE Travis, why would you-

428
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,480
RYON If I'm going down, you're coming down with

429
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,880
me, Griffin.

430
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,040
I'm not letting you.

431
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,880
KYLE X bottom right.

432
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,160
RYON Circle top left.

433
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,080
KYLE See, why are you doing this?

434
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,200
Like you don't want one of us to-

435
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,920
RYON I'm taking you down with me now.

436
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440
KYLE Justin, are you hearing this shit?

437
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
RYON A lot of people ask me, Justin,

438
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
where's a good place to start with my bim bam?

439
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
And I never know what to tell them.

440
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,520
But now I'll at least be able to conclusively say,

441
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,920
not the one where they play audio tape.

442
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,440
KYLE But this is what I'm saying, Justin.

443
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,920
You listen to this-

444
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
RYON You're going to play your, Griffin.

445
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,440
Game's not over.

446
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
Game's not over.

447
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,640
Game's not over.

448
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
KYLE Justin, you're watching this killing game

449
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
and you're going to walk away from it with no brothers.

450
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
Do you want no brothers or one brother?

451
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,360
Is there some-

452
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,600
Like now I like this element of a third party trying to like,

453
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
trying to like make sure to limit damage.

454
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
RYON When my quote unquote brothers have decided to

455
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,040
deep six one of the primary means I use to feed my toddler daughter

456
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,280
and keep her in the shop-able fashions that she enjoys.

457
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,680
Like right now I'm kind of unequivocal.

458
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
KYLE Bottom middle, Travis.

459
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,520
RYON Fuck!

460
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,960
Thought I had you.

461
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,800
KYLE Nah, dude.

462
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,680
You don't have shit.

463
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
RYON I believe top middle is still available.

464
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
KYLE No.

465
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,080
RYON Top right.

466
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,600
KYLE Top middle, I win.

467
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,240
It was available.

468
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
RYON Whoa, fuck!

469
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
KYLE Sorry, Travis.

470
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
RYON That does actually make the game a little bit better.

471
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,400
KYLE See?

472
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,440
RYON Why is this awful game allowed?

473
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
Why can I not get another Seaman and yet everybody knows Tic Tacs How?

474
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
It drives me up a wall.

475
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,840
It's a bad game.

476
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
KYLE It's a bad game if you don't have the toe.

477
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,320
And that stands for total death of both people playing.

478
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
If in the case of a draw.

479
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
RYON I'm going to make one more change.

480
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,800
KYLE Okay.

481
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,560
RYON Right now it's played three by three.

482
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,920
We play ten by ten.

483
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,480
Your move.

484
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,880
Go.

485
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,440
Start it out.

486
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,560
KYLE Okay.

487
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,680
I'm going to go with grid four, two.

488
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,320
RYON Okay.

489
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,960
KYLE Dammit.

490
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,240
KYLE Sunk his battleship.

491
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,040
RYON All right.

492
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
Next question.

493
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm moving on.

494
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
I'm taking the show back from you monsters.

495
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,680
RYON I'm going to keep playing throughout the game though.

496
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,720
KYLE That's fine.

497
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,920
See, that's fun.

498
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,680
If you have to play over a period of time where no one can see the board, I think that maybe

499
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,960
makes it a little more interesting.

500
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,680
And one toe.

501
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,280
RYON To answer the core question, what is the third choice in tic-tac-toe?

502
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,640
The answer is to live.

503
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
KYLE Brothers.

504
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,360
RYON This question got deleted, by the way, while we were talking.

505
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,560
KYLE An excellent service.

506
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,520
RYON All right.

507
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,360
Brothers, help me.

508
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
I've been talking to this person for three weeks online thinking she was a different

509
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
friend of mine.

510
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,040
By the time I found out she and my friend weren't, in fact, the same person, it was

511
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,320
too late to go back on it.

512
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,080
Should I come clean with this person about my mistake, or should I just keep the friendship

513
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,760
going like nothing happened?

514
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,160
I don't even know her name, but we've been talking like we've known each other for years.

515
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,880
That's from Cornered in California, and it's also from my plot synopsis of You've Got Mail

516
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,280
To coming to theaters next fall, it's going to be a love story you'll never forget.

517
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,160
KYLE It's a lot.

518
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,440
Hey, it's hard to make friends to put yourself out there.

519
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,960
You may have accidentally discovered a great way to do just that.

520
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,920
If I could talk to strangers the way I talk to my friends confidently, I would have more

521
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:59,200
friends, but I'm too nervous to talk to somebody like that, and so I don't have more friends.

522
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,480
But you found a way to do it on a sort of circuitous way.

523
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,080
I think you just say like, hey, by the way, I'm Tony, people call me Tony the Pony, and

524
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,800
I don't actually know who you are, but I feel like we're friends now, so that's great,

525
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
that's good, that's just across the board good.

526
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,120
AARON Let's take a moment, and I just want to parse

527
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,640
this just for a second to talk about my favorite element of this question.

528
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,040
You maybe saw like a screen name, thought it was your friend's screen name, but there

529
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,160
was like one letter difference or whatever, but you didn't know that at first, so you're

530
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,120
like, hey, what's up?

531
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I need to tell you, I'm moving.

532
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,320
Oh, I haven't seen you in forever, whatever the conversation was.

533
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,600
And then after three weeks, you texted your actual friend, and they're like, that's not me.

534
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,640
AARON The person in this that I'm most curious

535
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,120
about is this third party person that like you just like contacted out of the blue, and

536
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,520
they know they don't know you, like they didn't think you were their friend, and they were

537
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,160
just like, all right, yeah, I'm game.

538
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,320
AARON That's the great thing about this tool,

539
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,360
though, is that if you deploy it on an unsuspecting party, they are powerless to sort of resist

540
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,840
its thrall, like, oh, you must, I guess we're friends, like, let's just roll with it, I

541
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,400
guess.

542
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,920
You've lowered all my defenses.

543
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,400
GRIFFIN Yeah, I mean, and y'all know my favorite

544
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,800
seafood dish is catfish, and that's what you're dealing with right now, is a catfishing situation.

545
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
AARON But this is like a reverse catfish, GRIFFIN.

546
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,920
GRIFFIN It's a light catfish, yeah.

547
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,320
AARON This is like you said to a stranger, I think

548
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,280
you're my friend, Bill.

549
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,560
Like, you basically handed them the rod and reel and hooked the hook in your mouth.

550
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,840
GRIFFIN You don't see that often on the movie or TV

551
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,840
show, catfish, of just like, I think you're my girlfriend?

552
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

553
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,480
You said yes.

554
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
AARON All right.

555
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,560
GRIFFIN Here we go.

556
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,680
What is this service you're using, by the way, where you were online chatting with a

557
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,560
person without knowing their identity?

558
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,840
AARON My hope and prayer to good lord above is AOL

559
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,640
instant messenger.

560
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,400
GRIFFIN That's the only thing I can think.

561
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,240
You ended up in a fucking, like, firefly role playing server, and you're like, oh, you sound

562
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,520
like my friend Denise.

563
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,560
She also likes Wash, so you must be her anyway.

564
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,600
AARON We might also be like, we might be in a

565
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,680
frequency situation where you are instant messaging this person, and they're still back

566
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,640
in 1995.

567
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
GRIFFIN Oh, you gotta be careful, your fucking thumb's

568
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
gonna disappear, because of something that happened back in 95.

569
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,840
You gotta be so careful when you're chatting in these online role playing

570
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,480
servers, because if you're not careful, you're gonna frequency yourself, and your whole friggin,

571
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,680
like, head's gonna disappear, because of something that happened 20 ding-dang years ago.

572
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,960
You gotta be so careful.

573
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,000
AARON Gotta be so careful.

574
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,560
But think of the good you could do.

575
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,520
GRIFFIN You could do good.

576
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,240
You could do lots of good.

577
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,720
AARON For sure.

578
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,760
AARON But you don't know what it- here's the thing.

579
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,440
You might think you have to do good to do good, but maybe, like, you have to lie to

580
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
them to do some good, you know what I mean?

581
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,400
And do get them to quit smoking, because, like, that's always good.

582
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,880
That's a positive.

583
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,040
AARON If you could talk to somebody in 1995, wouldn't

584
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,760
it be dope to tell them, like, listen, you're gonna hear about a movie called Pirates of

585
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,960
the Caribbean, and it's honestly gonna pop off.

586
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,680
So, when you hear about it, just start talking a big game about how dope it's gonna be, and

587
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
no one's gonna believe you.

588
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
And you're gonna come off sounding, like, so smart.

589
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,440
GRIFFIN So, that's the message that Justin would

590
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:39,280
send back- just to- in 1995, that's sort of the warning that Justin would prioritize.

591
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
He sends it back in time through his magic microwave.

592
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,520
That's the one that he wants to make sure gets out there, get ready for this, will catch

593
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
the heat, catch the wave.

594
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,080
AARON I'm sorry, Justin.

595
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,400
I think that's actually very short-sighted, because what I would do is I would say, person

596
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,160
back in 1995, get a hold of young Travis McRoy.

597
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,040
He's very excited about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

598
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,280
But let him know that 20 years later, they're still making them, and they're terrible, and

599
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,280
he should not, because in the future, the fact that he saw Pirates of the Caribbean

600
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,840
one in theaters nine times is going to be like an albatross around his neck.

601
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,400
So, tell him not to get excited about Pirates of the Caribbean, or don't discuss it openly

602
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,760
on a podcast several times.

603
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,360
GRIFFIN Yeah, and also, just- hey, 1995 person, just

604
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,520
go ahead and get off the depth train now.

605
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,880
You trust me on this one, you're gonna want to hop that one off before it reaches a certain

606
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,360
station.

607
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,080
Um, you need to get- just get right off that one, and then you send- send it.

608
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,720
Send message.

609
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,520
You know, who would you all talk to through your magic microwave to send back to 1995?

610
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,920
Who would you all want to chat with?

611
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,040
AARON Probably Dad, just to keep up with the frequency

612
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,240
kind of storyline.

613
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
GRIFFIN See, ironically-

614
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,360
AARON Dad, Coke Zero's coming.

615
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,880
You're gonna be so excited about it.

616
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,120
GRIFFIN It's the only beverage you'll ever drink.

617
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
Enjoy other beverages now.

618
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,800
Fucking keep cracking that crystal clearly Canadian, because fucking, once Coke Zero

619
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
comes out, it's the only one you're ever gonna do.

620
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
AARON That actually is what I would do.

621
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,640
I would ask Dad to just start hoarding clearly Canadian for me.

622
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,200
GRIFFIN Mm-hmm.

623
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,680
AARON Dad, buy up all the Surge you can find.

624
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,680
Get Josta in bulk.

625
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,240
AARON Surge is back, so that would have been a

626
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,120
little bit of a waste.

627
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,800
Josta though, I would- I would love a nice cold Josta right now.

628
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,440
GRIFFIN I think I would- ironically enough, I think

629
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
I'd chat with Dennis Quaid.

630
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
AARON Oh, interesting.

631
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
GRIFFIN You'd talk to 1995 Dennis Quaid?

632
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,360
AARON Yeah, and I'd be like, there's a good

633
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
frequency joke for my podcast.

634
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
GRIFFIN Also, check on Randy.

635
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,920
Talk to him more.

636
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,600
AARON Hey, talk to Randy more.

637
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,880
AARON Uh, Frequency had that dope Garth Brooks

638
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,120
song.

639
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,920
When you come back to me again, you remember that one?

640
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,720
GRIFFIN Um, how about Money's Money?

641
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,480
AARON Yeah, that's fine.

642
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
We're probably gonna have to pay the rights of somebody after that.

643
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
GRIFFIN After- sorry, no?

644
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,680
Discussing the movie Frequency?

645
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,880
You think we're gonna have to pay the rights?

646
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,560
How do you think that works?

647
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:08,400
AARON Hey, this first ad is about shaving?

648
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,360
GRIFFIN Okay.

649
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,400
AARON What is- what am- what am shaving?

650
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,880
What is this?

651
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,560
GRIFFIN It's when your hair, which we can all agree

652
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
is bad.

653
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,440
You want to, like, punish it and send it to

654
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,840
Sink Jail.

655
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,680
And the way that you get it there is you use a very sharp blade, which sounds, like,

656
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,000
really dangerous, but it's not.

657
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,880
Because when Harry's makes it, they know they're shit.

658
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,440
So that's just been my personal experience.

659
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,720
AARON This is not a joke.

660
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,120
Recently I bought what I basically consider a shaving bib.

661
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,080
GRIFFIN Oh.

662
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
AARON It's got two suction cups on it that suction

663
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,880
cup to the mirror, and then it clasps around my neck, so that when I trim my beard and shave,

664
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,200
it just all goes down to the jail in the sink.

665
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
GRIFFIN It all goes to the bib, and then I can throw

666
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,240
it in the garbage instead of clogging up my sink.

667
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,560
AARON So you attach your face to your bathroom mirror,

668
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,600
you, like, sort of strap yourself into a shaving harness.

669
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,000
GRIFFIN Yeah.

670
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,520
AARON Kind of like in Pacific Rim.

671
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,200
GRIFFIN And then I hope and pray there's not an

672
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,680
emergency, or I will just corrupt myself.

673
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,040
AARON That would be hysterically funny, yeah.

674
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,160
I've been sent so many Harry's trial boxes because of all the different ads we've done

675
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,680
across our different podcasts.

676
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,600
I got essentially Final Fantasy VII Limit Break Omni Slash My Face Clean Off.

677
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,520
GRIFFIN I could deliver a coup de grace to the final

678
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,840
boss of my facial hair with these eight huge, awesome buster swords.

679
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,160
AARON I used to have a buster sword.

680
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,960
Y'all remember that?

681
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,880
Dad got it for me for Christmas, and I used it to cut open a watermelon.

682
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,520
I didn't clean it, and the buster sword got all rusty.

683
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,680
That's what you get for not taking care of your weaponry.

684
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,560
But Harry's is a great shave at a fair price, and they can send you their trial shave set

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,760
And it comes with a weighted ergonomic razor handle, five precision engineered blades with

688
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,440
a lubricating strip and trimmer blade, a rich lathering shave gel, and a travel blade cover.

That's harrys.com slash my brother.

691
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,160
Our next sponsor this week is Indochino.

692
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,040
They are making it easy to get a perfectly tailored suit at an incredible price.

693
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,960
You choose from hundreds of top quality fabrics and personalize your suit just the way you

694
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,720
want it, whether it's for work, a wedding, or other special occasion.

695
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,520
Here's how it works.

696
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
You visit a showroom or you shop online at Indochino.com.

697
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,800
You pick your fabric, you choose your customizations.

698
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,560
Neon is very big.

699
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,760
This is a good question.

700
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,760
If you were going to personalize your suits, what would you do?

701
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,800
Nice try, Travis.

702
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,960
Ten breast pockets, ten interior pockets, two holsters, and a built-in backpack.

703
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,360
I'm ready for the fucking road and whatever it has to throw at me because of my cool suit.

704
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,440
But you forgot Griffin bulletproof lining.

705
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,280
Did I forget it?

706
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,720
Nice try.

707
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,920
What kind of fabric do I want?

708
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,960
Tactical.

709
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,040
Submit your measurements, and then you place an order.

710
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,240
John Wick 2 is so good.

711
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,600
Yeah, John Wick 2, he went to Indochino.

712
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,960
He did.

713
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,840
As far as you know.

714
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,640
And then he went and he said, Justin, who do you want me to kill?

715
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,960
And I said, anybody that's keeping me from getting through these five fucking copy points.

716
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,840
And he was like, are you sure?

717
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,160
Because I think that's your- I said, you heard me, John Wick.

718
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,960
Yeah, who's becoming Batman from LEGO Batman?

719
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,800
Yeah, slowly.

720
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,680
He doesn't talk a lot.

721
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,200
It's hard to model an impression on John Wick.

722
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,040
And then he was like, I need knives.

723
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,160
And you turn him to Harry's and Harry's gave him just the sharpest

724
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,320
ergonomic razor blades that you could use to attack common in a subway car.

725
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,960
And then you place your order and you wait for it to arrive in just a few weeks.

726
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
That's the Indochino experience.

727
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,120
You can cobble the comprehension of the experience together.

728
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,960
Hopefully throughout my brother's troenings this week, my listeners,

729
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
my listeners, it says, and I'm going to keep with that.

730
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:13,600
My listeners, the good eggs out there can get any premium Indochino suit for just $379.

731
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,960
That's $379.

732
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,760
Not the baffling alternative at Indochino.com while entering my brother at checkout.

733

That's Indochino.com promo code my brother for any premium suit.

737
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,440
Just $379 and free shipping.

738
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,240
And folks, listen, I'm being serious now.

739
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,840
If you're going to get into a blade fight with common in a subway car,

740
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,960
you got to go to Harry's.

741
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,840
No, don't fight common, Griffin.

742
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,760
He's been through enough.

743
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
I'm not saying you should seek it out.

744
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,640
But if you're on a subway car and you realize that you and common have wronged each other

745
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,280
and that the Hitman society is not going to take you back in

746
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,520
and the blade fights coming at you and there's nothing you can do to stop it,

747
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,600
make sure you go to Harry's and get it.

748
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,320
Here's my worry.

749
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
My worry is that they'll get this new suit, Griffin, they'll put it on and be like,

750
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,000
I feel great.

751
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,680
I feel like I could conquer the world or go stab common like Griffin said.

752
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,440
No, I'm not saying go stab common, Jesus Christ.

753
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,960
I would never say anything like that.

754
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,880
But if you're getting into an honorable blade fight with common in an enclosed space,

755
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,320
Justin, did you leave?

756
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
No, I'm still here.

757
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
This is all great stuff.

758
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,400
I just didn't want to risk, you know, throwing you guys off.

759
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,440
Also, I just want to say a quick thank you to common for listening.

760
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,240
Thank you, common.

761
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,040
Thanks, common.

762
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,720
You're an above average listener.

763
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,660
Stupid.

764
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,120
Here's your personal message for Lauren and Ma-

765
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,480
What if he just went by great?

766
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,440
Whoa.

767
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,800
Oh, I was taking a drink of water.

768
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,840
I almost died.

769
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,340
Okay.

770
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,560
Change his name.

771
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,640
I got a big new announcement to make, everybody.

772
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,040
I'm rare now.

773
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm uncommon.

774
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,880
I'm rare.

775
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,380
I'm epic.

776
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,840
My name is epic.

777
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,360
Legendary.

778
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,600
You have to say it like that.

779
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
There's 18 R's in it.

780
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
It's legendary.

781
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
Common, are you glowing?

782
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,720
I am.

783
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
My name is pre-order bonus.

784
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,040
Yes, I'm DLC.

785
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,640
I've changed my name to Malfurion Stormrage.

786
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,160
Fuck yeah, that's an awesome name.

787
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,660
Yeah.

788
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,280
Did you hear that new Malfurion Stormrage track?

789
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
It is pretty sick.

790
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,080
So this is a personal message and it's for Lauren and Monica.

791
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,960
And it's from Nat, but never Nate, who says,

792
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,840
please keep sending in those Yahoo answers.

793
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,680
Griffin needs your help more than I do.

794
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,920
Y'all are good friends and the idea of a revenge

795
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,040
Jumbotron seems like the perfect candle nights whenever gift.

796
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,600
Always remember Obama's sunset amendments.

797
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,080
Oh, and do me a favor and have a great week.

798
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,840
That is nice.

799
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,440
That is so sweet.

800
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,400
I don't know if the revenge is against me or Nat, but never Nate.

801
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,760
Nat, but never Nate sounds familiar.

802
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,800
Have we had a Jumbotron?

803
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,680
Let me check.

804
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,640
The archive.

805
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,840
We did 326.

806
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,720
It's for Nat, but never Nate and it's from Laura and Monica.

807
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Okay, so kind of a twist.

808
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,640
I knew it, I knew it.

809
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,920
So this is our ARG.

810
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
Have you found other plays?

811
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,160
Yeah, this is good.

812
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,640
I mean, every time y'all sort of attack each other like this,

813
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,480
we make like a hundred dollars or something.

814
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
So please keep this beef a stewing

815
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,800
and thank you for the sweet message.

816
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
Somebody else wanna read this other one?

817
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,320
Yeah, it's from Libby and it's for Adam Gardner.

818
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
It says happiest of happy birthdays.

819
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,480
I love you more than the Yule dogs Christmas special

820
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
and rainbow sprinkles.

821
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,400
Let's eat a sleeve of birthday cake Oreos,

822
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,240
play some Twilight Struggle and watch Fast Five today.

823
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,040
You the best.

824
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,320
That sounds like such a fucking nice day, honestly.

825
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,480
That's that I'm like jealous by,

826
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,560
and it's not just because yesterday was my cheat day

827
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,280
and I couldn't do that if I wanted to until Saturday,

828
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,680
but it still sounds like a really nice day regardless.

829
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
Watching a video now called Yule dogs

830
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,840
and I'm wondering if this is like something

831
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,280
in the earbuds region.

832
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,480
Oh, this is just like some nice piano holiday music

833
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,280
and two dogs sitting down in front of a Christmas tree.

834
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,960
So it's 23 minutes long.

835
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,080
So I'm gonna sort of, I guess pop off for a little bit

836
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,400
and I'll catch you guys on the next podcast.

837
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,560
I'm Hal Loveland.

838
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,440
I'm Danielle Radford.

839
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,480
I am Michael Eagle.

840
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,080
And we are the hosts of tights and fights,

841
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,680
Maximum Fund's newest podcast

842
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,840
dedicated to all things wrestling.

843
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,440
We'll be talking about Sasha Banks,

844
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
the women's revolution, Sasha Banks,

845
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,160
the brand split and Sasha Banks' wigs.

846
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,480
And we'll also be talking about wrestler fashion.

847
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Some wrestlers wear too many clothes.

848
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,320
Some wrestlers don't wear enough clothes at all.

849
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,760
And I'll be doing impressions of all your favorite wrestlers.

850
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,640
New episodes, Thursdays on Maximum Fund

851
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
or wherever you get your podcasts.

852
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,080
Oh yeah, dig it.

853
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:20,320
What are the biggest fond do and fond don'ts

854
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
of having a cheese party?

855
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,960
That's from Crushing Curds in Kirksville.

856
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,760
And let me just say, you've come to the right place.

857
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,800
Oh, have they?

858
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,040
I'll say the first one is you don't say the word fond don'ts

859
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,720
at any point during the party or you will be asked to leave.

860
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,920
This is serious business.

861
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,840
It's not a time for jokes.

862
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,680
There's a lot of hot cheese being flung around

863
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,760
and you need to keep your fucking wits about you.

864
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,400
This is true.

865
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,440
I think the number one thing,

866
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,040
and this is so often followed by the wayside, is safety.

867
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,160
I think it's the number one.

868
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Are your sticks long enough?

869
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,520
Cause you don't want to get like your sweater sleeves in the cheese

870
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,360
and then you're flinging the cheese around

871
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
when you're gesturing telling your story

872
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,680
about something that happened in accounts payable.

873
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,800
So you want to use long enough skewers.

874
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,120
Long skewers.

875
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,280
Don't punch your whole fist into the cheese.

876
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,320
Yeah, that's a rookie first kind of stick.

877
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,360
Don't punch your whole fist in the cheese

878
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,680
and then wandering around asking people if they want a bite.

879
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
It's poor form.

880
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,480
But if you do, do make sure you say smack-a-doodle and not bite.

881
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
That does make it slightly less gauche.

882
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
Here's something that I learned

883
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,280
when I received a fondue pot as a gift.

884
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,360
From me, so be tender.

885
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,640
I'm just saying it was from me and Rachel, so be tender.

886
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,560
No, this is not that fondue pot.

887
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,280
This was my first one.

888
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,840
Oh fuck, why didn't you say you got multiple fondue pots?

889
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,280
Now I feel like a big asshole.

890
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
The answer will become clear in a moment.

891
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,080
If you find yourself with a fondue pot

892
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,760
and you don't have special cheese for that,

893
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
do not assume that you can just throw quote,

894
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,040
whatever fucking cheese you want in there,

895
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,320
because that is a pretty,

896
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,280
it does solve the problem of having a fondue pot.

897
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,680
Because if you try to throw sprinkle cheese,

898
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,600
sprinkle mozzarella cheese in there,

899
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,400
that's pretty much the end of that sort of fondue experience.

900
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,160
So you're back to having one.

901
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,880
Just the one.

902
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,280
I was at zero, but I had one,

903
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,320
and then I threw a bunch of fucking pizza cheese in there,

904
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,480
and then I was at zero after that.

905
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,040
And then you brought me back up to one for my tally.

906
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,880
God, I'm so glad, I'm so glad I could,

907
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,920
you should have told me that story.

908
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,360
I would have felt better about the gift.

909
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,640
I felt okay about that.

910
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,760
While I was buying it for you,

911
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
I was like, I don't know about this one,

912
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,640
but if I had known I was filling a really specific need,

913
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,360
affording you a valuable second chance,

914
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,960
a second lease on life,

915
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,240
I would have felt pretty good about it.

916
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,240
There is a, this is somewhat related,

917
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,160
because fondue can be chocolate too.

918
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,040
I don't know if you've ever had a fondue

919
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,840
can be chocolate too, basically.

920
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,920
And I took my daughter to Golden Corral yesterday

921
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,600
for breakfast, because it was-

922
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,680
Because you were, she did bad in school

923
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,800
and you were punishing her.

924
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
It was cheat day, and I thought,

925
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,520
if I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna fucking cheat.

926
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,760
If I'm gonna cheat, I'm taking my daughter down with me.

927
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,480
In that sense, the Golden Corral

928
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,800
is essentially the game genie of food.

929
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,120
They got all the codes.

930
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,960
Except it's the complete opposite of infinite life.

931
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's the prima strategy guide.

932
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,240
They have a chocolate fountain at the Golden Corral,

933
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,520
even, I should mention, at 9.30 in the morning,

934
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,160
which is like, it seems like a lot.

935
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,120
And the, okay.

936
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,360
So when you go to the chocolate fountain,

937
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,680
there are a few different options for you.

938
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
You can dunk a strawberry.

939
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,880
You can dunk a small Rice Krispie treat

940
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,040
and you can dunk a marshmallow.

941
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,200
But the chocolate they're using is extremely liquidy, right?

942
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,560
It's just like liquid chocolate.

943
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
It's not like it hardens instantly.

944
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,840
So if you put it on, if you do the enrobing process

945
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,640
and then you put it on your plate full of other vittles,

946
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,600
it will turn the entire thing into a chocolate new mess.

947
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,360
So really the only option that Golden Corral has afforded you

948
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,600
is to just stand next to the chocolate fountain

949
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,520
and dunk in a marshmallow and then just eat it there

950
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,920
like some big, terrible animal.

951
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,640
And that's really the only option you have.

952
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,040
Hold on, Justin, because there's always the option to not.

953
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,960
Okay, it's a chocolate fountain.

954
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,880
So that actually is not an option.

955
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,960
But thank you, Travis, for your participation.

956
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,840
Fair enough.

957
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,200
I just think it's very dehumanizing is what I would say.

958
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Would they let you at Golden Corral

959
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,760
just scoop up a bowl of the chocolate fountain

960
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,160
just to take back to the table, maybe for the table,

961
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
an order of chocolate for the table?

962
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,280
So your thing is they make an amazing like feet,

963
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,800
like a chocolate fountain,

964
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,480
and you just dunk a bowl in it and take it back to the table

965
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,640
so you can dunk it in chocolate there.

966
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
That's not an experience, Travis.

967
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,160
What you described is nothing.

968
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,840
That's not, that's nothing.

969
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,720
That's avarice.

970
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,480
It has nothing to do with the magic of a chocolate fountain.

971
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,560
Do you think there exists a restaurant

972
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,200
where it's just like there are chocolate fountains

973
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,720
at every table and it's just like,

974
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,400
we know exactly what you want.

975
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,080
We know why you came here.

976
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,880
You're describing like maculagula,

977
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,040
like you're describing like an opulent experience

978
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,880
that sounds like a little much.

979
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
How about a Yahoo?

980
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,600
Sure, yeah, sounds good.

981
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,440
I have a lot of, I have a lot of them

982
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,000
and I don't know if all of them will,

983
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,600
also all of these pages literally just crashed simultaneously

984
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,120
because of a Shockwave plugin that went sort of sour.

985
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm curious.

986
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,720
It's a very curious thing.

987
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,880
Yeah, some of them are just gone.

988
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,760
Okay, fun.

989
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,880
I love this website.

990
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,720
Well, see, you were worried about having too many

991
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
so they took care of it for you.

992
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,800
Yeah, thank you.

993
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,480
Here's one, another one from Seth Carlson.

994
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,960
It's Yahoo Answers user Simon asks,

995
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,200
can or is our galaxy just an eye in a giant's face?

996
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,280
Has science proved this wrong?

997
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,200
Wait, what?

998
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,520
Can or is our galaxy just an eye in a giant's face?

999
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,200
Has science proved this wrong?

1000
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,000
Cool.

1001
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,440
We never left the galaxy.

1002
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,840
So the answer to that is of course no.

1003
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,080
I like whenever someone writes a question

1004
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,400
and they think I can't decide which word

1005
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,560
is the right way to start this sentence.

1006
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,360
I'll do both.

1007
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,800
I'm gonna leave both in for now

1008
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,760
and make sure I edit it before I click publish.

1009
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,200
No, we don't have to talk about this one.

1010
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,400
I just wanted to put that out there.

1011
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,480
People think about it if we're just living

1012
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
in one big spin and eye in a giant's face.

1013
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,000
Here's my question, Griffin.

1014
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,480
Okay.

1015
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,200
What would the difference be if we were or we weren't?

1016
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,840
How would that affect your day-to-day life

1017
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,560
if tomorrow like Neil deGrasse Tyson was like,

1018
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
we're all in the giant's eyeball?

1019
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,400
Would you be like, well, damn it?

1020
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:06,960
Yeah.

1021
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,400
Well, no, I mean, I'm not always thinking about myself, Travis.

1022
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,080
I would be thinking about the giant,

1023
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,400
like be fucking a little bit empathetic

1024
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,520
for once in your life.

1025
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,520
Do you think that that would make people care more

1026
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
about like global warming and pollution

1027
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,080
if it was like, this is probably pretty irritating

1028
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,720
for like his tear ducts?

1029
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,760
Yeah, maybe if the giant introduced themself.

1030
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,120
I'd be immediately start getting really anxious

1031
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,400
if the giant ever decided to finally go for LASIK,

1032
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,400
finally treat himself, you know,

1033
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,280
because I don't need that.

1034
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,000
Hold on.

1035
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,680
If he has a giant's eyeball,

1036
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,080
whenever we get into a space shuttle and fly into space,

1037
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,840
are we just doing inner space?

1038
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,680
We're flying deeper into the giant.

1039
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,640
I'm just saying.

1040
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,240
Wait, I'm not done talking about this, Griffin.

1041
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,800
I am.

1042
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
Here's another one from Aaron.

1043
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,240
Are we just doing Osmosis Jones?

1044
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,160
Are we all Osmosis Jones?

1045
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,400
Is this all just a Big Meat Dave?

1046
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,760
Holy shit.

1047
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,440
I didn't sign up for this, God.

1048
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,160
Which might be the name of the giant.

1049
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Actually, it's pronounced Todd.

1050
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,720
Popular misconception.

1051
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,480
And so he is the giant.

1052
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,800
Fuck, now I'm accidentally lifting gags from the stupids.

1053
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,200
Yeah.

1054
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,160
How's my day going?

1055
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,280
Don't say accidentally,

1056
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,440
like you didn't reference the Lloyd

1057
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,000
in your license plate tweets.

1058
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,960
That's why I'm saying,

1059
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,520
like I did reference the Lloyd from the hit film.

1060
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,160
Hey y'all, if you haven't watched the stupids before,

1061
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,120
don't sleep on it.

1062
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,640
Do not sleep on this film.

1063
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,560
It is a grand slam.

1064
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,240
It's Bug Hall's finest work.

1065
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,600
Tom Arnold's.

1066
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,360
That is actually true.

1067
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,720
How about this one from Aaron Keese?

1068
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,160
I've been trying to read for 10 minutes

1069
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,760
and it's by Yahoo Answers user.

1070
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,120
They're anonymous, but they asked,

1071
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,440
would my nickname, Navy Bean, help me get in the Navy?

1072
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,160
Yes.

1073
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,840
It's a small thing, but details matter.

1074
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,360
They say put everything on a resume.

1075
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,400
I got this in high school.

1076
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,520
I graduated this year.

1077
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,880
I don't know why I got this name.

1078
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Just because I eat Navy Bean soup,

1079
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,160
can I use this to my advantage?

1080
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,760
Will it help me become a SEAL?

1081
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,440
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1082
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,320
You can't say, I don't know why I got this name.

1083
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,160
And then explain it in one, two, three, four, five, six words.

1084
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,400
Because I eat Navy Bean soup.

1085
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,600
I stepped away from this Yahoo Answers

1086
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,200
to ask some friends and then came back

1087
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,720
and finished the question.

1088
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,560
So says here, you wanna be a general?

1089
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,000
Like you wanna start out at a general?

1090
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,720
Yeah, that's right.

1091
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,320
Did you take like JROTC or like, nope.

1092
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,440
Do you even know what we do here?

1093
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,560
I don't know, boats and stuff.

1094
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Cause we don't have generals in the Navy.

1095
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,720
Yeah, what do you think you're doing?

1096
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,400
Read the name, read the resume.

1097
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,680
Oh, shit.

1098
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,560
You're hired, sir.

1099
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,200
I like this concept, Griffin, in this question.

1100
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,440
And I would like to extend it to other job opportunities.

1101
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,200
Okay.

1102
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,240
How do you mean?

1103
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,560
Like what nickname, like if you,

1104
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,800
if you like called yourself like,

1105
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,440
like Dr. Good Hands,

1106
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,640
would that help you get into like the medical profession?

1107
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,600
You know what I mean?

1108
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,400
Let me hit you with this.

1109
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
Famous celebrity movie star walks into the,

1110
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,480
to the like army recruiting offices and says here,

1111
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,000
you wanna be a general?

1112
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,080
So I'll do redo the bit we just did.

1113
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,840
I'll take a different take of the scene.

1114
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,480
Yeah, that's right.

1115
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,920
I wanna be a, what is, son,

1116
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,840
what do you know about being in armies?

1117
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,920
Do you have any training to be in the armies?

1118
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,560
And this famous person is like, no.

1119
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,280
And like, well, what do you know?

1120
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,000
It says, look at my name and it's Armie Hammer

1121
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,920
from the Facebook movie.

1122
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,420
Yeah.

1123
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,960
I think that's hysterical.

1124
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,920
Oh, shit.

1125
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,840
I laughed when you said you thought it was hysterical.

1126
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,840
So I'm apparently incredibly susceptible to persuasion.

1127
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,600
All right, so not that Yahoo.

1128
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,480
How about this one?

1129
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,440
I forget who was sent in by,

1130
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,720
cause this fucking website crashed

1131
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,000
because it's a piece of dog shit.

1132
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,960
Hold on.

1133
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,360
It's from, yeah, Drew Davenport.

1134
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,400
Yeah, level 9,000.

1135
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,440
This is level, thank you.

1136
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,480
It's by Yahoo Answers user fishingforstars

1137
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,320
who says, doing a mini play based on an episode of Frasier.

1138
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
In my theater class in high school,

1139
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,240
the upperclassmen became directors of mini plays

1140
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,920
that usually have about four to five characters

1141
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,520
and the play lasts for seven to 20 minutes.

1142
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,760
Lower classmen are the people in the play.

1143
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,920
I wanted to take an episode from a TV series.

1144
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,080
Sorry, fuck.

1145
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,440
I didn't read this sentence.

1146
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,080
I wanted to take an episode from a TV series called Frasier.

1147
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,760
Do you mean Frasier?

1148
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,440
And use the transcript for a play

1149
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,800
I would be directing in the fall.

1150
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,200
My Coffee with Niles is the name of the episode,

1151
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,600
season one, episode 24.

1152
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,000
Of course.

1153
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,880
Do you think I would be-

1154
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,800
That's gotta be a season finale, right?

1155
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,280
Gotta be.

1156
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,160
It's up there, I think.

1157
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,000
Do you think I would be allowed to take the transcript

1158
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,480
and use it while still giving credit to the writers slash show slash act?

1159
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,920
Based on what you know so far,

1160
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,400
do you think I could do that?

1161
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,600
So, I think, and I'm no legal expert,

1162
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,880
but I think this is where fair use comes in

1163
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,400
and you can do it,

1164
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,800
but you can't use any of the settings.

1165
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,840
So you gotta have the episode like take place on the moon

1166
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,960
or like in hell, something like that.

1167
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,120
But then all the dialogue can be exactly the same.

1168
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,760
So let's walk into this play.

1169
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,280
You hear that boom, boom, boom, boom.

1170
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,680
Hey, baby, I hear the blues are calling, toss salad and ham and cold cereal.

1171
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,080
Yeah.

1172
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,200
Change the food.

1173
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,440
Yeah.

1174
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,720
Hey, baby, I hear the blues are calling, ice cream.

1175
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,840
And then it starts, that song ends, and it starts.

1176
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,640
And here comes-

1177
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,040
Frials and Nazer.

1178
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,720
Frials and Nazer.

1179
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,960
Those are the tags you use on Tumblr to find, they're big in the fandom.

1180
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,320
Frials says, you know, I'm trying to get coffee with my brother,

1181
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,760
but where's a good place to do it?

1182
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,280
Cause we don't live in Seattle.

1183
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,240
He has to say that.

1184
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,720
There's gonna be some lines that are gonna have to be changed.

1185
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,880
Anything where like, in almost every line,

1186
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,760
they're gonna have to say like,

1187
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,560
I'm not a psychiatrist on the radio in Seattle.

1188
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,120
We live in a universe in which the radios never existed.

1189
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,560
What are you talking about?

1190
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,280
Yeah, yeah.

1191
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,440
The dad in this one is very congenial.

1192
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,920
He has two dogs.

1193
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,400
And Frazier had to move in with him because of problems Frazier was,

1194
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,400
or sorry, Nazer was having.

1195
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,200
Yeah.

1196
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,040
And Frials loves his wife very much.

1197
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,880
Can't stand their housekeeper.

1198
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,200
Yes.

1199
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,160
Let's see, they live on the moon or maybe in hell.

1200
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,120
Do you wanna stick with that?

1201
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,400
Yeah, here's the thing about my coffee with Frials though.

1202
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,040
Yeah.

1203
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,440
Is that this is a bottle episode.

1204
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,480
Oh shit.

1205
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,880
That is just Frials and Nazer talking to each other

1206
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
for the entire 22 minutes.

1207
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,480
Ah, good old fashioned Frazier two-hander.

1208
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Can you imagine the world in which you're like,

1209
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,440
you're in the writers room on Frazier

1210
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
and somebody has the courage to stand up and say-

1211
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,320
The audacity even.

1212
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,440
This world we've created is too rich.

1213
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,360
There's too much going on on the periphery.

1214
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,120
What we have to do is take a laser-like focus

1215
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,080
on these two people that are basically the same person

1216
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,840
if you think about it and just talk.

1217
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,280
What are they doing?

1218
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
What's going on in their heads, right?

1219
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,600
What's going on for them?

1220
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,920
Yeah, but I think this is gonna adapt to the stage really well.

1221
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,800
And to be honest, in this version of Nazer,

1222
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,360
because it does take place in hell,

1223
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,000
they're pretty much all gonna be bottle episodes.

1224
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,560
Yes.

1225
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,000
If you think about it.

1226
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,280
Ooh, and it's the same.

1227
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,400
Okay, every episode is basically the same

1228
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,280
and you can see behind their eyes that they know it.

1229
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,960
And it's like, is this a rerun?

1230
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,720
And they're like, no, this is episode six.

1231
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,160
And it's just like, because they're trapped in a bottle,

1232
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,640
and it's just like, because they're trapped in an endless loop,

1233
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,240
like that's their torment.

1234
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,880
But like, they do act it differently every time,

1235
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,760
even though the dialogue is the same.

1236
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,360
It's so good, yeah.

1237
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,520
And now, one sort of lingering question

1238
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,000
is when you do distribute out the program

1239
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,640
to all of the school kids in the audience,

1240
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,360
do you credit yourself as Gelsy Cramer?

1241
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,200
God, that is an unfortunate name.

1242
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,480
It's a not great name.

1243
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,760
Yeah, I'll be the first one to admit it.

1244
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,280
Gelsy Cramer is a tough sort of...

1245
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,520
It's challenging.

1246
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,200
It's a challenging thing to go by.

1247
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,080
That's Common's new name.

1248
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,280
I bet he mispronounced it in a few auditions

1249
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,800
and then immediately had to follow up with,

1250
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,000
well, that's my time.

1251
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,120
Thanks, everybody.

1252
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,240
That's how we got the part.

1253
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,080
People saw how self-deprecating it could be.

1254
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,800
Hello, my name is Gelsy Cramer.

1255
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,280
And okay, you know what?

1256
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,520
I got another thing.

1257
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,480
So anyway, I guess I won't be playing Spiderman.

1258
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,080
Is that how you say it?

1259
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,960
Am I saying it right?

1260
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,680
Spiderman?

1261
00:55:51,680 --> 00:56:00,160
I would love to play the role of Petra Parker in Spiderman.

1262
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,480
But unfortunately, I've said Gelsy Cramer

1263
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,280
and I don't think we're going to move forward.

1264
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,200
I'm so terribly embarrassed.

1265
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,360
There's scrambled eggs all over my face.

1266
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,800
Stop right there.

1267
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,360
You're in.

1268
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,000
Get off this stage.

1269
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,800
Come here, Cramer.

1270
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,520
Give me a hug.

1271
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,000
You're in.

1272
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,320
I'm about to make you a star, Cramer.

1273
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,720
Why do we talk about Frasier so fucking much?

1274
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,720
I've seen this show eight times.

1275
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,000
I don't get it.

1276
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,000
I don't understand why we talk about Frasier so much.

1277
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,840
I don't get it.

1278
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
Oh no, you pulled back the curtain

1279
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,560
and now we're going to fade away to oblivion.

1280
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,320
By all the metrics, this show is supposed to be excellent.

1281
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,200
I don't understand why we talk about Frasier so much.

1282
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,320
We're not talking shit.

1283
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,080
Maybe that's a better way to sum up our show.

1284
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,160
It's an advice show where they talk about Frasier

1285
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,360
way too fucking much.

1286
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,040
I just don't understand.

1287
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,320
I mean, I just don't get it.

1288
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,440
We talk about it constantly.

1289
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,560
I've seen nothing Frasier.

1290
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,400
Do you guys remember when he fell off the stage

1291
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,360
in that viral video?

1292
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
That's why we talk about it so much.

1293
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,720
He seemed to take it very well

1294
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,360
and he seemed to have a good sense of humor about it.

1295
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,320
Jesus Christ.

1296
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,920
Hey, let's stop the podcast.

1297
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,200
Yeah, this has been our podcast,

1298
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,160
my brother, my brother and me.

1299
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,600
Super quick, I'm going to be in Philadelphia

1300
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,040
doing a Sawbones show

1301
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,720
and I hope that you will come out and join me for that.

1302
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,120
It is going to be at the Trocadero Theater

1303
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,840
and it is July 16th at 2 p.m.

1304
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,600
So an early show, all ages.

1305
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,920
Tickets are 22 to 24 bucks

1306
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,880
and you can get those at bit.ly forward slash Sawbones Philly.

1307
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,560
I hope you will come out and see the show

1308
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,400
because it should be really fun

1309
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,680
and there's a few tickets available

1310
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,440
and I would love it if you would hop on those

1311
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,040
and just come say hey.

1312
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,160
And shortly thereafter,

1313
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,280
we will be doing our my brother, my brother and me live show

1314
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,080
and Adventure Zone live show at San Diego Comic Con.

1315
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,080
We will see you there.

1316
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,120
If you're going to be at the show,

1317
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,960
be sure to send questions in for my brother,

1318
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,760
my brother and me.

1319
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,440
Yeah, we're also going to, I believe Saturday,

1320
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,720
we're going to be at the first second booth

1321
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,280
promoting our upcoming graphic novel.

1322
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,360
We'll let you know the times and stuff so you can stop by.

1323
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,320
Yeah, we're excited to be at San Diego Comic Con

1324
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,200
and see everybody there.

1325
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,760
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1326
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,720
for the use of our theme song,

1327
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,280
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1328
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,040
It's a really, really good album

1329
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,880
and I think you should just go listen to it right now.

1330
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,400
Like don't worry about what the final yahoo is,

1331
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,280
just like go get it.

1332
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,960

Ooh, speaking of video stuff, at this year's E3,

1341
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,000
I joined Justin and Griffin on a floor tour at E3.

1342
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,720
We just had some fun goofing around as brothers.

I think that's it, yeah?

1346
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,640
Yeah.

1347
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,520
Here's the final yahoo.

1348
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,120
It was sent in by Seth Carlson, crushed it.

1349
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,840
Thank you, Seth.

1350
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,120
Yahoo Answers user Atlas asks,

1351
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,600
is Elon Musk basically adult Jimmy Neutron?

1352
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,640
My name is Justin McElroy.

1353
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,840
I'm Travis McElroy.

1354
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,800
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1355

This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1356
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,880
Kiss your dad.

1357
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,280
Square on the lips.

1362
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,720
What the is an interview?

1363
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,400
I mean, I do not know.
