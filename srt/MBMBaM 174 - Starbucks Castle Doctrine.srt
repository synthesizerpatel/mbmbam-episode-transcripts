1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,080
The weather outside is frightful. Merry Christmas, everyone. It's 81 degrees outside

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,920
of my house right now. It's 81 degrees. It's gonna be a warm Christmas at the McElroy household.

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
By that, I mean Griffin McElroy. I guess that's kind of frightful when you think about, like,

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,960
the earth and the fate of the world and its peoples. Christmas time has sprung because

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Halloween's over, so we're full-blown Christmas season. I got my Scrooged graphic t-shirt on,

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,280
which I wear every holiday season. I have a frosty mug of cocoa, hot cocoa. I actually

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,840
literally just drank some hot cocoa. Well, hey, kids, I'm Tom Turkey. Let me teach y'all a little

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,920
lesson about why Thanksgiving deserves a chance. Tom Turkey, you had your fucking time in late

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,320
August and you fucking blew it because you slept through it. I was on vacation. Yeah, I know you

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,920
were, but you- I'm full tryptophan. What we should do is we should start celebrating American

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,760
Thanksgiving during Canadian Thanksgiving, which is in October, pre-Halloween, and just get it out

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,440
of the way. Listen, okay, straight up, though, it's an arbitrary day anyways for Thanksgiving.

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,760
Like, it changes every year and it's just- does it really matter? Why not just make it, like,

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,400
23rd- I don't know, March? No, no, I mean, we should- we should settle on a fucking date on

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,000
this fucking thing because it's- It's September 17th. No, it's the 23rd. The 23rd, I feel like,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,040
is a good average Thanksgiving day, and it's not like when the Pilgrims and the Native Americans

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,160
had their first sit-down, their first collabo. It's not like that shit happened on, like,

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
a set Thursday. It was a day, you know what I mean? It was the 23rd, I think.

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,920
It's not like the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ happened December 25th at 6.38 p.m.

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Yeah, it would be like if we celebrate Christmas, like, when was Jesus born? I don't know,

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Tuesday? The third Tuesday, maybe? I don't know, it seems about right. It seemed like a Tuesday-

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,520
It had a Tuesday vibe in the Bible. Historians have a hard time pinning down- nope, 25th,

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,360
says so. Ecclesiastes 22- Here's the problem, though, is that if we- if we don't do the- the

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,600
Thanksgiving on, like, a floating day, one- one year, it'll just be, like, a big Saturday lunch.

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,200
Like, there will be nothing special about it except, oh, we had three more sides than normal.

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,760
Oh, maybe- maybe for you, Edatron. Yes, that would be your robot name.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
Oh, okay. Because you eat so much all the time?

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
Right. I'm not saying you're fat, but you do eat a lot of- you consume a lot of content.

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,240
Well, I- I want other people to not have it. Fair enough. This isn't My Brother, My Brother,

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,080
Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. You wouldn't know it from our intro, but it is a

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,640
comedy program, and we're gonna be serving up fresh laughs to you just as soon as we find our rhythm.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,360
It's been a while since we've made a live- an actual program, I'd say about three weeks or so,

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,760
since we've made an actual- We've been busy.

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,520
Well, you've been busy.

39
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,000
That's not an excuse. To the people at home, we're just- we're just voices that come into

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,920
their ears. Like, we're not human beings. They don't have time for marriages and,

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,800
um, other big important life events.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,000
They don't want to see us, you know, wiping off the grease paint,

43
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,840
returning- Exactly.

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,440
Returning back to our lives. We don't have any stage door Johnnies

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,040
there waiting for a glimpse of us as we slip out the back of the podcasting theater.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,600
As soon as we- we pronounce that kiss your dad's ground on the lips, we die for a week.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
We die in their minds.

48
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,240
We have no lives and certainly don't have weddings.

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,400
Or murder mysteries.

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,280
But that's okay. We're here in your ears now. We're- let us cradle you into wisdom

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,640
with this first question.

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,520
Since American politics have become such a hot topic lately,

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
I've been having a problem with my- one of my closest friends.

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,640
Recently he's been getting extremely vocal and animated about his opinions

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,160
whenever he finds a news article or political meme on the internet.

56
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Although we don't share the same views on these matters,

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
he and I normally have a great time when we hang out.

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,200
But since he's been constantly bringing up these topics,

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,520
I find him difficult to be around. I don't want to ostracize him from my life.

60
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
And I've told him a few times that talking about politics

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
isn't how I want to spend my time with him, but he just won't listen.

62
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Is there a way I can avoid these conversations while also maintaining our friendship?

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
And that's from Congressionally Confused in Connecticut.

64
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
That someone has to be engaging with him.

65
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
Like there's no way he's just sitting there and,

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,640
an Obama, right?

67
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
And like nobody answers and he just keeps going?

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Because if so, your friend is insane.

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
You gotta- you gotta make him feel small.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,600
You gotta- you gotta learn so much more about whatever subjects he wants to talk about

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
that you politics him under the table.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Like if you- if you haven't already started, it may actually be too late,

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,520
but you need to start, you know, reading Le Monde exclusively.

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,760
You need to start reading back- back catalog of the economists

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,080
and just get like so deep in politics.

76
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,320
You could do that or you could do what my parents did

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,520
when I thought that I would start discussing politics with them.

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,240
And this is actually pretty savvy on their part, so I'll pass this on along to you.

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
What they did was when I would start espousing political opinions,

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
they would just keep asking me questions about my political opinions

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,040
until that thin veneer of basically a hodgepodge,

82
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,800
paper mache construction of hope and good feelings

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
and just a minimal amount of information.

84
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
And stuff you learn from The Daily Show.

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
And exactly.

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,240
And that would- it was- that was- became sort of a tapestry that I would-

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,640
I would wrap myself in and they would just ask questions about my beliefs

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,720
until they crumbled around me.

89
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,520
This sort of predated The Daily Show though, this interaction.

90
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,880
Like I don't know- where did you get-

91
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,640
Don't fucking age me Griffin, Jesus.

92
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,960
No, I'm saying you're old as fuck, but where did you get your shit?

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
Like Nick News? What was your-

94
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,760
He read it on The Onion.

95
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,120
The Onion. The paper one. The Onion.

96
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,600
And I was like-

97
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,480
Oh that would be great.

98
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,840
Every time your friend brings up an article like you read in USA Today,

99
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,600
bring up an article you read in The Onion.

100
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,600
It's like- and you can believe this? He's- he's mating with aliens.

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Listen, you're basically fucking describing Facebook.

102
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
That is basically just my Facebook wall right now that you're describing.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Hey, Obama's a Muslim.

104
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, somebody at a mall believed something about a dragon.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,520
That's The Onion headline, isn't it?

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,160
I don't read much.

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
That's pretty good.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,640
That's not bad. I'll find it.

109
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,840
Does anybody-

110
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,760
Obama says french fries are Benghazi.

111
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,480
I have- I have friends that are- I would say very political.

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
They talk about political things.

113
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,640
But like, does anyone really like talking about this shit?

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,600
Is there anyone that it doesn't make you just feel impotent?

115
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Here's the thing. That's the thing.

116
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Nobody enjoys talking with other people about this.

117
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,280
They like talking at other people about this.

118
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,360
They like just hurling facts and knowledge and random shit.

119
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,040
I guess in the hopes that the other people listening will just

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,480
realize that they are the superior political mind.

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,520
People say not to discuss religion and politics because it's impolite.

122
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,480
And I think that's fair because it rarely leads to any sort of positive discussion.

123
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,360
But I think the other side of that is because they're also-

124
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
Those conversations, almost by definition, can't be fruitful.

125
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
You're going to have one of two things.

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,040
Either you're going to have two people so dug in that all they are doing

127
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,760
is espousing their own beliefs at the other person until they run out of breath.

128
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Or you're basically going to have an echo chamber

129
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,920
where you're hearing your own beliefs repeated back to you.

130
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
Neither one is healthy.

131
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Well, somebody's got to be- Yeah, you ain't Lincoln Douglas.

132
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,200
You know what I mean?

133
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
Somebody's got to be listening to this shit though.

134
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
Or else explain Ron Paul.

135
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,080
Ron Paul started with one guy.

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
It was like Ron Paul talked to this one dude.

137
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,280
And that dude was like, oh my God, Ron Paul, I'm so into you.

138
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,360
And then he told two friends and then they told two friends.

139
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,120
And then all of a sudden you had the Ron Paul extranet of human beings.

140
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
You had the Ron Paul hive mind.

141
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,960
And that was started by word of mouth.

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,440
That wasn't big political contributions.

143
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,600
Can I tell you guys a few things about Ron Paul?

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,280
That I like?

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,160
How long do you have?

146
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,520
I know everybody's lives are so busy, but-

147
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,560
Are you opening to joining with me and opening your hearts

148
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
and just joining the relivution?

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
That's what we call the revolution, but there's love in there.

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
Let me tell you all about it.

151
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Do you like guns?

152
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,640
Ron Paul sure as shit doesn't.

153
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,160
If your friend wants to talk about politics,

154
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,520
you should carry around in your pocket forms to sign up for the next election.

155
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,920
To like make him run for city council.

156
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,080
If he is so belligerent about this, make him run for political office.

157
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
That's your only out.

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,160
Because if he's not going to do that, then he's not serious enough about it.

159
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,280
And if he does do that, you have to be his campaign manager.

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
Oops, you fucked up now.

161
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
That's that you played chicken and you lost.

162
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Oh, cut to 40 years from now.

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,480
He's president and you're his chief of staff.

164
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
And then you're like, hey, by the way, I've never really liked you that much.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
This was all a mistake.

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
But I'm proud of the progress that you've made.

167
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,400
Too bad that you beat the shit out of Ron Paul in the primaries.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,840
I was really rooting for that guy.

169
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,680
I heard some really good news about him.

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,800
What about what if every time your friend brings up 2013 American politics,

171
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,600
you bring up 1913 American politics, but don't let him know the difference.

172
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
But like and I hear that they're voting on something called prohibition.

173
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Then just see see if eventually he'll stop hanging out with you.

174
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
Or you could always bring up rap beefs.

175
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
Those are about the same thing.

176
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,400
Yeah, but when they got Biggie, who was almost like the GOP, GOP,

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
when the GOP got Biggie, that's when things really probably fucking did.

178
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,320
I could I could send you guys some literature,

179
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
but that that shit was entirely politically driven.

180
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,360
Go for the three way beef between Pac, Biggie and Ron Paul.

181
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,200
And let's just say one of them still alive.

182
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
And then the other two died.

183
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,240
Ron Paul was like, Biggie, they might as well call you the IRS

184
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
because I'm not convinced of your continued solvency.

185
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
And Ron Paul said nothing.

186
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,400
He just got it fucking done.

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,640
He just did the damn thing.

188
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Just did it.

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
He did that hit.

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,080
He did that hit on Biggie.

191
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
No, he did it twice.

192
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,400
Mystery solved.

193
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,800
And now you know the rest of the story.

194
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,080
Ron Paul, 2014.

195
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,960
When's the next election?

196
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
Yahoo, please.

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,440
This Yahoo, as long as we're talking about politics,

198
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
this Yahoo was sent in by Harrison Ross.

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,080
Thanks, Harrison.

200
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,040
But Yahoo answers user Friendly Cow, top contributor.

201
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Who asks, why can't you just walk into a store and take something?

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,280
Then walk out.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
Like who is going to stop you?

204
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,320
Walmart stop funding that greeters so you could just walk in,

205
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,760
take whatever and walk out.

206
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
As long as it doesn't have one of the things

207
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
that make the alarms by the door go off.

208
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
That's actually an unspoken law.

209
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
If no one sees you, then you're good.

210
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
It's like, oh, you got us.

211
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,280
If you're saying shoplifting is legal,

212
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,600
if you can cross the barrier and nobody sees you,

213
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
the statute of limitations on that is until you get to your car.

214
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,080
And then once you're there, it's all yally oxen free.

215
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,920
I mean, that's the question.

216
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
If the question is, why don't you do that?

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,880
The answer is everybody does all the time.

218
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,280
Yeah, you've just described the exact conditions

219
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,080
through which everyone is stealing everything.

220
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
Everyone's doing, I've never shoplifted anything in my life.

221
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
Can I tell you why everyone doesn't do that?

222
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Because it's not exactly like everybody

223
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
who would shoplift from Walmart is a master thief.

224
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
I worked in loss prevention at Best Buy

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
and like the ability to be like,

226
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,280
oh, look at that person who's like hiding their eyes

227
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,200
and looking around and it's like,

228
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,400
yeah, you're not exactly like Pink Panther in this shit.

229
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,040
It's that guy in the hoodie

230
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,720
who won't make eye contact with anyone.

231
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
But like, at Walmart, what's gonna,

232
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
like someone, I've never understood

233
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,280
you can just grab the thing and walk out the door

234
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,960
and even if somebody's like, hey, you can't do that,

235
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,040
I work at Walmart, you have to pay for that.

236
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
What's stopping you from just being like,

237
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
no, and there's really not anything you can do to stop me

238
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,560
and then getting in your car and driving away.

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,640
I mean, you can't do that.

240
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,480
Can't they detain you?

241
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,680
Can't they chain you to a right here?

242
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,720
No, they can't, you know why?

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,840
Because I'm a fucking adult and they have no legal authority over me.

244
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,600
So wait, Griffin, are you implying that all of capitalism

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,560
is just a smokescreen and we only do it

246
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,400
because we think we have to do it?

247
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
I'm saying that the societal norms

248
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,120
are all entirely projected into our own minds

249
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,960
by ourselves and our teachers.

250
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I'm saying if I go to Target right now,

251
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,560
I can pick up a fucking PlayStation 3

252
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,760
and walk out the door and someone's like,

253
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
hey, you can't take that, I work at Target.

254
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
And I can say, you're not my dad, like later, later.

255
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,600
And I can hop on my skateboard

256
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
that I've been riding through Target the entire time

257
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,000
because nobody can fucking, they can't touch me.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,280
That's for fucking sure.

259
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,560
It's like Target is like a haunted house rules.

260
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
They can't touch you.

261
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,480
They can't touch you.

262
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,880
They're not gonna, there's a security guard by the door.

263
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
He's not a fucking ordained by the city.

264
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,840
My taxes don't pay his salary.

265
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,880
He's not gonna fucking shoot me later.

266
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,640
If you ever wanna have some fun.

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,320
His gun squirts mustard.

268
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Like there's no way he can't stop you.

269
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,200
That's why he sits by the fucking food court.

270
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,240
He is not a cop later dog, later.

271
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
If you ever wanna have some fun,

272
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,080
if you're at like a big box store,

273
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,200
trust me as someone who worked in loss prevention,

274
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,960
they won't do shit until you try to leave with it.

275
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,720
Even if they watch you do it.

276
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,560
So just make eye contact with someone

277
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,680
in the electronics department

278
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
and put something down your pants.

279
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
And then just before you leave,

280
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
pull it back out and put it on a shelf.

281
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,080
And then just walk out and goodbye everybody.

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,960
And like you've done.

283
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
Can I give you an alternative theory?

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
Just shove it down your pants

285
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
and walk the fuck out of the store

286
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,240
because they're not cops.

287
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
I wouldn't shoplift from a cop store,

288
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,760
a cop good store staffed entirely by cops

289
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,520
because they're gonna fucking enforce that shit.

290
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Travis, what could you actually do

291
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
to someone you thought was stealing?

292
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,480
Like what was my process?

293
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
Crack this open, crack open

294
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,600
how fucking impotent these dudes are.

295
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,120
It really is, okay, listen,

296
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,200
I don't wanna put all security guards on blast

297
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
because I feel like I'm betraying my brotherhood.

298
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
But here's the thing, you guys,

299
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,400
the amount of quality,

300
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,880
like the amount of things that you have to prove

301
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,280
before you can even have someone arrested.

302
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,520
Right.

303
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,320
Like here's the thing,

304
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,960
I could watch you, Griffin McElroy do it, right?

305
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,560
Yeah, and you know,

306
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm fucking going to after this goddamn podcast.

307
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,600
And then if I lost eye contact,

308
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,080
like if I lost the visuals on you

309
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,800
and you were just gone and then showed back up,

310
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
I couldn't do shit.

311
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,240
Couldn't do shit.

312
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,360
Because I couldn't prove,

313
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,440
all you would have to say is like, no, I put it back.

314
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,520
Hey, that's not cool, I'm gonna call real cops.

315
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,200
All right, they'll be here in like 20 minutes later, later.

316
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,360
My car is 20 feet away, bye.

317
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
The point Griffin is making is not that,

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,240
it's not about whether or not they see you do it.

319
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
What he's saying is they can watch you do it,

320
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,480
watch you walk out the door and they cannot do anything.

321
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
They can't do fucking anything

322
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,520
because they're not a cop or my dad.

323
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
If my dad was working loss prevention,

324
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,120
he's like, no, son, don't.

325
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,440
Like, all right, I'll put it back.

326
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,560
And I put it back.

327
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
But very rarely would that happen

328
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
because my dad doesn't work retail.

329
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,000
That would be a sweet,

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,080
like some sort of a duel between they bring on Clint

331
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,640
because he's the only one that can stop Griffin.

332
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,040
It'll be sort of a Thomas Crown Affair vibe.

333
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
I think Griffin's like rappelling through the ceiling

334
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,760
and dad like cuts the string.

335
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,520
Except by rappelling through the ceiling,

336
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,120
you mean like just walking in the door

337
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,760
and taking out a handful of boxes of Mike and Ikes

338
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,480
and walking out.

339
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
If you think I would go that small,

340
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
I mean, I will go that small.

341
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
I'll go small to big.

342
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm not paying for shit anymore.

343
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,360
I don't wanna-

344
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,840
I actually, I don't believe in shoplifting.

345
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,240
It makes me so sad because I know who it affects.

346
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,960
So what I do is I go in and I pick up the thing

347
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,760
and then I leave like a clay pot I've made

348
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,280
or some like shiny stones.

349
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,560
So you like covert bartering basically.

350
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,400
You like very one-sided bartering.

351
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,800
They can't say yes to it

352
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,160
because then everybody would do it.

353
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,560
But I know that they appreciate those sand dollars.

354
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,120
It's like farting in yoga class.

355
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
That is what I equate shoplifting to

356
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,200
is like farting in yoga class.

357
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,600
Because you've done inventory

358
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
at a major retail chain before.

359
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,280
I have too.

360
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,320
I imagine Justin has too

361
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,160
since he's worked about 28 retail jobs.

362
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,440
It's like typically 75, 80%.

363
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,520
And then the other shit gets just straight up cribbed.

364
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
And when someone, if you become a cog in that machine

365
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
you're literally just a drop in the bucket.

366
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,000
You're adding 0.0001 to the shoplifting rate at that point.

367
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,560
Like it doesn't-

368
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
Because most of it, most of it.

369
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
I do wanna drop.

370
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
When I worked at Best Buy, I had like 10 fools arrested.

371
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah.

372
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,080
How, Travis, how?

373
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,280
Because I called the cops before they tried to leave.

374
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,840
But you said they won't do anything-

375
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,960
The cops are waiting.

376
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,280
Hold on.

377
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,320
Until they try to leave.

378
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
Which is- Until they try to leave.

379
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,680
And so then the people would walk out the door

380
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,800
and the cops would fucking, you know, come in.

381
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,680
No, okay.

382
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Travis, how on earth?

383
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,400
Because I was fucking on point.

384
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,400
With your profiling?

385
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,480
No, because I want-

386
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,960
Okay, so this is why there are greeters

387
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
because people come in and you say hi

388
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840
and like your normal average person goes, oh, hi.

389
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
And then people who are coming in to steal shit-

390
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
So they look at you and they're like, can't talk.

391
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,040
No, there are people that would come in

392
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,360
and suddenly they'd be so surprised

393
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,000
that a human being was like acknowledging them.

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,640
They'd be like, what?

395
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
Too busy, too busy, gotta steal something.

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,800
In which aisle is your small and valuable things?

397
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,000
About pocket size, please.

398
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
Do you have that special belt that loosens your pants?

399
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,200
The thing is, is like all you have to do is watch people

400
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
and people, like I said, are not exactly master thieves.

401
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,160
So they're like looking around all shady

402
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
and like hiding stuff.

403
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,160
And like, you know, when you see a 12 year old kid

404
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
jacking out the refrigerator section,

405
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
it's like, no, you're back there stealing stuff.

406
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
I'm gonna give you one last chance at this

407
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,640
before I just declare your entire form of profession made up.

408
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
You can't physically stop people

409
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
as they're leaving the store, correct?

410
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,440
If someone went-

411
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,800
All right, let's paint a hypothetical.

412
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
No, no, no, I can.

413
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
I have to prove that they were bypassing the checkout.

414
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
You can't fucking touch them though.

415
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,600
You can't grab them by the script.

416
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,320
That's what I'm saying.

417
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
If someone walked in the store-

418
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,600
Oh, I hardly disagree.

419
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
Let me finish my scenario.

420
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
Someone walks in the store,

421
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,720
goes full-blown supermarket sweep in two and a half minutes,

422
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
just like runs through the phone aisle,

423
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,920
like wee, just like knocking shit into their giant pants

424
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,880
and then runs out.

425
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,680
You can't do shit about that scenario.

426
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,200
I would tackle the shit out of them.

427
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
You can't, that's assault.

428
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,520
That's assault and you go to jail

429
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,960
and don't want that happening to you, my brother.

430
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
I wouldn't do very well in prison.

431
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm just saying you wouldn't be able to-

432
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,840
I would though.

433
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
The settlement would pay for all the shit

434
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,400
that he was gonna steal

435
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
and then you'd be back to square one.

436
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,680
But see, the problem is, Griffin-

437
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,200
You're not Batman.

438
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,520
You're not Batman.

439
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
I don't know why we haven't talked about this

440
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,920
for 20 minutes now.

441
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,400
But the problem is the fiction that you're creating

442
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
is not how people shop with.

443
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,560
It's reality.

444
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,120
I've never seen anyone do that.

445
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,440
I agree that that would be a solid play.

446
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
But people are trying to heist it.

447
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,320
People are trying to Ocean's Eleven it

448
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
and the first person I ever had arrested

449
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
was hiding it in a baby carriage.

450
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
Just pick up the thing and walk out.

451
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
I do agree with you.

452
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,240
That's what I'm saying.

453
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,200
People just don't do it that way.

454
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,480
They're not, not yet.

455
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
Not until this episode hits the fucking web.

456
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
God, Travis, I bet when you would catch someone stealing

457
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
literally the second the cops are out of earshot,

458
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,600
you would just crank Katrina in the waves

459
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,040
and just dance around the store.

460
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,840
Actually, the first time I had someone arrested,

461
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,320
I jumped up and down in celebration

462
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,680
so hard I hurt my ankle.

463
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,880
Just like Batman does.

464
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
I think that's how the killing joke ended.

465
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,920
I am here at Starbucks studying

466
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,040
and there's a guy taking out the only two comfy chairs

467
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,400
with him in his bag,

468
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
is putting his feet on the little table

469
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,640
that is shared between them and hasn't bought a drink.

470
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
I have no plans on sitting on them,

471
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,880
but it's annoying me how inconsiderate it is.

472
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,800
I just asked the barista if they could do something about it

473
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
and they said they can't even talk to the customers.

474
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,720
What can I do to fix this without getting into 50 cuffs?

475
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,160
And that's from not a single fuck was given in South Texas.

476
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
Can I just like, can I just say something?

477
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,360
Can I just say something really quick

478
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
based on this new fucking worldview

479
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
that I've adopted since we started recording?

480
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
Just walk up to him and take his bag.

481
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Just take his bag and walk out.

482
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,720
What is he, like, what can he possibly do?

483
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,760
He can't touch you.

484
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,960
No, he actually can at that point.

485
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't think he is not associated with the store.

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,520
I don't think you get the fucking castle doctrine at Starbucks

487
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,400
no matter how much you think you live there, Brad.

488
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,680
You're still associated with like humanity and the law

489
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,360
and you can say, hey, you assaulted me.

490
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
I was just trying to steal that.

491
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, mine's a victimless crime

492
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,720
in that no one was physically injured, but-

493
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
Right, I just, man.

494
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
This is why we have the liner at the beginning

495
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,040
saying don't do anything we say

496
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,560
because I'm basically telling everybody

497
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,720
just fucking whatever's not nailed down, man.

498
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,280
Grab it and go.

499
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
I think, question asker,

500
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,080
I think what you need to do is to realize

501
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
that this seems inconsiderate

502
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
until you consider that everyone in the world

503
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
is inconsiderate and terrible.

504
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,640
That's not-

505
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,800
And so this is actually, this is pretty basic.

506
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,960
If you ever need proof of it,

507
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,680
all you have to do is travel.

508
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,960
Travel, having just been on so many flights

509
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
and going through so many airports,

510
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,680
it is this microscope under which you can view

511
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,080
the inconsiderate nature of all humanity.

512
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
You go on one honeymoon and all of a sudden

513
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
you've seen the curvature of our terrible Earth.

514
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
Curvature of the terrible Earth

515
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
was my favorite pop band in the 80s.

516
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,680
I think this is a very different,

517
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
I mean, I think they're very different people.

518
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,680
Me, when I go into a place that is my home,

519
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,760
literally all I'm thinking about is,

520
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
please, God, don't let anybody yell at me.

521
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,520
Just let me not get yelled at

522
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
for this time that I've left my door

523
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
and will soon return to it.

524
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,400
Please don't let me get yelled at.

525
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
If I'm at Starbucks, I'm pretty sure

526
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,120
that when I plug my laptop into the wall,

527
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,560
they're gonna yell at me.

528
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's art juice.

529
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
Are you gonna buy four coffees?

530
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
It's four coffee feet, use the plug.

531
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,360
Like, I didn't know.

532
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,800
I just think it's a different world

533
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,160
where some people don't think that way.

534
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,520
I think it's very possible that this person

535
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,200
doesn't know what a dick fish they're being.

536
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
And if that's the case, then just walk up to him

537
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
and say, hey, can I move your bag and sit down, please?

538
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,280
Hey, do you know what my pet peeve is?

539
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,960
As long as we're talking about inconsiderate people.

540
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,840
And it's when someone either walks into a doorway

541
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,720
in a room or gets to the bottom of a set of stairs

542
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,800
and stops when there's a group of people behind.

543
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,040
I was on a tour of a castle

544
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,280
and very small doorways, very small things.

545
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,760
And people would get inside the doorway of a room

546
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
and stop and look around.

547
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,400
And it's like, hey, dog, there's 30 people behind you.

548
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
Life is so hard when your castle tours

549
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,200
are interrupted that way.

550
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,080
I know, Jesus.

551
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,480
Hey, is this what it's gonna be?

552
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,440
Is this how it's gonna be?

553
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,640
I think that you run a real risk.

554
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
Travis does have a fair point.

555
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:16,720
Thank you.

556
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,280
I don't think everyone on Earth is that way.

557
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,080
But I think that if you're looking for people like that,

558
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,240
you will find no shortage of inconsiderate people.

559
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,000
Especially at Starbucks.

560
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,440
You're looking at the worst place.

561
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,560
Yes, and I think that if you allow it,

562
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,040
you are constantly going to be annoyed

563
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,280
by people that aren't directly inconveniencing you.

564
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,160
And I know it's annoying,

565
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,320
but unless you're being directly...

566
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,520
If you're looking for a seat,

567
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,160
I think you're 100% within your right to say,

568
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,880
hey, would you mind if I sat there?

569
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,480
That's human and natural,

570
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,800
and that's how we should be interacting with each other.

571
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,320
But if you don't need a seat and you leave your seat...

572
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
First off, you can leave your seat, bummer.

573
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
But secondly, it doesn't...

574
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,640
Actually, the TikTok seat lock is enforceable by law.

575
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,960
That is the only thing that our fucking legal system can allow.

576
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
And you can actually assault someone if they break it.

577
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,360
You can fucking beat the shit out of someone.

578
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,560
You can steal their shit.

579
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,000
But TikTok seat lock is...

580
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,240
Is TikTok seat lock what you had in college?

581
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,720
Yeah.

582
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
We had barbershop.

583
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,120
That's what we...

584
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
What would you say?

585
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,880
TikTok barbershop.

586
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
TikTok barbershop?

587
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,680
No, we would just say barbershop when you get up.

588
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,080
You would quote your favorite barbershop lines from barbershop.

589
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,200
But wouldn't that be confusing

590
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,800
if you were just going to the haircut place

591
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,720
and you were just announcing your friends like,

592
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
oh, barbershop.

593
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
And they're like, oh, should I sit in a seat

594
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,920
or is he going to go get a shave and a polish?

595
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
It was the 70s.

596
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
We didn't get haircuts.

597
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,080
What was your guys' favorite barbershop movie?

598
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,640
I think it was Barbershop 2.

599
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,120
That's right.

600
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,400
I don't know when people started getting so rude.

601
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,520
I don't know what the turning point,

602
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,640
what the tipping point was using Malcolm Gladwell content.

603
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,600
At some point, shit done tipped and everyone got really rude.

604
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
I think it's when Touched by an Angel went off the air.

605
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,880
We didn't have the soothing influence of Roma Downey there.

606
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
I think if Roma Downey had walked into this Starbucks

607
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
and be like, oh, child, you should get up

608
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,800
and not be occupying three seats.

609
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,320
Do you know, wait, do you know which one was Roma Downey?

610
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm Roma Downey.

611
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,280
Which one was she?

612
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,240
Who do you think she was?

613
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,960
I thought she was the large black woman.

614
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,400
No, you're done wrong.

615
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,320
Okay, so you, in trying to fuck me, got fucked yourself.

616
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,600
The old Roma Downey fuckeroo.

617
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,920
You flipped it on yourself.

618
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,360
I think it was Robert Downey Jr.'s wife.

619
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,240
Oh, no.

620
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,920
I think that's inaccurate.

621
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,840
First off, she was a gypsy woman, I believe.

622
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,880
She would have to take the junior first if they got married.

623
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,440
Secondly, where do you get off?

624
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,680
Where do you fucking start?

625
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,960
Challenging people's Touched by an Angel knowledge

626
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
when you yourself are pretty fuzzy on the basics of Touched by an Angel.

627
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,600
Listen, all I need to know is was James Spader on that show

628
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,280
or am I thinking of the wrong dude?

629
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,400
Yes, he's on every show, but I think he was on that one too.

630
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,720
This is what happens, you miss two weeks of episodes

631
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
and I forget who Roma Downey is.

632
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

633
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,440
Sure, yeah.

634
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,560
Ugh, I still had that tab open about why can't you just take shit

635
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
and it makes me so angry.

636
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,680
This Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Burghardt.

637
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,240
Thanks, Ashley.

638
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user

639
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,680
PowerHouseStan who asks,

640
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,280
can your girlfriend break up with you if she doesn't like your Facebook photos?

641
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,600
We've been going out for three days, but she's been very distant.

642
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
I don't know, before she was all over me and she doesn't even respond.

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,400
I even added her on FB and she didn't respond.

644
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,480
Any advice, kind people of Yahoo Answer?

645
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,840
Additional details, I'm 16 and she's 15.

646
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Ah, Jesus, I've invited her places, but she says she has a strict father.

647
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,040
I think I can be fun.

648
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,700
Wow.

649
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,360
Can your girlfriend break up with you if she doesn't like your FB photos?

650
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,600
It's just so weird to me that that seems like the least of his worries.

651
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Listen, it's fucking hard out there,

652
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,040
even for a relationship that's been going on as long as three days.

653
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,080
A solid 72 hours.

654
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,440
A solid 72 hours.

655
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
The first 48 were amazing.

656
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,160
We're amazing.

657
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,320
It was like before sunrise,

658
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,320
like every moment was just pregnant with romantic intent.

659
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
And now she doesn't respond.

660
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,400
She's pregnant.

661
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,240
There has been a poke lingering for eight hours unanswered, an unrequited poke.

662
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm an old man and I don't know any better,

663
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,600
but isn't it weird that they would engage in a relationship

664
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,680
and not already be Facebook friends?

665
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,840
That is quite puzzling.

666
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
I think maybe this is a whirlwind affair.

667
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,360
I think it's gotta be even a whirlwind affair.

668
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,200
I feel like Facebook friendship should be step number one.

669
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,280
Especially for a 15, 16 year old.

670
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,240
Like if I'm considering that at 9 30,

671
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,960
you gotta think that they have that in a handbook somewhere.

672
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,280
I think if you don't have everyone in your high school

673
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
on your Facebook friends list,

674
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,840
you're basically, I mean your high school career is over anyway.

675
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,480
Yeah, I mean, I like, you know,

676
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,200
me, I go to a party and I say, who here don't I know?

677
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,440
And people are like, you don't know me.

678
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,240
My name is Charlie.

679
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,680
I'm like, hold up, Charlie what?

680
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,160
And they're like, Charlie Powell.

681
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,440
And I say, okay, hold up.

682
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,920
And I whip out my phone, search them, link them, sync them,

683
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,680
hand over my phone, say, log in, accept that shit real quick.

684
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,440
And then they say, what?

685
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,000
I say, log into your Facebook account on my phone.

686
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And they're like, I don't want you to have access to that.

687
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,480
You're a big Buffalo Bills fan, huh?

688
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,720
Huh?

689
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,840
Oh man.

690
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,640
I see you like books.

691
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,600
Griffin doesn't get invited to a lot of parties in case that wasn't clear.

692
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
No, but when I do, I make it fucking count.

693
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,680
And then he steals stuff from the person's house.

694
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,520
And I just walk to their house and take the things.

695
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,600
They can't touch me.

696
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,360
Actually in Texas, they definitely can.

697
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,800
Can't run that game in Tejas.

698
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,640
Cannot do it.

699
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,280
Cannot do it.

700
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,080
They have strictures written down explicitly saying, don't do this thing.

701
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
Or you will be, or you can be harmed.

702
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,920
Capitally.

703
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:25,360
If you in high school start dating someone, but you're not connected on Facebook.

704
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,520
One, two, you don't go out and hang out and do anything because she has a strict father.

705
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,840
Yeah.

706
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,920
How did they get dating in the first place?

707
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,400
Yes.

708
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes.

709
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,840
It was a drive-in?

710
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,400
It was a drive-in dating scenario.

711
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,520
I'm sure it was a drive-in.

712
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
It might as well have been a spaceship, Griffin.

713
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,960
The odds are equal that they found a drive-in.

714
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,680
Like unless they are their parents, like their connection is that their parents are

715
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,480
weird drive-in enthusiasts that drive across the country looking for still open drive-ins.

716
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
That's the only reality in which that would happen.

717
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,240
What's the modern day drive-in?

718
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,200
Because in our day, you go to a drive-in with a group of your friends.

719
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,840
You would swap hot rods, right?

720
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,120
And you would, you know, neck.

721
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,960
You raise for pinks.

722
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,280
Yeah.

723
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,720
You would neck for a solid 90 minutes, depending on the length of the movie.

724
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,000
Sometimes you would say you would want to go to a longer movie, like remains of the day.

725
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,240
You can get a solid two and a half hours of necking in.

726
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,800
And what's the modern equivalent of that?

727
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,720
What is the modern equivalent of that?

728
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,400
I guess anywhere, anything.

729
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,400
I often race for pink slips, just at normal movie theaters now.

730
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,080
Outside the parking lot.

731
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,120
I mean, that would make it so much easier.

732
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,680
We should race our Toyota matrices at some point.

733
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,880
What year is yours?

734
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,440
2003.

735
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,600
Oh, that's a slow shit.

736
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,280
I mean, I've souped it up.

737
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,640
I've done quite a bit of work.

738
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,160
I have a lot of, I have a few.

739
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,840
What kind of stuff did you add to it?

740
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,880
Oh God, Hemi.

741
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,960
You put Blazer, you put Blazer.

742
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,280
You put Blazer, you put Blazers in there.

743
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Blazers, NOS, the wrapper just rides around with me.

744
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,400
Brakes, I just took those out.

745
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,720
Never going slow again.

746
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
Griffin knows where all the mattress stores in town are now.

747
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,480
That is one benefit of losing the brakes.

748
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,960
Yeah, stuff like that.

749
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,040
Six wheels, using more traction on the ground.

750
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,960
Butter, just covered everything in butter.

751
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
Just get up real, real, real slippery in there.

752
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
Which makes me pretty, pretty popular to drive in.

753
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,320
He has two steering wheels, one for left and one for right.

754
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,200
That's right.

755
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,120
It's basically like pod racing.

756
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,400
It can't go in park.

757
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,520
It's another thing.

758
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
That one was tricky to figure out.

759
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,480
Just like the physics of it is that it can't stop.

760
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,920
And you actually can't turn it off.

761
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,800
If I remember correctly, you just welded the key on.

762
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,040
Yeah, you could say she's a gas guzzler.

763
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,400
Except she's not powered by gas.

764
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,560
Just fire.

765
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,720
It runs on fire.

766
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,760
So pretty fast car if you want to race them.

767
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
Yours sounds more stock than mine.

768
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,400
But there's no shame in that.

769
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,320
It's all about the driver, not about the beast.

770
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,440
That's what I learned from Too Fast, Too Furious.

771
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,960
Or at least the 45 minutes of it you watched.

772
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,880
Yeah, I couldn't finish it.

773
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,440
One would say that movie was a little too fast and too furious

774
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,280
for Travis's taste.

775
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,320
The Rock never showed up and Diesel never showed up

776
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,520
and I didn't even have my eye candy.

777
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,320
No, but you knew.

778
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,760
That was like three movies ahead.

779
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,520
And you knew that eventually like, God,

780
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,680
the Rock has got to get messy up in this shit.

781
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,920
That's why I forced myself through the first 45 minutes

782
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,640
just so I would understand when I got to Three Fast,

783
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,760
Three Furious.

784
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
You don't want to be lost, sure.

785
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,400
Yeah, I wanted to know what was up.

786
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,080
I mean, I don't think he showed up till Fast Five.

787
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,520
But by Three Fast, Three Furious,

788
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,040
you could already smell what the Rock was cooking,

789
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,520
which is weird.

790
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,280
Sorry, did you say Three Fast, Three Fergie?

791
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,440
Three Fast, Three Furious.

792
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
She was in that one, I think.

793
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,800
What was the one where she came in?

794
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,480
I thought there was four Fergys.

795
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Four Fergys and a Ferguson.

796
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,080
The Hugh Grant film.

797
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
I love my film.

798
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,240
You know, if you were going to shoplift,

799
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,960
I bet the best place to hide things would be in your butt.

800
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,080
Because not only would no one ever find it,

801
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,360
but even if they knew where it was,

802
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
they wouldn't go looking for it.

803
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,320
I mean, I already said that you can just walk out

804
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,200
because no one can touch you.

805
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,840
But I guess if you want to go the whole nine yards.

806
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,400
Well, what if you like having things in your butt?

807
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,200
If you want to go the Sextra Mile,

808
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,800
there's only one way to go,

809
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,640
and that's ExtremeRestraints.com.

810
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,400
They've got everything you can fit in your butt.

811
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,760
If it fits, it ships.

812
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,240
And I bet it's like stuff that feels better

813
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,400
to have up there than like a CD player.

814
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,600
Like maybe the Ass-Emulator Wireless Silicone Butt Plug.

815
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Wait, it's wireless?

816
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,960
What other butt plugs are wired?

817
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,600
No one wants that weird cord dangling out of your khakis.

818
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Luckily, there's the Ass-Emulator Wireless Silicone Butt Plug.

819
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,120
It's your secret.

820
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,800
No one else in Jenny's needs to know

821
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,280
that you've got this beautiful AAA goblin beauty.

822
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,320
What percentage?

823
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,640
But what does the batteries do, Justin?

824
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,640
They play CDs.

825
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,000
The two batteries will play MP3s

826
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,920
that reverberate through your colon

827
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
and you can hear them in your ears.

828
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,920
Also, more importantly, it vibrates.

829
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,120
Do you guys hear air supply?

830
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
I swear to God, I hear air supply.

831
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,040
Now that only works if you have braces.

832
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,000
That's worth noting.

833
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,600
That's why fucking Lucille Ball,

834
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,000
she thought she heard radio signals all the time.

835
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,720
It wasn't.

836
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,960
It was Desi's radio butt plug.

837
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,480
You can use remote control.

838
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,000
It only has two buttons on it.

839
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,840
I guess because the most important one is off

840
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,160
because I can see a lot of scenarios in which,

841
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,840
well, this is no longer appropriate.

842
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,480
There's one that says go and one that says go hard.

843
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,480
Don't worry.

844
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,320
This one does come with a power button

845
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,640
so you can't shut it off at some point.

846
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,240
And there's 10 modes of vibrating pleasure.

847
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,560
So you can pick that up at extremistraints.com.

848
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,600
Now here's the thing about,

849
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,280
and maybe use it as a space.

850
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
There's lots of things you graduate up

851
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,480
to the biggest things you can put in there

852
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,520
until you can fit a nook in there.

853
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,000
I have a thick colonic wall.

854
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,000
I may be sharing a little bit too much for you guys.

855
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,920
Let me know when it starts getting uncomfortable for you.

856
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,080
But I have a really thick colonic wall.

857
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,640
Will the wireless-

858
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
The question at Extremistraints is

859
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,840
when does it get uncomfortable for you?

860
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,160
I have a thick colonic wall, as I said, a couple times now.

861
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,320
Will the wireless signal from this remote

862
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,640
be able to reach the device that I have installed within me?

863
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,120
When I have-

864
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,840
Well, you have to put the device in your butthole too.

865
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,800
I mean, that's-

866
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
Now we're dealing with a little old lady

867
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
who swallowed a fly scenario.

868
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm gonna have to shove a horse up there

869
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
to get the 20th remote that I've shoved up there

870
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,880
to shut down the 19th remote and so on, et cetera.

871
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm just chock full of remotes over here.

872
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm just jangling around.

873
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,360
Just a big ball of plastic and batteries.

874
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,520
Is the remote programmable?

875
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Could I control both my butt plug and my Bose sound system?

876
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,920
Yeah, but you don't wanna get that turned around

877
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
because you're either gonna deal with really loud music

878
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,080
or an exploded butthole.

879
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,320
Crank it.

880
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,040
Oh, don't.

881
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,360
Oh, don't.

882
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,240
Oh, no.

883
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,960
Don't crank it.

884
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,440

We wanna give a message to Aaron Brown from Desiree Dupree.

887
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,960
It says, happy birthday to you.

888
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,400
Happy birthday to you.

889
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,600
Happy birthday.

890
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,240
Oh, we can't do it.

891
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,040
No, we can't say it.

892
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,600
Don't sing it.

893
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,120
We'll get arrested.

894
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,360
Sing it, but sing it to the theme of a different song.

895
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,420
Okay.

896
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,880
Do it to Welcome Back, Cotter.

897
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,600
Happy birthday to you.

898
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,280
Happy birthday to you, dear Aaron.

899
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Happy birthday to ya.

900
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
Hey, you're famous.

901
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,680
You don't have to sing this part.

902
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,520
Hope you have a good birthday because you're the best in town.

903
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,320
Now you're adding-

904
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,520
According to our new rival, life is more than their survival.

905
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,880
Yeah, they don't try to live the good life yet, Aaron.

906
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,720
Standing tall on the wings of Aaron's birthday.

907
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Henry, we got a message to you from Elisa.

908
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,080
She says, please wish Henry a happy 27th birthday for me.

909
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
Nothing to rearrange.

910
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,320
Show me that Henry again.

911
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,760
Show me that Henry.

912
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,240
Don't waste another Henry on your Henry.

913
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,480
It's a rare condition this day and age that me and Henry have been together for 12 years

914
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,760
of sweet delight.

915
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,720
Yet he only cares to hear birthday wishes from the mouths of the macaroons.

916
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
Love him anyway.

917
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
What are the next words?

918
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,560
There must be some magic clue inside these gentle walls.

919
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,060
All right.

920
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,280
I never knew the next words, but I'm glad I do now.

921
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,760
I got a message for Angelo from Dan, Greg, Nick, and Wayne.

922
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,540
Wayne?

923
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,740
Wayne.

924
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:35,060
Angelo, we hope you have the rudest, most hecklesome, nice and neat math filled birthday

925
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,220
yet.

926
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,980
I hope I didn't just say something gross.

927
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,380
Don't let those cadavers you see on a daily basis bring you down.

928
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,260
Here's hoping for high quality goofs on this episode.

929
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,060
Sorry.

930
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,100
And shit in your pants now that you heard some authentic McElroy Leo-isms.

931
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,980
Wait, what?

932
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,780
From your favorite.

933
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,940
I think these guys hate Angelo.

934
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,620
Why do you hate Angelo so much?

935
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,380
And why are you calling him a serial killer?

936
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,220
I mean, I guess jokes on them because they just paid like a penny to wish him a happy

937
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,260
birthday on this podcast.

938
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,060
So I guess good way to prank suckers.

939
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,300
Is he seeing the cadavers on a professional level?

940
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,980
Welcome back.

941
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,940
Welcome back.

942
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,980
Welcome back.

943
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,620
Okay, hold on.

944
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:19,300
Dan, Greg, Nick, and Wayne are dead bodies that haunt Angelo.

945
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,580
No.

946
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,420
Okay, Angelo killed Dan, Greg, Nick, and Wayne and actually wrote this message to himself

947
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,140
from the perspective of their dead bodies.

948
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,540
Oh, and this is like the monkey's paw.

949
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,100
This is the-

950
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,140
This is the monkey's paw.

951
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,860
This is the heart beating beneath the floorboards.

952
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,340
That's driving him insane.

953
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,380
This is the black cat.

954
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,860
This is the in a pendulum.

955
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,260
This is Jesse Thorne, proprietor of MaximumFun.org and host of International Waters.

956
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,940
International Waters pits a team of comedians in London against a team of comedians here

957
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,660
in LA over several rounds of very stupid pop culture questions and games.

958
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,620
We've got Paul F. Tompkins, Josie Long, Greg Proops, Claudio O'Doherty, Robin Ince, Andy

959
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,060
Zaltzman, Paul Scheer, Izzy Sooty, Ricky Carmona, Cameron Esposito, Aaron Gibson, Brian Safi.

960
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:12,580
So join me and the best comedians in the English speaking world for International Waters.

961
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,020
Go to MaximumFun.org or look for us in the iTunes store.

962
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:22,660
Farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Get your pitchfork.

963
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,100
Justin had a stroke.

964
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,660
Oh no.

965
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,180
Did you know carrots?

966
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,020
Do you know carrots and being around goats can fix strokes?

967
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,740
Our first farm wisdom comes to us from IMDB.

968
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,180
Says that John Dye was in touch by an angel, not James Spader.

969
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,660
Dammit.

970
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,100
Jesus Christ.

971
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,980
James Spader.

972
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,260
I know. I was surprised too.

973
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,180
John Dye is dead now.

974
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,980
He passed in 2007.

975
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,740
Was he playing James Spader?

976
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,140
He was playing James Spader playing the angel of death.

977
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,700
And he passed away.

978
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:06,820
The skin on a turkey's head and waddle can change with their mood.

979
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,380
It can be red, pink, white, or blue.

980
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,700
I think if they'd heard the past couple minutes of podcast, probably blue.

981
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,500
That's from Alan.

982
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,420
Trav, give me one.

983
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,780
Break me off a piece.

984
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,940
Apparently horses engage in a behavior called cribbing.

985
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,980
Where they go to Target and just like pick shit up and leave.

986
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,660
Where they copy each other's test answers.

987
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,460
Where they bite down on something like a wooden post and suck in air.

988
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,220
It can cause stomach ulcers.

989
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,860
They may do this out of boredom, stress, or dietary imbalance.

990
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,980
Those are both from Alan.

991
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,220
People think we give horses a hard time.

992
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,060
That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard.

993
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,780
Okay, no.

994
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,100
To be fair, it's not exactly like human beings.

995
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,940
This shit that we do where it's like,

996
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,420
hey, if you drink too much alcohol, it can kill your liver.

997
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,780
Be like, yeah, but I'm stressed.

998
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,300
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.

999
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,060
Which is what I say every time I take a shot.

1000
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,740
If a horse gets this stupid because of boredom, stress, or dietary imbalance,

1001
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,100
that's not the horse's fault though, is it?

1002
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,060
It's the owner's.

1003
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,700
And the fact that you have this precious treasure that you're fucking in charge of keeping,

1004
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,420
not bored, not stressed, and not imbalanced, dietarily speaking.

1005
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,220
This isn't on the fucking horse, Justin.

1006
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,820
Horses are perfect.

1007
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,020
Also, if they do do this, they probably have a pretty good reason for it.

1008
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,860
Beyond the boredom or stress or diet.

1009
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,140
We can't see inside their heads.

1010
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,500
This might be a religious thing for horses.

1011
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,820
Have you bitten down on a wooden post and sucked in air ever?

1012
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,540
Have you cribbed?

1013
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,340
You will trip balls.

1014
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,420
You will fucking get so fucked up.

1015
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,780
Horses love to party.

1016
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,980
If you want to keep rodents from eating your bird feeder,

1017
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
I hope they mean the seeds in your bird feeder.

1018
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,060
Okay, eating from your bird feeder.

1019
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,540
There we go.

1020
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,060
Put jalapeno poppers in the mix.

1021
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,500
No, jalapeno poppers.

1022
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,660
Man, put some potato skins and some mozzarella sticks in there.

1023
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,160
Good.

1024
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,540
This is Guy Fieri's target demo.

1025
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,300
Is rats.

1026
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,620
Just take those rodents to Max and Irma's and give them a triple app of slider pack.

1027
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,940
Hey bros, got rats in your bird feeder?

1028
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,940
Buy some of my mozzarella slammers.

1029
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,780
Buy some sloppy-doppy turkey bones.

1030
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,540
We coat them in hair gel to slide right down your throat.

1031
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,980
Birds aren't able to taste the spiciness.

1032
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,060
But it does keep rats out of it.

1033
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,100
Birds are rats with wings.

1034
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,220
I don't know why we all are.

1035
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,460
That's from our dear friend Ousmane.

1036
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,100
Why are we giving them preferential treatment over rats?

1037
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,860
Rats are just terrestrial birds.

1038
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,980
Rats are birds.

1039
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,100
Rats are the birds of the ground.

1040
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,740
Think about it.

1041
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,580
I always want to try to dress professionally as possible.

1042
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,080
Work.

1043
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,180
I follow blogs.

1044
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,980
I put this on and really make an effort to dress well.

1045
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,780
Problem is I often have to attend conferences for work and have to wear some sort of name badge.

1046
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,580
Oh man.

1047
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,260
Always seems to clash with my style.

1048
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,940
Wow, how do I wear the name tag and remain stylish?

1049
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,980
That's from a lanyard hater in Little Rock.

1050
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,660
Oh, this is a great question.

1051
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,820
This is a great-

1052
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,580
This is one of those words like I wish I knew.

1053
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,300
Well, I mean, if they're not going to supply you with a fashionable name tag,

1054
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,860
you have to supply your own.

1055
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,820
Like maybe if you just had your own like a silver carved kind of thing.

1056
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,300
Well, I mean, silver doesn't go with everything.

1057
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,580
You would- I mean, if you want to-

1058
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,100
You got to have at least-

1059
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,380
What about a big diamond necklace with your name in it?

1060
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,940
See, that's the reason that those exist.

1061
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,220
Can you have a fashion lanyard with you?

1062
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,060
Just keep a fashion lanyard.

1063
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,620
You got to have one in black, one in brown to go with your accessories.

1064
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,820
And then a casual lanyard, which really is going to be seasonal.

1065
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,980
I think you're going to want some pastels for the spring.

1066
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,980
Well, you're also going to want like a utility lanyard, something that's durable

1067
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,420
and can withstand the elements for like outside conferences.

1068
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:04,660
Yeah.

1069
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,940
When you're at a mountain climbing conference business, what are you talking about?

1070
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,180
Or like a paintball business mixer.

1071
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,260
Maybe you could-

1072
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,180
We're up to seven lanyards now that you need.

1073
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,380
Go on, Justin.

1074
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:23,860
Maybe you could class out the name tag a little bit by drawing pictures of classy stuff on it,

1075
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,980
like money clips or caviar or something.

1076
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,260
So you're saying dip the lanyard.

1077
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,100
That's just a messy lanyard at that point.

1078
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,020
No, I'm saying draw pictures of it.

1079
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,860
Draw a picture of caviar.

1080
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,580
It'd be fun.

1081
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,540
My name's Brian and you can tell the things I like.

1082
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,980
I drew a picture of a sleek Lambo.

1083
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,860
Is it posh here?

1084
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,020
Wait, is this a money making thing where we could like have sticker books

1085
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,420
for adult professionals so that they just have some Lamborghini stickers already?

1086
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,900
Every meeting between two adults is a money making opportunity.

1087
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,260
Think about it.

1088
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,740
Think about that.

1089
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,100
Is it possible to have a street team that just you don't wear a lanyard,

1090
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,700
they just go around the room and go up to people and say,

1091
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,740
Brian, and then they point to you.

1092
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,460
And then nobody's going to forget your fucking name at that point.

1093
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,580
Brian's ready for you.

1094
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:21,140
Just hire like a Herald that they walk into the meeting room before you and say,

1095
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,820
my lords and ladies.

1096
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,180
Brian approaches.

1097
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,180
Prepare thyself for the oncoming Brian.

1098
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,900
You want to get a little hipper, you hire a hype man.

1099
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,780
They come into the meeting room, they start flipping the light switches on and off.

1100
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,940
Here he comes.

1101
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,820
Hold on though.

1102
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,060
What's the hype man going to wear?

1103
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,820
You're going to have to get him past us.

1104
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,420
You got to get a smaller hype man.

1105
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,220
You got to get a smaller hype man ad infinitum.

1106
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,660
Let's see.

1107
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,180
So many great ideas so far.

1108
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,700
Can you get a business Jersey?

1109
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:05,700
Sorry, that actually creates twice the problems that it's all a business Jersey.

1110
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,220
You can color coordinate that easy.

1111
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,540
And then your name is just on the back of it.

1112
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,420
Business Cape.

1113
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,620
Business Cape with your name on it is a little gauche.

1114
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,540
Business robe.

1115
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,860
That's moving in the right direction.

1116
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,540
Oh, sort of like a boxing vibe.

1117
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:19,700
Yeah.

1118
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,140
I'm selling like business trunks, business gloves.

1119
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,180
The champ is here.

1120
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,220
Sign your name on that.

1121
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,260
I can't gloves.

1122
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,300
Can't sign shit.

1123
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,220
Luckily my Herald is, is authorized.

1124
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,300
I have his power of attorney.

1125
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,020
I'm just waiting for him to die.

1126
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,820
I'm his lover.

1127
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,660
I'll inherit everything.

1128
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,660
I'm his lover and he won't acknowledge me publicly.

1129
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,500
At night in bed.

1130
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,980
I think about killing and becoming Brian.

1131
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,380
No one would notice.

1132
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,700
It would be a seamless transition.

1133
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,260
Hold on.

1134
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,580
I forgot to flip the lights on and off.

1135
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,380
He loves that.

1136
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,100
He loves that.

1137
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,180
Oh, Brian.

1138
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,300
Maybe sunglasses in the shape of the word Brian.

1139
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,980
I like that.

1140
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,860
Like the two that find those people that make them for the year and they had thought they

1141
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:21,140
had a really good scam until 2009 when they just had that meeting where they had to stand

1142
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,140
around like, okay, look, guys, I think we can work something out for 2010 pretty good.

1143
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,780
But past that, I think we're just going to be really flying by the seat of our pants.

1144
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,580
We'll see you guys again in 20,000.

1145
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,420
I just hope there's still eyes.

1146
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,460
Or that people have evolved three eyes because then we will have it made in the shade.

1147
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,660
There will be nothing but shade, though, because we'll be covered in an ash cloud.

1148
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:51,540
The most important part of style is to not make anyone feel uncomfortable with your style,

1149
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,040
right?

1150
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,460
It's for it's for every your style is for everyone else's benefit to look at you and

1151
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,580
be be odd, right?

1152
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,900
And I think if you show up and you're the only one with a gold plated name tag or a

1153
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,060
Herald dressed in pastels in the spring, of course, then like you're going to you're

1154
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,620
going to stick out and everyone's going to feel uncomfortable that they didn't bring

1155
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,220
their own Herald or maybe they did.

1156
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,940
Maybe that is the maybe that is the coterie in which you run.

1157
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,020
And in that case, where do I sign off?

1158
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:30,660
I I have to guess that if that was the norm for Brian and his business dealings, that

1159
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,140
information would have probably been included in the question.

1160
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:37,780
Like, I try to dress nice and I always dress my Herald in pastels when it is the spring.

1161
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,420
That's the only palette that I know, by the way, matching the season.

1162
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,260
If it's wintertime, I don't know snow colored whites.

1163
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,340
You do blues and whites in the winter.

1164
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,620
You're going to do the autumnal like some brown, some oranges, some yellow.

1165
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:57,620
And summer is just a fucking Jimmy Buffett orgasm explosion.

1166
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,420
But he has to maintain the same decorum and professional nature.

1167
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,740
I thought it was just pastels, but shorter.

1168
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:09,380
Everything's shorter, a pastel, Jimmy Buffett, pastel, like a pastel crop top.

1169
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,220
Great luck.

1170
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,220
You guys want to Yahoo, please?

1171
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,980
This Yahoo was sent in by Daniel Shires.

1172
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,540
Thanks, Daniel.

1173
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,020
By the way, and Daniel wasn't guilty of this, but I feel like it's time for me to sit down

1174
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,140
our audience and have a very stirring talk with them about the subject of the show.

1175
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,220
I mean, we can make it pretty quick, because I could come up with a bullet list of no-nos.

1176
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,340
Like number one, incest, number two, poop, number three, poop incest, very, very much frowned upon.

1177
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,260
If anything involves pooping on someone, especially a family member, you probably just go ahead

1178
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,300
and keep that one in your pocket.

1179
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,380
Especially don't send it in saying, hey, I found a real gem, because then I can't help

1180
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,540
but pass judgment on you and the type of person you are.

1181
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,660
Weirdo, weirdo, fucking weird beard, just keep those yourself and keep digging, because you'll

1182
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,900
find something not about poop or incest eventually.

1183
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,700
Just dig deep.

1184
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,460
There are Yahoo's about other things.

1185
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,260
Anyway, thank you everybody for your submissions.

1186
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,660
This is by Daniel Shires, though.

1187
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,220
He sent this one in.

1188
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:05,700
Thanks, Daniel.

1189
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:11,300
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jacqueline who asks, I just clicked a Yahoo advertisement link.

1190
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,540
Let me just go ahead and close out of that, and then I can get back to business.

1191
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:19,540
How do I get Jonah Hill to notice me on Twitter?

1192
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,540
I want to get noticed by Jonah Hill on Twitter.

1193
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,740
He's like my idol.

1194
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,940
I swear.

1195
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,140
I swear.

1196
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,940
If I had to die just to save his life, I would.

1197
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,940
But please help me get noticed by him.

1198
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,540
Would mean the world.

1199
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,540
Thanks, Jacquelinexx.

1200
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,540
Jacquelinexx.

1201
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,540
Thanks for the question.

1202
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,540
Would mean the world, thanks, Jacquelinexx.

1203
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,540
Jacqueline, I think if you're willing to die so that he may live, it sounds like you've

1204
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,020
already got a pretty good method of getting his attention.

1205
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,660
Do you ever hear that Eminem documentary Stan?

1206
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,060
That was the only way that Eminem ever acknowledged him.

1207
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,740
Right, and they formed a long friendship that lasted to this very day.

1208
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,420
Is this what the song Your Own Personal Jesus is about?

1209
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,340
This person wants to die for Jonah Hill.

1210
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,340
That Jonah Hill is their Jesus.

1211
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,540
No, they want to be Jesus of Jonah Hill.

1212
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,340
Right.

1213
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,660
Dying for his sins, and there are many.

1214
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,620
I saw Moneyball.

1215
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,740
He was great.

1216
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,100
Moneyball was a fine film.

1217
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,780
I know, but I couldn't think of a bad one.

1218
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,740
Hold on, give me a second.

1219
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,940
Yeah, that's a fun puzzle.

1220
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,580
Try to think of a bad Jonah Hill film before you start talking shit about him and his career.

1221
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,060
Can't do it.

1222
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,980
I don't think he's ever been in a bad film.

1223
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,300
Wait.

1224
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:31,540
Yeah.

1225
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,500
Okay, let me try the joke again.

1226
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,340
Griffin will just edit this, I'm sure.

1227
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,180
Oh, he's got sins.

1228
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,620
I saw The Sitter.

1229
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,940
And let me do one cold so you can just, in case the other edit's better, I'll just record this wild.

1230
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,580
The Sitter.

1231
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,060
Can I get-

1232
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,060
Can we get a Cyrus goof?

1233
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:53,940
What?

1234
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,060
Cyrus.

1236
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,180
Cyrus.

1237
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,940
All right, we're doing great here.

1238
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,020
We're doing great picking on Jonah Hill.

1239
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,980
How do you get someone like Jonah, someone of the Jonah Hill echelon to notice you on Twitter?

1240
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,740
Someone from the Brat Pack.

1241
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,380
What are they called?

1242
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,420
I think they're just friends of Judd Apatow.

1243
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,860
Aren't they the Frat Pack?

1244
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,300
The Frat Pack, I think, actually, maybe.

1245
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,980
No, isn't that, like, I don't think that's the same circuit.

1246
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,620
That's like Will Ferrell and all those guys.

1247
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:26,340
I think maybe it had something to do with weed, because they all seem to have quite an affinity.

1248
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,420
Did you just call him Will Ferrell?

1249
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,260
It came out wrong, I'm sorry.

1250
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,860
Did you hear the new Daft Punk?

1251
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,900
The new Daft Punk with the samples from Will Ferrell in it?

1252
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,380
It's great.

1253
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,580
Does that one impression of that guy from that thing?

1254
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:47,620
Jonah Hill seems to be the type of celebrity that, while, I mean, he's definitely up there,

1255
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,940
it strikes me that he's not like a Brad Pitt level kind of like-

1256
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,420
Oh, some of that did rub off during Moneyball.

1257
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,340
You're in a movie with Brad Pitt, and you get the sexiness that follows you along.

1258
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,380
And if you don't believe me, watch Jonah Hill on Moneyball, then watch him in This is the End.

1259
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,940
Dude picked up, like, dude got some shit definitely figured out between those two films.

1260
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,700
How do you get someone to mention you on Twitter?

1261
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,580
How do you get someone?

1262
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,820
I think if you just tweet at him and say,

1263
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,820
hey, Jonah Hill, I'd die for you, follow back.

1264
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,500
RT, please, for a friend.

1265
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,620
The problem is, you gotta-

1266
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,900
Rinse and repeat.

1267
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,940
What's important is you have to look at his feed, right?

1268
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,700
You look for people he has tweeted to.

1269
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,620
Has he tweeted to fans, right?

1270
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:36,100
Has he said, hey, shout out to my boy, this guy, or replied to anyone?

1271
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,180
And I'm looking through his feed, and I don't think he's ever replied to anyone.

1272
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,020
So I think you're wasting your time with this right now.

1273
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,500
I think you need to move on to greener pastures.

1274
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,900
Or just go directly to get him to see you in real life.

1275
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,340
The tried and true method used to be you try and kill Ronald Reagan.

1276
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,580
But that method doesn't-

1277
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,340
You can't do that method anymore.

1278
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,980
You can claim-

1279
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,780
That used to work for everybody.

1280
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,700
Or you could claim responsibility for his death on Twitter,

1281
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:07,940
and then that might be enough to peak his interest.

1282
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,340
Kill a Ronald Reagan, because I bet there's more than the one.

1283
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,940
I'm hoping that one of the ways to get the attention of Jonah Hill

1284
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,220
is not to make fun of a couple of bad movies he's been in, because-

1285
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,220
Yeah, and first of all, we have to think-

1286
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,820
Jonah Hill and Justin got beef.

1287
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,620
First of all, if he is listening to this, I hope he doesn't get upset,

1288
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,340
because really, how long did we have to think before we could think of a bad movie

1289
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:30,980
that he was in it?

1290
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:36,340
And really, the average length of time that it would take to think of anybody in a bad movie

1291
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,460
is much, much shorter than it took us to think of Jonah Hill.

1292
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,100
Jonah Hill, he did his time.

1293
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,140
He did his Cyrus.

1294
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,380
But he's making fucking solid goal hits now.

1295
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,660
I love that dude.

1296
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,180
Did you guys see 21 Jump Street?

1297
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,740
Yes, I did.

1298
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,580
It's a fucking great movie, Jonah Hill.

1299
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,300
I'm so sorry.

1300
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,220
Follow me on Twitter, Griffin McElroy.

1301
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,140
You know 22 Jump Street is coming, right?

1302
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,500
Oh no, is it?

1303
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,180
I just learned that from his Twitter feed.

1304
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,620
Follow back, follow back, Jonah Hill.

1305
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,140
Oh, that's a good way to get him to notice you.

1306
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,180
Be Channing Tatum.

1307
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,900
Yeah, if you can be Channing Tatum, I bet he'll reply.

1308
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,660
Pretend to be Channing Tatum.

1309
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,100
I don't think that's going to work.

1310
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,060
There's anonymity.

1311
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:18,580
Okay, Griffin, you were all about shoplifting, but identity theft is a sticking point for you.

1312
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,700
I mean, it's just harder to do.

1313
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,100
You can't walk in and take Channing Tatum.

1314
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,220
You know what I mean?

1315
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,580
You can't just like go into Channing Tatum's house.

1316
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,700
Wait, wait, Ocean's 15.

1317
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,580
Ocean's 15.

1318
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,420
We gotta have Channing Tatum.

1319
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,900
Oops, we stole Stockard Channing.

1320
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,700
It's okay.

1321
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,300
That's an easy mistake for anyone to make, including Griffin, constantly.

1322
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,420
Every goddamn day.

1323
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,260
I'm sorry, I skipped Ocean's 14, you guys.

1324
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,740
It's okay. Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1325
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,740
We hope you've had some fun.

1326
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,740
We're sorry we were not with you.

1327
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:58,500
The funny joke about the greatest hit shows is they take infinitely longer to edit together.

1328
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,740
And also requires us to listen to when we weren't as bad.

1329
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,700
I don't know.

1330
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,340
Do you think we were better in the days or do you think we were shittier?

1331
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,180
Because I always think we're shittier.

1332
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:11,140
Because it takes us- I think our highs were higher and our lows were lower.

1333
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,220
We're so, so much lower because it takes us so long to find gems in the shit.

1334
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,020
But thank you for downloading that.

1335
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:23,460
We hope that this week, if you get a second, it would be awesome if you share the show with people

1336
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,900
or review it on iTunes.

1337
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,620
You know, something to help us spread the word.

1338
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,980
We don't have a big, you know, we don't have a big PR firm behind us.

1339
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,260
We don't have a Herald.

1340
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,540
We only have you.

1341
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,820
So we need you to help us pass the word around.

1342
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:42,980
And we'll do our part right now by recommending some of the other great Maximum Fun podcasts,

1343
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,740
like stop podcasting yourself.

1344
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,380
Judge John Hodgman, Jordan Jesse Goh, Wham Bam Pow, Bullseye.

1345
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,340
One Bad Mother.

1346
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,460
One Bad Mother.

1347
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,060
And make sure you check out Sawbones.

1348
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,980
It's the show Justin does with his wife, Sydney.

1349
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,380
It's mine and Teresa's favorite.

1350
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,820
We listen to it constantly.

1351
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,260
We listen to old episodes.

1352
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:05,060
Catch the fucking Sawbones wave that is like sweeping, sweeping the nation.

1353
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,740
Justin's too humble to talk about this, but that show is about to start doing better than

1354
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,620
this one.

1355
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,780
Yeah, it was in like the top 10 on iTunes.

1356
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,500
That's sickening.

1357
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,860
It's disgusting, but we try our best.

1358
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:21,140
Thank you to people tweeting about the show like Ian Dukes, Caitlin Klein, Josh, Diabolical

1359
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:27,300
Machines, JP, Matt Brown, Ryan Lynch, one gentleman named Comedy Podcasts.

1360
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,140
I don't think he's a person.

1361
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,140
Sam Lubega.

1362
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,900
Is it Lubega Senior?

1363
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,580
Lubega Vivo.

1364
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,460
That's Lubega's official YouTube channel.

1365
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:39,780
What?

1366
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,220
I don't think it is actually Lubega's Vivo channel.

1367
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,180
Still, that's a great Twitter name.

1368
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:46,900
It is a great Twitter name.

1369
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:53,220
Church's wife, her old friend, Jess Krawowsa.

1370
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,620
I'm sorry I messed that up, Jess.

1371
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,380
And thank you to everyone else listening and sharing the show.

1372
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,260
It really means the world to me.

1373
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,620
Justin, open up that mailbag.

1374
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,340
Tell us what's in there.

1375
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,860
Oh, crap.

1376
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,540
We got so much mail from you guys.

1377
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,220
No fewer than three wedding invitations.

1378
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,580
Can you please make sure you respond to those?

1379
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:18,020
Wedding is a fucking month out, and I'm still missing RSVPs from people.

1380
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,100
Are any of them near any of us?

1381
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:20,260
Yeah.

1382
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,540
Is there any in Cincinnati?

1383
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,820
They're actually all past because I forgot to check the mailbox for a while.

1384
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,460
You did.

1385
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,180
But I did spend.

1386
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,660
Okay, listen.

1387
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,220
I'm trying my best.

1388
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:31,140
Can you RSVP now at least so you don't, like, I don't want people to think that I'm a dick

1389
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,580
just because you're a layabout.

1390
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:38,900
Kate and Liz sent us a horse named Orb that they got in Iceland.

1391
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:45,140
We got a note from Erica, Sam, and Kim that has pictures of gorillas on it.

1392
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:45,700
You like that?

1393
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:51,940
Got one from China from Paden that's lovely.

1394
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,940
Is it a postcard, or do they live in China?

1395
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,540
It's a postcard from China.

1396
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:02,340
Our uncle traveling, Matt, sent us postcards from all over, including but not limited to

1397
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:10,740
Portland, Los Angeles, Olympia, Seattle, Chicago.

1398
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,860
He sent us one from there.

1399
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,700
Catherine and Matthew sent us a beautiful postcard from Croatia.

1400
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,340
We got to save the date for Joanna and Kyle's wedding.

1401
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,140
Not going to be able to make that one because it is past, but gosh, I wish we could have

1402
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:23,460
saved some for any parent.

1403
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,740
Hold on, fuck, we got to save the date and we already missed the wedding?

1404
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,180
Sorry, okay?

1405
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,220
I'm trying my best out here.

1406
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,300
Corinne and Kevin, again, sorry we couldn't make it.

1407
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,380
That was in August, but, uh, and-

1408
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,100
Jesus!

1409
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:34,500
By this much!

1410
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,380
John and Benjamin-

1411
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:35,780
By a hair!

1412
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:38,420
John and Benjamin, consider this our RSVP.

1413
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,620
Sorry we couldn't make it.

1414
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,180
Uh, sorry I didn't check the mailbox for so long.

1415
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:42,900
With regrets, I guess, kind of.

1416
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,260
With regrets, uh, I guess.

1417
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:49,620
Uh, I want to thank- I want Griffin to thank John Roderick and the Long Winners for the

1418
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,420
use of a theme song.

1419
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,740
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1420
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,700
Griffin, can you do that real quick?

1421
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,180
Thanks, guys.

1422
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,140
And thanks to you.

1423
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,340
Here's one last question.

1424
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:02,660
Oh, make sure if you, uh, if you want to wish someone a happy birthday or if you know someone

1425
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,820
that's a fan of the show and you want to send out a special personal message to them, go

1426
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,940
to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

1427
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,060
Can you guys please-

1428
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,540
I love you so much, but please don't email us because we have no mechanism to set it

1429
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:15,700
up.

1430
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,380
You have to go through maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

1431
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,580
No, but we appreciate your emails.

1432
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,500
If you just want to email us and just like chat.

1433
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,420
Um, guys, 20 dirt?

1434
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,700
We're like 60 days left in it.

1435
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,460
Can you fucking believe that?

1436
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,980
Did you get all your dirt out?

1437
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,100
Did you dig it up?

1438
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,820
Wash it out.

1439
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,380
Wash it out.

1440
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,180
Rinse out those sheets.

1441
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,380
What's 2014 going to be?

1442
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:42,580
You know, I- somebody emailed today and said, uh, go full war in 21-4, which I really kind

1443
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,220
of liked.

1444
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:43,860
We'll figure it out.

1445
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,820
We'll get it together.

1446
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:50,100
Um, I feel like tomorrow- next year- tomorrow year is going to be a banner year for us,

1447
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,740
and it's not going to be much harder to beat this year, I think.

1448
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,180
Yeah, we'll actually do a live show.

1449
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,300
We'll actually do live shows.

1450
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,820
That's my promise to you, the listener.

1451
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,180
We'll do live shows, I promise.

1452
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,460
We'll have time on our hands.

1453
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,260
We'll have time to do it.

1454
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:04,980
And I'm going to try- I'm really going to push us to try to do something in the UK in

1455
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,700
the next year or two.

1456
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,020
Oh, Jesus, just don't promise that.

1457
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,540
I mean, just don't promise it.

1458
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,420
Griffin, take us out.

1459
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,060
I said push.

1460
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,100
I didn't promise nothing.

1461
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,100
Final Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

1462
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:14,900
Thanks, Alan Black.

1463
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,620
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rosalie, who asks,

1464
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,220
What the heck is masturbating?

1465
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,540
I'm Justin McElroy.

1466
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,420
I'm Travis McElroy.

1467
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,540
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1468
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,900
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1469
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,860
Kiss your dad.

1470
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:47,940
Square on the lips.

Comedy and culture.

1474

Listener supported.

1475
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,060
This is Biz.

This is Teresa.

1477
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,180
We host a show called One Bad Mother.

1478
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,420
We're a comedy podcast about parenting.

1479
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,820
Not a parenting podcast.

1480
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:07,460
And for some reason, we seem to be most popular among single dudes with no kids.

1481
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,340
Weird.

1482
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:13,300
The only advice you'll get from us is when we tell you to stop feeling like shit for

1483
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,100
being a mom.

1484
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:14,820
Or a dad.

1485
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,700
Or, you know, a single person with no children.
