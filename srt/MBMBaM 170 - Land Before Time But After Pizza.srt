1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,400
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Welcome to My Brother My Brother Me, a very honored advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,560
your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy. I'm your baby

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,520
brother Griffin McElroy. Gosh, could not, this is huge. I want to say, uh, gosh, where to start,

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,640
thank you so much. Uh, welcome to new listeners, I guess, obviously. Uh, and thank you so much to

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,120
Vince Gilligan, Gilliam, Vince, or what he just said to us. Gungan. Vince Gundham. Thank you,

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,800
uh, creator of Breaking Bad. Uh, seeing My Brother My Brother Me referenced, uh, so many times. I

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,200
counted 18, 18 discrete references to My Brother My Brother. I mean, it started innocuously enough.

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,600
Like when, uh, uh, Jesse was like, guys, I've got to, I, listen to me, Beaver and Trunch,

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,920
his two friends. I got it. I don't want to listen to hardcore rap anymore. I've got a podcast that

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,520
you guys are going to love. And then there was just, uh, how, what seemed to be a 16 to 17 minute

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,320
segment that was just Jesse clip from our show, like Beaver and Trunch listening to our show.

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,160
And it was weird because it was basically this like Jesse staring expectantly at Beaver and

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,840
Trunch, like going, ah, you like this, right? Just wait, just wait, wait till they get to the

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,320
extreme. They do this one bit about horses. They do this. They do these 1000 different bits about

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,080
horses. It was a weirdly tense scene. Um, but not like a violent tense, but more like a awkward

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,120
tense because nobody was laughing. Um, but then it just sort of went on from there. Uh, so, uh,

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,240
my favorite part, I loved when, um, uh, Lamont Cranston's character, what's his name? Lamont

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,800
Cranston. Lamont Cranston. Well, Lamont Cranston was cooking up some of his meth and somebody

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
tasted it and they said like, ah, this meth is sweeter than the goofs on My Brother My Brother

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,480
and Me. Yeah. Like really blatant. That one felt a little bit forced to me. There were those three

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,440
brothers that bought meth from him. Um, even though he's been out of the game for a while,

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,720
which is like kind of seemed like a plot holding me, but I'm not complaining cause obviously like

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,600
it's genius level TV. And he, one of the guys was like, you're trying to sell meth to my brother,

28
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,720
my brother and me. But he kept doing, he kept referencing themselves like in that style. Oh,

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,600
hold on. I'm checking Navy club right now. The review of the finale is in. I got it. It got an F.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
Probably because of that at the end when I just kind of zoomed like a really big zoom out and you

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:29,120
realized it was just Griffin staring into a snow globe. Griffin's dream. It was little Griffin's

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,800
dream the entire time. And the snow globe fell from his hand shattered grease, his hand greased

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,400
with the grease of a thousand potato chips. And he of course said, oops, uh, I eat it all the

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,280
potato chips. I dropped daddy's favorite snow globe. And the doctor said, it's so sad to see

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,960
a 45 year old man reduced, reduced to this and they pulled out and it was another snow globe.

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,880
And the snow globe, the snow globe was full of snow, obviously. And then in giant block letters,

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,280
the word bad. And then when it fell to the floor and shattered, and then I looked at the camera and

38
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:14,080
I said, get it created by events. Gilligan. I thought the polar bears were a nice touch though.

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,880
Yeah. I don't know why Hurley was chosen to continue on the meth lab, but, um, so gosh,

40
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,920
thank you to the new listeners who found our show, uh, through our, they're all gone. Sorry,

41
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,720
juice. I I'm looking at the live cast stats right now. They all already left. There were 2.6 million

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,000
people listening and they're all gone. They all left. Uh, so, but thank you. Thank you to, uh,

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,040
those who left, uh, those download, you know, those numbers still spend, uh, and, uh, let's,

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,400
let's do what we came here to do, which is help people. You know, I don't want to lose sight with

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,960
our fame. Uh, I don't want to lose sight of that initial goal around 2 a.m. Every night. I'm

46
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,280
awakened by a very loud cat fight. An outdoor neighbor cat enjoys coming by my bedroom window

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,240
to antagonize my indoor cat. They hiss and meow and try to fight through the glass, making it

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,720
impossible for me to sleep. Keeping the window closed and shades down doesn't help. What should

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,880
I do? That's from cranky in Chicago. I think you should let them fight it out. Yeah. They got beef

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,360
and who are you to try and try and squash it yourself? That's not how the animal kingdom

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
works. It's like Justin and I used to fight a lot. And then my dad would be like, well,

52
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
I'm just going to strap some boxing gloves to you guys and let you like do get out. And I'd

53
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,840
be like, whoa, hold on. It's not that bad. So maybe it's just a lot of, uh, a lot of blunder,

54
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
a lot of fuss. But when you actually say, Hey kitty, I'm gonna let you fight that other kitty.

55
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,440
The way our dad escalated that, um, that strategy was that I thought a little irresponsible of him.

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Like I love our dad, but like once that strategy wore off, he like, he like pumped us full of

57
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,120
mescal and, and like dropped us in the desert with, with swords. And he just like threw a

58
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,680
knife down in the middle of us and said, you know, work it out. And then when he said, um,

59
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,320
I'm going to strap knives to both your hands, he duct taped knives into our hands, both our hands.

60
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,880
And he blindfolded us. I'm not coming back till one of you has taken one. I'm taking one son home.

61
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm taking one son home. I'm going to dip into my college fund that I saved for you guys.

62
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,800
He didn't, but he's a great man. I love him. He did, uh, try to have us kill each other though,

63
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,080
on several occasions, but you know, it made us closer. That's how Pokemon was invented

64
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,800
by us fighting. Why is your cat in your room? I have a very strict policy when it comes to this.

65
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,200
I have a closed door. I have a closed door policy for, for my cats at night. They have run up the

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,040
entire house. There's one room that they cannot enter. And of course that bothers them. So they

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,840
scratched. So now what I literally have is a closed door with a baby gate in front of it.

68
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,400
They cannot even scratch. It is completely my territory, humans only a thank you.

69
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,240
But sometimes when Justin wakes up too early, he'll find his two cats with like a rolled out

70
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,200
blueprint staring at the door and then they're like, roll it up real quick. Meow. Meow. Meow.

71
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,760
We're cats. Yeah. There's a Brad Pitt cat eating a sandwich. Um, I've been watching a lot of my cat

72
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,720
from hell lately. Uh, it's on Netflix. You should Netflix it. Um, so like I Jackson galaxy has been

73
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,240
like preparing me for this, for this question, my whole life, these past four days, Griffin,

74
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
the way you, the way you talk about some programs, I'm just going to assume that one day you

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,360
accidentally put it on animal planet and then through your remote into the sun, because that,

76
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
that is the only explanation for the amount of terrible animal related television.

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,520
This is you. This is you. Oh, my cat. I'm going to pet it. Pet it. Love it. Love it. Love it. I

78
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,840
pet it and I love it. All right. Beat me. Why did it happen? That's you every day. This is me

79
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,240
petting the cat. Oh, the cat's tail is switching. That must mean I put too much energy into it with

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,680
my pets. It's all about how much it's all about managing the energy that you put into your cat.

81
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Cause if you overstimulate it, do you know what it's going to do? What it's going to bite you

82
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,560
with his little teeth. Oh, like those little like a toy cars that you pull backwards to rev up. But

83
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
if you pull them back too far, they start clicking and bite you. You got to rub those cheeks too.

84
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
Cause that's where they get them pheromones out of. And then they like smelling that shit on your

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,440
hands. Cause cats are nasty. That's like, that's true. So they smell their own funk on you and

86
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,520
they're like, yeah, yeah. You my friend. Also, how do you know that your indoor cat isn't

87
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,000
antagonizing the outdoor cat? Like what's up? I got a cool sitch in here. It's totally warm and

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,120
I get food on the reg. I don't understand. Where do you, so where, like, where does the milk and,

89
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,400
and, and kibble come from for you out there? Oh, you don't get that, huh? You're eating garbage.

90
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,280
And you like that? Oh, cause you're poor. I bet you went to public school.

91
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,960
Wait a minute. If one cat in a situation went to any schooling, I have to imagine that that's the,

92
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,440
the privileged cat. Cause cats by and large, don't, don't get a lot of education. You didn't

93
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,440
send your cat to private school? Yeah. Jackson Galaxy said 101. Have you even seen cat waiting

94
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,440
for Superman? Like the public cat school system is fucked beyond repair. You got to get some vouchers

95
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,880
for these goddamn cats. My cat is in fifth grade and learning algebra. Fifth grade. I, I sent my cat

96
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,480
to a Montessori cat school. I think I learned as much from my cat as I do from tracks and galaxy,

97
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,600
which is to say a lot. My cat's still in kit, kitten garden. Ah, done. God damn it. Kitten

98
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,920
garden. Oh, okay. Do you guys want to Yahoo? Please. Anything. Um, this Yahoo was sent in by

99
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,120
Jennifer Cheek. Thanks Jennifer. It's by Yahoo. Interest user. So who asks,

100
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:14,720
I just ate some ricearoni that expired in 2004. Am I going to get sick? Yeah. Definitely realized

101
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,320
this after I made it and ate some. It didn't have bugs or anything that I noticed. The box said

102
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,440
best before, not expires, but I still feel like it's going to be bad for me to have eaten. Is

103
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
anyone eaten old ricearoni before? And then there's a, there's an emoticon. It's like a frowny face

104
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,000
with a bracket. So like, that's a piece of the rice. I think it's, I think it's, I think you're

105
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
supposed to pronounce that. Oh God. Oh man. This is like my worst fear. We laugh at this person,

106
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,280
but I think they're definitely dead. Oh, sorry. Okay. First off they're, they're dead. So let's

107
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,040
not worry about helping them. I think that everybody has at least a few things, at least

108
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,080
I know we do that are in the cupboard that I have no memory of purchasing. And if I do take it out

109
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:10,640
to inspect as I have before the, the date is always like Clinton administration, like a mystery item.

110
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,000
I would argue that I do not because I obsessively check dates on things.

111
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,240
Because you obsessively eat. Because I have no food. We can't keep food in the house,

112
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,400
but it's like, I understand having some old shit, you know, sometimes I go to the jungle

113
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
gyms and I'm like, well, of course I want this weird package of figs. And you know,

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,880
then I don't touch it cause it looks gross. At home it looks gross. It looks great.

115
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,920
But then like I pull it out. I always look like, how do you pull out that box of rice,

116
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,400
your onion go? I don't remember buying this. It's rice. It's uncooked rice. You don't think

117
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,120
that shit goes bad. It's rice. Yeah. But there's gotta be a threshold that we're like,

118
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,520
I don't think this went bad. But granted it was nine years ago. I think, I think that

119
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,000
this has an infinite freshness. I think that the best before date is a recommendation in this case,

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,200
or else they would have worded it a bit more strongly. There should be a best before date

121
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:21,520
and a worst after date. It is best before 2004. It is worse after 2011. After 2011,

122
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,280
it is the worst. It can't get any worse. The half-life will not reduce anymore at this point.

123
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,640
This is what makes shelf-stable food so scary and why I try to keep as many of them in the

124
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,880
house as possible because you can trust shelf-stable foods. They'll be there for you.

125
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,640
Yeah. I do not have the same success rate with vegetables. There's no place in my home

126
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,320
where the divide between aspiration and reality is more clear than walking from my produce drawer

127
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:58,960
to my trash can. I actually this week threw away, and this is 100% true, I threw away a

128
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:08,240
a biggest loser branded bag of celery unopened. I guess the celery was the biggest loser.

129
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,760
I bought that in a store thinking, you know, that celery could not be more.

130
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,040
There is zero hassle with that celery. It's just like potato chips. You pop open the bag,

131
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,720
you eat celery. It is not hassle. That's why I love that in the fridge,

132
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,000
it's like refrigerator designers went, let's make sure we hide these. I'll hide this. Nobody wants

133
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to see this. We're going to put it on the bottom in a drawer by itself. So you never have to think

134
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
about the fact that you're not eating it. Justin, otherwise it's taunting you constantly. Did the

135
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,880
bag have some sort of like hyper color label on it that as it expired, it slowly revealed a picture

136
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,760
of bingo looking disappointed at you. Couldn't crack the bag, huh? I get it, man. Veggies be

137
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,840
scary. Why are they green? You know what else is green? Monsters. You know what else is green?

138
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Godzilla. Bingo's terrified of Godzilla. Hates that motherfucker almost as much as he hates

139
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:08,800
vegetables. Sneak him in the meat. This steak tastes weird. It's oozing green. Oh well, it's

140
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,440
meat. Bingo's got to get big. The only vegetables he'll eat are pimentos that are hidden in head

141
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:25,360
cheese. Fat fuck. I haven't seen bingo in a while. He may have slimmed down. Lost 80 pounds. Still

142
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,800
big. And he's a little kid. How did he do it? Most kids are 80 pounds. Bingo lost a kid. And

143
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,960
he's still, there's still a lot of bingo to just to admire. I don't know who you're referencing.

144
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,080
Fucking, oh god, Google. Like how have you not Googled this kid yet? I don't know. You always

145
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,320
talk about bingo for biggest loser and I don't know this person. I also, I don't want to Google

146
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,840
it because I don't want to ruin the image in my head that you've created because I've got like a

147
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,360
rich, rich fiction going on in my head. Let me tell you something. You're going to Google this

148
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,440
kid and you're going to fuck it up because his name has two i's in it. Stupid. No, it doesn't

149
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,120
really. Mm-hmm. Bingo was his name. Oh, but the song doesn't work. It doesn't work for this

150
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,960
particular bingo. A big hello to my favorite trio of brothers. As you know, Halloween is coming up

151
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,320
soon. I just had a major upheaval in my costume plan. I was going to be the cowardly lion in a

152
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,440
group. My group disbanded and I'm left with no idea what to be. My hair is teal and medium length.

153
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,800
If that helps. That's from Kaiser McMuffin. I think that when you do a big group thing,

154
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,920
one, it works if everybody is on the same level of like commitment and goodness as everybody else.

155
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,320
It doesn't work alone. Like one person spent like $150 on a costume and worked on it for like days

156
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
and days and days. And the other person just like reaches into their closet and throws it on.

157
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,400
But it also doesn't work when you're at the party and you all separate to go do other things.

158
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,240
Yeah, but then you're just a fucking lion. Like you're a lion. That's good enough. That's fine.

159
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,920
That's fine. You did it. You did a costume.

160
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
I mean, great. But imagine like you're doing the dudes from Reservoir Dogs,

161
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,560
right? And like your other dudes leave you and then you're just a guy in a black suit.

162
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,280
What about if he goes peanut butter and jelly and then your partner leaves you and suddenly

163
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,440
you're just toast? Why is jelly crying? Jelly looks so sad. I guess peanut butter just wasn't

164
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:33,920
ready for it. Oh, God. I love that. Travis liked it. I did. It's a thinker is what it is. I got a

165
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,160
mullet. You could go as a mullet. That would be a tough costume to pull off.

166
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,880
I'm giving up on Halloween. I think I'm pretty much done with it.

167
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,520
Because for two years running, I put a lot of work into a costume.

168
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,720
As first as a contestant on Legends of the Hidden Temple, people would be like,

169
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,640
oh, you're a biker because of your helmet. Like, oh, you fuck. These are obviously barracudas.

170
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Anyway, last year I was homeless Elmo because Mitt Romney wanted to shut down Sesame Street.

171
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,800
It was political. It was fucking nobody. Nobody understood my art. Nobody understood my craftwork.

172
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,920
Last year I did Marty McFly and I built a fucking hoverboard and put a little

173
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:25,200
bit of work into it. The first dude I saw when I walked in to the party was like, oh, what are you?

174
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,120
I was like, I've got a hoverboard. He's like, I'm Marty McFly from Back to the Future. He's like,

175
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,040
oh, I've never seen it. You fucking stress out about it all month and then you spend like $45

176
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,320
acquiring the goods and nobody knows who or what the fuck you are.

177
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,680
I also feel like I could see Halloween being totally worth it if over the weekend, like the

178
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,360
28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, you went to like four separate parties and got four different days of

179
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,960
like rocking this costume you spent like $50 to $60 on. But otherwise you're going to one party for

180
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,040
like four hours and you get that initial like, oh, awesome. Yeah, that doesn't sound so bad.

181
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,520
Who doesn't want a chance to just get outside themselves for a night, you know?

182
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,880
Well, I love myself though. What if I just went as like me on my best day?

183
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,000
Is that a good Halloween costume? Me just living it.

184
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:31,600
Actually, our friend Mike Murdock, one year recently, he was in his mid 30s at the time

185
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,960
and he went as himself from when he was happy in his mid 20s.

186
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,440
And he acted like he did when he was happy before he was miserable.

187
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
It's like, just do that every day. Can you go as America's Next Top Model 2.0,

188
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
boys in the house? Boys in the house.

189
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
Boys in the house. Boys in the house.

190
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,160
There is nothing more to say about this that will be funny.

191
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,760
I don't think anything has been said about it that was funny.

192
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,160
I mean, either. Okay, let me rephrase that. There's nothing on earth to say about this as funny

193
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
because if there were, we would have discovered it.

194
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,000
I love it. I love everything about fall. I love cider. I love pumpkin spice lattes.

195
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,480
I love pumpkin spice waffles. Spice anything with some fucking pumpkins and I'll eat it.

196
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:26,960
I love crisp leaves. I love carving things. I fucking hate like October 1st is Tuesday

197
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
and I'm gonna have to start like cranking the gears. I gotta kick it in the high gear.

198
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,080
Can we all agree that like Halloween is dead?

199
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,240
It's dead.

200
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,000
Halloween is, what are you talking? Halloween is, the older I get,

201
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,640
the more I enjoy Halloween over Christmas and that is a set. You guys wait till you're 30.

202
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:53,760
Here's the thing though. If I could attend a Halloween party where it was like a macabre

203
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
kind of like gothic thing where everybody was just like dressed in black and like suits but

204
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,640
like really nice like classy outfits but just the difference was it was orange and black,

205
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,040
that would be dope. It's when you show up to a Halloween party and like really let's be honest,

206
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,720
three quarters of the people are wearing a t-shirt with something they've drawn on a piece

207
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,560
of paper safety pin to it and they're like do you get it? I'm a bottle of ketchup and it's like no,

208
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,960
you're wearing a red t-shirt with ketchup written on a piece of paper. It's like this is sad. Like

209
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,920
this is a bad party. Like let's just be adults and get drunk with a purpose.

210
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I want my Halloween to be a Dawson's Creek Halloween special. I want the fucking thing

211
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,320
to go right off the rails. I want to go to a haunted house where maybe there's an actual

212
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,480
fucking ghost up in there. I want to maybe solve a mystery and then at the end everyone gets

213
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,240
murdered and then the next episode nobody got murdered. I think you've skewed into Boy Meets

214
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,560
World. I just want to be spooked I guess. I haven't been spooked in a real long time.

215
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Why don't you come to West Virginia. We'll go to the West End Asylum. It's the largest

216
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,200
freestanding stone structure in America. Second largest in the world after the Kremlin. Used to

217
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,840
be filled with poorly treated insane people and go on a tour. They'll let you sleep there at night.

218
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,000
It's crazy. That doesn't sound like something I would be into. That sounds too spooky. I want to

219
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,040
split the difference. Split the spook difference. Yeah. Does anybody remember what I was for

220
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,520
Halloween last year? I can't remember. You and Sydney had a couple's costume didn't you?

221
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,400
We usually do but. You were the Doctor Who. And that was two years ago. What year did you go as

222
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:40,720
Lowell and Antonio Scarpacci from Wings? I went as Lowell and Thomas Hayden Church from Sideways.

223
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,840
How about Yahoo? Yeah teach me to laugh again. This Yahoo is also sent in by Jennifer Chee.

224
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,400
Thanks Jennifer. But Yahoo answers user Daniel who asks first day at Little Caesars. Today is

225
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,720
my first day at Little Caesars and I'm pretty nervous. I knew no one there at the orientation.

226
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,760
Yeah Little Caesars class of 2013. Plus I don't know how to punch in.

227
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,120
Also they only showed us how to make one kind of pizza at the orientation. How will we all know

228
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,400
what to make if we didn't get very much training? The store opened like a week ago. When I get there

229
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,800
should I just ask my boss how to do so and what to do? I don't want to look like I need constant

230
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:33,760
help. Additional details. I don't want to seem needy. Man fucking Little Caesars apparently has

231
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,240
like a drunk dad at the public pool method of teaching their employees. The one kind of pizza

232
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,680
you have to learn is the five dollar hot and ready pepperoni oven that no one else is coming

233
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,920
and going. You know what I want? That really complicated expensive pizza. Everybody rolls up

234
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:57,600
two o'clock in the morning gets himself 18 hot and ready and sits in their car. Nobody's coming

235
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,320
into Little Caesars to ask for the chickpea and chevrola pizza. It's not happening. Can I get the

236
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:13,440
goat cheese and spinach artisanal pizza? Is your shiitake local? Local grown? We got boomperonis.

237
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:21,120
Can I have your corn-fed shiitake? Is your crust organic? I have a problem with I mean it might

238
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,760
seem that Little Caesars is being irresponsible but I have a question for this gentleman.

239
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:33,040
Why did you apply for a job as a pizza maker if you do not know how to make pizzas? That seems

240
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,520
like a very of a large ethical piece. Justin let me throw you a different question. Where

241
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,040
other than Little Caesars do you think is the base entry level position as a pizza maker?

242
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,040
What do you think you're saying? I need to go to pizza school first before I can. You're also

243
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,280
assuming that like they show up to Little Caesars on the first day like so how'd you get into Little

244
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,960
Caesars? Like I've been making my own pizzas at home for such a long time and just I found the

245
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,800
prospects so rewarding I thought hey I could probably make a career out of this no. I'm going

246
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:12,080
pro. I also found out this week by talking to uh the the young man playing Superman in the musical

247
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm directing he works at Little Caesars actually and he was telling me that his his role in the

248
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,080
process is he takes the pizza out of the oven and he cuts the pizza and he tries not to burn himself

249
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,720
and sometimes he does not do the last one so well and he does burn himself on occasion but

250
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,280
maybe because the Little Caesars process is so specialized no one needs to holistically know how

251
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,080
to make a pizza. You mean you just need to know how your your part in the assembly process. They

252
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,120
by specialized you mean they have mastered the craft of shoving a pizza inside of a cannon

253
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,880
and then firing it through a superheated oven directly into your mouth. Right.

254
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,520
Right. No. Yes. This carnival ride costs you five dollars. I believe it was Henry Ford who said the

255
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,040
beauty of the assembly line is that no one needs to know shit about making pizza and we only have

256
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,920
to charge five dollars. Five goddamn dollars for it instantly. Instantly. It's hot and ready. It's

257
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,920
not hot and not ready. It's not cold and ready. It's hot and ready. Uh I have to actually disagree

258
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,520
with the hot part. I don't think I've eaten a hot Little Caesars pizza in a while. I think at my

259
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,600
local Little Caesars pizza I think that they have some sort of robot that makes 500 pizzas at 9 am

260
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,920
as soon as they open and then they just like they just shuffle up and deal. There was a uh a limited

261
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,160
time you could get they had a pretzel crust pizza at Little Caesars in the hot and ready and I

262
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:50,000
actually showed up for one so early that they had not prepared them yet. They were not ready

263
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,000
for me because it was like 11 in the morning and I was buying an entire pizza. Hey how's your day?

264
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,400
How's your day? It's going pretty bad uh if I remember correctly so I thought I'd cheer myself

265
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,480
up but you know what if you're cheering yourself up at 11 with pizza all you're really doing is

266
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,280
buying yourself a bad rest of your day. If you do that you have to roll up in scrubs covered in

267
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,080
blood and say like I had the worst night shift of my life and all I need is pizza. I just want one

268
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,120
zombie. You know when you're holding the child in your hands and it breathes its last breath you

269
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,120
think well that hot and ready later it's gonna make it back. No but I'm glad that you hadn't

270
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,920
started making the pizzas. Man I'm gonna need to have eaten an entire pizza in 11 minutes.

271
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,600
But no how was your important pizza making job that you couldn't get started yet?

272
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,640
Uh if we're gonna continue to buy hot and readies every day we're gonna need some money.

273
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,720
And not much not a lot of money. Not a lot of money. One of these spots and we'll be good to

274
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,000
coast on for like two months.

275
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,920
I want to tell you guys about a book. You go to amazon.com here's how you get the book. You type

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,440
Cerebrally rewarding. The book is 50 ways to say you're awesome. It's a collection of love notes

286
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,640
and thank you notes for the modern era which they think they're being cute by putting that in their

287
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,600
ad text but uh you'll be speaking from my lawyer you'll hear from him. You'll be seeing from his

288
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,840
mouth because you're a ventriloquist. You'll be feeling from my lawyer. You'll be sad because of

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:31,200
my lawyer's stuff to you. Call PJ Johnson and Johnson we'll make him sad for you with the stuff

290
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:39,840
we do. We're good time lawyers yes sir. We are great great lawyers with law degrees and everything

291
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,480
we're gonna do stuff you're gonna have money they won't and they'll be so sad about it. Top notch

292
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:56,400
lawyering okay. Get ready for a feeling coming from law legal. All the legal feelings legal to

293
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:03,600
feel. Book it. Book them Dano now we're suing ourselves. Feel that? That's irony.

294
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:14,320
Irony that pays you. Car accident, puddle accident, slip and fall accident, bathroom accident,

295
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:21,920
hot pocket burns, burns on your mouth from a hot pocket. We'll do it. We got this I think.

296
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:35,120
Torts, torts and gavels. Let's make fun of tabloids not the celebrities although the fake ones

297
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,120
probably deserve it but let's make fun of gossip magazines the business itself. Us Weekly Digest

298
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,320
is a short funny video every week where one man tries to make sense of why these rags do what they

299
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,720
do. It sounds insane and it's on YouTube which is a video streaming hosting. I'm sorry which one's

300
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,240
YouTube Justin? It's a video streamer hoster. It's not US Weekly Digest it's Us Weekly Digest

301
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,680
but I think either one's gonna get the job done just type US and then Weekly Digest into YouTube

302
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,000
next to the magnifying glass and you're gonna see these uh videos and you're gonna laugh at them.

303
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
Hey what do you guys think about this? YouPube.

304
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:24,080
I don't even I don't even hear the rest. Travis liked it. Dear Shark Tank, here's the idea.

305
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,640
YouPube. Get Foxworthy's in. You're asking for four hundred thousand dollars for a two percent

306
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,280
stake in YouPube. That means you evaluate your company. Let me do the math. Twenty billion

307
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:44,240
dollars. Yep. Uh excuse me everyone. I have an announcement to make. YouPube redirects to DirecTV.

308
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,360
That's my official announcement. Breaking news. YouPube.com

309
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,640
redirects to DirecTV. You know guys I am looking at my keyboard the p and t keys are wicked far

310
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,520
away from each other. This has to be they have made a concerted effort to stake their claim.

311
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,000
If I can draw your attention to the pie chart as you can see 63 percent of our business comes from

312
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,880
people being redirected from YouPube and going hey that is a good deal. Uh do you guys know about

313
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,600
Wise Guys? I do but I want you to tell me about it. They're they uh they're they're game dudes.

314
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:31,440
They're Miles and Greg. They design challenges for Survivor on CBS. But I've always wondered

315
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,840
who makes those fucking games. Those these guys are doing it and they're uh right now

316
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,440
I've actually met them. They they had a game at E3 once that I I played. It was the one Griffin

317
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
do you remember the one where everybody wore trench coats and they had napkins in their pocket

318
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,080
and they stole the stuff? No. It was great and it was a real game but they made up but they make

319
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,240
games they have games for Survivor. They've showcased games 83 and they're kick starting a

320
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,680
game for downtown Los Angeles that will be hidden in plain sight for anyone to find and play for

321
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:09,120
free. It's uh so dope. It's a noir and players sleuth out clues concerning a stolen artifact

322
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,480
and a missing detective. You interact with characters and artifacts some real and some

323
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:20,400
virtual while visiting actual locations uh around LA. Um that sounds amazing. It also sounds like

324
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,320
I want that. It sounds like I could get real thorny real quick. Wiseguisevents.com go there

325

Nope. No you have hepatitis. It's clue it's Clumidia. Doctor.

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,840
Now that if you go right now to the website uh you're not going to find a Kickstarter link.

331
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,440

364
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,280
first line of defense actually that's the plot of wall-e they stopped eating the the hot and

365
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,960
readies and they ran out of room also wall-e is wall-e is a totally tubular dinosaur this is the

366
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,000
version of wall-e that was made in the 80s it was a dinosaur that transformed into a sports car when

367
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
he ate too much pizza everybody had to fly off in space so they got fat enough to consume the rest

368
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
of the pizzas that were left and then they could come back because they would have room in their

369
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,200
tum-tums to store all the hot and ready switched by this point we're cold and oldies the original

370
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,160

378
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,880
how we knew andy dick we've had a monogamous relationship for five years i barely cheated on her

of course at maximum fun dot org hey brothers i live in kentucky and when i talk to people outside

382
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,320
the state and mention where i'm from they often assume i live with a bunch of rednecks or that i

383
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,520
eat kfc all the time at first i played along with their jokes and took it in stride but after a while

384
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,040
these false assumptions started to bother me and i started feeling that i should take pride in my

385
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,440
state and try to dispel their negative stereotypes should i just let it go when it comes up in

386
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,480
conversation or should i tell them that kentucky is more than just kfc bourbon hicks and horses

387
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,480
and that's from one cantankerous kentuckian why don't you tell those people fuck off yeah that's

388
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,160
not talking to people from outside your state no it's on the fuck off like what if they are what

389
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,640

double chicago chicago squared like unless you live in like one of those places or orlando every

413
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,800
other city in america is the same city well orlando gets a pass because they have uh more

414
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,320
uh amusement parks per capita yeah uh than the rest of the country put together that's different

415
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,520
you know when people ask me how austin is i usually respond like you can get fried avocado

416
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,480
tacos like pretty much anywhere that is literally like the defining characteristic of this of this

417
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,400
city and state for me that i think people are like how's cincinnati i'm like well it's right

418
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,000
on a river so we have a thriving trade he just basically recites the wikipedia page our main

419
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,240
exports and imports are i almost hit a dude in with my shopping cart yesterday at walmart

420
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,200
i was buying ingredients to bake a tart to tan today that's going to happen too

421
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,920
but everybody can come over and have some if they want uh got some more that's my favorite that's

422
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:51,840
my favorite musketeer uh uh but i almost hit this dude with my cart and he smiled and said sorry

423
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,480
because that's west virginia people here are great and you wouldn't know anything about it

424
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,400
if you weren't here yes it's impoverished like a lot of areas here's here's a surprise for you uh

425
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,040
most places that have these kinds of reputations aren't impoverished because they love they love

426
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:15,120
going out back and not having anything there they don't love going to bed hungry because it's like

427
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:22,320
their fucking identity they're poor because you corporations bought everything stole our

428
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:29,600
resources so yes i i mean i understand that why why these stereotypes about reasons are handy

429
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,760
because your brain can't hold all the truth so the brain has to hold convenient lies like when i

430
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,320
think about orlando that i i mean it literally might as well be a road straight to that big

431
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,920
globe in epcot there's a name for that you know that weird dome anyway spaceship earth

432
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,720
spaceship earth what's up so you can i mean i watch a lot of behind the scenes uh documentaries

433
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,600
from uh from disney world so that's my life i watched a lot of battlefield earth so that's sort

434
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,080
of like what i'm into yeah like if you don't travel a lot you just fucking make up these

435
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:12,880
assumptions you just assume you assume the the funniest about a state and yeah i don't know it's

436
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,200
no one's gonna say like i bet you have like a middle in commerce and i bet you rely heavily

437
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,880
on tourism but most of your money is actually made by coal am i right like yeah that is actually

438
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,040
pretty close you nailed it got it i bet you have average rainfall and a pretty uh common uh lowest

439
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:40,320
point of the state i bet your pollen count from your deciduous forest i didn't know i didn't know

440
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:47,920
any smart things to say i just said smart sounding words and then kind of i bet you

441
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,560
i bet your tributaries to uh your biggest the water table

442
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,080
i bet your geology is

443
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,560
slate and shale do you guys want to yeah sure this yahoo was sent in by julie ken thank you

444
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:14,640
julie it's by yahoo answers user woe is me who asks things you would like to tell non-horse people

445
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:22,080
and then there's an enumerated list uh i'm ready some of them are just like gibberish

446
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,880
uh just because he's a paint doesn't mean his name is patch i think maybe she meant pinto

447
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,960
no paint is that a type of horse yes it is it's those uh horses that have look like they have

448
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,920
splotches oh okay um no he's not being silly he's pissed off because you're acting like a retard

449
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,800
all right great wow wow cool i'm glad you're focused on horse sensitivity right now we'll

450
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,000
we'll circle back around to human sensitivity uh not his pony won't grow to be a horse didn't mean

451
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,480
anything uh i stepped in horse poop and i don't care it's gonna smell like horse it's a barn

452
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,440
i guess this is if you're in a barn with these people go complain somewhere else and then in

453
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,080
parentheses animal activists at local fairs what do you want to tell these really specific problem

454
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,640
what do you want to tell these people who don't know about horses you're a horse person listen

455
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,680
we're all horse people here this is a saviour horse zone uh what do you say to non-horse people

456
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,440
people who are cool about horses don't offer him that he quit smoking three years ago okay

457
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,040
it seems like a pretty specific scenario i mean i'm just taking people off from my horse smokes yeah

458
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,920
um there's a lot of answers on this which is why i think oh of course there are

459
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,040
um people love to talk there's one thing that people horse people love more than anything

460
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:51,120
more than uh breaking the spirit of a beautiful animal so they can ride it around town like

461
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,960
the mayor of fancy land but they the other thing they love is judging people who don't have horse

462
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,120
fever as as though as though the uh the thing keeping me from horse isn't the economic barrier

463
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:10,640
it's just my distaste for for quadrupedal beings um when yahoo answers users said very

464
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,560
interesting question with a lot of good answers fun reading had a good time

465
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,720
i like people that aren't there to provide an answer they just want to

466
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,880
uh comment on how things are going i like the work you're doing asking the tough questions um

467
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,480
here's some more answers yes my horses just eat hay that is what keeps them warm in the winter not

468
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,800
grain so like i guess in this situation quit asking hey i bet your horse keeps warm from grain

469
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,600
like no dog don't talk don't run your fucking mouth in here man you have no fucking idea what

470
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:53,360
you're talking about take your grain agenda right out the door no which is over there and it opens

471
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,800
in the middle because we gotta get horses through uh no my particular horses don't need shoes if

472
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,280
that changes i'll look into it should put some shoes on that hey why don't you fuck right off

473
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,080
you're not his horse parent i just i just listened to the stuff you should know horseshoes episode

474
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,040
how horseshoes work and i'm almost positive that if you do not put shoes on your horse

475
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,440
their feet hurt real bad travis that's where those attitudes come from now you're gonna get

476
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,920
hate mail you don't know who what this person's fucking situation is and you're talking shit no

477
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,600
i don't blanket my horses in the winter they grow a thick fur coat and do just fine god damn it dad

478
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,080
you gotta trust me you gotta show a little faith we're never gonna make it through this if you

479
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,200
don't trust me this is what's wrong with america we don't teach people at little caesar's how to

480
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,800
make pizza but we expect people who don't own horses to understand the intricacies of maintaining

481
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,280
them this person these all these answers have come from the same person and the wheels kind

482
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,160
of fall off the wagon here yes i have three horses on four acres they have lots to eat

483
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,280
and their pastures will manage so don't tell me the law says they need x number of acres per

484
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,720
hour i think that might actually be like a law legal law i think that might i think we might

485
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:20,160
need to call our law experts to do some stuff have your horses got a tummy hunger grass on down

486
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,360
you got horses we've got answers we'll sell you our grass no i'm not a horse expert that is why

487
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,160
i have a vet and a farrier i trust and ask lots of questions not knowing every single thing there

488
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,200
is to know in the world of horses does not make me a moron or disqualify me from owning one this

489
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,080
now sounds like a person who is a horse person that is defending themselves from other horse

490
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:47,840
people who are better horses yeah eight of my horses died under mysterious circumstances also

491
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:52,400
if you're trusting fairies for horse advice you you should probably hang it up right there

492
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,320
no a farrier a person who drives fairies wait a minute why is the person who drives fairies

493
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,320
knowledgeable about horses because they use the ferry to get the horse across the river

494
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:09,040
oh no read a goddamn book justin i'm not doing this again get no he's gonna have to take the

495
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,680
bridge like everybody else i'm not putting another horse on my ferry why does that tell

496
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,480
you some things about horses why does that horse look so sad he looks like he was beaten um maybe

497
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:26,240
because he has a long face literally hey hey whoa okay so that's just you're just telling

498
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,960
a really bad horse joke at this point he he ran into a horse door so what if he walks into a bar

499
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,400
and then why are you so tired all you did was horse riding yeah you wish that's all i was doing

500
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:50,160
i had a busy day before i got on the horse i went to the bank i paid some bills i bought a saddle

501
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,920
men cleaned it women won't laugh along with you when you crack horse penis jokes so don't even

502
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,480
go there with us okay now it's getting this is starting to veer heavily away from like horses

503
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,920
don't talk about dicks just because i'm around a bunch of republican conservative yahoos doesn't

504
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:16,640
make me one a jewish liberal equestrian it cannot be whoa man what hold on this is narrow casting

505
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,160
i think right now we're we're getting uh we're intercepting a message intended for one person

506
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:29,120
um i sometimes worry that as much as i love horses i might hate horse people you know

507
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,880
i hate half horse half people too well no wait no i'm saying like centaurs they can keep it to

508
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,600
themselves i'm done with it centaurs always prancing around uh just because i'm a centaur

509
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:48,640
doesn't mean i can't poop in the potty like a big boy just because my centaur kids only have three

510
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,840
acres i know what i'm doing thanks they don't have shoes they don't that's because i'm poor

511
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,680
yes i'm half horse but i also eat things other than hay and grains i mean i will eat hay and

512
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,400
grains because they're delicious but i could have a steak if i wanted uh yes my body does have two
