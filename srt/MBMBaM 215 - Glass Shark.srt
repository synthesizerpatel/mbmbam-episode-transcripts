1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:40,720
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,800
Well, howdy, everybody. Welcome to my brother, my brother, and me. It's an advice show for the

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,280
modern era. We're just pleased as punch to have you here. I am Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm Griffin McElroy. I think I know what's going on. It is so great to have you guys on the show,

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,880
just to be doing this podcast with you. Oh, I'm feeling, feeling pretty fine. Oh, God. Oh, God.

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,440
Justin's biting me. I'm just doing just dandy too. I'm finer than frogs hair split four ways.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,880
Sand it down too, I should hope. Sand them right down. I just flew in from downstairs,

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,400
and boy am I, well, you know how that old chestnut goes. Oh, I see. You've caught the dad real hard.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,760
I'm just a father. I come at comedy from my own unique perspective, colored by my life with my

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,720
wife and my beautiful baby daughter. I'm just a where dad, because Justin passed his

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,160
foul darkness into me, vis-a-vis fluid transaction. Boys, what's on the docket today? I hope we can

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,680
try to keep it clean. We're going to probably talk about dicks. Dicks and balls. Well, that seems like

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
old version of my brother, my brother and me. I'm not sure. Do you want to play catch?

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
That would be better. I think we could probably split the difference. With dicks and balls.

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,080
No, we could probably land somewhere in the billing vol territory. Okay. Yeah. He gets a

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
little colorful from time to time, but at the end of the day, you know, you're going to get off this

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,760
roller coaster and you're going to have all your limbs attached. You know what I mean? My brother,

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,080
my brother and me is just about three guys shooting the shoot and talking about what

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
grinds their gears. You're going to laugh a little, you're going to learn a little,

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,520
and you're going to learn a lot. My brother, my brother and me gives its own unique approach to

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,520
comedy. It's from a Christian family perspective, but a little bit skewed. Thanks for buying our

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,960
audio cassette at the Christian family bookstore. Or your local Zondervans.

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,880
You can also listen to our totally clean hockey comedy podcast,

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,800
HE Double Hockey Sticks. Thank you for listening to both programs.

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
Justin, you back? I am back. All right, let's do the show.

30
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,360
Sorry, the little one had to, uh, had a poopsie. You know how that is,

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,440
is late night food. Can you watch your fucking language? Okay, straight up, I haven't, I haven't

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:30,000
slept. Do you think that is going to be a lot of, you think that that is just a goofy thing people

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,600
say? And I got irritated because it was the thing that everybody was saying. Everyone,

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,040
ah, catch up on your sleep. I hope you, you cannot, you cannot put enough hours in the bank.

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,760
First off, sleep doesn't work like that. Anyway, you cannot put enough hours in the bank for a

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,640
human that knows nothing about time or, or darkness or anything and how that will infringe on your

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,000
life. Yeah. From one of those things, like you think like this is surely as tired as I could

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,040
possibly get. And then you proceed to get more tired. And then no matter how tired you get,

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,200
there's nothing, there's nothing you can do. It's not like, no, I'm so sleepy. So I'm going to sleep

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:18,480
now. Baby, I heard that over there, but I'm sleeping now and I will catch you in a few.

41
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,440
The best, the, probably the, the thing that makes me happiest so far is that the baby has really

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,920
good timing. It has good comedic timing. By which I mean, I'll get up fucking stumbling around,

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
stumble over the changing table, change your wiper little tushy,

44
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,800
feed her. Mom will feed her and then we'll sit, we'll get her all fed. Then we'll put her in her,

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,920
she has a baby straight jacket. She sleeps in and we'll get her that. We'll lull her to sleep

46
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,680
and I'll gingerly lay her down bomb squad style. Just not want to trip any wires. It's going to

47
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,240
wake her back up. I'll sneak back over to my side of the bed. I'll get in my, my snugly,

48
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,680
snugly pre-kid position for how I would sleep when I still slept. And then I'll just hear from across

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:11,440
the room. A huge, massive, massive screaming dump. And you know what the best part about the dump is?

50
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
The best part about the dump is the baby will dump and then not cry, but fucking stare at me like,

51
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,920
what's up? What's up now old man? Are you going to leave me here with my little week old tushy?

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,480
My three week old tushy? Are you, are you man enough to just sleep there while my little baby

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,000
tushy sits in poopy? Are you man enough or are you going to come over here and pick me up?

54
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,560
The most horrifying thing I think that you've told me about this situation and it's a, it's an

55
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,000
enormous list. Um, and I'm sorry, by the way, that I just referred to the beautiful human life you

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,120
created as a situation. But let's, uh, move on. Um, the horrifying thing you told me is that

57
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:02,160
that baby's poop, when that zone gets stimulated, and one way to stimulate that zone is to clean

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,320
the poop off of it. Yeah. Babies are hilarious. That's a real, like, um, yeah, that's, that's a,

59
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,160
you're playing with fire. Anytime you clean a baby's butt, you're playing fire. The baby's

60
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,600
gonna be like, oh man, I forgot I had a butt. Thank you. Thank you. What was the thing that I

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,360
did with- Thank you, poorly gentleman. What was the thing I did with my butt? Oh, that's right.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,920
That's it. Should we do- Do you mind if I put this in your hand? Should we do advice now? That's a

63
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,560
good place for it. Yeah. I love that we joked about doing the thing and then we did the thing.

64
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,400
Well, I mean, yeah. I mean, that's the fucking McElroy way. It's a slice of life. That's what

65
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,640
we do here on My Brother and My Brother. Tragedy, tragedy plus, tragedy plus this podcast equals

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,520
comedy. Yes. Cause that's, that's my life right now. Nah, she's great. It's fine. I actually would

67
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,360
say in this circumstance, poop in your hand, plus me not being you equals very, very funny.

68
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Fair enough. All right. Let's, uh, we still help people on the show. Sometimes. Sometimes we play

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,720
fucking Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah. Uh, sometimes we do Griffin. Um, but, uh, right now we're helping

70
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,160
people. So let's do this. Thank you by the way, for, for continuing to put the show together in

71
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
my absence, Griffin and Travis. I really appreciate it. You're welcome. Just don't do this again.

72
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,160
Yeah. I won't. Not for, uh, for nine months at least. My girlfriend and I recently went to a

73
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,440
movie. Okay. Wanting good seats, we went to a row in the middle of the auditorium and selected seats

74
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,320
in the middle of the row. As soon as we sat down, a girl in the seats behind us very loudly said,

75
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,040
seriously? I glanced back a minute later and saw that she had moved a few seats to her left

76
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,840
so that she wasn't directly behind us. Are we good? Or did we commit a film viewer faux pas by

77
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,000
sitting in front of her? To our credit, it was stadium seating and neither one of us are very

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,760
tall. That's from naive in North Dakota. Interesting. Um, yeah, because are we talking

79
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,200
about sight lines or sight lines? The issue, or is this the issue that you went to what sounds

80
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,600
like a relatively empty movie theater and decided to sit, um, you didn't leave a buffers, uh, uh,

81
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,480
because proximity is an issue. Proximity is an issue there, but I would say, here's the thing.

82
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,680
That's her issue and not yours. I think, I know you walk into a movie theater. If someone sits

83
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,960
too close to you and you want to move the onus is on you at that point. I don't think I don't know

84
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,200
about that. If it's otherwise empty and someone sits directly in front of me, that's going to

85
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,520
feel intentional to me. No, I'm going to tell you it's intentional if it's directly beside.

86
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,440
No, I know in front works too. And, and, but here's the thing I, in a trillion years, in a,

87
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,040
in a bajillion years, I could be at the midnight opening of the last Harry Potter movie, which I

88
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,000
don't know if you guys knew this is my most anticipated and also greatest film of all time.

89
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,920
And for some miraculous reason, the theater was empty except for myself. And then somebody walked

90
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,920
in and sat in front of me. I wouldn't fucking say anything. I wouldn't cause you're trying to

91
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,600
get whisked. Yeah. And like saying that is going to impact both my experience, their experience,

92
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
the experience of everybody who has to be a part of the fact that I just made it super uncomfortable.

93
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Is it possible that she was not referring to you sitting down, but some other factor that

94
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,080
had just become impaired? Like she just realized did you, did you let out, did you let out a huge

95
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,880
maybe she just sat down and found that the chair she was sitting in was full of farts.

96
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,800
The foam had absorbed the fart of a two hour previous movie. Okay. So maybe you sat down and

97
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,480
almost at that exact same instant, she put her hand on her armrest. Oh my God. There's jelly

98
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:54,400
all over it. Seriously? Justin's been here. Who ordered that pricey movie theater jelly only to

99
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,240
leave it on the armrest. The trick is you bring your own in a little Ziploc bag. Travis. That's

100
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,520
how you get past it. They charge like six 50 for some jelly. People like you, they're ruining the

101
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,160
jelly industry. They're just had to say, you know, you go to the Alamo draft house, they bring you

102
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,360
craft brew jelly during the movie. You don't have to get up and cause like you you'll finish

103
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,160
jelly and like, I fuck, I can crush one of those tubs in like 20 minutes maybe. And then what am I

104
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,560
going to do? Get up and do that maybe six times, seven times, depending on the length of the film.

105
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,320
If I, if it was during fucking boyhood, we're talking about like 12 jam jars. I, I have to

106
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,600
admit, I don't think it was a huge faux pas, but I do think that it is, it feels a little bit

107
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,760
inconsiderate to sit directly in front of somebody when, when you have a lot of other. But I do,

108
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
I do understand though, like if they picked middle seats and you picked middle seats,

109
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,960
but maybe leave a row if possible, everybody wants to sit in the middle, especially in a

110
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,720
big stadium seating, like IMAX kind of thing, but maybe leave a row, a row between you if possible.

111
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,280
But that's okay. But that's not how space works. Like obviously the ideal like position is like

112
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
row four or five in the direct center, right? And then the next best one is like the row behind that

113
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
or in front of that in the same exact position. But then it's a, there's diminishing returns.

114
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,880
You get too close. What am I fucking even seeing? Is that, is that, you know, Bradley Cooper's nose?

115
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,800
No, it's a house. It's a raccoon. It's a raccoon. God damn this movie's transportative.

116
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,440
Did you guys, did you guys remember, did you ever like when you were, you know, a teenager

117
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
going on some dates, did you ever encounter a thing where like you'd sit and be by yourself

118
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,880
and then either like it was always older people or like, you know, like wanting to sit close to

119
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,680
you, like, I know what you guys are going to get up to, not on my watch.

120
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,600
And I want to, or, or explicitly on my watch, only on my watch.

121
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,960
I always got it. Like they were just trying to like ruin whatever, you know, necking I was

122
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,280
planning for that evening. But maybe they were just going like, no, go, go on.

123
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,120
Wait, you're telling me that, uh, old people tried to ruin something for me, Travis?

124
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,640
I don't know. That doesn't sound like their MO.

125
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,880
I think your mistake was being that the same movie that an old person would want to go see.

126
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,640
Well, that's the thing is if you're like 15 or 16, that is your, like, you're going to see

127
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,760
the toy story too. And guess what? So are super old people because they know there's not going

128
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,720
to be any violence or boobs in it. I have a, a theater etiquette question for

129
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
you guys. And I want to know if I'm making too big a deal out of this. I, uh, the, my,

130
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,840
my like theater pet peeve that, I mean, obviously the, the obvious stuff, you know, talking during

131
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,560
Godzilla and, and things like that, that drives me crazy. But, uh, people who continue their

132
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,160
conversations once the trailers have begun, is that not, is that a DMZ or is that like,

133
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,360
is that still a safe zone for chatting? Because some of us like trailers more than movies.

134
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,360
A lot of times they're like short movies because I don't, I, I don't know if you guys know,

135
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm a dad now. I don't get to the theater a lot. So a lot of times trailers are going to be the

136
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,560
closest I'm going to get to seeing that movie. So basically you're in, you're ruining the movie for

137
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,280
me. Here's, I actually have a rule of thumb about this. If the movie theater lowers the lights to

138
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,720
the same level that it's at for the movies, you lower your volume to the same level you would for

139
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,280
a movie. If they take the lights to half, you can continue your conversation at half volume.

140
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,720
Are you saying that in case of technical error that brings the house lights to full mid film,

141
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
you will just start shouting. Have you ever been in a movie theater and they brought the

142
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,000
lights up to full? Has everyone just stayed quiet? No, everyone goes, Hey, whoa. Travis actually

143
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,360
follows that. I don't know if you noticed this, Justin, but Travis follows that rule

144
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,680
with just his everyday sort of life. So like during the intimate times, maybe in the bedroom,

145
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,960
he's like, Oh, what do you, I can't understand what you're saying to me. Are you trying to be

146
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,400
intimate? Turn the lights up. My pee pee is ready. Well, turning down a little bit,

147
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,320
maybe in the middle, Travis is basically photo sensitive at a baseball game at night with all

148
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,120
the lights like blasting those fucking Friday night lights. Forget about it. Forget about it.

149
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,680
He is the loudest thing in the universe. You guys want Yahoo? Absolutely. Yahoo was, um,

150
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,960
so who was sent in by a man named Drew Davenport, a legend one might say. Thank you, Drew.

151
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:31,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Pineapple Lifesaver, who asks, why do so many people buy Lunchables?

152
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,560
You could put your own together for a lot cheaper. Just put some meat, cheese and crackers in a

153
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Gladware container. Well, fucking thanks, Einstein. It's an update. It's not cheaper though for the

154
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,440
tiny handful of food that you get even at $1. They're using the cheapest quality of ingredients,

155
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,960
buying some cheap turkey, American singles and Ritz saltines will give you the same amount of

156
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,200
10 or more Lunchables for half the cost. Holy shit. That can't possibly be right.

157
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,160
All right. First off, last for me. They're saying 10 or more Lunchables for half the

158
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,920
cost. We're talking about 20 fucking homemade Lunchables per Lunchable proper.

159
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,400
That's a lot of margin. Has anyone ever bought a Lunchable thinking, I am, I'm a thrifty consumer.

160
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,200
This is, yeah, you're not, you are neither a thrifty, you're not fiscally smart. You are

161
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,520
not making a good nutritional decision. You are basically just saying, I, I'm a piece of shit.

162
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,720
Well, I just want to do things. Either you're saying like, I'm a piece of shit, or you're

163
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,280
saying like, you know what? I'm going to little kid treat myself. Hey, eight year old Travis,

164
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,080
who only wanted Lunchables all the time, but his mom packed him like actual sandwiches and apples

165
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,840
and stuff because she cared for him. But at the time he would look around the other kids who ate

166
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,160
Lunchables and think, what fun lives are they leaving? If only I was more of a Lunchables type

167
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,280
kid, but I wasn't. So maybe 25 year old Travis buys eight year old Travis a Lunchable and sends

168
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:08,080
it back to him through his tummy. We've got to go back. Can an adult not just enjoy a motherfucking

169
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,280
Lunchable though, without those auspices? You guys are throwing a lot of shade at Lunchables right

170
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,680
now. I knew we, I knew we love horses on this podcast, but I did not know we love high horses

171
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,280
quite so much. But are Lunchables not the same? Like I put them in the same category as, uh,

172
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,440
the Hot Pocket. The Toaster Strudel. Yeah, that's a fucked up Venn diagram you just weaved. A Hot

173
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,040
Pocket's a lot of work. You gotta push the buttons and, and a lot of fiddling. A Lunchable,

174
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,480
you have to construct your own. They don't just hand you a package. That's customizable. Kids

175
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,000
love that. Let's um, we're getting away from the fucking heart of the matter. Um, and I want to

176
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,480
get us back to it. And now, okay, if you want to fucking time travel, I'm eight years old. I roll

177
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,960
up to school. I bust out a Gladware. DIY. It's a, it's a Lunchable. You've written Lunchable on it,

178
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,880
but you spelled it differently to avoid copyright. Griffin, what the fuck is that? It's, it's a,

179
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,520
it's a Munchable. It's a what? A Munchable? Dad, my dad made it for me and he said it's just as

180
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,320
good. And what are you? I'm literally gonna cry. I'm literally gonna. What are you all eating?

181
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:20,800
Uh, we're eating Lunchables that, uh, their brand name Lunchables that our rich parents got us at

182
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,080
the store. What was yours called? Munchables. What's in it? Um, looks like some, looks like

183
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,840
I got some oyster crackers and a nice note. What seems to be a hair. It looks like a hair. I'm,

184
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,360
this is one of my, this is one of my new dad Jerry's hairs. The container smells like salami

185
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,560
because it used to have salami in it. That's how we got it. We can't afford to buy Gladware either.

186
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:50,320
We're just reusing the old containers. Have you guys ever noticed with Gladware when you store

187
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,200
like a, maybe like a tomato sauce or a base product in it for an extended period of time

188
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,560
and then you wash it and it's still that color? Yeah. What is happening there? What is the

189
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,960
porousness of the material? I think it is photosynthesis. Is that, is that osmosing

190
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,240
through the, through the plastic? Can you, is this a, can I rock Munchables in the modern workplace?

191
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,600
If I roll up and I have a fucking Gladware container and I've written Munchables on there

192
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,880
in a Sharpie and maybe some of the letters are backwards, uh, just to like really drive it home

193
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
and, uh, I'm just like, Jerry from accounting walks in and he's like, what are you eating there?

194
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,280
I say, oh, Munchables. Uh, and that. Wait, hold on. That voice worked for the eight-year-old.

195
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,760
Yeah. I prepare a fucking snack cracker tower and I eat it from the top down like a T-Rex. Uh,

196
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,360
am I okay? Am I good? I think, I think, I think if you, if I got to watch you do that,

197
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,840
just make a huge stack of crackers and cheese and meat and then just deep throw it. Just put your

198
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,000
head at the top and just keep jamming until it's all gone. Munchables. These, what, these are

199
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,320
Munchables. Yeah, I'll make you some. I'll bring some in tomorrow. The weird thing is it's like a,

200
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,200
the sadness is greater than the sum of its parts because if you just brought in like a container

201
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,360
with crackers, a separate container with cheese slices, a separate container. But that's not weird

202
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,120
to me, but you put it all in the same container and transport it that way and it's like a hundred

203
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,960
percent sadder. Of course, context is important in this situation. If I eat crackers and then

204
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,560
in another room I eat some lunch meat, it's not going to be a thing. But if I try to give it my

205
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,400
own DIY fucking Pinterest branding, then we have a situation, all right? I, this is an interesting

206
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,560
question for you about Lunchables. If you go to a party, let's say, where there are crackers and

207
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,240
cheese and little pieces of meat, I don't think there's a number of those things that you would

208
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,720
eat at which point you would say, well, I've had lunch now. Me? Did you have lunch? Yes, I did.

209
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:02,000
You guys are limiting your scope to the fucking snack cracker Lunchable box set. There was a lot

210
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,480
more variety in there for our dirty North American bento boxes, essentially is what we're talking

211
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,640
about. I don't know if you guys ever sampled the pizza, which was pizza but cold. I have very clear

212
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,880
memories of watching an adjacent rich kid eat the pizza Lunchable and being physically repulsed at

213
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,200
the idea of eating cold, all of it cold. And they would call it pizza and it turned my stomach even

214
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,240
more. Let me take you down the Oubliette to even further just peer into the darkness with me and

215
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:49,280
we'll talk about the definition of the word soft taco because Lunchables also had that gain. It

216
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,680
wasn't especially on point because you had a round thing. It was the pizza crust. It was the fucking

217
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:03,120
pizza crust. And then they had a cold, essentially giant ketchup packet, but instead of ketchup,

218
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:13,920
it was ground meat question mark. I don't know how you would meet was a meat was in quotation

219
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,080
marks. It was also an acronym. It was as bad news bears. I don't know how you would recreate that

220
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,360
for the Munchables brand, but I think that there is a lot of opportunity in there. We could probably

221
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,480
get some vegan free option, vegan free, gluten free, no vegan. I think all Lunchables are inherently

222
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,560
vegan free. Anyway, this person has a great point. I'm going to take this to Shark Tank. Thank you,

223
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,680
Yahoo. A few years ago, I took the plunge and moved to Reykjavik, Iceland. It's a beautiful

224
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,040
country and its popularity as a vacation destination has been growing over the past few

225
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,760
years. There are frequently cruise ships docked here, which discharged a few hundred tourists

226
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,160
every few days. Man, I hope this question is about a grift. I haven't finished it yet, but

227
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,680
when I walk through the city, I encounter lots of said tourists taking photos.

228
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,600
My question is, what's the acceptable social norm when you encounter someone taking a photo

229
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,880
and you're passively through their field of vision? Should I wait for the person to take the photo,

230
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,960
continue on my way, regardless of whether or not it would ruin the shot? Any advice you could

231
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,240
offer me? Much appreciated. That's from In Frame in Iceland. That's beautiful. I'd love to get up

232
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,480
there sometime. I was just watching The Simpsons about that. The travelogue of The Simpsons.

233
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:34,800
Do they get the Aurora Boreanus up there? The David Boreanus? That was in the episode of The

234
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:44,320
Simpsons, so I'm hoping so. I say keep on keeping on. I think JKL, I think just keep living and just

235
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,280
keep walking. If they get you in the shot, then they have actually gotten some fucking local

236
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,320
wildlife in the picture. Yeah, I think you go one step further. I think you don't just

237
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,240
walk through. You get in the shot. You pose. You act like, look at this! Give it kind of a thing

238
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,640
like they asked you to be in the picture, or even better, they were like, hey, Steve, get over here.

239
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm going to take a picture of you. Then you just kind of pose and gesture towards the mountains.

240
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,480
I think it loses some of the magic if they have to ask for it. Then it's not candid. I think maybe

241
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
you carry around a giant swordfish with you, a really big swordfish that maybe has a little bit

242
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,520
of ice still on it. Whenever you see somebody taking a picture, you scurry over there as fast

243
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,680
as you can, and you hold that swordfish over your head proudly, and you make like a jovial laughing

244
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:34,240
face. It's like, look at this, I caught this local swordfisherman mid-catch. How happy is he? God,

245
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:42,160
I wish I was that happy anymore, Diane. That's how memories are made. I think it's all about

246
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,360
your angle. If you're behind the person, then you're local color. If you're in front, in the

247
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,480
foreground, you're messing up the focus. You're making yourself, I mean, you're basically turning

248
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,440
it into an album cover for you. That's such a good question. Are these people taking photos of the

249
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,760
scenery, or are they taking pictures of people? Because if it's of people, I'm way less likely

250
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,960
to keep going. But if it's just taking a picture of a beautiful building they found or a lovely

251
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,800
landscape, yeah, I'm just going to keep walking. I think the problem, though, with your guys'

252
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:24,000
two lines of logic is that you're thinking about the feelings and desires of the picture-taker,

253
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,760
and not my own feelings and desires, to become either an internet meme of like swordfish Iceland

254
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:40,800
man, or maybe a local legend vis-a-vis the mothman. Only I'd be swordfish man, and I would

255
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,080
I would carry with me portents of terrible destruction. So like you would hold the

256
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,320
swordfish, but like maybe have your back to the camera and just the last minute turn and look

257
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,280
back. Just like half a face and a swordfish. And it's like he's in every photo. He's in every photo

258
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,120
that's been taken in Reykjavik today. How did that happen? Oh, it's just like on, oh what's that show

259
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,120
with the kid from the Dawson's Creek, and then it's the fringe, it's the fringe, and there's the

260
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,960
bald man. He's in all the photos, and he's holding a swordfish. It's also Dawson's Creek. There was a

261
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,960
season where there was just a guy just, and he had a swordfish, and he was in every shot of the show.

262
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Did you guys know the observer, which Travis refers, is from Huntington, West Virginia?

263
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,080
Well, you just think that because he's fucking all over the place. He's everywhere. He's everywhere.

264
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,440
Did you watch the show? Yeah, I mean I watched the show. I'm just saying he's from Huntington.

265
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:39,120
Did you get the symbolism of the swordfish? I saw swordfish. Keep going. Keep going with it.

266
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,240
Keep going deeper. That's all. It was inoffensive, I'd say. Some of the hacking was a little harder

267
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,640
to buy, specifically the Hugh Jackman hacking. Specifically all of it. Hugh Jackman. Don't buy it.

268
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Keep going. I don't have it. What do you want me to say, Travis?

269
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Johnson-Wolter was in it. Read another question.

270
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,400
I wish Johnson-Wolter got more work. There, I said it. My wife is terrified of round fish.

271
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,560
Uh-oh. We like to be outside. See what I mean?

272
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,760
I love adventuring in the water. Okay, stop right there.

273
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,880
Pump the brakes, chief. I love adventuring in the water, but anytime we leave the shore,

274
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,360
my- Are you a pirate? Like just the beach. Okay. My wife freaks out because there might be round

275
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,400
fish near her. Apparently flat fish are fine. She agrees it's an irrational fear, but just-

276
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,960
Let me just finish this. She agrees it's an irrational fear, but just today she ran crying

277
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,000
to the shore because a four-inch trout swam by her. I'm sure that's something she wanted

278
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,640
the internet to know. Great job, sir. I don't want to give up my aquatic activities,

279
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,280
but I don't know how to help her get over her fear. N-B-N-B-A-M. What do I do? And that's from

280
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
ichthyophobicintribe. God damn, Justin.

281
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,360
Nailed it.

282
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
You just said that word fucking- Even like sleep battle.

283
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,680
Just like saying your words is not like your best thing,

284
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,680
and that's the hardest word I've ever seen, and you did 100% right.

285
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,440
Also, you said Reykjavik really good.

286
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,600
You did a great job.

287
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,000
Great job.

288
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,200
Thanks. Apparently what I've been missing all these years? A reason to live.

289
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
Yep. So-

290
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,000
Who knew?

291
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,800
Round fish. Is that-

292
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,640
Round fish? Okay, what are we talking about?

293
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,080
Is it everything but a stingray? Because bad news bears, that's the scariest fish that exists.

294
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,600
No, what's the one that's the one that stays on the floor of the ocean,

295
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,080
but it's just like it has the eye on both sides? Perch?

296
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,480
I mean like, is it like how Nemo's are flat and like fish like that,

297
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,920
like that don't have a lot of girth?

298
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,360
And then there's like the sea man, and he's got the face and he's all round.

299
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,920
No, Travis.

300
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,480
Nobody. Nobody's afraid of sea man. Everybody loves sea man.

301
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:52,960
So kind.

302
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,480
Okay, so the one thing that is weird about this is that I'm assuming if it's trout,

303
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,200
aren't trout just exclusively freshwater fish?

304
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,440
Yeah.

305
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,400
Am I incorrect here?

306
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,280
We have no way of proving that. Probably not.

307
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
There's probably one trout that swam in the ocean was like,

308
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,360
I'll kick it here. And then they had-

309
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,240
I get way more worried about like aquatic life when I'm in like a lake or a river.

310
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,880
Above the ocean? More than the ocean? Really?

311
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,920
Yeah. I just find it much more, I think in the ocean it's just, I don't know.

312
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,280
I get a much more like under the sea kind of vibe.

313
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,520
And I guess when I'm in freshwater, I get more of like a opening of true blood.

314
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay. So is it possible-

315
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,920
A big old catfish swimming around through the reefs.

316
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,560
You're assuming that the fish in the ocean are just like,

317
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,400
we live in the biggest fucking body of water.

318
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,600
There's fucking rules.

319
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,320
And fish in a lake are like, God damn those ocean.

320
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,040
Our shit is like one, one trillionth of one percent of ocean.

321
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
Cool. Glad we're here.

322
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,480
Right.

323
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
Would love to catch a plane and what's that? No fish planes.

324
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,040
Yeah. I guess that makes sense.

325
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,440
Oh, my body would die in the ocean. That sounds fair.

326
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,520
Thanks fish Jesus.

327
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,720
I'm real confused. If your wife is so afraid of fish,

328
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,920
why, why is she continually putting herself in a position

329
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,080
to be the only place where fish are?

330
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,560
Well, it sounds like she's doing that to please.

331
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,040
Well, why not canoe? Why not perhaps get a pontoon boat?

332
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,120
Because then you're just like above the thing that you're afraid of.

333
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,680
And they'll jump into the boat. You see that shit.

334
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,960
You watch videos of like surfers like surfing

335
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,280
and then like a stingray jumps through them.

336
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,680
It's like, hey, great job catching that wave.

337
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,360
You have a stingray shaped hole in you now.

338
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Can we focus? I think that, you know, a fear of fish, that's fine.

339
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,880
I have a fear of mice. People have fears.

340
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
My friend John Mahaffey is afraid of spiders so much.

341
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,160
I think he pooped his pants when he saw some.

342
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,600
Okay. People are afraid of things.

343
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
Again, this is the episode where people say things about people

344
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
that they don't want said about them on internet.

345
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,680
What I am more concerned about is this guy is apparently so...

346
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,920
We have two references to his aquatic pursuits.

347
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,320
He loves adventuring in the water

348
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,120
and he doesn't want to give up his aquatic activity.

349
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,560
What is he doing that this is such an inconvenience

350
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,760
that he would come to us over this?

351
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
Everybody gets one pretty much.

352
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,520
And this is this guy's one.

353
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,320
What is he doing in the water that is so sacred

354
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
that he can't give it up for his lady?

355
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,360
Aquatic activities. Very, very suspect.

356
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
You know what you could do, right?

357
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,360
You could go to a pool.

358
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,760
I used to, when I was a kid, I would sometimes get into the deep end of a pool

359
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
and I would have the thought, what if there was a shark in here?

360
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,760
And then over the next few minutes of being in the deep end,

361
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,960
that thought would gradually congeal to, fuck me.

362
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,720
There is a shark in here.

363
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,240
So if you're wondering if people are born with anxiety or they develop it,

364
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,560
I think you have your answer now.

365
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,640
So Justin, the fact that you could see through the water didn't do anything?

366
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,800
Don't matter. Don't matter. He was behind me.

367
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,280
He's avoiding me.

368
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,080
He's made of glass.

369
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,120
Glass shark. Glass shark.

370
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
Glass shark love fat kid.

371
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,120
That's one thing about glass shark you gotta know.

372
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,040
Glass shark, he loved a fat kid.

373
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,280
You stay out the water, fat kid.

374
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,960
Glass shark coming for you.

375
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,280
He get you down there by deep water.

376
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,440
That dark water, fat kid.

377
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,400
No go.

378
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,720
Glass shark come to that dark water.

379
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
Get you fat kid.

380
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,880
You swim around and you bite your trunks right off, you tubby little fish.

381
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,720
You swim all you want, flop and flap around. Glass shark gonna come.

382
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,760
Glass shark behind you, fat kid.

383
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,440
You gotta swim.

384
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,400
Swim faster.

385
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,560
Pretend there's a corn dog at the end of the pool.

386
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,920
Get out that dark water.

387
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,080
That dark water and glass shark coming for you, fat kid.

388
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,240
He make you a snack.

389
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,280
He make you a snack.

390
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,480
He eat your brother.

391
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,200
He don't care.

392
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,040
He glass shark.

393
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,960
He in that bad dark water.

394
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,960
Swim on over here.

395
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,520
Why don't you cool off a little lemonade, wave that glass shark, move on down the next pond.

396
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,560
Get that next fat kid.

397
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,360
Don't let him get you.

398
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,440
You seem all right though.

399
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,120
Oh, fucking glass shark.

400
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,760
And a friendship is formed that lasts the ages.

401
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
Oh my god, glass shark.

402
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,040
By the way, that guy wasn't black.

403
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,000
He was from Louisiana.

404
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,560
Oh, sure.

405
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,280
We all got that.

406
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,640
Just wanted to clarify.

407
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,520
Should we go to the money zone?

408
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:51,840
Okay.

409
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,440
This week's episode is brought to you by Prosper.

410
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,640
Just the idea that you can have money.

411
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,840
Enjoy.

412
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,240
The idea of being prosperous.

413
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,560
It's brought to you by positive visualization.

414
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Focus on the word prosper.

415
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,000
No, what if you knew that 72 hours from now you would have $35,000?

416
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,400
What would you do?

417
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Coke bender.

418
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,840
Coke bender.

419
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,920
You pay off your credit cards, start a business, whatever you want to do.

420
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,800
Prosper is the place you can go for a low fixed rate loan.

421
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,600
Now, listen.

422
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,480
This is not the kind of thing that you typically come to us for.

423
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,040
We get that.

424
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,440
You're already coming to us for this kind of thing.

425
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,520
We know you're someone who likes to take chances.

426
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,840
Okay.

427
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,800
Prosper is the high tech answer to personal loans.

428
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,200
They got a peer to peer lending process.

429
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
They don't charge a bunch of fees.

430
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,320
They don't raise interest rates.

431
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,560
And you'll never ever, this is the best part.

432
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,280
You'll never set foot in a bank.

433
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Listen, like anyone who's ever looked for a loan before.

434
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,200
It's like a sweaty, awful process.

435
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,480
You know what I mean?

436
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,680
Even if you know you have good credit and you know you're in a good place,

437
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,440
there's something about sitting down in the bank and having someone sit across from you

438
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,600
while they go through every inch of your life in front of you and judge whether or not you're

439
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,000
a good bet to give money to.

440
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,040
So why not do it over the computer and not have to face that kind of judgment?

441
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,840
You know?

442
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,200
No sweat required.

443
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,320
No sweating.

444
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,240
But here is, if you think about it like any kind of funding site, this allows you to say,

445
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,560
I need a loan for, you know, maybe you're doing a big cross-country trip or you need to,

446
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,120
you know, fix the stairs on your house.

447
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,680
Something like that.

448
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,040
Something that you need a loan for and you plan to pay back.

449
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,000
When you go to Prosper, you say, this is what I need the loan for.

450
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,360
And then people throughout the world can give you that loan.

451
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,200
And then, and when you pay back your loan, you're paying back them.

452
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,600
So there's no bank involved.

453
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,840
It's other people are giving you the money you need and then you're paying that back.

454
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,120
And if you get a loan through Prosper and you tell them the brothers McElroy sent me,

455
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,520
you can get a $50 visa prepaid card when you get that loan.

456
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Just go to prosper.com slash my brother.

457
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,960
And you can actually get your, you can check your rate like instantly and it won't affect

458
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,520
your credit score.

459
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,560
So you can see, you know, sort of where you can get in at by going to prosper.com slash

460
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,040
my brother.

461
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,840
It's all one word.

462
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,480
Travis, you have to read this legal stuff or else all three of us will go to jail.

463
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,640
And you know, if you have any questions about it, there are other restrictions apply.

464
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,080
You got to see the site for program and visa prepaid card details.

465
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,880
All personal loans are made by web bank, a Utah chartered industrial bank.

466
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,360
It's a member of FDIC, equal housing lender.

467
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,600
So just go check it out for all the details.

468
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,520
This is like a real ass thing.

469
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
This is just like some funny website.

470
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,440
You can tell it's a real ass thing because there was text we legally had to read or else

471
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,040
we'd all go to jail together.

472
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,920
Go check it out.

473
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
That legal text.

474
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,600
You know what?

475
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
When you're getting your prosper loan, I have a great idea.

476
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,800
When you're getting prosper loan, maybe cut yourself off just a little bit extra.

477
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
Maybe just slide a few extra bucks in there.

478
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,400
So you can go to naturebox.com and get yourself some food also.

479
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,880
Maybe you need a loan for snacks.

480
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
I need a snack loan.

481
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,920
You're not going to need a snack loan with these snacks because these are affordable.

482
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,640
They're healthy.

483
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,040
They're delicious.

484
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,880
There's no trans fat.

485
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,080
There's no high fructose corn syrup.

486
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,560
Some of the snacks are low in sugar and don't have gluten and they'll ship to you for free.

487
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:40,560
You go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you pick out the snacks that look good to you.

488
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,320
Are you guys rocking anything new?

489
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,080
I haven't got a new box in a while.

490
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
The peanut butter nom noms are very good.

491
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm actually on them.

492
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,440
We got a coffee coated popcorn.

493
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,520
Oh, that sounds amazing.

494
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,080
Amazing.

495
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,040
I'm on a fog cleanse actually.

496
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,680
That's where you just...

497
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh, thanks for asking.

498
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
It's where you just eat fog.

499
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,600
You just eat fog, whether it's like natural.

500
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,200
I mean, obviously the natural stuff is the best.

501
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
If it's a foggy day outside, you just go outside.

502
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,120
But otherwise you're going to need like one of those fogger machines that they use for like

503
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,080
Easter pageants when they roll away the stone and it's like, whoa.

504
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,880
Oh, but once you finish your fog cleanse, go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

505
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,840
You're going to get 50% off of your first month's box and delivery is always free.

506
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,960
So you don't have to worry about it.

507
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm telling you, every week it seems like more and more people are saying like,

508
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
I finally tried it.

509
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,360
Thanks.

510
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,320
It's wonderful.

511
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,080
So what the hell are you waiting for?

512
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,960
What are you even doing?

513
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,160
I got a message for Steven from Tacoma who says a happy birthday because you couldn't wait and

514
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,640
opened all of your presents before your actual birthday.

515
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
I went ahead and bought another one and hid it.

516
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,440
Here's your clue.

517
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,560
This one isn't in my office or in a closet.

518
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,120
Good luck.

519
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,080
And hopefully you don't find it before they read this message.

520
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
If you do, you owe me like a whole dollar.

521
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm confused is I thought for a second that this was the present and that they hid it

522
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
inside our fucking brains and voices.

523
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,560
Oh my God.

524
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,920
That's the best place to hide something.

525
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
I think total recall.

526
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,760
I got to say, Steven.

527
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,400
Do you need to slow your fucking roll for like a minute?

528
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,840
Do you not know how presents work?

529
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,920
They are a representation of how thoughtful I am about like how much I know about you.

530
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,240
And if you look that shit up ahead of time, you ruin it.

531
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,800
You ruin it.

532
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,600
And I'm just, I'm just going to throw this out in the day and age of Amazon and everything

533
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,480
getting shipped to you.

534
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,040
If you're within like two weeks of your birthday and you get a package, don't just tear into

535
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,160
it like an animal.

536
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,040
Clearly, clearly it's a birthday present, you fool.

537
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,680
Yeah.

538
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,560
Savor the flavor.

539
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,080
Yeah, savor the flavor.

540
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,640
It's from me, but really it's for me.

541
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,720
Speaking of which, Griffin, one quick break.

542
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,080
Griffin, I wanted to thank you because right before this podcast, my wife and I enjoyed

543
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,200
the chicken pot pie that you bought for us and it was off the charts.

544
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,480
We sent you that shit like mouth sloppingly delicious.

545
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,600
Three weeks ago.

546
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,640
Yeah.

547
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,720
We were in the hospital for a little while and it's kind of hard to get home to cook

548
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,120
a pot.

549
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,200
I'm saying, but it was, it was still cool.

550
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,320
I'm saying get pie.

551
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,280
It's in the freezer.

552
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay.

553
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,720
It's fine.

554
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,360
It was absolutely delicious.

555
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm not going to mention who, who made the pie initially because pay me.

556
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,720
Yeah.

557
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
But, but yeah, it was delicious.

558
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,280
I wanted to thank you for that.

559
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,240
Well, thank Rachel.

560
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,560
I didn't, I didn't get, I didn't get you a pie.

561
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,040
I didn't.

562
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,440
Technically.

563
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,480
You got me lots of stuff.

564
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
I got to tell you, I technically, I technically did also not get you a pie.

565
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,040
My wife, my very thoughtful wife did.

566
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,400
It was, it was really good.

567
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,680
Okay, enough of that bullshit.

568
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,880
Here's the greatest money zone spot we've ever had.

569
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh Jesus.

570
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,360
Who is this message for?

571
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,040
It's for present day, Chris.

572
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
And who is this message from?

573
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,600
From past Chris.

574
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
Hey me, how's it going?

575
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,080
You're probably stressed at work when they're reading this.

576
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,680
So I hope this cheers you up.

577
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,400
Speaking of work, did you get a new job yet?

578
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,240
What about your gender stuff?

579
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,880
No rush.

580
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,640
But have you figured out any of that?

581
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
Is the cat still peeing on the rug?

582
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,200
I bet he is.

583
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That PB boy can't be stopped.

584
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,360
All the best, you.

585
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,360
And when asked what date he wanted, he said, surprise me.

586
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,960
Oh shit.

587
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,760
See, this is how you hide a fucking present.

588
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,040
Fucking Chris hid a fucking present from himself.

589
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
And he gave me the joy of giving it to him.

590
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,920
I'm going to throw that out.

591
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm not going to jump to conclusions.

592
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,600
Yeah.

593
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
But it's the greatest thing.

594
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,080
All I can picture is that Chris hit enter in the keyboard

595
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,240
and then erase this memory.

596
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,560
Just somehow there's like a eternal sunshine

597
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,640
on the spotless mind was gone.

598
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
This is solving a sustainability problem

599
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,240
that we've had for so long now, which

600
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,920
is that if everybody on Earth buys a money zone spot

601
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
for somebody else on Earth, we are

602
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
halving the number of money zone spots

603
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,640
we could ultimately get if everybody just bought them

604
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,080
for their own fucking selves.

605
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,000
And then that's a direct ROI.

606
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,880
Travis says that this is the best money zone message ever.

607
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,720
Is this best better than thanks for vibing

608
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,440
and keeping it tight?

609
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,120
Hit me up.

610
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm on my mobile.

611
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,400
OK.

612
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:20,960
OK.

613
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
That wins for best content.

614
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,600
This wins for best concept.

615
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,240
Conceptual.

616
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,000
By the way, if you have not yet been in my brother,

617
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
my brother, me appreciation group on Facebook,

618
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,200
get there, get approved, and see the illustration

619
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,760
that Lucas Williams created for thanks for vibing

620
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,000
and keeping it tight if you need me, hit me up on my mobile.

621
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,360
It's a baby talking into a cell phone.

622
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,760
The baby's in it.

623
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,560
It's pretty good stuff.

624
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,880
The application process is, I'm not going to lie to you guys,

625
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
it's pretty strenuous.

626
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
I check how many groups you're in.

627
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,720
I see if you're in any bullshit groups,

628
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,800
and then I say, yeah, OK, you can come in.

629
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,040
If you post shitty memes, or listen to my podcast,

630
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,680
or degrading photographs, no thanks.

631
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,800
We don't need you here.

632
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,760
We don't need your services.

633
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,040
Or try to sell jeans.

634
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,720
Or try to sell jeans or sunglasses.

635
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
A lot of people on there seem to sell jeans.

636
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,960
Just come to the group and start selling jeans.

637
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,000
If you're made of cyber bits, you are not welcome here.

638
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,400
No thanks.

639
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,440
No robits.

640
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,400
I have a Yahoo answer.

641
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:18,960
Do you guys want it?

642
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Wait, before we go on, if you would

643
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,920
like to buy a Money Zone spot for someone you know.

644
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,480
Or yourself.

645
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,600
Yep.

646
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,400
Just go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron,

647
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,640
and they're going to set you up for all that birthday messages.

648
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,800
And if you have a website or a product

649
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,560
that you want us to talk about and tell people to go check out,

650
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,520
just go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

651
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,000
This is episode like 215.

652
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,960
We've been with Max Fun since like episode 38.

653
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,160
And I still get emails every week, like six or seven,

654
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,560
that say, how do I get a Money Zone spot?

655
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,520
Well, that's only because we're fucking terrible

656
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,280
at telling people how to do anything.

657
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,520
So I'm going to make sure I say it again.

658
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,640
Maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

659
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,200
Thank you.

660
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,680
I love you.

661
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Hi.

662
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,120
My name's Dave.

663
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,160
And my name's Graham.

664
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,760
Now, what do we have to do to put you

665
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,440
in a brand new podcast today?

666
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,920
Yeah.

667
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,280
What, do you want me to drink bleach?

668
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,400
I'll do it.

669
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,600
Yeah, Dave will drink bleach.

670
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,360
If that's what it takes to get you to listen to,

671
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,160
stop podcasting yourself on maximumfun.org.

672
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,680
Don't make Dave drink bleach.

673
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,120
Just listen to the show.

674
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,560
He will, but don't make him.

675
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,680
Stop podcasting yourself.

676
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,880
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Alan Black.

677
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,520
Thank you, Alan Black.

678
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sass, who asks,

679
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,440
is there a traffic ticket for sexting?

680
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,600
Hypothetical question.

681
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,720
That's it.

682
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,840
It's hypothetical.

683
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,000
It's fucking hypothetical until it's not anymore,

684
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,040
until it's manifest.

685
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm confused by the parameters.

686
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,680
Are they saying if someone sees you sexting

687
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,040
while in a car in general?

688
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,280
Yeah.

689
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,000
Or is it like while driving?

690
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,480
Because I feel like that falls under a different category.

691
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,920
It varies from state to state, right?

692
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,080
Could be if you're texting in your car no matter what.

693
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,200
Yeah, you're fucked.

694
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,520
If the car is at a stoplight, you're fine.

695
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,080
Just don't move while you're texting or sexting.

696
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,120
There was a whole 15 minute spot on Car Talk

697
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,200
about not sexting while you drive.

698
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,480
Is there fucking really?

699
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,280
You could tell me not to move while sexting.

700
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,600
You might as well tell the sun to stop shining.

701
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,160
Yeah.

702
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,480
I got to move till I find the exact right angle.

703
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,760
I'm going to find my light.

704
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,880
I'm going to find my angles.

705
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,240
Going to model H2T.

706
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,520
That is head to toe.

707
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,880
I'm going to I'm going to booch.

708
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,200
I'm going to smize.

709
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,560
I can't sext.

710
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,400
You're going to take a picture of my dick?

711
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,520
No, do not do that.

712
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,160
I'll take a picture of my dick and balls.

713
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,800
No, no, no.

714
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,680
You're not going to do that.

715
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,680
You're not going to do that.

716
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,080
Sexting I don't think involves dicks or balls.

717
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,840
Okay, so maybe I'm just going to text like

718
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,360
I'm going to use my wiener so good on you.

719
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,720
So good.

720
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,760
You're going to really enjoy it.

721
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,960
This is pretty hot so far.

722
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
I think you're going to thoroughly have a good time.

723
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Your comment card is going to be all fives.

724
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,440
You're really going to enjoy it.

725
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,480
Oh, God, a police officer pulls you over.

726
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,040
Excuse me, sir.

727
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,240
Were you texting while driving?

728
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,280
Yeah, I'm sorry.

729
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,760
I just, you know, I, I am too busy and like this message

730
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,920
couldn't wait the four minutes that it was going to take for me

731
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,920
to get to fucking super America.

732
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,200
So I am sorry.

733
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,160
I was texting while driving.

734
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,520
I will take that ticket now.

735
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,080
Hold on a second.

736
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,360
Can I ask the subject matter of the text message of the SMS?

737
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,440
Yes, it was, it was of a medical nature.

738
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,800
Okay.

739
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,400
I mean, as you go a little bit deeper.

740
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,480
Was it about how good my wiener is?

741
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,080
It was about how great my wiener is.

742
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,320
Sorry.

743
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,560
Sorry.

744
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,080
I have to take you to double jail.

745
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,920
You know, there's a new campaign to, but when you get into a car

746
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,040
to text your friend hashtag X and to let them know you're driving.

747
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,320
Hey, just to let everyone on my contact list know.

748
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,960
Meemaw, Meeps, Peepaw, Peepums.

749
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,360
Everybody.

750
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,560
My hashtag X.

751
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,960
My old landlord's wife.

752
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,960
When I lived in Chicago.

753
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,800
Do need you to know it's just hold off for just like 15 minutes

754
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,080
till I get to the super America.

755
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,600
Couldn't you just not look at your phone?

756
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,680
Are you kidding?

757
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,200
Have you met a 14 year old?

758
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:11,920
No.

759
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,400
A 14 year old who's driving and sexting.

760
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,200
And he's drunk.

761
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Yeah.

762
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,520
And he's drunk and high.

763
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,720
We're in a blindfold.

764
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,160
This kid is reckless.

765
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,840
He's probably high.

766
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,960
He's got a knife in his mouth.

767
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,000
He's got a knife in his mouth and he's high because he lives in Boulder, Colorado.

768
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,200
And he doesn't vote.

769
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,000
He just complains about how it turns out afterwards.

770
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,760
Motherfuckers never voted.

771
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,320
And he's always high and he's driving and he's a danger to us.

772
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,360
What's that in the back seat?

773
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,400
It's a monkey.

774
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,360
Wait, what?

775
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:37,840
Where are we?

776
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,920
There's a monkey in the back seat.

777
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
Wait, is the monkey supposed to represent danger or awesome?

778
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,120
Just the kid's back of the bone.

779
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,040
Oh, maybe it's a helper monkey because the kid has no sense of judgment.

780
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,080
Okay.

781
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,920
The monkey's in the back going, I don't know about this kid.

782
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,840
I don't know, Robbie.

783
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,440
Maybe take the knife out of your mouth.

784
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,640
Robbie, you should pull over.

785
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,600
You should get on high.

786
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,880
You should put the knife down.

787
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,320
And you need to text your dad, your mom, and everyone you know, hashtag X.

788
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,280
And maybe don't talk about your dick and balls when you talk to that nice girl.

789
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,520
Well, nobody should fucking be sexting.

790
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,920
You don't need me to fucking magic decision monkey to tell you to do that.

791
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,040
Or a comedy podcast.

792
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,200
Here's the more you know PSA.

793
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,120
Don't send pictures of your privates to anyone or descriptions of your privates.

794
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,480
That link, that's worse in a lot of ways, depending on how good you are at writing.

795
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,760
Justin, go ahead with the next question.

796
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,840
I work in a call center.

797
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,040
Part of our job is asking the client if there's anything else we can do for them before hanging

798
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,600
up.

799
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,120
Maybe four or five times a day, someone will say, yeah, the winning Powerball numbers.

800
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,620
What?

801
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,280
That's crazy.

802
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,840
Do you work at like a fortune telling place?

803
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,440
I don't think you delivered it correctly.

804
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:45,920
Let me try.

805
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,600
Okay.

806
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,080
Yeah, the winning Powerball numbers.

807
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,520
Okay, that's funnier.

808
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,720
That is better, actually.

809
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,520
That is funnier.

810
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,720
I know they're trying to be funny and nice, and I don't begrudge them.

811
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,760
But after hearing that same joke, and there are actually four sets of quotation marks

812
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,280
around joke, infinity times, I'm incapable of polite laughter and sit there like a weeping

813
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,720
angel looking into a mirror.

814
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,440
Are there any funny responses that you could help me add to my repertoire so that I don't

815
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,160
feel like a humorless ass five times a day?

816
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,200
Is there anything I can do to associate this terrible joke with a good one and make it

817
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,000
funny?

818
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,120
And that's from Fake Laugh Failure in Philadelphia.

819
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,960
Here we go.

820
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,680
Do you want it?

821
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,880
First, let me say one thing.

822
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,640
You only need one response.

823
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,280
Really.

824
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,720
I mean, you can have more in your quiver, but the person's not going to know.

825
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,360
They're not going to know.

826
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,080
They're not going to talk to Steven like, did you talk to that customer service person?

827
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,440
Yeah, what'd they say to you?

828
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,640
I did my great job.

829
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,280
Fuck.

830
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:43,920
Quick question.

831
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,360
Do you want it to be funny to them or funny to you?

832
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,440
You're trying to re-yuck a yuckster?

833
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,160
No, no, no.

834
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,720
I'm saying like-

835
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:59,760
I think Travis is pointing out one of the sort of, one of the facts of growing up is

836
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:07,680
that you tend to, you learn to treasure jokes that aren't exactly funny, but are serviceable

837
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,840
and make sense and can get you out of a conversation.

838
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,160
Because I'm going to tell you, here's the thing.

839
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,840
As someone who's worked customer service and had to deal with these people at work,

840
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,840
they're not trying to be funny.

841
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,080
They're using this like a fill in the blank, drop it in so they feel like they've had

842
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,920
some kind of interaction with you.

843
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,360
This is like a thing they say when they can't think of something to say, like, how you doing?

844
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,360
You know, oh, weather, huh?

845
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:31,840
You know what I mean?

846
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,280
This is just a filler thing.

847
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,920
You are trying to normalize the behavior of fucking space aliens, Travis, because the

848
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,800
normal thing that you say when someone says, can I help you with anything?

849
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,120
When someone says, can I help you with anything else is no.

850
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,520
Thank you.

851
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,160
Goodbye.

852
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,880
Great service.

853
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,520
You don't even say that last part.

854
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,240
You don't even say no.

855
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:48,880
Thank you.

856
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,600
You say bye and you hang up the fucking phone.

857
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,280
Sometimes you say bye because you're talking to a human automaton.

858
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,640
Is the transaction over?

859
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,760
Can I can I detect that you were trying to wrap this conversation up?

860
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,040
I'm going to save us both a lot of time and just end.

861
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,160
Just cut the line.

862
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,840
All right.

863
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,240
All right.

864
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,880
Let's think of some not funny.

865
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,520
Okay.

866
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,280
But serviceable answers.

867
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,600
Let me throw one out just to get things started.

868
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,200
There's a three in there somewhere.

869
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,120
That's all I'm allowed to say.

870
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,840
I like that.

871
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,840
Let me throw this out.

872
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,400
Travis, I swear to God, if you say, I'm going to start taxing you.

873
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,520
There'll be a tax.

874
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,560
You're going to get a bill.

875
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,680
Where's this bill come from?

876
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,560
Try this one on for size.

877
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,200
Oh, fuck.

878
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,960
Put this in your pipe and smirk it.

879
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,640
Okay.

880
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
Okay, Justin, you give me the Powerball line.

881
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,240
Nothing on my sleeve this time for sure.

882
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,360
Why'd you try that?

883
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,800
Okay, Justin, give me the Powerball line.

884
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,120
Yeah.

885
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,800
The winning Powerball numbers.

886
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,520
Well, I'd love to, but I'd get fired.

887
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,440
Wow.

888
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,600
That fucking gave me the douchiest chills.

889
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:04,800
Fuck.

890
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,760
Okay, wait, hold on.

891
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,080
Try it.

892
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:06,960
Can I try one out?

893
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,520
You both did one.

894
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,320
Let me try one.

895
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:08,880
Okay.

896
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,960
Travis, you do the prompt for me this time.

897
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,600
Yeah.

898
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,520
The winning Powerball numbers.

899
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,480
69.

900
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,040
You make a vigorous blow job.

901
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,360
Okay, Justin, give me a line again.

902
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:24,720
Yeah.

903
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,560
The winning Powerball numbers.

904
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:32,720
Six, 17, 23, 38, six, five.

905
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,000
Oh God.

906
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,720
What just happened?

907
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,880
And then you hang up the phone.

908
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,000
Travis, give me the line.

909
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,560
Okay.

910
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:38,800
Yeah.

911
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,240
The winning Powerball numbers.

912
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
36, 24, 33.

913
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,480
Maybe she's Sir Mixalot's girlfriend.

914
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,560
Kids, Justin, give it to me.

915
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,240
Yeah.

916
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,520
The winning Powerball numbers.

917
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,680
Sir, I have a lot of people to get through today.

918
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,200
Do you need anything or don't you?

919
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,680
Yeah.

920
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,200
The winning Powerball numbers.

921
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,520
Please.

922
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,720
I need some escape.

923
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,560
I need an escape hatch for this life.

924
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,000
This prison life that I've constructed for myself around myself.

925
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,920
My family and I are so destitute.

926
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,280
I've been out of work for six months.

927
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,720
That's why I called the Butterball hotline.

928
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,800
It sounds like I'm hanging on by a thread here.

929
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,400
Sounds like you're in dire straits.

930
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,440
So 69.

931
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,040
I'll get you out a lot of workplace pickles.

932
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,520
Get you out a lot of workplaces.

933
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,240
Yeah, that too.

934
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,880
Get fired.

935
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,600
Let's end the show.

936
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,160
Yeah.

937
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,200
Yeah, we're done.

938
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,640
Hey, thank you all so much for listening to My Brother, My Brother, Me.

939
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,160
I sure missed doing this with my brothers.

940
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,160
And I miss seeing all you all and hanging out with you all.

941
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,840
And I'm certainly glad to be back.

942
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,040
So thank you for listening to our show again.

943
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,280
Thank you to people tweeting about our show like Kyle Starr, Peter Alan Boyle, Rich Wilson,

944
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:08,400
Todd Hauser, Steve, JB, Paul Briner, David Lasky, Rocket Man, Sam Dean, Lynn Bravo Alpha,

945
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,800
Rocket Man again, Mia, Dan Hendrickson, so many others.

946
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,520
We're at NBNBAM on Twitter.

947
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,800
So you can just follow us there and tweet at us using the NBNBAM hashtag.

948
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,040
That'd be great.

949
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,200
And thanks for all the nice feedback about the Adventure Zone.

950
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:27,680
Yep.

951
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,560
D&D episode.

952
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,360
We're out.

953
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:29,840
We're fit.

954
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,600
We had a lot of people asking if we're going to release the rest of it.

955
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,960
Like that was all that we've played.

956
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,880
But we are figuring out what doing more of that looks like in a podcast.

957
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,240
Not this podcast.

958
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,200
But maybe another one.

959
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,320
Speaking of other podcasts, if you enjoyed this podcast and you haven't listened to the

960
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,160
other Maximum podcast, you are cool.

961
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,920
There's tons of them.

962
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,320
I'm not going to try to list all of them because there's way too many.

963
00:53:54,320 --> 00:54:00,000
But I just saw on Twitter that Lady2Lady just recorded an episode with French Stewart.

964
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,720
Oh, don't tell people that because then they're going to try and fucking shame us

965
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,640
because we were horrible to French Stewart.

966
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,440
We were not.

967
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,560
It was all in fun.

968
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,280
It was all-

969
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,880
It was not in fun or in jest.

970
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,200
We were fucking horrible to French Stewart.

971
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,240
In our defense, those were in the days when we couldn't imagine anyone would ever listen

972
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:18,880
to our show.

973
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,200
Correct.

974
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,760
That was not as long ago as I think you guys think it was.

975
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,360
That was like 199.

976
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,640
I'm sorry, French Stewart.

977
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,960
We're fucking growing.

978
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,200
We're learning that when we say things about human beings, sometimes those human beings

979
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,000
can ostensibly hear what we say and it hurts them.

980
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,640
It would hurt me.

981
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,560
So go check out the other Maximum podcast.

982
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,480
Yeah, please do.

983
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,120
They're really great.

984
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,640
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us.

985
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:47,920
We love you guys.

986
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,560
Yeah, I really-

987
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,880
It's a constant joy.

988
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,760
I want to thank John Roderick, too, and The Long Winters, as long as we're thanking people

989
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,680
for the use of our theme song.

990
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,400
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

991
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,400
It's a great album.

992
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,040
I was listening to it on the record player earlier today.

993
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:08,000
I played it backwards and I heard John Roderick's dark regards.

994
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,320
You guys want the final yahoo?

995
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:12,800
Yeah, hit me.

996
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,880
This final yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

997
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,680
It's a yeah, Drew.

998
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,640
Uh, this yahoo user, Steven, asks,

999
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,280
What is the best moisture of all to use for lovemaking?

1000
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,080
Oh, golly.

1001
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,960
I'm Justin McElroy.

1002
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,000
And I'm Travis McElroy.

1003
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1004
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,640
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1005
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,360
Kiss your dad.

1006
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:52,000
Square on the lips.

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,360
of Misguided Medicine, a show about all the dumb, weird,

1016
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,160
terrible ways that we've tried to fix each other over the years.

1017
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,400
You know, some light summer listening.

1018
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
Maybe you want to hear about yogurt enemas

1019
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,040
or why we tried to eat mummies for a while

1020
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,560
or why drinking cholera diarrhea sounded like a good idea.

1021
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,840
That and so much more is waiting for you every Tuesday

1022
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,720
right here on the Maximum Fun Network

1023
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,600
with Sawbones, a marital tour of Misguided Medicine.
