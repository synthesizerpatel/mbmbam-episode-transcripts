1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:52,640
Can I smell yo dick? Perhaps not, but I can't smell your queries,

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,120
and that's why you've brought them to us. It's my brother, my brother, and me.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
Is that really what you're choosing to lead off with?

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
That's what- that's the beginning thing. The first thing that I'll say is, can I smell your dick?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,840
See, what I'm curious about is that you can smell their questions,

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
but you can't smell their tangible dick.

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,760
Would the question be, may I smell yo dick?

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
May I smell yo dick?

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,480
Can you smell- you certainly can, but am I able to smell yo dick?

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
You have the olfactory powers to inhale-

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,760
Do I possess the capacity for dick smelling?

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,880
To waft the dick fumes, and yes, you can smell my dick.

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
Hi, Nonny. I hope you're listening to this episode.

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,800
This is my brother, my brother, but it's an advice show for the modern era.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,040
I am your host, co-host, co-brother, Justin McElroy.

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
I am also those things, Travis McElroy.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,160
And I'm Griffin McElroy. No titles necessary or required.

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,400
So here's how the show works. You guys send us your questions.

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,080
We call a few from Yahoo Answers, and then we answer them.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,880
So let's just do it. Let's go right into it.

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
Let's get it- let's- let's get our dicks wet.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
I have a brother that's 12 years older than me.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,080
He's a cool guy, but at times he's a dick, and I can smell him.

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
For example, a family get-togethers, he likes to play this game where he flips me off when our mother isn't looking.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
Awesome! That's a great game.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,320
I wish this question was sent in by your brother instead of you, because he sounds way cooler.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,040
I try to get back at him when I can, but it always seems like he has the upper hand.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,000
Can you please help me out by letting me know how much- letting him know how much of a dick he is?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Thanks, Bitter Brother.

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
I have bad news for you. Your brother is awesome.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
Your brother's- I want to be best friends with him.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,840
That's pretty cool. Yeah, he sounds like a pretty cool cat.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,520
And here's the thing, older brothers are always going to be cooler than you.

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
That's just how they roll.

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
And that has as much to do with perception as it does with the classes they have to go to.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
And not only that, but like that's their job.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,240
It is your older brother's job to kind of be a dick to you.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,320
Yeah, it makes you tough.

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,560
Yeah.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
I don't think you guys were ever dicks to me, really.

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
You wouldn't think that.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
We told you you were adopted.

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah, but I saw through that ruse pretty quickly.

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,320
Yeah, because we had tormented you though.

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,040
That's how we made you so hard and crafty.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,320
Yeah.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,920
You know?

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Made your heart leathery.

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,720
You taught me manners. That's for damn sure.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,360
Yeah.

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
You would smack me down when I got out of line.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Yeah, absolutely.

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,920
Like if you would try to smell inappropriate dicks, we would always say like, stop it.

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,720
Get your-

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,200
You're sick.

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
No, you may not.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
You're out of line.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,560
And it's may I smell your dick, Griffin.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Jesus.

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
Grammar.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Cro-magnon.

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,000
Your brother sounds cool, but if this is like a play like he got you and so you're going to

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,840
redouble back burn him by having us call him a dick, I will say he's a dick.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Your brother's a dick.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,160
What a dick.

70
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,120
Is it wrong to have sex with a woman if she's slightly drunk and I'm fully

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,520
sober?

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,240
So many ways.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,960
J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J.

74
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,960
You got to like slightly is it specific enough for me?

75
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
I wouldn't need like a blood alcohol content.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,200
I don't know.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,720
I'm going to need like-

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,680
I keep a breathalyzer by the bed.

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Yeah.

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,000
At all times.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Because that leads to a nice seg of, you know, blow into this.

82
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
Now blow into this.

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
That's a good move.

84
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
Yeah, ladies really love it.

85
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Because they never see that coming.

86
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,880
The important question is if if you're only going to get to have sex with her because

87
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,440
she's drunk, then no, it's not okay.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,680
I think you guys were going to have sex anyways and then she got a little bit drunk.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
Then yeah, it's probably okay.

90
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
I think, J, you send us this question.

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,120
I think you really need to take a long look in the mirror and then you need to decide

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,240
if you are, in fact, attractive enough to be having sex with this girl.

93
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,200
Because if not, then no, it's not appropriate.

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,920
But if you look at your face in the mirror and you say, all right, J.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,680
This is about your level.

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
If it's apparent that you have tricked her with juju magic, then you should probably

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
just keep your dick dry.

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,640
You know, juju magic hasn't been the same since it got bought by Anheuser-Busch.

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
I liked it so much better when it was an independent brew.

100
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
But I mean, I don't know.

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
Because what if- couldn't he just rectify this situation if he's like, oh, I'm dead

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,600
sober and she's wicked drunk and there's no way that she would have a sex with me.

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
So let me just take a couple shots and we're ready.

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,720
Thanks, Little John.

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
It's time to go.

106
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
Thanks, LJ.

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,840
Or there's the alternate.

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,400
Make her take a cold shower and drink some strong coffee.

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
I want to make love to you.

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,480
I'm going to sober you up first.

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Balance both of your humors at the same time and then you can fuck.

112
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Although if he's been waiting for our answer, chances are she is sober.

113
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Yeah, sorry about that.

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,520
Or I mean, what if it's like somebody that I wouldn't normally have?

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
What if it's like his girlfriend?

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
But she's a little drunk and he's not.

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,160
But it leads to more adventurous things that she wouldn't typically do if sober.

118
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,040
You know?

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Yeah, I eat a bunch of carbs.

120
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,880
She wakes up in the morning like, why is my armpit raw?

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,640
He's like, we did the armpits last night.

122
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,720
We finally tried pits.

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,040
You've been talking about pits for so long.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,440
The Old Spice is new to us, ironically.

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
But we tried it and we loved it.

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,240
I loved it.

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
You were just so completely drunk.

128
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,640
I got that pure sport.

129
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,800
Would you like to smell my dick?

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Because it smells like pure sport.

131
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,360
Jay, I think that this is one of those cases where you really need to trust your own judgment.

132
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,680
And you seem like a nice guy.

133
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
If there's any doubt in your mind, it's like the creepy thing that you talked about.

134
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
If you have to wonder if it's creepy, it's creepy.

135
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
I think this falls into the same camp.

136
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,160
If you have to wonder if it's kind of skeezy, then yeah, it probably is.

137
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm going full prohibitionist.

138
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,640
I'm saying if spirits cross betwixt her lips, just go ahead and just shy away.

139
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,480
See, I actually agree with Griffin on that one.

140
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,720
Because I think that it's just the safer bet.

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,600
You don't want to offend anyone in that way.

142
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
And you don't want her getting pissed off or doing something wrong.

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,480
So just be safe and take her to breakfast the next morning.

144
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,680
And you guys have a chat.

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,640
Maybe you'll hit it off.

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,960
Now, should he have sex with a woman if he's drunk and she's a giant stuffed animal?

147
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,480
This seems like a pretty pressing inquiry for you, Griffin.

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Is this something you need to know like right away?

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,720
I need to know two nights ago.

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,520
I need to know two nights ago.

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
Time traveling questions.

152
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,000
So Griffin, maybe you could break me off a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo answer service.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,520
First, I have to thank everybody.

154
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,720
I was a scoundrel this past weekend.

155
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,200
I forgot to solicit these Yahoo answers earlier in the weekend like I usually do.

156
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,720
And instead solicited them 30 minutes before the show started.

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
But I still got a shit ton.

158
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,280
So thanks, everybody.

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,360
And hey, thanks everybody for showing that that is an inexhaustible resource,

160
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,800
apparently, which is fine.

161
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
Goddamn, there's so many good ones.

162
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,680
How about this?

163
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,320
This one was sent in by Chris Player.

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,960
Thanks, Chris.

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:47,760
It's by Yahoo answers user Goob Von Goob, who asks, how can I seduce my babysitter?

166
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,400
I am 16.

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,520
My babysitter is 26 and has been single for a long time.

168
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,680
And it's not particularly intelligent.

169
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
Is there a way I can seduce her?

170
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
Additional details.

171
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
My parents do not trust me.

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
I don't know about that.

173
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
That last part is ominous.

174
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
I don't like that.

175
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,520
Because of what I did to the cat.

176
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,080
I mean, everybody has a crush on their babysitter at some point.

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
16, by the way, maybe a little old for a babysitter.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,840
Maybe you don't need, maybe you shouldn't have a babysitter.

179
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Oh, that's probably why all his parents don't trust him.

180
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
A 16 dog?

181
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,520
Hey, dog, you should move out.

182
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,120
You should probably emancipate yourself from that sitch.

183
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
Are you a bad person?

184
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
Like, are you like that omen kid?

185
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,320
I think the situation is best if he's just direct.

186
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
If he just says, hey, you've been single for a long time and you're pretty dumb.

187
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
You're probably not going to do any better than a 16 year old kid.

188
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
Let's do this.

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
I think anybody can do better than a 16 year old kid.

190
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
And sorry, 16 year old kids that are listening.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,680
But you don't know how to please it.

192
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,480
I'm 23.

193
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I don't know how to please a 26 year old woman.

194
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,960
I certainly didn't know how to seven years ago.

195
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,920
Ain't that the truth.

196
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,920
The women, who knows how to please them at all at any age?

197
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,640
You don't want to get into that when you're 16.

198
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,920
Just be selfish like all the other 16 year olds.

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,240
Just worry about your driver's license and what episode of the Jersey Shore is on tonight.

200
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
We're being evasive.

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,040
How can this guy seduce his beautiful kind babysitter?

202
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Flex.

203
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Flex those beefy, beefy muscles.

204
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,600
Beefy 16 year old muscles.

205
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Pop those tendons right in her grill.

206
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
Hey, can you back your grill up a little bit?

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,080
I'm about to pop a tendon and I don't want to loosen any of your teeth with my tendon popping.

208
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,400
Oil up.

209
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,600
Like it's a small thing.

210
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Small thing.

211
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
Just grease up.

212
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
Like if you're going to be-

213
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
Like your whole body?

214
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
If you're going to have a lady on-

215
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,840
No, that's not-

216
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,520
Okay, you can't grease up your whole body because then you're like creepy red dragon

217
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
waiting in the closet to kill her and skin her.

218
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm saying like you grease up your top half so you look-

219
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:11,120
Like you highlight the sinew-y-ness of your 16 year old frame.

220
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
That's a good frame.

221
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,720
16?

222
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,400
That's a good frame.

223
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,840
My chassis at 16 was awfully tight.

224
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,360
Yeah, it was a nice-

225
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,400
It was a good chassis.

226
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm not commenting on your chassis, but-

227
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,920
No, my chassis was tight.

228
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
I'm uncomfortable with this.

229
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,200
I had a good core.

230
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, I'm done.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,800
My delts were-

232
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
Well, I'm leaving the call now.

233
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm bustling.

234
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm quitting the show if you keep up with this.

235
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
I can't do it.

236
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,920
I think that you should just be like a super nice tour.

237
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,840
Like, hey, why don't you tell me about your problems?

238
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,560
Ooh.

239
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
And then she may associate you as like,

240
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,120
like who's babysitting who?

241
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
Ask her to prom.

242
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,280
Okay.

243
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,240
Okay, okay.

244
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,200
Ask her to prom.

245
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,120
Fun, nostalgic.

246
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
I love it.

247
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,680
Watch Adventures in Babysitting.

248
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,960
You know that scene in Adventures in Babysitting

249
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,080
when one of the babysitting kids has sex with Elizabeth Shue?

250
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,760
Fast forward to that part and say like,

251
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,280
huh, what do you think?

252
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,720
He has sex with Elizabeth Shue?

253
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
Mm-hmm. It's a pretty good movie.

254
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm surprised you haven't seen it.

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,760
My volume is turned down pretty far on my headphones

256
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,880
so that I don't get feedback.

257
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,720
But I thought you just said something

258
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
about having sex with an actual, a literal shoe.

259
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
With Elizabeth Shue.

260
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
Oh, pardon me, Elizabeth.

261
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,120
I would watch that movie.

262
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,920
I would watch that movie.

263
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,280
May I borrow your shoe for a moment?

264
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
Sex with Elizabeth Shue's shoes?

265
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Like, I would be into that.

266
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
Why does your dick smell like Elizabeth Shue?

267
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,520
It's leathery.

268
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,840
What is the proper etiquette

269
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,000
when you walk into a public restroom

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,840
and there's already someone in there,

271
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
but you can't quite tell if the restroom is meant

272
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,960
for more than one person?

273
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,160
Oh, man, Jeff.

274
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,440
That's a good one.

275
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
I know what he's talking about, right?

276
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,080
Like you go to one of those halfies where you,

277
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,520
you know, it's sort of like a stall and a urinal,

278
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,360
but it's so small that if you're going to be

279
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,280
doing your business in there, it would be weird.

280
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,600
Yeah, you're going to get splash damage.

281
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,120
I just announced loudly while leaning up against the wall,

282
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
no need to rush.

283
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm just here for the show.

284
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,560
That's good.

285
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
That'll help to really lighten the tension

286
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,080
and not increase it.

287
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,280
The thing is, those bathrooms always have a lock on them.

288
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,000
And if you are the person in the restroom,

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
you know, the first person to get there,

290
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
lock the goddamn door.

291
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
What fucking utopia do you operate in

292
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
where every bathroom has a security system

293
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,480
that makes them as efficient as a lock on it?

294
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,960
Well, you kind of stretch your leg back

295
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,120
and you put one heel up against the door

296
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,640
or like you stretch your hand

297
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,200
so your hand is like a half inch away from the door.

298
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,360
So if someone tried to walk in, you could slam it.

299
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,840
When I'm peeing, I don't want to fucking pull

300
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,600
some Inspector Gadget hijinks.

301
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Like I want to get the urine out of me

302
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
and then get back to whatever it was I was doing.

303
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
I think if the door has a lock,

304
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,120
that is a sure sign that it is a one person bathroom.

305
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
I think that if you're in a bathroom that has a lock

306
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,120
and you don't lock it, you just want to get dick watched.

307
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,600
That's it.

308
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
Like you're just, that's your oops.

309
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Oops.

310
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,120
You saw it.

311
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
Sorry, you saw my dick.

312
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,640
Don't you ever tell.

313
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
I just want to, in case anyone out there is offended,

314
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
that's not my gay guy voice.

315
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,040
That's my Jim Carrey as that bodybuilding lady

316
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,400
from In Living Color voice.

317
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Which is the closest I can approximate to a dick watcher

318
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
who likes to be dick watched.

319
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,560
See, mine was very on the nose.

320
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,280
Mine was the gym teacher that just really wants

321
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,640
to get his dick watched.

322
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,560
Yeah, like that's all he wants in this world.

323
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Who's ready for showers?

324
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,280
Me.

325
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,520
I think if you are the person that walks in,

326
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,200
the proper etiquette is to go, whoa, sorry, sorry, sorry.

327
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,280
And then walk to the opposite end of the bar

328
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,360
and blend in with a crowd so that the person

329
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
never knows who it was.

330
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
They can never know.

331
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,840
I actually carry a small satin pouch

332
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,520
of smoke bombs with me for this very occasion.

333
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,160
Because if I see somebody, if I even like,

334
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
if they think for a split second that I've seen their dick,

335
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,360
like smoke bomb out and gone.

336
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,040
Like I'll leave, I'll move away.

337
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
I'll move to a different state.

338
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,800
I have a question.

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,200
When you guys go to the bathroom and it has a lock on it

340
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,160
and you lock it and there's someone in there, right?

341
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,080
So you can't get in and you try the knob.

342
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,440
Do you do the thing where you try to move away from the door

343
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,200
so it seems like it wasn't you?

344
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,960
Like you try to play like you weren't the one

345
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,240
who just turned the knob and interrupted their beamer.

346
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,800
I actually-

347
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,960
I casually lean against the wall and whistle.

348
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,560
I want them to know.

349
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,920
I want them to know.

350
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,960
Look at my face because this is the face of the guy

351
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,240
whose time you just wasted.

352
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,040
And I have to pee so much more than I did just a few minutes ago.

353
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
You've caused me a discomfort and I'll never forgive you for that.

354
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,960
We will never be best friends.

355
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,920
We're never friends.

356
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
I can't do it.

357
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,920
I can't let people know that I just was the door guy.

358
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
And I don't know like why I'd be embarrassed.

359
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,240
Like they just-

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,640
You know, I have the same thing where I always feel discomfort

361
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,160
and I feel the discomfort comes from me knowing they just peed

362
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
and then knowing I had to pee and somewhere in there

363
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,840
this knowledge of each other makes us way too intimate.

364
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm gonna pee on your pee.

365
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,720
Here, just a second.

366
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,320
Hope you gave it a good flush of Rooney

367
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,760
because I'm about to pee right on it.

368
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,320
Let's make pee cocktails.

369
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,880
My dick's gonna be in the air that your dick was just in

370
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,640
and for some reason it makes me uncomfortable.

371
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,280
I just-

372
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
Yeah, no, there's definitely-

373
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,760
There's like a trace of dick that you have behind you in the bathroom.

374
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,640
I hate when somebody pees on the seat while you're waiting

375
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
and then they come out

376
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,000
and they look at you like they just ate the last cookie.

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,520
Like, meh, I didn't.

378
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,720
They don't flush.

379
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,320
Like, get it?

380
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
I peed on the seat.

381
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,200
Enjoy.

382
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,640
Like, what are you doing?

383
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,280
Like, why did you do that?

384
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,120
Why is that guy snively whiplash?

385
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,160
You know, I was asking.

386
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,120
Because he's a villain.

387
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,480
Oh, I see.

388
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,600
Yeah, right, exactly.

389
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
I hate when people come out of the bathroom

390
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,960
twisting their handlebar mustache.

391
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,080
And peeing on seats.

392
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,160
Hey, I just peed on the seat.

393
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Can we just everyone be good in bathrooms?

394
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,440
It's not hard to be good at bathrooms.

395
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
Just be good at bathrooms.

396
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,040
Get your bathroom game right.

397
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,160
And don't pee on anything.

398
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,680
Just pee in the toilet and wash your fucking hands.

399
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
Wash your fucking-

400
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
What are you doing?

401
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,240
Get back in there.

402
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
Wash your hands.

403
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,320
Now, see, I'm not always agreeing with you on that.

404
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,880
What's worse?

405
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,920
You gotta shake someone's hands.

406
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,560
What's worse?

407
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,640
And you don't know what they've been doing for the past 20 minutes.

408
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,120
What's worse?

409
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,200
There's dry hands that could possibly be germy.

410
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
Or wet hands where you think,

411
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,680
oh, I know what you did.

412
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,520
I know what you did and you can't hide from it.

413
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,880
You're saying that-

414
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,600
I would rather someone shake my hand with a dirty, unwashed hand

415
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
than a wet hand that I know they washed after they touched their wiener.

416
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,080
Like, I don't need that pressure in my life.

417
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,920
That's so fucked up, Justin.

418
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,480
What?

419
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,760
Because I can guarantee you that that dry hand

420
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,440
has also touched wiener,

421
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
only it hasn't taken a bath afterwards.

422
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
I don't have to think about it though.

423
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
It's not confronting my reality at that moment.

424
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,120
That's-

425
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,320
You live a weird life.

426
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,560
It's pretending you didn't just pee as the opiate of the masses.

427
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,520
I want to be lied to

428
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,440
and I don't want to know the truth about people's bathroom habits.

429
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,120
If I shake your hand and it's wet,

430
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
you better have a fucking explanation.

431
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,560
Why didn't you dry it right away?

432
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Dry your hand better next time.

433
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Okay, I just went to the bathroom.

434
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
Urine only, so you don't have to think about the-

435
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,040
Oh God, you don't have to think about the alternative.

436
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,200
And then I washed-

437
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,400
We're not even touching that.

438
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
I washed thoroughly afterwards

439
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,240
and I sang Old MacDonald while I washed

440
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,360
so that I made sure that I did it for the appropriate length of time.

441
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
I used two squirts of soap.

442
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,680
I got front and back because there's a wraparound effect.

443
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:11,920
Yeah.

444
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,160
Yeah, and that is-

445
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,760
Old MacDonald is also the appropriate amount of time to smell someone's dick.

446
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,400
There's a lot of notes you're going to miss if you're not really in there.

447
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,480
My girlfriend and I have been together for three months

448
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
and best friends for five years.

449
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
She is a, quote, curvy girl.

450
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
It's definitely got her sexy right,

451
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,560
but has a hard time seeing it herself.

452
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,760
How can I help her become more confident and comfortable with her body?

453
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,520
Well, listen, man, if you can crack this one,

454
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
you let every guy on Earth know

455
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,960
and you just send that around like an email or like a big kind of chain.

456
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,320
Write a book.

457
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
Become a millionaire.

458
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
Write a book and get rich, Jay.

459
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,600
Like, will you gonna come to us and have us fix this one?

460
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
Okay, done.

461
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Challenge accepted.

462
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,960
We'll fix it.

463
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,520
Like, I can't tell you how.

464
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,680
All I can tell you is that you cannot.

465
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:05,920
Like-

466
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,680
Wait, wait.

467
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever said.

468
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,480
What are you talking about?

469
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
You can't tell him how.

470
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
You're just gonna tell him that he can't.

471
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah, exactly.

472
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Thanks, drunk, unsupportive dad.

473
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm not gonna tell you how-

474
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Now go get me another beer.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
I'm not gonna tell you how to please a woman.

476
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
I'm gonna tell you that you can't.

477
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
You will just fail.

478
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,920
You are a failure.

479
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,640
Okay.

480
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,120
The thing is, is the more that you try, like the-

481
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,080
Okay, here's my advice.

482
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,680
Actions speak louder than words.

483
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,480
And the more you say, no, you're pretty, you're pretty, you're pretty,

484
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,240
the more she's going to shut off to your compliments

485
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
because you're gonna start to lose the-

486
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, God, yes.

487
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,200
Your compliments depreciate in value the more you drop them.

488
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
So make her feel attractive by being attracted to her, you know?

489
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Like, compliment her when she is dressed up, hug her, kiss her,

490
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,400
do all those things that make a woman feel pretty.

491
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
And that's all I got so far.

492
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,360
See, I think-

493
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
Let's go back and explore the other thing.

494
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
What's your best move?

495
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,200
Explore the fact that if you use too many compliments,

496
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
they're completely without value.

497
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,800
That's not a joke.

498
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,360
That's for real.

499
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,680
So what you do is you only compliment her once a year.

500
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
You wait, you target it strategically.

501
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,280
Okay.

502
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,360
Like a nuclear strike.

503
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,200
And you wait for it until she's real down in the dumps.

504
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,960
Then you'd say, hey, looking mighty sexy.

505
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,720
How about taking it a little bit further?

506
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,800
Just rays of light will shoot out of her.

507
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't speak to her at all except for that one compliment.

508
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,680
I like this.

509
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,240
Move out.

510
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Move out and only visit her.

511
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,240
Have her locked in prison-

512
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,880
Once a year.

513
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,000
In a serious note, if you give her compliments in reaction

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,560
to her saying that she looks bad or she's-

515
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh, you're fucked.

516
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,720
Oh, no, that's cheating.

517
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,400
She's never gonna buy it.

518
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Try to sympathize without agreeing.

519
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,760
And if you can figure that one out, I will buy your second book.

520
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,120
How to sympathize without agreeing.

521
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,440
How to sympathize without agreeing.

522
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,800
On another serious note-

523
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,680
Men are from Mars.

524
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,600
Another serious note.

525
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,640
You should probably fire a pair of sweatpants to say juicy on them.

526
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,720
It seems so popular.

527
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,320
I was at the grocery store on Valentine's Day,

528
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,320
and I saw a bouquet that had a card and was full of Slim Fast bars

529
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,560
and a balloon that said, happy Valentine's Day.

530
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,120
No, that's-

531
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,560
So don't do that.

532
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,600
Hey, guys?

533
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,320
Hey, guys?

534
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
Absolutely don't do that.

535
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,600
Free advice.

536
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,320
Don't do that.

537
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,880
That's inappropriate.

538
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,600
I don't think that's gonna work out for you as good as you think it's gonna.

539
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,440
Griffin.

540
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,600
Yeah, you know what I know what you need.

541
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
You know what I need.

542
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,000
That was weird.

543
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,920
Kind of depressed that we didn't work smell your dick into that last question,

544
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,480
but whatever.

545
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
This one was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

546
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,200
Thank you, Johnny B.

547
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,680
Johnny B.

548
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Questioner, which is good.

549
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,960
Who asks?

550
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,280
Do you suspect that girls are actually evolved cats?

551
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, yeah.

552
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Yes, every day.

553
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,880
Cats evolving into girls over millions of years of evolution.

554
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,680
Why do girls and cats have uncanny similarities?

555
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:34,960
Please.

556
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Well, I mean, it's number one, pussy.

557
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Sorry, that was stupid.

558
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Hi, Nani.

559
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,800
Go ahead, Griffin.

560
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
That's, I mean, that's it.

561
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,360
That's it.

562
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
That's the extent of his question.

563
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,600
They don't have-

564
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,960
He doesn't list the similarities that he's coming up with his crazy brain?

565
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,680
No, but I mean-

566
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,200
They both like milk.

567
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,720
Look, everybody has them, right?

568
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,000
You think of cat, a cat, cat and dog are the two, the binary domesticated animals, right?

569
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Sure.

570
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
And so dogs are dudes and cats are ladies.

571
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,000
Okay, cool.

572
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Am I the only person who thinks that?

573
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,320
Am I-

574
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,600
No, no, no, no, no.

575
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,040
We've all thought that before.

576
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Sometimes, and sometimes you look at a cat and you think,

577
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
I can kind of see why some guys would think this is attractive.

578
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,520
Like you find yourself attracted to cats by extension.

579
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,200
We've talked about how sexy cats are before just because they want it.

580
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,000
No, they don't.

581
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,720
But they do.

582
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,680
But they don't.

583
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,000
You know that Justin Timberlake song was originally,

584
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm bringing sexy cats is what it was originally.

585
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,400
Like he was coming to the party.

586
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
He's bringing the sexiest cats.

587
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
Justin, we're throwing a really weird sex orgy.

588
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,480
I'll bring some sexy cats.

589
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,440
Yep, yep.

590
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,680
Timberland knows what's up.

591
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,320
He's a dog.

592
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,880
Did you know that Timberland is a dog?

593
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,160
He produces records with a pause.

594
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,800
He's a dog.

595
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,320
It's true.

596
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,600
I can't wait for that Photoshop.

597
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,560
JT bringing sexy cats with his dog.

598
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:13,920
See, all I can picture him is looking like John Candy in Spaceballs with the big tail on his ears.

599
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
JT, that last verse you dropped was so fresh.

600
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,600
I'm going to hump your leg.

601
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,320
Timberland, the dog.

602
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,600
You know what I bet his favorite rap crew he wishes he could join?

603
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,280
Oh no.

604
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,560
The Rough Riders.

605
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:34,960
Okay.

606
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,040
I was going to say Lil Bow Wow.

607
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,160
Oh, fuck.

608
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,640
Yeah, I was going to say the Dog Pound.

609
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah, there's a lot of dog rappers.

610
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,160
I'll make you a list.

611
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,800
Have you ever noticed how all rappers have evolved from dogs?

612
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,040
That's true too.

613
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,040
I have a question.

614
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,760
Can you give me some answers?

615
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,560
There have to be some answers that have been supplied.

616
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,960
Let's see.

617
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,600
Let's see, that would make men either smelly monkeys, pigs, or dogs.

618
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,320
I think girls got the better end of the deal in that case.

619
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,720
Lol.

620
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,320
Meow.

621
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Meow.

622
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,880
I mean, that's it.

623
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,720
Everybody's just saying that men are pigs or dogs.

624
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,400
Really?

625
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,120
Here's the thing.

626
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
These people know that it's not true, right?

627
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Why do they reinforce these people's crazy?

628
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I'm telling you, it's the natural bias of people to give a gender to dogs and cats,

629
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
and that cats are female and dogs are male.

630
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,520
No, I understand that.

631
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,640
I have no problem with that.

632
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:36,960
But what I'm saying is-

633
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
I have a problem with it, kind of.

634
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,280
Yeah.

635
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,080
This person who's like, you know that female human beings have evolved from a completely

636
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,800
different species than male human beings have evolved from.

637
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,080
That's the crazy part.

638
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,960
You know that that is scientifically impossible, right?

639
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,880
Like, it's one thing to be like, this gender has similarities to this animal, their attitude,

640
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,680
but it's another to be like, is it possible they've evolved from others?

641
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,160
No.

642
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I need to establish that Griffin knows this, so then we can kind of move on to the question

643
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,960
asker.

644
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,760
Griffin, do you believe that women are evolved from cats?

645
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,320
Answer me.

646
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,440
No.

647
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Do you?

648
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,280
Yes.

649
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,800
See?

650
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,600
I knew it.

651
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,240
I knew it.

652
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,400
You monster.

653
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,480
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

654
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,520
Yeah, you just work.

655
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
This is how it starts, you know?

656
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,200
Cats are sexy and ladies are sexy.

657
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,920
You like them both.

658
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,560
Like both.

659
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,720
I'm allergic to women.

660
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,360
Or at least that's been his excuse for all these years.

661
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,920
We don't know.

662
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,000
Don't know what the reality of the situation is.

663
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
Women like to poop in gravel, which is weird.

664
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Next question.

665
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,480
I'm kind of a hipster.

666
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
Sardines.

667
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,960
Sardines is another one that women love.

668
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,840
Dishes of milk.

669
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm kind of a hipster and for a couple of years now I've been sporting a full mustache.

670
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I like it and I think it suits me.

671
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,520
However, I'm also gay and recently a couple of guys I've been interested in have explicitly

672
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
torn me down on the basis of my mustache.

673
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,600
I feel a bit conflicted.

674
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,680
If I shave my mustache, I might have a better chance of men, but I'm worried at this point

675
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,840
I'll be sacrificing some part of my personality in order to impress guys who might only be

676
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
attracted to me for shallow superficial reasons.

677
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,040
But maybe that's what dating is all about and I'm just being too stuck up.

678
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,440
Frustrated with facial hair.

679
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,680
Bad.

680
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,880
So big.

681
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,920
I'm going to break this story wide open.

682
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,080
If a guy turns you down because you have a mustache, he's not really gay.

683
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,560
Think about it.

684
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,800
Why don't you want a mustache there?

685
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,040
It's so you can pretend you're kissing a lady.

686
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,240
They're fake gay.

687
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,520
They're fomo-sexuals.

688
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,080
Trust me.

689
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,960
How?

690
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,160
No, if you don't want a mustache there, you ain't gay.

691
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Your aim is so true.

692
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,960
I know, I know.

693
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,400
I'm spitting fire here, but it's all straight from the heart.

694
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,160
I can't, I also, I can't wrap my fucking mind around this because who is everybody's favorite

695
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,960
gay of all time?

696
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,960
Charles Nelson Reilly.

697
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,200
Nope.

698
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,400
No?

699
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,280
Really think.

700
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,840
Everybody's.

701
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,960
Tom, oh, well, Neil Patrick Harris.

702
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,920
Everybody's favorite.

703
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,880
Or maybe Tim Gunn.

704
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,200
I have a lot of favorite gays.

705
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,440
I can't.

706
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
He doesn't have to be alive.

707
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,280
Okay.

708
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
In fact, that's a hint.

709
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,880
He's totes, he's totes dead.

710
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,600
Tom Selleck.

711
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
Where are we going with this?

712
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
I don't know where you're going.

713
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,360
Hitler?

714
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,000
Like I'm trying to think of mustachioed homosexual men.

715
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,560
Help me out.

716
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,480
Freddie Mercury.

717
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Freddie Mercury is up there.

718
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:38,800
Yeah.

719
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,960
Wicked big mustache on that dude.

720
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,800
Like quite a, quite a mustache.

721
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,560
He, he, he had a Hagar thing going for him in his later years.

722
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,520
Lots of people don't know.

723
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,160
Freddie Mercury's mustache actually outlived him by three weeks.

724
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,920
That's that's true.

725
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,040
They couldn't bury him.

726
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,080
I'm going to throw out that it's not because of your mustache, but because you refer to

727
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,600
yourself as kind of a hipster.

728
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,640
You think that's the bigger problem than the mustache?

729
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,680
Yes.

730
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,800
I, I think that you need to go after some real gay guys who like a big mouth full of

731
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:13,280
mustache and like not more of these, no more of these FOMOs. I'm done with them.

732
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,600
Like you, like you need a, a real gay man who likes hair up there.

733
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,480
If you don't like the hair up there, then what are you even doing?

734
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,760
That's such a cool look.

735
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,440
It's such a cool look.

736
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,360
The mustache.

737
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,760
I mean, is it well tended?

738
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,080
Do you have-

739
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,120
Yeah, that's the thing.

740
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,800
Is it above your lip?

741
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
Is it above your lip?

742
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,880
Is it below your lips?

743
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,280
What?

744
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,240
Because if you have a mustache on your cheek, that might be part of the problem.

745
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
I don't know what you're saying right now.

746
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,200
That's a sideburn, I think.

747
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't know.

748
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,360
I don't understand that.

749
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,600
You're talking about like a full on Snidely.

750
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Sure.

751
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,920
You gotta just get the, get a gentlemanly mustache.

752
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Something well groomed.

753
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,040
Not like a, not a Snidely, not a Wombroom.

754
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,640
Just something, something classy and well tended.

755
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,600
Like a topiary on your face.

756
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,640
A face topiary.

757
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,200
Is that, is the ideal situation is a face topiary?

758
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,760
If you're living your life as a mustachioed man, I say you live it.

759
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
And don't change for anybody.

760
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,080
If you think that mustache is working for you, fine.

761
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,160
Now, you do raise an interesting point.

762
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,080
I mean, the, one of the main points of your visage is to draw people in.

763
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
To attract the people you want to attract.

764
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,040
And if your mustache isn't working that for you, maybe it's not working as well as you think.

765
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,840
But-

766
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,640
He says it suits him.

767
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,360
But hey, if you think it suits you, then you wait until you find the person that loves you

768
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,200
for the mustache that you have.

769
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,360
At the end of the day, your appearance is about attracting other people,

770
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,800
but you should also be happy with it.

771
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,920
And you're, if you're happy with the mustache, then, you know.

772
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,160
Yeah.

773
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,520
My question is, how can I make my roommates stop doing stupid shit without being a bitch about it?

774
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,480
I don't want to get angry with them because they're nice girls.

775
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,360
And I don't want to leave some kind of stupid passive aggressive note.

776
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,120
Love, Jenny Lee from Hawaii.

777
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,360
We have listeners in Hawaii?

778
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
Who can get upset down there?

779
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,000
There's an answer in between that.

780
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,320
What's that?

781
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Do you think where you don't have to get angry or leave passive aggressive notes?

782
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
You just have to bring it up.

783
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,520
Like-

784
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,600
Yeah, like, um, aloha, roommate.

785
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,360
Um, I don't, that's the only fucking Hawaiian phrase I know.

786
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
Um, mukalakehiki, come on, you wanna lay me fast?

787
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,760
Spoil the hollow.

788
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,080
Gungu chichi, gungu chichi, gungu chichi, gungu chichi.

789
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,640
Uh, uh, I had a, I knew a girl in college that had the vest, the best thing for this ever.

790
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,640
She had bags of mini marshmallows, and whenever her roommates would leave,

791
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,760
would leave messes and not clean them up, she would coat the messes in mini marshmallows.

792
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,880
What, what purpose did that serve?

793
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,560
Because then you have to deal with it.

794
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,480
You can't, it's not a regular mess.

795
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,280
Then it's the kind of mess that has mini marshmallows all over it.

796
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
That's awesome.

797
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,760
If they left the bathroom sink dirty, mini marshmallows.

798
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,920
And you would know, like, ah, you got me.

799
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,200
I did leave the sink dirty.

800
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,560
Because you can live with some plates here and there,

801
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,000
but what you can't live with are plates with mini marshmallows sitting on them.

802
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,560
Because then people come over and there are so many questions,

803
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,680
and you have to, your, your, your filthiness gets right up in your face.

804
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Why didn't you finish your mini marshmallows?

805
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,520
That's a good question.

806
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,240
I don't know.

807
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,800
How much money was this woman spending on mini marshmallows though?

808
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,640
No price too high.

809
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,040
That's what I'm saying.

810
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I mean, there is.

811
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,360
No?

812
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,640
Well, okay, there probably is, but.

813
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,400
Uh, I, that is such a hard.

814
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,200
They're at 60 bucks a barrel for mini marshmallows now.

815
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,560
I keep them all in my larder.

816
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,240
Uh, I, generally, that's a tough situation cohabitating with people.

817
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,360
Griffin has actually been doing it more recently than, than I have.

818
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,600
How do you guys deal with conflicts, Griffin?

819
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm really good friends with my roommates, and we,

820
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,320
if we need somebody to do something, we just do it.

821
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,400
Yeah, honestly, I think it's the kind of thing where the open

822
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,760
communication takes care of the problems.

823
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,440
Like the more open you are to say, Hey, could you do the dishes?

824
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,120
Cause they've been sitting there for a while.

825
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Like if you just don't say anything, it'll fester.

826
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,720
And like, that's why you feel like you either have to be

827
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,600
passive aggressive or angry because those problems are just

828
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,360
like sitting there festering.

829
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,160
Just bring it up.

830
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,880
That is the problem.

831
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,360
If you go, if you go too long without talking about it, then you

832
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,080
start to vilify the roommates in your mind.

833
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,800
And like that has a two pronged effect of one, you don't want to

834
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,040
talk to them and it ruins the relationship.

835
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,720
And two, it makes even things that aren't so bad, seem bad

836
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,960
because you make them part of this bigger pattern that they

837
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,680
won't reverse.

838
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,800
And sometimes, like, I know that when I was in college and,

839
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,640
you know, to present, I'm the type of roommate that when it

840
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,720
comes to cleaning stuff, I just don't see it.

841
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,920
Like it just doesn't occur to me.

842
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,880
It doesn't bother me.

843
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,720
And so it usually takes someone saying, and I've tried to get

844
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,920
better about it, but it usually takes someone saying, hey, by

845
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,400
the way, could you take care of this thing that's been here

846
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,880
for a week?

847
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
And I go, oh, yeah, I didn't even think about that.

848
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,440
My bad.

849
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,880
So it might not be that your roommates are being, you know,

850
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
messy on purpose.

851
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,440
They might just be messy people.

852
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,800
So let's boil this down.

853
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,120
Okay.

854
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,760
You get one warning and then many marshmallows.

855
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah.

856
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,360
And then many marshmallows.

857
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,000
That seems like a pretty good standard operating procedure.

858
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
And they know what that means.

859
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,000
There's no there's no need for ambiguity.

860
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
You know, they know they know what that symbol is.

861
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
I think everybody understands many marshmallows on your shit

862
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,720
means clean up your shit.

863
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,040
Yeah.

864
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,360
I would also suggest, Jenny Lee, this is just something to

865
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,720
try out if there's a mess that and I'm assuming that's what

866
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,520
you're talking about.

867
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,200
Just clean it up yourself.

868
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,880
It's bothering you so much.

869
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,080
Just clean it up.

870
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,800
And well, see, but that seems and then when your roommate

871
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,320
notice notices what you can't do in that spirit, it can't be

872
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,520
about I did this to teach you a lesson.

873
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,840
It should come from a place of like it was bothering me.

874
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,360
So I cleaned it up like hopefully that kind of good

875
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,320
example will will be a more positive influence in the

876
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,120
roommates than I mean.

877
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,840
What if she's really busy like hanging out on the beach with

878
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,680
Johnny Tsunami or like taking ukulele lessons or applying

879
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,640
banana boat to herself or eating pineapple or spit roasting

880
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,320
a pig or you're doing much better at this than you did at

881
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,240
the the the note gag.

882
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,600
I just wanted to let you know.

883
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,320
Thank you.

884
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,920
You really have a lot more going on here.

885
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,360
Is that racist to Hawaiians?

886
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,240
Can you?

887
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,600
That's not like a thing you can do.

888
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
I know they're still American.

889
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah, maybe before they were incorporated.

890
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,200
But what's up?

891
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
You can be insensitive, I think.

892
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,320
Oh, well, yeah.

893
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,280
But I love what is our bias?

894
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,200
Our bias is that you live in paradise.

895
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Yeah, you live in heaven on Earth.

896
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,160
Sorry to pay you with such a broad brush, assholes.

897
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm going to do a Yahoo.

898
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
This one was sent in by Karen D.

899
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,240
Thank you, Karen D.

900
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

901
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, man, I'm so bad about not reading these ahead of time.

902
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,960
Saki Hart, Kio Soma, Dark Mousy and Ronnie V.

903
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,960
That's one name.

904
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,280
I think it's a group of people that have gotten together.

905
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
Don't understand how usernames work.

906
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,240
To to just team up.

907
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,040
They form like a Yahoo Answers user super group.

908
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,880
Okay, stupid Voltron.

909
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,240
Yeah, like the damn awful.

910
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
Damn Yankees asks.

911
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,260
Yeah.

912
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,520
Which name do you like the best?

913
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm trying to name the horses for my story.

914
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
I've decided on names for all but one of them.

915
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,880
The horse I haven't decided on is a male silvery gray wild horse.

916
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,120
He's very fast and very strong.

917
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,560
Here are some names I'm considering.

918
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:52,640
Silver Wish, Phantom Sky, Phantom Dawn, Drifting Castle, Spirit Catcher, Wild Wind.

919
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,760
Which name do you think is the best and do you have any suggestions?

920
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,260
Thanks.

921
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,320
Those are all such great names.

922
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,120
No, they're not.

923
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,360
They're shitty because of all the animals on the planet that you get to name.

924
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,760
Horses are the fucking best.

925
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,200
Horses are the best and you have named them terribly.

926
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,000
What kind of horse names do you like?

927
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,240
You want it to be something a little more like a tougher sort of vibe?

928
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,800
Is that what you're saying?

929
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,560
I want it to be like Papa's Delicate Condition.

930
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,760
Racehorse names?

931
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,320
Like Big Steed maybe is a good one.

932
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,840
No, she's not thinking outside the box.

933
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,400
What about this?

934
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,960
Let me hit you with this.

935
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,320
Princess in the Pants.

936
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,120
Fast Fast.

937
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,080
Sorry?

938
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,040
Fast Fast?

939
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,080
Fast Fast?

940
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,960
Fast Fast.

941
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,560
Justin, have you ever been to a horse race?

942
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,600
Do you not know how they-

943
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,960
I do not know what a horse is.

944
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
A Little Sister's Big Shoe.

945
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,640
Tumblin Aloysius.

946
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,720
Little Sister's Big Secret.

947
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,800
Another one that you could do.

948
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,680
I think if you're going to name a horse, it's got to be one word and it can't be a combination

949
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,520
of two kind of gay things to make a super gay thing.

950
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,080
It has to be like Domination.

951
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
Domination?

952
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,480
Yes.

953
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,000
Domination.

954
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,640
Domination.

955
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,440
Freedom Suit.

956
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,120
That's good.

957
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,760
What?

958
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,800
I just pictured a horse in a spangly like red, white, and blue suit and it made me really happy.

959
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
See, I would read a fantasy novel about horses if they had names like

960
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,560
The Chancellor's Parapet, but we're not working with things like that.

961
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,440
Maybe Justin Timberlake would be a good name for a horse.

962
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,240
Justin Timberhorse?

963
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,560
Yeah, what about just Steven?

964
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,480
Why can't horses have regular adult names like Tim Gunn or Steven?

965
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,960
Trevor.

966
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Neil Patrick Harris.

967
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
This is my horse, Freddie Mercury.

968
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,240
He's America's favorite homosexual horse and he's no fun with it.

969
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,920
Check out his sweet horse mustache.

970
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,200
Check out his horse stash.

971
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,960
He's got some oats in there.

972
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,720
He's got a face mane.

973
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,800
A mustache is basically just a face mane.

974
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,120
Silver Phantom.

975
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,240
Silver Striker.

976
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,200
Silver Heart.

977
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,160
Silver Blood.

978
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,880
White Prince.

979
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,560
Moon Lord.

980
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
Silver Eye.

981
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,320
Wild Eye.

982
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,280
Magic Orb.

983
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,200
Like, are these the answers that people are giving them?

984
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,840
Yeah.

985
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,400
Did anyone give like a grown-up adult name for a horse?

986
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,080
Silver Pants.

987
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,520
Why not a simple name like Axel, Robbie, Toby, Ryken?

988
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,920
Hey, Robbie.

989
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,720
Robbie, you wanna get fucked up?

990
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,120
Robbie.

991
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,560
When he gets older, he can be Robert.

992
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,840
That's nice.

993
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,800
Robbie, it's Chantam.

994
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,920
I got some steel reserve.

995
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,040
Let's do this.

996
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
Robbie, we're gonna go hit up Peckers.

997
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,400
Get some bitches.

998
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,240
Robbie, I thought we were gonna go to Peckers and Timmy fuck some bitches tonight.

999
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,160
No, I don't think that that is how Robbie the horse's friends act.

1000
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,280
I don't think that that...

1001
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,840
I think Robbie the horse is lonely.

1002
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,240
Robbie the horse seems like he lives with his mom still, right?

1003
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,240
Robbie.

1004
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,920
We have to put Robbie down.

1005
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,080
Never moved out.

1006
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,280
It's kind of sad.

1007
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,040
We have to destroy Robbie.

1008
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,560
Axel, though?

1009
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,440
You know what I love?

1010
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,680
What?

1011
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,160
You don't kill a horse.

1012
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,160
You destroy it.

1013
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,080
The term for putting a horse down, which is like the saddest thing ever.

1014
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm not making light of that, except I totally am.

1015
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,040
You destroy them.

1016
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,320
You throw the horse into the fires of Mount Doom.

1017
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,480
That's basically what we're saying.

1018
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,280
I guess it sounds inhumane to be like, oh, my horse can't walk.

1019
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,360
So I just like I totally emptied a clip in his dome.

1020
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,400
I popped a bullet in his bubble goose.

1021
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,040
You don't do that.

1022
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,000
That's not enough.

1023
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,200
That's not what he deserves.

1024
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,720
He deserves to be destroyed.

1025
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,880
Oh, I obliterated that fucking pony.

1026
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,520
Hey, Justin.

1027
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
Me and Robbie went to Peckers last night.

1028
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,480
Just got destroyed.

1029
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,200
Why are we riding towards Mordor, Justin?

1030
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,400
Well, Robbie, Justin, are you going to pitch me into the fires of Mount Doom?

1031
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,560
God, this is awkward.

1032
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,480
I do need to destroy you.

1033
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,680
Like, the more you say it, the more ridiculous it sounds like you're like talking about your

1034
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,880
your robot best friend who turned evil, like what they have, like I must destroy him.

1035
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
The horse shall be no more.

1036
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,640
Like there's a button underneath their saddle.

1037
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,960
If you push it, it just sends horse meat everywhere.

1038
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,520
Like self-destruct button.

1039
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,360
I love you, Secretariat, but I'm going to I'm going to fucking give you like you're done.

1040
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,040
I'm going to hit you with a rocket launcher, Robbie.

1041
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,540
I'm sorry.

1042
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,840
You're not fast.

1043
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
You're not fast enough in the race.

1044
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,360
You didn't do a good job in the race.

1045
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,920
So where does glue figure into it?

1046
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,480
Is that anti-plane?

1047
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,600
I don't know, because when I hear destroyed, I fucking destroyed that horse.

1048
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,040
I was going to make glue out of that horse.

1049
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,080
How did you do this?

1050
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,720
Out of this ash.

1051
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,400
I was going to invent a way to make glue from a horse.

1052
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,760
I don't know.

1053
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,440
Ah, horses.

1054
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,760
What big fucking stupid animals was like, I broke my leg.

1055
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,040
Now I have to be destroyed.

1056
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm happily engaged.

1057
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,480
Twenty five year old stay at home mom.

1058
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,120
So every few months I go out to the club with my girls.

1059
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,800
I generally just go go to just let loose and go crazy dancing and just have a great time.

1060
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,880
But then a creeper will come up and start rubbing his nastiness on me.

1061
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,000
How do I originally read this?

1062
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,280
Rubbing his nastiness on me, I originally read that as rubbing his sadness on me,

1063
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,880
which is probably pretty accurate.

1064
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,880
How do I get guts to stop?

1065
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,440
Whoa, I think she meant guys, but I want to go with guts.

1066
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,120
How do I get guts to stop doing that?

1067
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,800
And how do I get them to go dance with my single friends instead?

1068
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,520
Stop wearing your sweatpants that say juicy.

1069
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,040
Yeah, those are those are like catnip, mannip.

1070
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,920
No, not catnip.

1071
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,160
I guess dognip because it drives the guys in.

1072
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:06,960
And so technically speaking, you know, exceptionally low voice mustache, all the classic moves.

1073
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,000
You really should get the girl if she's interested to start dancing with the guy.

1074
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,040
Like if you get your single friend, dance up on him and then you just kind of like in one move,

1075
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,160
sort of peel off, then he'll get the message.

1076
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,720
I think at least you could roll up a newspaper and pop that dog on the nose.

1077
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,320
You bad puppy.

1078
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,200
Get out of here.

1079
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,760
No.

1080
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Some of us are trying to get juicy up in the speeds.

1081
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,160
Put some peanut butter on your friend's bottoms, I guess.

1082
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:32,960
Yeah.

1083
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,160
You think that would work?

1084
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,360
I feel like I have less of an unders-

1085
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,720
A lot of episodes we record and I feel like I've talked some things through

1086
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,640
and maybe understand the world a little bit better by helping others.

1087
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,440
This is one of those episodes where I feel like I understand shit less than I did just 50 short

1088
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,160
minutes ago.

1089
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,120
Yeah, I mean, dogs are cats literally and people are and horses can be destroyed.

1090
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,440
Horses must be destroyed.

1091
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,000
Do you think there's one button that interconnects all horses that if you just

1092
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,480
flipped it, it'd be like, ah, no.

1093
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,200
The horse of President Obama has control over it.

1094
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,440
Who?

1095
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,040
President Obama.

1096
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,840
Obama's got the internet turned off switch and he has to kill all horses button.

1097
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,280
Not kill, sorry, sorry.

1098
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,640
Destroy.

1099
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,160
Destroy.

1100
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,800
If you tie the horses together, it's basically WMD.

1101
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,000
A winning of mass destruction.

1102
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,400
How are we supposed to answer this fucking question, though?

1103
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,680
Because I don't think the three of us have ever been the type of person.

1104
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,640
I don't know that I know any of the type of dudes who go up to girls behind

1105
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,600
at bars and like dance on them.

1106
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,200
Like, aren't those guys like-

1107
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,800
Baiting someone.

1108
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,640
100% creepers except you get like 1% like Patrick Dempsey's.

1109
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,240
Like Patrick Dempsey's a miracle.

1110
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,120
You don't want to pass them off on your friends.

1111
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,040
I would say if one starts dancing with you, you just kind of just

1112
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,280
ignore them and eventually look away.

1113
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,240
Isn't that why you go to clubs like big groups of girls together so they can like

1114
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,640
form ranks like a pride of lions.

1115
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,720
They just all get together to protect each other from the creepers.

1116
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,280
Make a phalanx and shatter him.

1117
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,680
I tried to dance on some girls at a bar once, but

1118
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,640
but they had a really tight nickel package that just-

1119
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,440
Their 4-3 was just too much where you could handle it.

1120
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,800
God damn, I hope that's a defensive maneuver, not an offensive one.

1121
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,120
Two sports gags in a row.

1122
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,080
One of them I worked.

1123
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,840
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but real quick housekeeping stuff.

1124
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,280
Of course, the Maximum Fun Network has the Pledge Drive coming up.

1125
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,760
We're going to have some really cool things to give away to people who help support us

1126
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,640
and all the other great max fun shows, so keep an eye out for that.

1127
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,680
It starts next Monday.

1128
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,120
Next Monday.

1129
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,840
So get your hearts, your minds, and your wallets ready.

1130
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,600
Because it's going to be big.

1131
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,400
You're going to want to give.

1132
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,120
It's going to be special.

1133
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,880
Listening parties.

1134
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,880
If you get four or more people together to listen to the show,

1135
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,160
if you're going to be doing that,

1136
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,400
send us an email with their names and all the details you want to share,

1137
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,240
and we will record you a personal message to begin your party.

1138
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,120
You get one for your first party and then for every 10 after that.

1139
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,240
Jeff Monloch, just hit number fucking 20.

1140
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,520
Have we even done 20 episodes of this stupid show?

1141
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:28,960
I don't think so.

1142
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,160
I don't know how he's been doing it.

1143
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,880
He's rigged.

1144
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,600
Rigged the thing.

1145
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,760
But Maximum Fun forums.

1146
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,080
If you want to go talk about the new episode, just go to maximumfun.org and click on forums

1147
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:46,960

1148
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,920
You can also talk about all the other great shows on the Maximum Fun network

1149
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,840
that you should all go listen to.

1150
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,000
Jordan and Jesse Go, Sound of Young America.

1151
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,600
Stop podcasting yourself.

1152
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah.

1153
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,720
It's a very special Jordan and Jesse Go this week.

1154
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:58,960
Yeah.

1155
00:47:59,520 --> 00:47:59,920
Yeah.

1156
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,240
And our congratulations on that.

1157
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,840
Travis is also pregnant.

1158
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,280
Travis is pregnant.

1159
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,760
Yay.

1160
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,800
Wow, super pregnant.

1161
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,080
With our joke baby.

1162
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:16,400
Speaking of pregnant, Teresa Thorne, if you are interested in purchasing a message on

1163
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,840
our show, either personal or business, you can contact Teresa Thorne.

1164
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,080
Teresa at maximumfun.org.

1165
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,000
That's Teresa with an H.

1166
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Those are $100 for a personal message, $150 for a business message.

1167
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,160
We promise to make them funny and interesting and draw people to you.

1168
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,960
Well, I can't promise to draw you to.

1169
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,880
What if they sell like hatred or something?

1170
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,120
It'll draw me to you in like a sexy, like a sexy way.

1171
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:47,600
If you want to ask those questions, mbnbam at gmail.com or mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

1172
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,400
Both go to the same place.

1173
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,000
Get us on FormSpring.

1174
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,320
FormSpring.me forward slash mbnbam.

1175
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,600
We have a voicemail line.

1176
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,560
Two zero three mbnbam one.

1177
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,680
Yeah.

1178
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,800
You can follow us on Twitter and we always encourage people to tweet about the show.

1179
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,880
Hashtag mbnbam.

1180
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,280
Of course, we have people who are always out there spreading the good word about mbnbam.

1181
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,160
And honestly, without those people, we would not have a show.

1182
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,880
I think special, special thanks has to go to Osman Mariko, who.

1183
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,600
Oh, my God.

1184
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,440
Like every tweet that dude does.

1185
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,080
It's about us.

1186
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,560
And like, does that make your Twitter feed better?

1187
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,360
Yeah, I think so.

1188
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,960
Yeah, probably.

1189
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,360
So I also like Michelle Mittens and she basically summed up our show in about 20 words.

1190
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,040
You know what?

1191
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,600
I think she was retweeting Osman Mariko there.

1192
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,440
So they're blowing it up.

1193
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,080
There you go.

1194
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,480
Blowing up.

1195
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,840
But thank you to everybody so much for all the tweets and everything.

1196
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,960
We really do appreciate it.

1197
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,800
But anyway, that's all for our nonsense.

1198
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:01,920
Griffin.

1199
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,640
That was really fast.

1200
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,640
Well, I'm trying to do it better because I don't want people to think we sold out.

1201
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,200
Should we talk about that new podcast?

1202
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,880
Which one?

1203
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,560
Nerdist has a new podcast.

1204
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,520
I don't want to give.

1205
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,720
I don't want to give those Ham and Eggers.

1206
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,680
No credibility.

1207
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,480
Ham and Eggers.

1208
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,960
Apparently Nerdist has a new podcast where people send them questions.

1209
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,240
How great idea, guys.

1210
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,080
Where'd you come up with it?

1211
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,000
Questions and answers?

1212
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,880
I've never met him.

1213
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,760
I feel like he's creeping on my style.

1214
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,880
Maybe just a little.

1215
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,400
He's just chomping your flavor.

1216
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,680
He's chomping my flavor.

1217
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,680
I know he has like a billion Twitter followers and he's actually a super nice and funny guy.

1218
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,720
But quit creeping, Chris Hardwick.

1219
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,080
Tell him we got beef, everybody.

1220
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,000
Go to Twitter and tell him.

1221
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,920
Just when we squashed that stop podcasting yourself beef, we got a new flavor.

1222
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,160
Basically the one we created for ourselves.

1223
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,760
We squashed it in like a week.

1224
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,040
And then Nerdist has to swoop up and beef it.

1225
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,400
Try and cop our swagger.

1226
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,680
I say no, Chris Hardwick.

1227
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,840
This far, no farther.

1228
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,000
Griffin, give me what I need.

1229
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,760
This very final question was sent in by Craig Neiman.

1230
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,880
Yep, that's it.

1231
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,440
Got it.

1232
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,480
Take a try.

1233
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,240
Thanks, Craig Neiman.

1234
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user MK who asks,

1235
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:20,080
is it a good idea to use a sex doll as a martial arts striking and grappling dummy?

1236
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,360
I'm Justin McElroy.

1237
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,560
I'm Travis McElroy.

1238
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1239
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,760
This has been my brother, my brother, my brother.

1240
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,320
And me, this is your dad, school wear on the lips.
