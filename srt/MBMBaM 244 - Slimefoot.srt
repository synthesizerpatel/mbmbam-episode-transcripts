1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:50,160
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, and moi. I mean me. My name's Justin

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,760
McElroy. C'est magnifique. My name is Lord Travis McElroy. And I am Duncan Worschteshire.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:06,080
Hi, Duke. Hi, Duke of the Andes Mountains. If you haven't heard the news already,

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:16,800
the Max Fun Drive hit its initial goal of 2,000 donors with just the first week in the rearview

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,240
mirror of our jet skis. I believe you mean two milla donors. See, I'm using the metric system

10
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:34,160
now. Oh. So, in case you're wondering, we are now predicting that we will reach that goal

11
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,200
of the new goal of 4,000 donors and perhaps- Fuck that old goal. Fuck the old goal. Sorry

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,120
about the coarse language. We'll reach the goal of 4,000 donors in about three days,

13
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,320
and we'll reach 8,000 donors by the end of the drive, and we'll finally take our place

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,200
amongst the super elite rich. I've already gone looking at super yachts. I am saving up

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,240
all of my money to have the person who is mowing their lawn outside fucking constantly every time

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,800
I record any bit of audio medium, I will have them killed. And you'll be rich enough to get

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,240
away with it. Oh, absolutely. And if not- Oh, we will be murdering left and right. And if not,

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,880
I will go to badminton jail. What are you two going to miss the most about being able to relate

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:37,120
to our common listeners? Probably being able to eat the simpler cheeses. Yeah, me too. I used to

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,280
get down on some Kraft single slices, and that's just not- Oh my God. Can you guys PayPal me your

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
shares of the max fund money that you already have so I can have this person murdered, and I can get

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,360
one good audio quality recording for once in my goddamn life. Sorry, go ahead. What were you saying?

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Oh yeah, we're very rich. What are you going to miss, Justin? I'll miss, you know, right now I can

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,640
go to the store and I can look at a gallon of milk and tell you about what it costs. Once I'm among

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,880
the super rich- Because the price is on the thing underneath it. Once I'm among the super rich,

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,520
I imagine I'll pick up a gallon of milk and say, what, from cows? Because I'll only drink milk from-

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:28,560
Is this one gold? Can I get a single fucking cent? That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make a spin-off

28
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,560
show with my riches, and it's gonna be called Justin and Some Silent Guys, and I'll be able

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,240
to finish all my jokes and they'll just be like, two little Ed McManns just yucking it up. That's

30
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:48,640
my dream. But only then will you realize, like, I miss it. You'll start a sentence and finish it and

31
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
go, well, that was kind of depressing. Well, I didn't have an ending. I had no ending to that

32
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,600
sentence. I never do, and I rely on my profits to step in it. I can say with 100% confidence,

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,720
that will not happen. No way. No problems there. There would have been time now. Ocelot

34
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,760
milk was the punchline to that one, Griffin, if you could get it in post. Yeah, I've been getting

35
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,600
real good at that. That would be the thing we could actually do is pay someone to actually edit the

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,840
show. I am just gonna miss Hardee's, I think. They won't even let you in. No. Excuse me, sir,

37
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
you are far too wealthy to be in here. You're making everyone uncomfortable. The only person

38
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,600
as wealthy as you allow in here is Hardee, our owner and CEO. Ed Hardee, the owner.

39
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,720
You can go to Shardee's, which is a version of Hardee's that only serves Swiss chard and chardonnay.

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,760
That'd be a good lunch. God, what a good fucking joke. Do you guys want to do some advice? Oh,

41
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,360
thank you all for donating to Max Fun Drive. It's been a pretty killer response. It's sort of blown

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,600
away our wildest hopes and our craziest dreams, but we're still going. Does that mean that you

43
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,440
should get a free pass? No. No. It's time to knuckle down and get a donation in. Time to knuckle

44
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,320
buck. Time to knuckle buck. Time to triple deke us into the super rich. We're over 2,000 donors,

45
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,520
which is our original goal. If we get up to 2,500, Jesse and Jordan will... Are they gonna

46
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,880
record an actual episode out on... In a gross lake. In a gross, gross lake. Travis is gonna

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,480
get him a bim bam tattoo that the internet is still deciding on what that's gonna look like.

48
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,000
If we crush it, if we get to 4,000 donors, we're gonna do two bonus episodes of every show

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,040
on the network. So two extra bim bams and two extra adventure zones and two extra saw bones and

50
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,800
two extra bunker buddies is a lot of extra shit that we're gonna do over the course of the year

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,040
if we get to 4,000. So if you haven't donated and you need a reason to, that's a good one.

52
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
We already decided beforehand that one of our bonus episodes would be

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,440
the much, the much requested My Sister, My Sister and Me, where our wives get to answer an episode

54
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
full of advice. So if you've wanted that one, that would be just one of the many audio delights to

55
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,000
tickle your timpani, timpanic membranes. And not only that, but for every member who signs up or

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,760
upgrades above the 2,000 goal, so like it's already happening, Max Funds is gonna donate five meals to

57
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,560
hungry families in Los Angeles to the LA Regional Food Bank. So not only are you giving back to the

58
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
network, you're giving back to other people who need it way more than us. So it's an awesome thing

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,120
to do. The heat is on. We'll tell you all about how to donate, what you get for donating. Let me get

60
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,880
you a URL though real quick. Yeah, yeah. It's maximumfund.org. We'll tell you all about that

61
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,320
stuff, what you get, all that good stuff later on. But for now, it's vision. I think that's a word.

62
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,440
Wow, there we are inside the lawnmower now. Whoa, guys, watch out for the blades. Duck, duck, duck.

63
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,080
This is like Honey I Shrunk the Kids but in audio form. Right. It's a lot cheaper to produce is the

64
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,520
nice thing. That actually was how Honey I Shrunk the Kids first existed as a radio play in the 40s

65
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
when they adapted it into a movie. Not a lot of people know that. It's based on,

66
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,600
it came on between The Shadow and The George Burns Show. Look at these minuscule children.

67
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,280
It was originally called Sweetums. I enshrinkified these level adults we call our kids.

68
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,640
And they shortened it in the Crest Time Fun Happy Family Hour.

69
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,000
Welcome once again to the Crest Fun Time Happy Hour. For Sweetums, I enshrink the lovable adults

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,240
we call our children starring Cary Grant as Wayne Zelinsky and Deborah Winger.

71
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,120
The immortal vampire. The immortal Deborah Winger,

72
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,560
which I mean quite literally as Mrs. Zelinsky.

73
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,920
As Dracula. We don't know what we're doing. Honey, I've enshrunking the kids again.

74
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,440
Advice time is two minutes ago. It's half past advice. My sister-in-law is a notorious regifter

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,720
even of used items. She once gave me a partially burned candle, food from her own freezer,

76
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,720
and four half-used bottles of dishwashing soap as housewarming gifts. Even when a present is new,

77
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,840
she'll tell me it's a regift and why she didn't want it. Should I refuse her unwanted junk or

78
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,120
would that make me as rude as her? And that's from looking a regift horse in the mouth.

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
Why is she giving you her garbage?

80
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,320
Is your house shaped like a garbage can? Like that one woman's house was shaped like a boot?

81
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,120
Wait, do you mean the little old lady who lives in the shoe, Griffin?

82
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
Yeah, you a little old lady who lives in a basuda.

83
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
Are you Oscar the Grouch?

84
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,360
Are you Oscar the Grouch even? Did you even consider that?

85
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,840
Actually, at the end, it looks like the email address is oscarthegrouch at grinder.com.

86
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,000
At grinder.com? I don't think they offer domains. That is weird.

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,400
That's weird. He must be on the staff.

88
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,720
Let me check the ISP and let me just tap this into my CSI cyber search. Yeah, it says garbage can.

89
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,800
Grindr's run out of a garbage can by Oscar the Grouch?

90
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah, I've always suspected, but now I can confirm that Oscar the Grouch runs the website

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,600
and sex service Grindr out of a garbage can. This is the worst thing. I don't understand.

92
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
Even when a present is new, she'll tell you it's a regift and why she didn't want it.

93
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,600
Are they saying that when she buys this from a goddamn Lowe's and brings it to your house,

94
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
brand new, says, by the way-

95
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
She not only regifts.

96
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
New as in unopened.

97
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
Okay, so not a half-used bottle of goddamn dishwashing soap.

98
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,720
Do you think she's saying it like,

99
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,280
hey, this is actually such and so company, but I already had a toaster and I didn't need it,

100
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,160
so I thought you would like it? Or is she saying, I didn't want this. Do you want it?

101
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,400
There's some part of me that thinks in our consumption-addicted society,

102
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,120
there's something very useful about the idea of like, well, here, I'm not making use of this,

103
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,720
you make use of it, but really, it's just her garbage. So it's more like,

104
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,080
will you throw this away from me?

105
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,520
Well, that's the thing is like, I think, so in Cincinnati, there was a time where Theresa and

106
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,480
I had like three waffle irons because it was like one had been given to us-

107
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
Listen to Bragi McGee over here.

108
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
I know. Well, it's that Max Fund money. One had been given to us and the other two,

109
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,280
we had already purchased at thrift stores because one was square and one was round, right?

110
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,560
Oh, my God. Sorry, Travis, but that's not a normal thing. You're a mad man.

111
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,360
Well, I didn't do what my wife did. Say shit to her, Griffin.

112
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,240
She's a mad woman. I need one square waffle stacked atop a circular waffle.

113
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
Listen, Theresa and I deeply enjoy waffles.

114
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,160
I need a multi-shaped breakfast experience.

115
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,480
But my point being that if somebody had expressed desire, like if they had said,

116
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,440
like, I can't find a waffle iron anywhere, I could see where you could justifiably,

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,680
like for our wedding, one of our friends gave us a set of their cast iron because cast iron is

118
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,920
the thing that like you pass along and like it's something that's supposed to be given to other

119
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
people because it's already aged and treated and everything.

120
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
It's got that food stank deep in it already and you want it.

121
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,600
Exactly.

122
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
It takes a long time.

123
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
You do want that. It's a weird thing. It's the one thing,

124
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
cast iron skillets are the one thing in your house that you want dirty.

125
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
You want to leave some dirt on them.

127
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,240
That re-gifting makes sense. A half-burned candle and some used dishwashing soap bottles.

128
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
I think we've all been at a place with a candle where you're looking at a new candle and you're

129
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
like, where do I even start?

130
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,440
Right.

131
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,160
I wish there was an easy jumping off point with this candle. Some sort of origin.

132
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Like Dr. Who. Where do I get on board?

133
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,480
Right.

134
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Here it is. Let me burn it down enough for you.

135
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,120
What if it's one of those candles that has a $10 bill inside?

136
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,040
You guys do have, I mean, I'm sure everybody has had a candle in their house that they just

137
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
haven't talked into yet because they're not sure they're ready for the commitment, right?

138
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
Or even worse, you light it and then you're like, oh, this smells like cookie farts.

139
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,400
But maybe somebody else likes cookie farts.

140
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,920
And like, what are you going to do with that candle? Just throw it away?

141
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,520
You burned it once.

142
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,680
You give it to somebody and you say, I hate this.

143
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,760
I hate this. I hope you like it, but if you don't, chain it, my brother.

144
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,520
I live a pretty confrontation free lifestyle and it works for me.

145
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,680
Not always, but most of the time it works for me.

146
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,680
If one of the two of you came to my house with an old shitty candle and a couple half

147
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,040
used bags of bagel bites and four half used bottles of dishwashing soap, I would say,

148
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
do not bring those into my house.

149
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,040
They're wrapped though, it's a secret.

150
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
I picture these just in like a kind of torn up grocery bag.

151
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,960
That's the worst part.

152
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,560
Used gifts, beautifully wrapped.

153
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,720
$45, they're gold flaked wrapped and they spent so much money on the wrapping,

154
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,640
just invest that into the product itself.

155
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,320
Get me two unused bottles of dishwashing soap.

156
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,600
To fucking take the four bottles, reallocate them into two bottles

157
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
and it will at least look newer.

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,320
What are you doing?

159
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
That's just lazy.

160
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
Question asker, I'm going to tell you exactly what you should do here.

161
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,320
This is the thing.

162
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,880
In gift giving, it is universally agreed that it is the thought that counts, right?

163
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
And I think that works both ways.

164
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,920
If the thought sucks, which it does here.

165
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
Exactly, because basically what this person is doing is saying,

166
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
I didn't pick out a gift for you.

167
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
I gave you something I already had.

168
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
So the thought is as minimal as it could possibly be

169
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
and still on some technical level be considered a gift.

170
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,600
So I think you are completely within your rights to say like,

171
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,480
I don't want this.

172
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
This is not a thing that applies to me specifically.

173
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
This is stuff you had at your house that you're trying to get rid of.

174
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
I'd rather not take it into my house.

175
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,160
Thank you.

176
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,680
Although I will say it's really satisfying

177
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,240
when you're doing like a cleansing of your cleaning supplies

178
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,040
and you say, I have so many goddamn half-used bottles of dishwashing soap under the sink.

179
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm just going to toss them all and start over.

180
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
And then you have so much more room down there

181
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
and this person is giving you that experience from the start.

182
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,080
You just put them right under the sink, look at them, survey your goods

183
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,840
and say, no, this will not do.

184
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,560
Put those right in the garbage and go out and buy new soap.

185
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,400
As my housewarming present to you,

186
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm giving you the future opportunity to throw these away

187
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
and feel good about yourself.

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,920
Yeah, exactly.

189
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,240
This half-used candle, I'm never going to finish this.

190
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,400
I don't particularly like the candle stink it makes.

191
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
Have you considered the possibility that the gift is the paper?

192
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
Like have you checked for maps?

193
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
Have you done a map check on the gift wrap?

194
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
Or maybe it's like if you put together the clues

195
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,360
and you're like, what does half-burned candle

196
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
plus garbage food from your freezer

197
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
plus four half-empty bottles of dishwashing soap?

198
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
Oh my God, I know where the Constitution is.

199
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
Well, yeah, we all do.

200
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,520
It's like at a museum.

201
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,320
No, you know where the American Constitution is.

202
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,640
Oh shit, which one are we talking about?

203
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,680
McDonnelland.

204
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,520
The McDonnelland Constitution.

205
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,680
I took a McDonnelland Constitution once and I got kicked out.

206
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
We the people, in order to form a more perfect burger,

207
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,280
that's the Constitution, right?

208
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,040
Or the deck, nobody can keep it straight.

209
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,200
We hold these pickles to be self-evident.

210
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,320
And by the way, would you take these pickles

211
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
or just hold them in our bare hands?

212
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
They're getting warm in my sweaty palm.

213
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
All fry guys are created equal.

214
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,280
Do you guys want a yahoo?

215
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,040
Can we, can I talk about, can I,

216
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,880
I know we talk about McDonnelland every episode.

217
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,400
Can I say something about McDonnelland real quick?

218
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,800
No, please.

219
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,760
It is a really weird makeup of residents in McDonnelland,

220
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,800
if you think about it,

221
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,440
because half of their population is constituted from like

222
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,520
anthropomorphized.

223
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,280
French fry monsters.

224
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,000
Food.

225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
Well, there's the fry guys, which are made of french fries.

226
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,240
There's the Mayor of McCheese, who has a hamburger.

227
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,720
The other half of the McDonnelland constituency

228
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,760
is made up of people who are almost defined

229
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,560
by their desire to eat McDonald's food.

230
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,960
Is there a food chain of McDonnelland,

231
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
like a very grim reality where like,

232
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,360
you have a person who's like whole thing,

233
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,320
hamburger is like.

234
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,960
He wants to steal, he wants to steal and eat

235
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Mayor of McCheese's head.

236
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,960
That's all there is fucking to it.

237
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
He wants to decapitate Mayor of McCheese,

238
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,960
take that, and then nobody would ever see him again

239
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,840
because it's a perfect crime.

240
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,920
That's the one, that is the last job

241
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
that he will ever need to do.

242
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
And then he can retire.

243
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,960
Every night before they put Grimace in prison,

244
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,200
they count the number of fry guys there are.

245
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,440
Because if there's one missing, you know he got out

246
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,880
and it's somebody's ass.

247
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Do you think that they created Grimace

248
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,800
as like the embodiment of how you feel

249
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
after you eat too much McDonald's?

250
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,960
That is actually accurate, both in like physical,

251
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,880
just like vest, like his look and his name.

252
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
And then there's a bird woman.

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,720
What the fuck?

254
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
How about a little bit of consistency?

255
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
The world was designing, the world was eating a McDonald's

256
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
and there were just a hundred pigeons outside

257
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,560
eating all the fries scattered around the ground.

258
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,000
Or the nuggets come from her.

259
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
Like every action, she just looks under her armpit

260
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,040
and there's like three more nuggets like,

261
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,840
good news guys, got another delivery.

262
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
Who are you?

263
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,240
Where are the apple pie boys?

264
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,360
I don't know about that.

265
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,280
Yo, I'm the Shamrock Shake.

266
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,040
I only come around once a year.

267
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,440
Why is that?

268
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,960
Who's got a couch for me?

269
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,480
Not again, Shamrock Shake.

270
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
You would think maybe he would be Irish.

271
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,240
No, he's from Boston.

272
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,640
All right.

273
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

274
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,040
Yes, please.

275
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,040
This Yahoo.

276
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm walking here.

277
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,920
This Yahoo was, this Yahoo was sent in by Carrie Poppy.

278
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
A little bit across podcast fusion.

279
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
It's all about synergy here because now we're rich

280
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
and we know all about things like synergy.

281
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,360
It's by Yahoo.

282
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
She is from Oh No Ross and Carrie,

283
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,160
which you should also listen to

284
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,680
on the maximumfund.org network.

285
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,920
There was a quick diversion.

286
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,920
We were on a thread talking about different maximum fund shows

287
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,120
and she mentioned in passing

288
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
that Oh No Ross and Carrie episodes

289
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,800
take anywhere between 10 and 80 hours

290
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,560
of investigative research.

291
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,200
Can you?

292
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,400
Just like us.

293
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,960
That McDonald land bit,

294
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
that took us 12 hours of researching

295
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,960
the physical makeup of every McDonald land creature.

296
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
This show would be biannual.

297
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
We could literally, it could be like,

298
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
man, I can't wait for another Equinox

299
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,520
so I can get another My Brother, My Brother and Me episode.

300
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,960
Carrie Poppy sent this in.

301
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Thank you, Carrie.

302
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
I am trying to look at their name

304
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,360
and it says sorry, something has gone wrong

305
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
and it won't load.

306
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,960
So, yep.

307
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,120
Well, that's not at all ominous.

308
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Sorry, something has gone wrong asks Peter pop off miracle water

309
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,040
to cure obese cat.

310
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,680
Hi, my cat Sammy is a male cat, six years old,

311
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,840
but he is very obese because he loves butter.

312
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,160
I am Christian.

313
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,120
I am Christian.

314
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
And I noticed Peter pop off.

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
Actually, they have misspelled it here as Peter po poof.

316
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,080
Peter po poof said on TV that his miracle spring water,

317
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
which he manufacture can produce miracles

318
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
such as riches or cure health problems.

319
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,920
The prophet sent me some of that water

320
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,600
after I rout him a ladder.

321
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,360
Do I pour it on Sammy or should he drink it?

322
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,240
I want to ask the people who use this miracle water before.

323
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,820
Peter.

324
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,520
Here's one thing I can say pretty concretely.

325
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,040
It will be equally effective.

326
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
I also, just before we get into the discussion of the water,

327
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,760
want to point out cats don't have their own access to butter.

328
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
Like there is no problem where you're like,

329
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
this cat just keeps getting butter

330
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
and I don't know how to stop him.

331
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Where do you keep getting butter, Mr. Mittens?

332
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
Mr. Mittens, you've been to the store once more.

333
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,400
Same question I have about Garfield, right?

334
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,120
Garfield clearly has an affinity for lasagna

335
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,560
and you always see him in the strips.

336
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,200
He's just got a big like fucking sweaty tray of lasagna there.

337
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
John, did Arbuckle fucking give him that?

338
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
Did he just bake a lasagna and then put it on the floor

339
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,120
and say, here, let my cat eat this.

340
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,760
You had to prepare that lasagna or go out to the store

341
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,600
and purchase it pre-made, preheated.

342
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,040
And then you get home from the store and you say,

343
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,360
okay, cat time and you put that lasagna on the floor.

344
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,920
What are you doing?

345
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,400
Maybe Garfield signed up for some kind of like evil nature box

346
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,120
where they just deliver lasagnas to his door.

347
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,720
Can we talk about something related to this?

348
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,200
Yeah, please.

349
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
John Arbuckle is a single man living on his own.

350
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
What is his, how is his thing going

351
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,000
that he's like another big tray of lasagna just for me?

352
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,640
Not for him though.

353
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,840
Not for him.

354
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,480
This is what I'm saying.

355
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,560
He is consciously making the conscious decision

356
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,640
to put lasagna on the floor for his cat to enjoy.

357
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,280
Did he win some sort of fucking Stouffer's contest

358
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
when he was 17 years old

359
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,600
and now he gets free sweet zon for life?

360
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,320
What's going on?

361
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,800
It doesn't make any sense.

362
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,400
Peter Pappouf, Miracle World.

363
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
It's so optimistic though.

364
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
By the time this lasagna goes bad,

365
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,760
I might have met somebody to share it with.

366
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,720
Yeah, that's the whole-

367
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Maybe that's his line.

368
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Maybe he goes to a bar and says like,

369
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,320
hey, I got some lasagna at home.

370
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,760
And then he gets home and that line,

371
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,160
here's the worst part, that line always works

372
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,440
and then he gets home, he's like,

373
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
fuck, fuck the cat ate it again.

374
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Garfield, you cock blocked me again.

375
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
Garfield, you cock blocked me again with your zon eating.

376
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I thought we were gonna eat lasagna.

377
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
Nevermind, I'm leaving.

378
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,520
Do you want me to go to Speedy Tony's

379
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
all night lasagna button?

380
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,080
No, I don't.

381
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,920
I want the home-cooked zon that I was promised at the bar.

382
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,080
Give me an hour, I'll make another one.

383
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
No, that's an hour I don't have, John.

384
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
We were gonna eat lasagna, fuck,

385
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,280
and then I gotta go.

386
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
She's like, fine, I'll give you one hour

387
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
and then he makes it, he's like,

388
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,720
oh, it's a little too hot.

389
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm gonna leave this out on the shelf to cool, babe,

390
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
and then here in 20, we'll eat it.

391
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh, no, not again.

392
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,080
I was trying to eat some hot lasagna,

393
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,920
get some hot lasagna, fuck energy,

394
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,440
and then I was gonna blow your mind.

395
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
I needed the carbo load.

396
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
Peter, poof, miracle water to cure obese cat.

397
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,400
Are we talking about a topical solution

398
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
or is this an analgesic?

399
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,680
If there's one thing I know about little big kitties,

400
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
they don't like to have water put on them.

401
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,120
No, that is true.

402
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,480
But I mean, it is a very obese cat.

403
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,120
The funny thing about this miracle water

404
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,440
is that if you dump the miracle water

405
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,320
on top of the cat every time it tried to eat butter,

406
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
it would probably work.

407
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, or anything.

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
Anytime you try to do anything,

409
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
if you spray it long enough, it'll get the hint,

410
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
it'll get the net.

411
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
Oh, no butter, okay, all right, I can dig it.

412
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,760
Okay, so when I touch the butter, I get wet

413
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,400
and I don't like that, so I guess butter's bad, cool.

414
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,680
What if it's an enema situation?

415
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Oh, jeezers.

416
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,040
No, I'm just saying all my butter is my enema.

417
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,120
Yeah, what if the dude came out and was like,

418
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,440
listen, I've invented a miracle water,

419
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,680
and I swear to God it totally works.

420
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,000
Promise, I promise it'll work.

421
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
But you gotta put it in your butt.

422
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,280
Do you think people would still be so gung-ho

423
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,040
about trying the miracle water?

424
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,480
Again, I think my arthritis in my wrist

425
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,280
is getting really bad from all my typing and pro gaming,

426
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,360
but if I put some water in my butt via an enema,

427
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,080
I'll probably feel better, right?

428
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
Not in my wrist, but I'll be a little cleaner

429
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,080
down there, I think.

430
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,960
So I think it'll still have, I think no matter what,

431
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,560
you're gonna like how you feel.

432
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,080
But how will you feel about butter?

433
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,520
I don't think that, I'm fine with butter.

434
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,400
What if every time your cat tries to eat butter,

435
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,200
you give it an enema?

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,800
That's effective training tool.

437
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,400
I mean, it'll work.

438
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,040
Ask Jackson Galaxy, that's his number one thing.

439
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
Okay, cat won't stop scratching your couch.

440
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,280
Here, let me get out my enema.

441
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,400
I keep it in my guitar case.

442
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,960
Let me get out.

443
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
Oh, I see you've got, this is great.

444
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,800
You've got a kiddie play place right by the window,

445
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
so he's got lots of different levels to play on,

446
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
lots of toys, great.

447
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,480
How many enemas a day would you say you're doing?

448
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,960
He does that, but Super Nanny tries to take that trick,

449
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,000
and she goes to jail.

450
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,840
And everybody gets so uptight.

451
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,120
Double standard.

452
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
Let me get out my Galaxy hose.

453
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,320
That's what he calls.

454
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,640
Do you guys ever think about the fact that Jackson Galaxy

455
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
with his guitar case full of hoses

456
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,640
and other cat training tools

457
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,920
is basically the cat El Mariachi?

458
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,600
Yeah.

459
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,720
You ever think about that?

460
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,960
He's basically El Mariachi

461
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,520
from Robert Rodriguez fame before kiddies.

462
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,280
Let me tell you the sad thing I think about

463
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,440
every time I think about Jackson Galaxy.

464
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
There had to have come a time

465
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,640
when he looked at his guitar in his guitar case

466
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,480
and said, I don't even need to bother with the guitar anymore.

467
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,360
No, I've never heard him play.

468
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
Like he made the decision to throw away the instrument

469
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,160
and just fill it with cat shit.

470
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,600
Yeah, he's so, he's-

471
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,560
Brainstorm.

472
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:48,960
Oh gosh.

473
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,840
Excuse me, guys.

474
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
If we reach 4,000 donors,

475
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
can we do one of our bonus episodes

476
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
be with special guestpert Jackson Galaxy?

477
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
Do you think he'd come on the show?

478
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
I feel like we've always been pretty nice.

479
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,920
I don't know that's a hundred percent true.

480
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,640
Nobody's got to listen to all the back episodes, right?

481
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,600
Yeah, I don't think he would vet us especially hard.

482
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
If, if, if, if we do one of our bonus episodes

483
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,280
I think should be just like a night

484
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,160
of all the stars we can get on our podcast.

485
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
All guests spreading at the same time.

486
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,800
So fucking Jackson Galaxy, Scott Bakula, Scott Dracula.

487
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:29,760
Scott Bakula is, we've had a 100% success rate

488
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,840
with attempting to get people on our program.

489
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,680
The only person who's ever said no is,

490
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,120
is Scott Bakula's people.

491
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,520
It hurts, hurts to this day.

492
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,800
He's our white whale.

493
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,920
Did not have the time.

494
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll get you Scott Bakula.

495
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
What if we just keep emailing him every month

496
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,680
and pretend like it's the first time

497
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,640
you've ever reached out to him?

498
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
Just checking with that schedule again.

499
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

500
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm saying reach out to him.

501
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
Say, hi, Scott, we have an exciting opportunity for you.

502
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,480
Do you like advice?

503
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Do you like podcasts?

504
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,360
You want to reach out to our 35 million listeners?

505
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,640
Well, we have an opportunity for you.

506
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,680
It's called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

507
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,240
You want to be on it?

508
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,320
And he says, no, no, no, no.

509
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,440
I'm doing CSI New Orleans.

510
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,760
Like I don't need your help with my career anymore.

511
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,960
And we say, okay.

512
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,640
We did miss that window though, didn't we?

513
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,520
Can we all agree on that?

514
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
We absolutely missed that window.

515
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
By just a few months too, which is the frustrating thing.

516
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,160
I'm saying the month after that we say,

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,200
hi, Scott Bakula.

518
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,160
My name is Griffin McElroy.

519
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,680
I'm from a podcast called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

520
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,680
We have an exciting opportunity for you and either we will get him on the show by tricking him

521
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,840
or we will make him think he's gone insane.

522
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,680
If we hit 4,000 donors, I can guarantee that we will gaslight Scott Bakula.

523
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,160
Absolutely.

524
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,960
We're not going to do that.

525
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,120
We're not going to do that to Scott Bakula.

526
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,680
We will gaslight him right into our hearts.

527
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,040
If we get to 4,000 donors, we will learn how to pronounce that dude's last name.

528
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,480
I promise.

529
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,280
I got another question here, Travis, but it's so long.

530
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,400
Do I really have to read all of this?

531
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
It's a good one.

532
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,480
Okay.

533
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,160
It's very, it's a rich vein.

534
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,600
This is on you, okay?

535
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,080
Okay.

536
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,280
Do you want me to read it?

537
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,840
No.

538
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,560
Justin, you got it.

539
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,960
No.

540
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
I don't want to break tradition here.

541
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,380
Okay.

542
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:03,040
Recently, I helped my friend, she's also a bambino, move into a new apartment where he

543
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
will be living with a classmate of ours.

544
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,600
Let's call her Cheryl.

545
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,120
My friend didn't have that much stuff to move, but no, really like one trip in a Toyota RAV4.

546
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,280
However, Cheryl had a big moving truck, my RAV4, and multiple trips of her civic worth

547
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,780
of stuff.

548
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Here is where the problem lies.

549
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,480
She asked me if I would help since I was already helping my friend move in, and she would quote,

550
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,440
get us pizza?

551
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,280
After a couple of hours moving her stuff out of her old place, her and her boyfriend started

552
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,480
eating cold pizza for the night before and offered us some, which we ate like manbees,

553
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,400
one slice each, and we were both around 250 pounds.

554
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,120
We then moved all of our stuff to the new apartment.

555
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,040
She invited my friend and me to lunch at an Applebee's-like establishment.

556
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,600
There is no place like the Bee's, but moving on.

557
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,480
Even when we sat down, she said something about buying, but when the checks came, she

558
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,760
had them split, and we each had to pay for our own lunches.

559
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm right in the middle of being annoyed.

560
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
I'm right for being annoyed, right?

561
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,320
Or was the cold pizza that I get, you know, caveat emptor, and inviting us to lunch was

562
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,360
just because we were there when they were making plans.

563
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,720
That's from contemplating contractual compensation in Concord.

564
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,560
That is a really good name.

565
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Oh my God, though.

566
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,360
I would go into the person's house and start moving them out.

567
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,880
I would walk back out the door and just start carrying things out.

568
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,480
And where are you going with my TV?

569
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:24,880
I don't know.

570
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,240
Where are you going with my pizza promise?

571
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,200
It's being repossessed because you're terrible.

572
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
You're late on your pizza dues.

573
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:38,000
By tricking you into eating garbage pizza, this person has pulled a goddamn mother goose

574
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,920
bridge troll trick on you.

575
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh yeah, this is definitely where you're looking at a nursery rhyme scenario.

576
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:52,240
Is this person some sort of nymph of the forest who is trying to trick you into giving her

577
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,080
your son or daughter?

578
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,600
Oh, you've fallen for my pizza conundrum.

579
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,960
Right, by eating that cold pizza on the wrong side of the river sticks, you are now officially

580
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,000
Haiti's concubine.

581
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,400
I think that's the kind of situation that you've gotten into where they've pulled a

582
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,200
food trick on you.

583
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,440
What a goddamn disaster.

584
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,960
I can't imagine going to fucking town at an Applebee's establishment and just going crazy

585
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,680
on appetizers, like having four different appetizers, two different entrees, and six

586
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,160
desserts thinking this is the best day of my goddamn life.

587
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,120
There is nothing that makes a Southwest quesadilla steak tower taste better than knowing someone

588
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
else is picking up the tab.

589
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,680
And then you get that tab and all of a sudden the food turns rotten.

590
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,040
The fields in your tummy turn fallow.

591
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,360
I cannot even imagine getting the fucking rug pulled out from under me.

592
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,200
You should be on like a fucking 60 minute special with this story.

593
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
This is some rescue 911 shit.

594
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
This is garbage.

595
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,920
This is the worst.

596
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,080
This is what that show The Jinx was about, some guy who did this to some of his friends.

597
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,040
What did I do?

598
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,440
Tricked them all into eating cold pizza.

599
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,560
They carried my futon up the stairs and then I crushed their dreams.

600
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,680
I have not seen the show.

601
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,240
Were we just being incredibly insensitive about a true life crime story?

602
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,640
Don't know.

603
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,520
Haven't seen the show either.

604
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,400
Haven't seen the show.

605
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,080
Probably being very insensitive about a true life crime story though.

606
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,680
Never seen the show myself.

607
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,360
Your first mistake.

608
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,480
Good reference, everybody.

609
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,480
Just around the horn.

610
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,920
Super cool job, the three of us.

611
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,000
We did a real good job.

612
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,440
We knew there was a cultural touchstone we hadn't mentioned yet.

613
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,840
Didn't have any other info, but we went for it.

614
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,040
We skipped a stone, crossed the surface of it, and let it be.

615
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,040
Next up, some great goofs about the works of Flo Bear.

616
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,800
Another topic which we're well equipped to.

617
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,520
Your mistake, of course, was agreeing to help this person move.

618
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:47,920
What?

619
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,200
No.

620
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,880
Absolutely not.

621
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,080
There's no, there's no.

622
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,880
Okay, listen.

623
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,320
The only reason that you would agree to help a stranger move and they offered you pizza

624
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,120
is that you don't know how to get pizza other ways.

625
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,520
And that's, that's pretty sad and scary to me.

626
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,320
Now, Justin.

627
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,920
Travis.

628
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm going to contradict you here.

629
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,640
Whoa.

630
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,880
First, I'm a bim bam first.

631
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,000
The problem is this stranger is moving in with a friend of yours.

632
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,200
So you're going to, I could see that this helping them move as an investment in

633
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,800
future friendship because it's like we're going to be hanging out at this

634
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,760
apartment with our buddy who were actually there to help move.

635
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
They're investing in future friends.

636
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,360
Travis, they're friends that I distance myself from because I suspect they might

637
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
want to move in the next six months.

638
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,840
Are you kidding?

639
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,800
This is the only reason people make friends.

640
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,480
The debt's already been paid.

641
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,480
There's no reason to pursue a friendship if you already helped the person move.

642
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,480
Are you crazy?

643
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,280
You're saying that this is your, like you helped this dude move and he's never going

644
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,240
to speak to you again.

645
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
Travis.

646
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,360
Right.

647
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,520
Yeah.

648
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,040
This is the end game for friendship.

649
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,280
Travis.

650
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,520
Yeah.

651
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,480
Well, you're definitely never going to speak to him again because he lives with

652
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,600
just a food monster.

653
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:57,920
Travis.

654
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,240
Yeah.

655
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,000
Some sort of pizza warlock.

656
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,640
This thing sucks.

657
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,920
And if you want to press charges, I can put you in contact with my people.

658
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,560
Travis.

659
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,360
You should contact Judge John Hodgeman right this second and make this happen.

660
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,760
Travis.

661
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
This is a huge issue.

662
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,280
Travis.

663
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,640
Contact Judge John Judy.

664
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,440
Travis.

665
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,440
I'm so livid about this that I can't actually advise this, but it's very upsetting.

666
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,520
Travis.

667
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,320
Let's take that anger-

668
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,280
I would throw their stuff out the window.

669
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,360
Travis.

670
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,840
Let's take that anger and let's channel it into asking people for money.

671
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,160
Travis.

672
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,800
Listen, I've distanced myself from everybody who would help me move and I have no money

673
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
to hire movers.

674
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,040
And that's where you come in.

675
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,120
Travis.

676
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,320
You are moving very soon.

677
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,640
Travis.

678
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,760
You're all part of the plan.

679
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:33,920
Travis.

680
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,120
You haven't even thought about this, Justin.

681
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
You're moving very soon.

682
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,720
Travis.

683
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,240
Yeah, and I'm out of options.

684
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,640
I have no options left.

685
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Travis.

686
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,720
You've been fucking paying it backward for a decade now.

687
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,040
Travis.

688
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,760
I was trying to get my baby to do curls this week so maybe she could cut, carry, I don't

689
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,080
know, a pillow, a scarf, something to help.

690
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,520
Travis.

691
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,360
You've been getting three people to do you a favor that you do nothing about after that

692
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,400
and it dies with you.

693
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,680
You've been paying it backward.

694
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,280
Travis, tell us about the Max Fund Drive.

695
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,840
Travis.

696
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,640
Okay.

697
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,120
Here's the thing.

698
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,960
Let's assume, I'm going to assume for the sake of this pledge break, that this is the

699
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,920
first episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me you've ever listened to.

700
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Maybe even your first podcast.

701
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,120
So here's what you need to know.

702
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,320
Here are the basics.

703
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,600
Maximumfun.org is a donor-supported network, which means that we rely heavily on the support

704
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,640
of listeners like you and your friends to help make the awesome shows on Maximumfun.org

705
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,120
possible.

706
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,120
It's not just money to pay the hosts.

707
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,720
It goes to pay production costs.

708
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,520
It goes to pay to keep the lights on at Max Fund HQ, to put new shows on the network,

709
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,160
and to help us grow our show.

710
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,720
Since last Fund Drive, we've added two new shows to the network that were just McRoy

711
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,800
based, and we've added others that you should listen to now if you haven't yet.

712
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,320
But new shows are created because of support from listeners like you.

713
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,640
So how it works is, once a year, we ask you to commit to making monthly donations.

714
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,800
So every month, that will automatically come out of your bank account to help us support

715
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,840
Max Fund.

716
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:10,960
And support us, like paying for hosting fees and upfront travel costs and stuff for when

717
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
we do shows, tours, like we're doing in shit, like 11 days.

718
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,480
God, very soon, we're hitting the road.

719
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,200
I mean, that's the awesome thing is the money that you donate goes to what you care

720
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,520
about.

721
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,160
It goes to the shows that you love and the shows that you listen to.

722
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,240
And from what I found, and don't quote me on this, but that's not very normal.

723
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
That's very unique to Max Fund.

724
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,360
Yeah, it's a special thing.

725
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
You're supporting us directly.

726
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Tell the people what they will get for giving us monthly donations at whatever level they

727
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,440
feel comfy with.

728
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,040
Well, I can say this.

729
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
Across the board, there's different levels.

730
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,120
But the main thing that you get is, one, our gratitude, and two, a feeling of ownership

731
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,400
and membership in the maximumfund.org family.

732
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,160
But not only that, you also get real shit, too, like quantifiable shit.

733
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,680
For $5 a month, you get access to exclusive donors-only bonus content.

734
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,360
And not just for this year, for all the past years.

735
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,280
So there's like years and years and years and years of bonus content.

736
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,480
Justin did the math, and it's like days and days of content.

737
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,760
I want to say there's like five bonus bim-bams on there at this point.

738
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,120
Oh, at least.

739
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,680
Oh, yeah.

740
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,120
I mean, if you like my brother, my brother, and me, and you donate at least five bucks

741
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,240
a month to this year's drive, you donate five bucks a month.

742
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,720
You will get a live from my brother, my brother, and me recorded at San Francisco Sketch Fest.

743
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,720
The world's only episode of the extant episode that's not on the deep web of Big Gulp

744
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,320
recorded in Los Angeles.

745
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:57,520
A demo of Fugue for Brother Horns performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the author of the hip

746
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,720
musical Hamilton, who also did a parody of Fugue for Tin Horns from Guys and Dolls.

747
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,440
He's a Tony Award winner, folks.

748
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,920
We spared no expense.

749
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,520
He got the, as we reminded him recently, he's got the IGT, and he is so close to the I.

750
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,560
And if you donate to Maximum Fun, you could help him win that Oscar.

751
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
Get him that Oscar.

752
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,680
2014, my brother, my brother, and me bonus episode.

753
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,240
2013, 2012, there's another one from 2012 for Maximum Fun Day.

754
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,520
2011, there's two riff videos that we did of public service announcements.

755
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,760
There's 15 minutes of live bim bam from Austin in 2012.

756
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,520
It's mind-boggling.

757
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,360
And then there is a 45-minute prequel episode of The Adventure Zone, which is one of my

758
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,720
favorite things we've ever recorded.

759
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,720
There's how many saw bones?

760
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
Two or three?

761
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,560
Two or one?

762
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,000
One, two, or three.

763
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,160
Two bonus saw bones.

764
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,800
There's a bonus.

765
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,040
Oh, and the bonus saw bones for this year is a full-length commentary for the finale

766
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,920
of Two and a Half Men.

767
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,040
Suck it.

768
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,440
Perfect.

769
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,560
Perfect.

770
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,760
There's a bonus bunker buddy.

771
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,040
There's bonus episode.

772
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,560
There's fucking a lot.

773
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,520
If you like Jordan and Jesse, go.

774
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,040
I can't even imagine how many bonus episodes of that show are available.

775
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,720
And that's just for $5 a month.

776
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,040
So that's so much.

777
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,120
And so for $10 a month, you get that and a driving exclusive tote bag that you're only

778
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
going to be able to get during Max Fun Drive.

779
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
And then for $20 a month, you get the tote bag, you get the bonus content, and you get

780
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,640
an in-flight power pack that contains a mobile device charger, a collapsible water bottle,

781
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,520
antibacterial wipes, and pilot wings.

782
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,840
For $35 a month, you get all of that and a pair of rocket-engraved shot glasses.

783
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,120
Now, I've got the tumblers and they are beautiful.

784
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,240
So trust me, you're going to want these shot glasses.

785
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,440
Now, say you've got a little bit more and you're looking to give at a higher level.

786
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,560
Well, for $100 a month, you get everything from the previous levels and you become a

787
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,960
member in the inner circle, our monthly culture club.

788
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,080
And how that works is once a month, a Max Fun host or a Max Fun employee will pick some

789
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,440
kind of cultural thing and they will ship it to you.

790
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,360
It could be a movie, it could be, you know, an album.

791
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,520
It could be the album Music Evolution by the awesome band Buckshot Lafonque, which is what

792
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,800
we sent all of the-

793
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,320
It likely won't be that again.

794
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,960
I would bet.

795
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,760
Probably not.

796
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
This time it will be their self-titled album, Buckshot Lafonque.

797
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,000
And they'll send you a note telling you all about it and send you either a physical copy

798
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,480
or a download code or something that you can get a hold of it.

799
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
Now, say you want to do $200 a month.

800
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,120
Holy shit.

801
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,320
One, I love you so much.

802
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,360
That's where we are at with our billions now.

803
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,280
Yes, you get everything else from all the other levels plus free registration to Max

804
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,960
Fun Con 2016.

805
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,400
Let me tell you, this is not only great because it makes good financial sense, but two,

806
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,280
that shit sells out so quickly.

807
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
You don't even have to worry about it.

808
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,440
Take a nap on ticket sale day.

809
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,800
Take a dirt nap.

810
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,520
Well, don't do that.

811
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,280
Just take a long nap.

812
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,320
Oh, and not only that, so those are all the levels.

813
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,120
You should do that.

814
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,280
Find the level that's right for you and do that.

815
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,560
But also there's a special competition going on right now that if you tweet using the hashtag

816
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,280
Max Fun Drive, you're automatically entered in the contest that if your tweet is picked

817
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,600
as the best tweet, you win a free ticket to Max Fun Con 2015.

818
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,960
Holy crap.

819
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,840
Which is already sold out, has been sold out for months.

820
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,920
So there's a lot of different things you can get for donating.

821
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,520
We also have challenge donors who, for every new donor that we get, will kick in a certain

822
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
amount of cash and all of those.

823
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
There's a bunch of them at this point and they all add up.

824
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,960
So if you're a new donor, then we get another chunk of change from them.

825
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,480
And also, if you are an existing donor, you can get these pledge gifts if you upgrade

826
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,520
your donation.

827
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,360
The cool thing about this, a lot of times if you donate to a group or organization,

828
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,320
it's hard to tell exactly where the money is going.

829
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,320
With the Max Fun Drive, 70% of your donation goes directly to the shows that you say you

830
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,120
listen to.

831
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,880
It's your, 70% of your pledge is, 30% goes to help run the network and there's a lot

832
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,640
of overhead with running a podcast network, believe you me.

833
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,480
But 70% of your donation goes straight to the shows that you listen to.

834
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,200
You are directly supporting them and that's pretty great.

835
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,560
The key is to not wait.

836
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,440
There's no reason to wait if you're thinking about it now and you're like, you know what?

837
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,280
I do want to support the shows I listen to.

838
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
I want to support the shows I love.

839
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,520
I've got a little bit extra in my budget and I want to do it.

840
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,240
Then go now, maximumfun.org forward slash donate while you're thinking about it.

841
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,840
Don't wait because there's only, by the time this comes out, a couple days left in the

842
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,800
Max Fun Drive and you don't want to miss out on these great gifts.

843
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,760
You don't want to miss out on our gratitude and you want to get caught up in the action

844
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,640
of Max Fun Drive.

845
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,080
Help us hit that 4,000 donor goal and get all of the other bonus content that could

846
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,680
exist if we do that.

847
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,480
Just sail away.

848
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,400
Come sail away with us.

849
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,920
Wait, can you give me the address one more time?

850
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,600
I didn't get a chance to write it down.

851
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,480
It's maximumfun.org forward slash donate and then tweet at us so we can thank you.

852
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,000
After you're done donating, take your game and recognize the game of Rachel Sperling

853
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,840
who sent in this Yahoo answer.

854
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,560
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

855
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

856
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,360
They are anonymous.

857
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,840
The group?

858
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,160
Yep.

859
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,400
They said, President Obama, your secrets.

860
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,160
No, they said, is there any science to a nerdgasm?

861
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,120
Okay, so I was watching The Flash.

862
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:44,640
Major spoilers for The Flash and then there's a big spoiler for The Flash here and I'm

863
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,880
going to leave it out because I assume that some people listen.

864
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
Is it that he runs really fast?

865
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,320
Yeah, he runs really fast and when I found that out, okay, end of spoiler, I had a crazy

866
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,280
nerdgasm.

867
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,720
It felt so real.

868
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,080
I was wondering if there's any science or research supporting this.

869
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,360
I'm sorry, it felt so real?

870
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,720
Yeah, I saw him run so fast and I just blew a huge one.

871
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,120
What?

872
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,640
It felt so real?

873
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,520
You produced a spumy fluid?

874
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,080
Do people never think about what they're putting out into the internet?

875
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,120
The implied addendum to it felt so real is it felt so real, I bet.

876
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,320
I bet.

877
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,400
Compared to the real orgasms I've had.

878
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,520
It was so real.

879
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,480
I'm just wondering if there's any science or research supporting this.

880
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,720
I mean our scientific complex, our American scientific complex is so crazy corrupt, hello

881
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,720
global warming, that I wouldn't put it past us that we're probably spending, probably

882
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,760
subsidizing billions of my taxpayer dollars to pay for scientists to watch episodes of

883
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,960
The Flash and then there's a control group that's just jerking off.

884
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,800
Isn't, isn't a nergasm just like, I got really excited to see a thing that I like.

885
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,080
And I, and I jizzed real jizz.

886
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,760
Has, has anyone ever thought that that's what a nergasm really meant?

887
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:19,120
I think that we as a society are doing something now that we should have done many years ago

888
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,440
and officially retiring the phrase nergasm from the popular vernacular.

889
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,840
Yes.

890
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Once someone thinks that they have experienced this thing that lazy bloggers made up probably.

891
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,560
Yeah.

892
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,680
Once you've, once you have people thinking they've experienced this phenomenon that is

893
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,080
made up and not real, then it's probably time, it's probably gotten reckless.

894
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,280
I mean it's, it's just a portmanteau, people.

895
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,760
Or is it a real scientific phenomenon?

896
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,360
Welcome to San Diego Comic Con.

897
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,560
Here is a mop and bucket.

898
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,600
We're gonna need you to chip in.

899
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
If, oh my god, the Firefly panel.

900
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,080
If he sees something, mop something.

901
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,640
Yeah.

902
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,240
At the Firefly panel, we had to put down fucking plastic sheets everywhere that you will be

903
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,480
waiting out of the Firefly panel.

904
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,680
It's a disaster in there.

905
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,600
It's a biological hazard.

906
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,280
He said I came to misbehave and you could literally see it coming out the window.

907
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,600
Right.

908
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,480
It's really, really bad.

909
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,160
A lot of those people just came to came.

910
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,600
It's really, really bad.

911
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,280
This has been a very bad run of sentences that we've had.

912
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,960
A lot of really upsetting.

913
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,280
A lot of very challenging concepts.

914
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,320
But don't you think that this is a like a bigger indication of the issue of like people

915
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,840
not understanding what a referent, like when someone says something like, oh yeah, I had

916
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,120
a total nerdgasm.

917
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,200
That there's some small portion of people that go, what is that?

918
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,680
And I'm not gonna ask.

919
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,600
Or maybe we're just like being pretty fucking reckless with language.

920
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,080
Maybe if we're gonna say something, it should mean that like this, this question asker is

921
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,880
a kind of adult, but they raise a fine point.

922
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,320
Like if this doesn't exist, if you can't have a nerd, if you can't have a scientific verifiable

923
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,560
nerdgasm, maybe it shouldn't be a thing.

924
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,880
Maybe don't like so flip it with language.

925
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,200
Yeah.

926
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,120
Why don't you just say pleasurable, pleasurable sensation?

927
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,040
I got really excited.

928
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,640
Or just like, okay.

929
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,240
I was watching the flash and I ejaculated for some reason.

930
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,040
And I guess that ejaculated for a solid 20 minutes.

931
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,840
Not the first two, because I totally saw that coming.

932
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:25,600
But then after the first two minutes, it was a solid like 20 minutes of like a slow orgasm.

933
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,280
And then I died.

934
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,920
So yeah, it's probably a real thing, right?

935
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,920
That's where we all land.

936
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,960
I haven't been paying attention for the past 10 minutes, but I think that's where we all

937
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,280
landed.

938
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,680
I mean, I could say this.

939
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,240
I watched the Avengers trailer and I saw a flash of vision at the end and I ruined three

940
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,280
pairs of pants.

941
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,760
Yeah, I actually, I didn't because I haven't been able to have a nerdgasm for the past

942
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,640
couple of years.

943
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:52,960
Yeah.

944
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,520
That's so hard to say that.

945
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,560
I've been taking like nerd hormone therapy to try and get my stuff right.

946
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,040
And frankly, this is the bravest I've ever felt just sort of talking about it.

947
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,560
It's just nothing does it for me anymore.

948
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,280
I guess when would you say that like you was the last my last nerdgasm?

949
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,960
That's tough.

950
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:20,560
I remember after seeing Iron Man 2, a movie that Iron Man was not in, and I just sort

951
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,200
of dried up down there after just walking out of the theater.

952
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200
I just sort of, it just sort of went fallow.

953
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,720
Brothers, I work at a very large company with a very lax dress code.

954
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,640
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

955
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,680
This reminds me of something.

956
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,160
What's that?

957
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,320
A great tweet we got yesterday from, did you guys see this?

958
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,920
From Terry Gross apologizing?

959
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,760
Saying, I'm sorry for chomping your flame for so many years.

960
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,840
No, we got a tweet about somebody who works.

961
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,680
It's from somebody who works in the FCC building.

962
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,560
Oh, yeah.

963
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,400
Or like somewhere adjacent.

964
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:58,800
I don't know.

965
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,560
They're in the same complex as the FCC.

966
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,000
And they ended up in an elevator with the chairman of the FCC.

967
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,160
And this happened to them twice.

968
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,680
And he gave the FCC chair a plug from a bim bam, trying to explain what the show was he

969
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,520
was listening to on his phone, I guess without headphones or what have you.

970
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:30,000
And after explaining the premise, the chairman of the FCC said, oh, it's like click and

971
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,760
clack for the modern generation.

972
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,360
That is the most flattering thing that anybody has ever said about our show.

973
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,200
Unfortunately, the next day, the FCC did crack down on podcasts.

974
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
And now we're all being fine.

975
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,960
I was going to say like if Tom Wheeler finds out that our show is also distributed through

976
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,800
the internet, he might have to turn around on net neutrality.

977
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,680
Like, well, I wanted to be neutral, but look what you've done.

978
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,120
Look at how reckless you've been.

979
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,480
Brothers, I work at a very large company with a very lax dress code.

980
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,640
Somebody in my building takes things a bit too far.

981
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,360
He never wears shoes or socks.

982
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,960
At times I see him in our cafeteria with naked feet and even worse, there have been times

983
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,800
when I've seen him at the urinal without any barrier between his feet and everything else.

984
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,000
Tapping out, tapping out.

985
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,600
You guys handle this one alone.

986
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I am, I need to take a walk.

987
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,440
How can I let this very casual acquaintance know that this is not okay, even if it does

988
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,760
still fit in our dress code?

989
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,880
That's from Mortified in Madison.

990
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,520
You're going to need to accidentally step on his feet a couple of times.

991
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,200
Or just don't worry about it because I think the staph infection will probably get him.

992
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,840
I think he's not super long for this world.

993
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,920
This was my RA.

994
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,440
Athlete's foot again?

995
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,560
This is the third time this week.

996
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,040
Weird, I've got staph on one foot and MRSA on the other.

997
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,400
How does this keep happening?

998
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
My foot has smallpox?

999
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,520
This doesn't seem to make sense.

1000
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
I have like a foot buffet of gross diseases.

1001
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,960
Somebody must have nerdgasm all over this place.

1002
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,360
This was my RA.

1003
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,800
A lot of challenging ideas.

1004
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,120
My freshman year, he was known for always being barefoot, like walking around campus,

1005
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,160
being outdoors.

1006
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,160
And like I asked him about it eventually and he was like, you know, at first my feet were

1007
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,000
real tender, but you know, after a while they really like toughen and leather up and now

1008
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,200
it doesn't even bother me anymore.

1009
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,720
That's what you want because that's what you gotta have.

1010
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,200
Basically his feet became shoes.

1011
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,800
I only know one other person that's done this and it's Bobby McFerrin.

1012
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,000
I saw an interview with Bobby McFerrin and he never wears shoes.

1013
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,720
He says he wants to have rough feet like a dancer's feet.

1014
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,320
So Bobby McFerrin never wears shoes.

1015
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,440
He's no tender foot.

1016
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
I don't care how rough your goddamn feet are.

1017
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,640
I don't care if you grow a pair of fucking chucks around them like they're goddamn foot

1018
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,200
chitin.

1019
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,800
You put fucking shoes on.

1020
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,720
You put on Japanese courtesy sandals before you go to use the urinal.

1021
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,640
What are you fucking talking about?

1022
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,000
In the Japanese style put some goddamn slippers on.

1023
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,120
Slime foot?

1024
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,360
Hey, welcome to the company, slime foot.

1025
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,800
It's super duper casual Friday.

1026
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,720
I see you're not wearing pants, but you will put on goddamn courtesy sandals or else I'll

1027
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,760
fucking fire you.

1028
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,760
Guys, my favorite contemporary Christian band is Slime Foot.

1029
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,960
You beat me to it.

1030
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh my god.

1031
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,760
This is the grossest and worst thing I've ever heard in my life.

1032
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,600
I don't care if you walk around and you step on goddamn hedgehog quills all day and you

1033
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,040
still don't get the net.

1034
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,800
You put on fucking Japanese courtesy sandals before you step in front of the urinal.

1035
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,320
What if you actually piss on your foot?

1036
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,120
What kind of fucking large company doesn't care that one of its employees isn't wearing

1037
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,620
shoes?

1038
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,840
Like how fucking chill?

1039
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,960
Unless your large company-

1040
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,280
The answer to your question, Travis, is Radio Shack.

1041
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
Like they're just buying their time, right?

1042
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,720
It's basically senior year of college in there.

1043
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,320
Yeah, everyone in Radio Shack gives us some weird dates of senior items.

1044
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,120
I don't care.

1045
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,680
They're just waiting to graduate through unemployment.

1046
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,480
If there are-

1047
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,000
By the way, if you listen to this show and you work at Radio Shack, I'm sure it's gonna

1048
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,560
be working.

1049
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,160
Or RBs or any place of business that we make fun of constantly.

1050
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:15,280
I don't care if there are dozens of nozzles hooked up to like propane tanks that just

1051
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,160
sort of line the bathroom and only one person's allowed inside at a time and then when that

1052
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,480
person walks out, the room is just sort of blasted.

1053
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,800
Just sort of flame blasted to kill every living thing inside of it and dry up every ounce

1054
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,640
of spume off the floor.

1055
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,080
You put Japanese courtesy sandals on before you walk in.

1056
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:42,480
I don't care if a fleet of fucking microbots scour it or those scrubbing bubbles.

1057
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,440
If those things were actually real and did their thing to completely fucking cauterize

1058
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:47,680
this bathroom.

1059
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,720
You're not wearing any shoes.

1060
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,920
That's disgusting.

1061
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,280
Yeah, let's get on there or not because even we have limits.

1062
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,600
Like, that's the fucking worst mental-

1063
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,320
I'm thinking-

1064
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,800
This has ruined my day because now I'm imagining the sensation of getting slimy feet.

1065
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,800
Fucking dare you to move slime foot.

1066
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,440
And I can't-

1067
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,520
I literally won't be able to sleep tonight.

1068
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:05,920
So thank you for this very much.

1069
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,600
How chunky is this dude?

1070
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,720
Like, how crunchy is he that he's like, nah, man, it's God's feet.

1071
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,240
Dog, listen, dog.

1072
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,600
That's God's piss on the floor.

1073
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,680
Listen, we all piss.

1074
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,800
I know we all piss and we don't talk about it.

1075
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,480
It's totally natural to get other people's pee pee on the bottom of my feet.

1076
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,400
The office is a flat circle.

1077
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,200
Just walk around.

1078
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,080
Just get it, walk around.

1079
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,440
Doesn't even matter, man.

1080
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,400
Slippery when wet.

1081
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,360
You know what I mean, dog?

1082
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,000
Know what I'm saying?

1083
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,960
Why are your feet pretty?

1084
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,480
It's from the bathroom floor.

1085
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,440
Cool.

1086
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,120
I stepped in all the piss.

1087
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,040
This is the worst day of my life.

1088
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,480
This is the worst day of my life.

1089
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,000
It all mingles together.

1090
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,440
Everyone's piss is equal, brother.

1091
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,760
You're fired from RadioShack.

1092
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,560
Get out.

1093
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,360
You know, there have been moments where someone has walked in the bathroom and seen him with

1094
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,240
his feet in the sink.

1095
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,120
Ah, sorry, bud.

1096
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,680
Sorry, bud.

1097
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,240
Some gum.

1098
00:53:53,360 --> 00:54:00,560
Do you think that what happened was this crunchy dude didn't want to go in the bathroom barefoot,

1099
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,640
but he committed to this barefoot lifestyle and he was like, I can't back out now.

1100
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,040
They'll all know that I don't really believe in this.

1101
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,480
And he had to make that he didn't use the bathroom at work for the first three months.

1102
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,960
And then was like, no, I just got to get over it.

1103
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,120
Or else the other horrifying reality is that this gentleman like wakes up every day going,

1104
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,160
doesn't matter.

1105
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,120
I don't care.

1106
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,840
Doesn't bother me at all what I step on.

1107
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,040
Think about this.

1108
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,520
Every office has that one guy that throws half finished sandwiches on the floor.

1109
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,960
So think about that guy and the shoeless guy in the same office.

1110
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,240
They I bet those two cats do not get along very well.

1111
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,920
Now they've taped off the office and they're like, you can be barefoot on that side.

1112
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,760
I can drop food on this side.

1113
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,840
Don't cross the line.

1114
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,560
I'm tired.

1115
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,880
I'm tired of getting pastrami toes, bro.

1116
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,680
You got your feet in my sandwich.

1117
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,600
You got your sandwich in my feet.

1118
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,320
Wait a minute.

1119
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,960
Wait a minute.

1120
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,520
This sucks.

1121
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,320
And we both suck.

1122
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,640
My birthday's in like a month.

1123
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,600
I want you to get me a fucking eternal sunshine in the spotless mind treatment to erase this

1124
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,240
episode from my mind.

1125
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,960
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1126
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,960
Yeah, hit me.

1127
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,120
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

1128
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,600
Are you Ira Ray?

1129
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,800
Who wants to know?

1130
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,360
Thank you Ira Ray.

1131
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,560
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

1132
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,200
Wow, Yahoo, your site fucking sucks now.

1133
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,520
It's been a while since I've railed on Yahoo.

1134
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,760
But like when your goddamn usernames won't even show up, get it fucking together.

1135
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,320
Let me refresh.

1136
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,200
See if that fixes it.

1137
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,480
No, you just made me waste bandwidth.

1138
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,600
God damn it, Yahoo.

1139
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,440
Thank you Ira Ray.

1140
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,480
And it's by Mr. User.

1141
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,520
And they ask, how can I glamp my tent like glamping but do it yourself?

1142
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,960
I am going camping and I always see this glamorous camping.

1143
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,440
But I want to glamp up my tent, but not make it cheesy.

1144
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,080
How can I?

1145
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,760
Well, we've all been there.

1146
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,240
Oh man, I stepped in glamp.

1147
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,600
Gotta start wearing Japanese courtesy sandals.

1148
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,800
Could you point me to your glamp aisle, please?

1149
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,640
I'm just really looking to glamp up my tent.

1150
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,360
Nope, nope, nope.

1151
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,360
They're asking for a DIY glamping solution.

1152
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,680
Wait a minute, hold on.

1153
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,640
Time out, time out, time out.

1154
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,440
Earlier in this episode, we had someone who said that they helped someone move

1155
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,000
an absolute mountain of things and all they got in exchange was a single

1156
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,200
pizza split between them.

1157
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:15,680
Right.

1158
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,040
Cold pizza, single pizza slice.

1159
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,240
A single split, yeah.

1160
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,760
And just now we had someone who is looking to go DIY glamping, presumably

1161
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,960
by putting a bunch of like electronics and fancy things in their tent.

1162
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,880
Are people just sending us Parks and Rec episode synopsis as question?

1163
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,800
Like, is that where we're at right now?

1164
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,160
Because this is the second question we've had in this episode that has mirrored

1165
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,680
a plot line from Parks and Rec.

1166
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,320
And you remember that episode where Ron didn't wear shoes and everyone peed

1167
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,360
all over his feet?

1168
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:43,920
Yeah.

1169
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,520
Remember that hit episode?

1170
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,200
This question was asked six years ago.

1171
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,400
So I think it precedes-

1172
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,760
This is a rich ARG.

1173
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,260
Yeah.

1174
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,240
I can't believe that glamping, that very concept existed in 2009.

1175
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,520
But it probably-

1176
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,920
I have a hard time believing 2009 existed.

1177
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,420
Yeah.

1178
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,080
Glamping.

1179
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,560
Glamping.

1180
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,760
Do you know about glamping, Justin?

1181
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,280
Yeah, it's basically living in West Virginia, right?

1182
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,720
Yeah, basically everywhere you are in West Virginia, you are glamping or camping.

1183
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,160
This, once again, this strikes me very similar to the nerdgasm question,

1184
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,800
because it seems to me to be a failure of language.

1185
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,480
We're like, if you understand that glamping is glamorous camping,

1186
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,960
I don't understand where the confusion is.

1187
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,000
Like, there's not a specific thing you do.

1188
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,800
It's not like, oh, if you don't have blank, you're not glamping.

1189
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,000
It's like, okay, great.

1190
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,200
Get an air mattress.

1191
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,320
Like, take shit with you.

1192
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,160
Like, there isn't a manual to follow to glamp.

1193
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,840
No, but there is a breaking point.

1194
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,960
There's a tipping point.

1195
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,480
There's a Malcolm Gladwell tipping point where you're just housing.

1196
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,760
Like, you bring too much shit with you.

1197
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,880
You blay down some plumbing.

1198
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,080
You put down a toilet.

1199
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,280
You bring in your TV.

1200
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,360
You just moved is what you did, and you built a new house.

1201
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,560
And you're on the grid.

1202
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,600
You're not even off the grid anymore.

1203
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,040
You're on the grid, and you're getting-

1204
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,840
You are the grid.

1205
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,600
You're the grid, and you're getting mail there.

1206
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,680
You're getting all of your Amazon Prime delivered to you there.

1207
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,320
If you have to call the grid to get set up, then you've probably over glamped.

1208
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,200
But what if you don't do enough, and now you're just camping?

1209
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,880
And you're like, well, I brought Tiffany's lamp.

1210
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,320
And you're like, yeah, but that's all you brought.

1211
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,680
You got nothing to plug it into.

1212
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,680
This is just camping, but delicately.

1213
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,120
Justin, can I ask when the last time you went camping was?

1214
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:27,440
That time that Trav invited us out there, out to camp, and told us he bought a bunch of beer.

1215
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,160
And then the ranger caught him and made him dump out his beer in front of him.

1216
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,080
Yeah, that was not a good trip.

1217
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,040
That was a rough one.

1218
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,400
We haven't been camping since then.

1219
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,880
Burned a lot of bridges that day.

1220
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,600
Yeah, with the park service, with nature, the whole bit.

1221
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,960
You know what?

1222
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,640
I never really thought about it.

1223
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:49,200
It is kind of a fucked up priority if the guy charged with preserving this park is like,

1224
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,360
I can't have anybody getting drunk in here.

1225
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:58,720
But if you want to go ahead and dump two gallons of Michelob here into the unspoiled wilderness,

1226
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,120
then that would probably be fine, man.

1227
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,360
If you're going to get drunk, Mother Earth is going to get drunk.

1228
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,160
I bet some birds probably got real fucked up that day.

1229
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,400
Last time I went, well, the thing that happened is the thing that happens every time I go camping,

1230
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,720
which is somehow I just get diarrhea out there and it just sort of happens every time I go out

1231
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:20,880
there.

1232
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,600
So my ideal glamping solution does not involve bedazzling my flaps.

1233
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,200
It does involve just finding out, just sort of figuring out what's going on in my tract

1234
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,280
when I get all natural and stuff.

1235
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:34,720
I don't know why.

1236
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,800
I don't know how I can counteract that with like modernity, which is the secret of glamping.

1237
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,560
But I do wish that I could, I don't know.

1238
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,000
Maybe I just have a doctor on him.

1239
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,160
Maybe that's my glamp procedure.

1240
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:53,280
Is it still camping if you go and stay in like a pre-built cabin-y thing?

1241
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:53,760
No.

1242
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,280
No, now it's just hoteling, right?

1243
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,800
If the structure, okay, if the structure existed before you got there, you are not camping

1244
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,480
or glamping, I would say.

1245
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,720
I think if you set up your structure, you can fairly call it glamping no matter what

1246
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,920
you do after that point.

1247
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,960
Like if you set up a tent outside your house, you're still camping.

1248
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,800
What if you just knocked down a wall of your house and put up some flaps?

1249
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,040
Yeah.

1250
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,360
Whoa, that's an idea.

1251
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,200
What if you built like a tent and then you just put up a bunch of like trash bags to

1252
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,440
make a tunnel connecting the tent to your house?

1253
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,480
That would be-

1254
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,240
You would never be in the tent.

1255
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,560
You would just have the option there available to you.

1256
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,440
The tent is there.

1257
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:35,840
Right.

1258
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,280
It's tent adjacent.

1259
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,400
I could be sleeping out there.

1260
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,080
It's very, there's a lot of pill bugs.

1261
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,800
I don't like that.

1262
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,680
No, or any bugs, really, if you think about it.

1263
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,120
Not a big fan of bugs.

1264
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,160
But every time Griffin sleeps in the tent, he does get diarrhea.

1265
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,120
It's, it's, it's, guys, am I allergic?

1266
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,120
Am I allergic to like vinyl housing?

1267
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,400
Like what, what happened?

1268
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,920
Is it just the knowledge that there is no bathroom close by that just sours me?

1269
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,320
What goes-

1270
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,120
If Griffin looks through mesh, he has to shit.

1271
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,640
That might, maybe that might be it.

1272
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,440
The sound of crickets, if too loud, the frequency resonates with my tract in a way that I do

1273
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,440
not understand, but I do not appreciate.

1274
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,800
I'll tell you what's going to help me glamp.

1275
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,320
Yep.

1276
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:23,120
Having a full-time doctor just come with me and in order to have someone like that in

1277
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,720
my retinue, I'm going to need a lot of money.

1278
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,520
How are you going to get a lot of money at this hour?

1279
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,560
Well, I was thinking I get either just sort of go door to door asking people to give me

1280
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,560
money because, and I will explain to them all about my woods diarrhea, or I can channel-

1281
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,600
Have you heard the good news?

1282
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:47,360
Or I can channel our listenership to see if they'll chip in, you know, a few bucks a month.

1283
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,680
And help us out, help support the podcast.

1284
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,000
I promise I won't spend it on natural woods doctors.

1285
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,400
We will spend it on expanding the show and doing all kinds of cool stuff with the donations

1286
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,920
and supporting the Maximum Fund Network.

1287
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,560
If you go to MaximumFund.org slash donate, it's very, very easy.

1288
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,600
In just a couple minutes, you'll be able to get set up and then you don't have to think

1289
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,400
about it again.

1290
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,240
It just automatically pops out of your, whatever card you set up to give us donations.

1291
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,840
And you can really help us out to grow and try and do cool new stuff.

1292
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,120
We got some, we got some cool stuff we want to do with the show and we need your support

1293
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,120
if we're going to follow through with it.

1294
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:32,400
So if you are able to kick in $5 a month, you will get a shit gaggle of exclusive bonus

1295
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,040
content that is only going to go out to donors for this year and every year prior for every

1296
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,600
show on the network.

1297
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,160
It's crazy.

1298
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,440
There's dozens and dozens of episodes of podcasts for you to listen to.

1299
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,200
If you chip in $10 a month, you will get a drive exclusive tote bag.

1300
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,560
You can put anything in that tote bag.

1301
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,040
We won't, there's no camera installed in the tote bag to tell you what you can and can't

1302
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,680
put in it because you're an adult now and you have the freedom to decide what to put

1303
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,360
in your own goddamn tote bags.

1304
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,200
There's no tote bag law yet.

1305
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,480
No, not yet.

1306
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,000
No gods or kings, only tote bags.

1307
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,200
Listen, this is our last pledge break of this year.

1308
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:17,040
Last pledge break of this Max Fun Drive and this is your last chance to say, hey, these

1309
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,080
shows are worthwhile.

1310
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,440
These shows are worth doing.

1311
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,400
These shows are worth making.

1312
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,920
The people who make these shows, the Max Fun Drive, jokes aside, not getting rich doing

1313
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,120
it, mainly just kind of do it because it's fun.

1314
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:35,200
We would be recording this show with much worse equipment and much cheaper hosting and

1315
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,720
probably more infrequently even without you folks.

1316
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:45,920
But it is, in the sort of society that we form for ourselves, the way you vote anymore

1317
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,200
is with your money.

1318
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,760
And if you like the stuff that we're doing here on Max Fun, this is the way you say,

1319
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,280
hey, I want more of this stuff.

1320
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,840
Like we've talked about before, the reason we did another show, the reason we started

1321
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,720
the Adventure Zone was because a lot of people said, hey, I want this.

1322
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,920
I want you guys to do that.

1323
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,920
And people who listen to that show have been coming in in droves, I think, to donate to

1324
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,280
the Max Fun Drive.

1325
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,680
And if you like what we're doing here and you want it to keep going and you want more

1326
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,280
of it, this is the way you make that happen.

1327
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,200
And I also want to say that every year since we've joined, my brother, my brother, and

1328
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,120
me listeners have really brought it to the Max Fun Drive.

1329
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,120
And it always makes me feel really honored.

1330
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,520
And I just really appreciate it.

1331
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,480
I just want to say thank you.

1332
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,680
So go to maxfunfund.org slash donate.

1333
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,880
Pick a level that works for you.

1334
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,680
$20 a month, you get the in-flight power pack with mobile device charger, collapsible water

1335
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,600
bottle, antibacterial wipes, and pilot wings.

1336
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,000
$35 a month, you get the rocket engraved shot glasses.

1337
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,120
$100 a month, you get to be in the Inner Circle, which is our culture club where we

1338
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,400
will send you cool cultural stuff that we like.

1339
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,920
$200 a month, you get the free registration for Max Fun Con 2016.

1340
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,960
But you don't have to do $200 a month, obviously.

1341
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,760
That's a big ask.

1342
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,320
You just do what feels comfortable for you.

1343
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:05,200
$5 a month is like what, like one Starbucks cup of coffee.

1344
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:12,800
If you're comfortable with it and that price makes sense to you for what you get out of

1345
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,400
our shows, just think about it.

1346
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,240
Maxfunfund.org slash donate.

1347
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,560
And if you're already a donor and maybe you started at $5 a month in the past and you're

1348
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,280
like, you know what, I feel like I could give a little bit more, upgrading donors count

1349
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,880
towards our numbers as well.

1350
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,800
And we appreciate any amount you can give.

1351
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,560
And also, we understand that sometimes you can't afford to give it all.

1352
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,920
And I think everyone's been there at some point in their lives.

1353
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,040
And that's totally cool.

1354
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,120
What you can do is make sure you tweet about the drive, talk to your friends, tell the

1355
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,440
people you know that listen to our shows and other shows on Max Fun Network and say, hey,

1356
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,280
have you given to Max Fun Drive yet?

1357
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,480
And getting the word out, talking about it on Facebook and Twitter, it's the best thing

1358
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,200
you can do to help get people on board with it and say like, hey, check out these shows,

1359
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,360
listen to this thing and then help support them.

1360
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:06,240
We appreciate everything you guys do to get the Max Fun Drive as successful as it is.

1361
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,040
Yeah.

1362
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,320
Thank you all so, so much.

1363
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
And then tell us about it so we can thank you.

1364
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,360
Yeah, absolutely.

1365
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,160
Question.

1366
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,600
When is the right time to throw out a pair of underwear?

1367
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,840
Should you be waiting until it's undeniably unrecoverable and ripped and stained?

1368
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,440
What if they're mostly serviceable with only a small tear or small mark?

1369
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,960
Oh, God.

1370
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,280
Or just a bit fake magic.

1371
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,040
Challenging episode.

1372
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,680
I don't want to be wasteful, but I also don't want to be economical to the point of being

1373
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,560
disgusting.

1374
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,480
That's from Pantsless and Perry.

1375
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,080
That's from Matthew Perry.

1376
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,800
He's a dirty boy with dirty undergarments.

1377
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,160
When should you put your underwear onto the ice floe and send it out to death?

1378
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,320
Shoot it with a flaming arrow as it.

1379
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,360
Oh, gosh.

1380
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:56,480
I think rule of thumb is if you would be embarrassed for somebody else to see your underwear, you

1381
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,440
should throw it right away.

1382
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,760
But don't we all have one or two pairs at the bottom of the rotation that's just like,

1383
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,600
ah, I didn't have time.

1384
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,960
That's one that has an ink stain from where the pen broke in my pocket.

1385
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,720
Like, ah, it's three weeks since last time I did laundry.

1386
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,400
I'm going to wear old ink staining.

1387
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,680
For Christmas one year, daddy got me.

1388
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:25,360
But this story is troubling now that I think about it, that my daddy's keeping me in underwears.

1389
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,960
But daddy got me a pair of Xbox branded underwear that has the Xbox logo all over it.

1390
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,480
And on the front it says game, and on the back it says on.

1391
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,560
And that pair of underwear, first of all, I should have shot with a flaming arrow while

1392
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,440
dad had it in his hands, handed it to me for Christmas.

1393
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,440
It would have been very dangerous because my dad is allergic to flaming arrows.

1394
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,360
But I should have just blown it sort of straight out of his hands right there and then.

1395
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,240
But I did not.

1396
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,320
Instead, it has served as like my blue line on the toothbrush head to let me know that

1397
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,920
it's time to do laundry.

1398
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,880
Because if I get down to wearing my Xbox boxers, I should have done laundry two or three days

1399
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,380
ago.

1400
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,160
I've allowed myself to get too late.

1401
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:08,880
It's a punishment.

1402
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,200
I've allowed myself to get to a point where I have no clothes left because all of them

1403
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,240
have my natural stink sort of boiled into it.

1404
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,760
Stink sort of boiled into them.

1405
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,720
And now I have to have the shame and embarrassment of when I bend over to pick up, you know,

1406
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,320
a wee nunchuck while my friends are over.

1407
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:32,160
And then they see game on my boxers.

1408
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,920
And they say, what is that all about?

1409
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,400
And I have to explain, these are my daddy Xbox boxers.

1410
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:44,560
Can I just say that if in speaking about your underpants, the word stained enters into it,

1411
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,160
they should have been gone before you emailed us.

1412
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,160
Here's my- here's a yardstick.

1413
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,440
Here's a good yardstick.

1414
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:58,240
If you saw those underwear lying on the ground outside, would you throw them in the trash?

1415
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,280
If so, it's probably priceless.

1416
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,240
Well, hold on, Justin.

1417
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:00,720
If you saw-

1418
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,920
Hold on, what's the other-

1419
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,040
No, let him finish his terrible, terrible, terrible example.

1420
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,920
If you saw these underwear outside and you're like, I can write Dusty's Bad Boys off.

1421
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,360
Oh, Jesus.

1422
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,800
Get a few miles out of them, then I think it's probably okay.

1423
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,280
I will say this, if I see some me undies laying on the ground outside,

1424
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,640
I do not care the quality of them.

1425
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,480
I will resuscitate them back to life.

1426
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,960
It will not require much work because they are stain proof, tear proof, moisture proof.

1427
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,960
When the apocalypse happens, I'm going to build a bunker out of me undies

1428
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,720
and I will be the only living man after that.

1429
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,840
That's how you go glamping.

1430
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,880
You're wearing me undies.

1431
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,680
Yeah, for sure.

1432
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,240
Welcome to the me undies family time, fun time hour.

1433
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,240
It's so- it's wow, it's not moist in here at all.

1434
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:40,960
Yeah, I know.

1435
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,640
I know exactly what I was doing when I started this.

1436
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,200
You're welcome.

1437
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,400
When is the- God, I just- I've got a pretty hair trigger for this stuff now.

1438
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,320
One of these days I'll throw away my Xbox boxers.

1439
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,080
Maybe that'll be our 4,000 donor bonus is I will just sort of-

1440
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,320
How about if we reach 4,000 and you make a video of you shooting them with a flaming arrow?

1441
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:58,480
Yeah.

1442
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,280
Can you guarantee that?

1443
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,400
Or a calendar with the three of us all wearing them at the same time?

1444
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:03,440
What?

1445
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,800
How do they do this?

1446
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,200
Let's just-

1447
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,840
This photoshop.

1448
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,280
Let's just do the flaming arrow thing.

1449
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,800
Okay, I think that once you start to develop holes, that is definitely out.

1450
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,280
Then they're definitely gone, especially around the waistband.

1451
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,680
I think that that- you start to get like the waistband pull away, then they've got to go.

1452
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,760
And I find that it's like a chain reaction, right?

1453
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,320
Because the first- like a couple years ago when I- and it really helped dating Teresa

1454
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,240
and her going, oh, you need to throw those away.

1455
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,320
Like your balls are hanging out.

1456
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,840
Get rid of those boxes.

1457
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,000
Where once I started doing that and I was like, oh, I should just keep doing this.

1458
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,840
I should just throw away the bat.

1459
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,320
And then I started like going through my socks and being like, okay,

1460
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,040
these socks are like ready to go and throw them away.

1461
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,600
And it's this wonderfully adult.

1462
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,960
So then you re-gift them and you give them to your cousin and say,

1463
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,600
now you can have these gross underpants and socks.

1464
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,640
Now these are yours.

1465
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,760
I have to go.

1466
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,600
I have a lot of grinder business to get to.

1467
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,200
Time is a flat circle.

1468
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,800
Travis, you- sorry.

1469
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,840
I got to circle back to something, speaking of flat circles.

1470
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,000
You did mention that your balls are hanging on your boxers.

1471
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,320
I am curious how you get holes in the front of your boxers.

1472
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,840
Is your dick a werewolf?

1473
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,160
No, no.

1474
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,800
This was in the, in the taint of the boxers.

1475
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,280
We're done here.

1476
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,520
Oh, another great episode of my-

1477
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,960
That'll be $30, please.

1478
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,640
Time to wipe off the grease paint.

1479
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,720
One last time, maximumfund.org first I should donate.

1480
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,880
Please, please, please help us out.

1481
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,040
We joke about being rich, but that was just a bit for the show.

1482
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,080
And you can keep those bids coming if you go donate

1483
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,080
at maximumfund.org first slash donate.

1484
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,040
Chip in whenever you can.

1485
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,800
You know, we don't charge for the stuff on the network

1486
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,920
because we think people who want it to keep coming will,

1487
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,080
will pay money to make sure that that happens.

1488
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,960
So please take a moment right now.

1489
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,520
Don't wait.

1490
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,240
Don't hesitate.

1491
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,600
Don't regulate.

1492
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,240
Just go to maximumfund.org first slash donate.

1493
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,120
Tickets are still on sale for our Chicago show

1494
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,040
for our Midwest mini tour.

1495
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,160
If you want to go to that, just go to bit.ly

1496
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,720
four slash MBMBAM Chicago.

1497
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,960
And you will find a ticket links there.

1498
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,120
If you are going to one of the shows,

1499
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,040
either in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, or Chicago,

1500
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,160
make sure you send us an email with the name of the city

1501
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,400
that you're going to the show in, in the subject line

1502
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,960
and let us know so we can answer your question

1503
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,840
in a live studio environment.

1504
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,960
Don't forget to tweet using the maxfund drive hashtag.

1505
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,480
So you can be entered to win that free tick to max fun con.

1506
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,840
And if you can fit it in,

1507
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,040
throwing in the maximumfund.org slash donate link

1508
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,200
would also be great or the MBMBAM hashtag,

1509
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,560
because like, it'd be great to know

1510
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,400
that it was one of our people that won that thing.

1511
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,080
If you have any ideas for a tattoo,

1512
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,680
I can get to celebrate our 2,500 donors.

1513
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,440
Well, you know, I've been thinking about,

1514
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,400
I am putting it off.

1515
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,280
I've been putting it off.

1516
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,640
I've been putting, what better time?

1517
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,080
So if you have an idea for one, tweet at me and let me know.

1518
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,160
And then when the drive is over,

1519
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,080
I will let everyone know what I've gone with.

1520
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,480
And then I'll post all kinds of pictures when I get it.

1521
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,480
Do they get to decide on the part of your body it goes on to?

1522
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,480
Dick.

1523
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,800
Well, I don't think so.

1524
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,920
Only because too many people I think would jokingly say face

1525
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,120
and I'm not going to do that.

1526
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:13,680
Yeah.

1527
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,720
Would it be better?

1528
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,920
Could you, could you get one that's on your penis

1529
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,200
that said welcome aboard?

1530
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,400
So instead of it's a MBMBAM references,

1531
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,400
the down periscope reference, would that be better?

1532
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,240
Well, I think that most people are clamoring

1533
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,160
for more down periscope references.

1534
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,640
So maybe what I, the two I'm thinking about right now

1535
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,800
is middle list in very flowing script.

1536
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,520
And then either that or a cartoon ghost horse.

1537
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,920
Please just wow Travis with a design

1538
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,280
and maybe he'll get that.

1539
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:41,680
I don't know.

1540
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:42,880
Sounds good to me.

1541
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,880
Also, while the drive is going,

1542
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,280
go listen to the other maximum fun shows.

1543
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:48,960
We do other shows.

1544
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,040
Justin does a medical history show called Sawbones

1545
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,080
with his wife, Sydney.

1546
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,560
Travis does a show called Bunker Buddies with his buddy, Andy.

1547
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,200
And the three of us do the adventure zone with our dad,

1548
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,360
which is a Dungeons and Dragons podcast that-

1549
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,080
We just had a Bunker Buddies, Sawbones crossover episode

1550
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,000
where Sydney came on to talk to us

1551
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,840
about plagues and global plagues.

1552
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,480
Oh, that's awesome.

1553
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,320
It's very, very fun and very informative.

1554
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,200
I highly recommend it.

1555
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:09,840
So check it out.

1556
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,280
But go listen to the other shows of the network too.

1557
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,280
Jordan and Jesse go stop podcasting yourself,

1558
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,000
throwing shade.

1559
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,640
Rendered is a really good one.

1560
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,400
I've been listening to that one a lot.

1561
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,600
You are, I promise you will really dig Rendered.

1562
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,080
So check that out.

1563
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,040
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

1564
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:23,600
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

1565
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,800
That we talked about early in the show.

1566
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,520
Flophouse.

1567
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,560
Flophouse, Pop Rocket.

1568
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,080
There's infinity shows

1569
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,400
and they're putting out their best stuff during the drive.

1570
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,280
So go listen to it.

1571
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,200
Did you just thank John Roderick?

1572
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,000
No, will you do it?

1573
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,400
Thanks, John Roderick and the long winners

1574
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,360
for the use of our theme song.

1575
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,440
It's a departure off the album, put the days to bed.

1576
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,200
Thanks again to Lin-Manuel Miranda for the bonus song,

1577
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,040
the fugue for brother horns.

1578
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,000
And if you're in New York in like the summer,

1579
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,120
go see Hamilton.

1580
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,560
It's amazing and it's great.

1581
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,680
It's from this summer through the end of time

1582
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,400
because that show is going to be the biggest goddamn thing ever.

1583
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,800
It's absolutely astonishing and very,

1584
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,000
like the best thing I've ever seen.

1585
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,040
So yeah, you're gonna dig that.

1586
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,560
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo?

1587
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,320
Yeah, this final Yahoo was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

1588
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:12,960
Thank you, Zoe.

1589
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Timelordess.

1590
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,600
Finally, the goddamn website loaded.

1591
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:24,720
And who asks, not actually a question, James Spader?

1592
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,520
I'm Justin McElroy.

1593
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,480
He's Travis McElroy.

1594
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,600
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1595
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,040
This has been my brother and me.

1596
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:48,640
Kiss your dads, wear on the lips.

1597
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,520
Maximumfun.org.

1598
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,560
Comedy and culture.

1599
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,680
Artist owned.

1600
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,640
Listener supported.

1601
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,000
We're Dave and Graham and we host Stop Piecasting Yourself.

1602
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,200
We started this podcast back in 2008.

1603
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,760
Before podcasts had to have any kind of concept,

1604
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,680
so we don't really know how to describe it.

1605
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,760
It's kind of like going to the barber shop

1606
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,400
if your barber knew all about the first season of the show Elf.

1607
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,080
It's like a 90 minute massage

1608
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,600
where the masseuse is two people talking to each other with a third person.

1609
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,240
It's like the Monsters of Metal tour,

1610
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:33,040
only quieter, no music, and just talking.

1611
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,720
It's like a makeout session,

1612
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,440
but without the lips touching, they just talk a lot.
