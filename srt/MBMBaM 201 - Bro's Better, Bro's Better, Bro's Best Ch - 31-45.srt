1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,080
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Well, I'm your middle-est brother, but for the purposes of this, I'm your youngest brother, too.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm both. I'm both brothers. I'm the middle-est and the youngest.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,480
Yes, because we are without Griffin right now. Don't worry,

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,440
we're not going to do a whole episode without him. Rather than-

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,600
No, that would be pretty great.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
He's out of town, and rather than just leaving you all hanging,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,320
we wanted to put together another best of episode. This encompasses our 31st

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,520
through our 45th episode, and there is so much good stuff. Bramblepelt, I think is in this one,

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,120
Padula Kitten, Chin Deep and Chinchillas, all the classics.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,560
I don't remember any of those babies.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
I know. Well, just wait, you're going to hear about them.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,160
All of those were animal-based. Do we do a lot of animal-based humor on the show?

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,440
All animal and penis-based humor in these early episodes, for sure.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,720
Okay, nice, nice.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,320
We wanted to mention, first off, we'll jump back in with you here in the middle,

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:56,240
but we wanted to mention right up front, we're doing a live show in Los Angeles, California,

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,240
and that's going to be on June 13th, 7.30 p.m. at the Downtown Independent Theater.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,480
Ticket sales are going to begin May 21st, that's this Wednesday, at 3 p.m. Eastern.

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,760
That's noon Pacific, and you are not going to want to miss out because they are going to go

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
fast. There's only going to be about 200 tickets available, and they will go fast because we're

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,240
doing a show with Jordan Jesse Go, Double Bell, Explosion. It's going to be huge,

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,640
and you are going to want to be there for it because it's going to be awesome.

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
So, there's one show, and it goes on sale.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,320
And we cannot add more, people.

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:46,160
We cannot add more. So, Wednesday at noon Eastern, and 3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,960
3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific. And you can get those at mbmbam.brownpapertickets.com.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,800
mbmbam.brownpapertickets.com.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
Okay, time for highlights. We'll see you in a few.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,960
Like the Chilean miners emerging from the cre-

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,760
You can't bust that out every week.

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
Like Chilean miners.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,440
Is that a reboot? Is that what this is? Are we refreshing the franchise?

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,280
This is just celebrating the hardworking miners of Chile.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,920
Of what?

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,400
This isn't like about anything. I'm just glad that they're there.

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,760
Oh, yeah. My screen breaks coming up, too. You want to maybe go to Chile?

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,080
Maybe we could go chill on the beaches of Chile.

44
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,480
It's like Chilean miners emerging from a mine. We've returned for another week of-

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
You know, a lot of people, a lot of people liked that when I did it

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,040
right after those famous guys came out. So I thought, what if I brought it back?

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,920
I mean, Chilean miners are still coming out of mines.

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,520
Sure, yeah. They haven't stopped, I hope.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,400
Right? I mean, they're going in there getting butane and gold.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know. They're getting butane?

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
They go down there with just plastic shopping bags and they just scoop up the bute.

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,600
Be open to receiving communications in varying ways.

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,720
For example, your dream may be filled with a conversation with a dead person,

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
or the dream may be filled with images, colors, or symbols.

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,240
I had this dream where I ate a giant sandwich. What do you think Hitler was trying to tell me?

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,720
It was very colorful, the sandwich, and symbolic in a way.

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,760
Yeah. As an example, the dead person may say to you,

58
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,960
I can't get through to your mother. She isn't picking up the phone.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,080
Let me try that again.

60
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Could you try her for me? Maybe send her a text.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,560
Let me try again. As an example, the dead person may say to you,

62
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,240
I can't get through to your mother. She isn't picking up the phone.

63
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,760
Obviously, there is no spirit phone, you dumb fuck.

64
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,640
You dumb shit.

65
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,760
Hey, dummy. But it's the dead person's way of saying

66
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,000
that they're coming to you because the other person isn't open to communicating with the dead.

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,040
And rather than say that, they brought up the complicated idea of a phone.

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,880
Travis, listen. There's imagery, there's colors, and there's symbols.

69
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,640
The spirit phone is a symbol.

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,080
Your mom-moms don't talk to ghosts. Tell your mom to stop being such a prudish

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
bitch. I'm trying to get your noodle.

72
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,400
So, if I have a dream in which I'm in Pee Wee's Playhouse,

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,960
and all of the talking furniture sounds like Charles Nelson Reilly, what's going on?

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,240
Ghosts of Charles Nelson Reilly. Is he still alive?

75
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
He's trapped in Paul Reuben's house. He's buried underneath Paul Reuben's house.

76
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
Paul Reuben killed Charles Nelson Reilly. Buried him in the cellar.

77
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,680
Now he makes the corpses of Charles Nelson Reilly watch him eat dinner.

78
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
It's a really weird arrangement they have.

79
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,640
Mystery solved.

80
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
Mystery solved.

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,960
It would have gotten away if it weren't for us meddling kids.

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,680
This question was asked by Yahoo Answers user Nat Ilf, who asked,

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,040
what is the heaviest babby to ever be birthed?

84
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Jesus.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,840
Really? Again with the babby?

86
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
Again with the babby.

87
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Fucking cut it out.

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
She goes on to ask,

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,280
I am pregnant, due on Christmas, and the doctors say my babby is very heavy.

90
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,040
I think they said he was going to be 175 pounds.

91
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,040
Can I do anything to make my babby smaller?

92
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
I am really worried about the labor.

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
That's going to be a wicked labor.

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,440
Wow.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
You will most certainly die.

96
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,120
Your lower section will open up, it will bloom like a flower,

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,800
when you pass that 175 pound man through your lady tubes.

98
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,880
Let's be honest, this guy's wearing her like an inner tube right now.

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
He's just walking around with his mom around his waist.

100
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,200
Sure.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,360
It's vulgar.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
He's already applying for jobs.

103
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
It's pretty awful.

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,760
Is this like an early onset, early onset, like, Jack disease?

105
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,880
Is that what's going on here?

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
You think that job market is up right now.

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,040
Now, try going in with your mom with her skin stretched out all around your hands and feet.

108
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,280
I see a human face sticking out of your chest, like, through the skin.

109
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,160
What is going on?

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
We're both applying.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,000
You hire both of us, or you hire neither of us, unless it's a very compelling offer,

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,120
and then I will consider a late-term abortion.

113
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
Although, you know what?

114
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
You know what, conservatives?

115
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
That is one area where if you abort a full-grown man,

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
I think I can get on board with you that that should be a crime.

117
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
When does consent, when does life begin?

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,520
I think once you have stubble, I think definitely life is officially begun.

119
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
At six, yeah.

120
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,960
Sure.

121
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
Life begins at six feet.

122
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,440
How bad, I don't even care about the miscommunication.

123
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
Like, how bad have you been at weights, your whole life?

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,960
You don't, like, that doesn't immediately, like, whoa, did you say 175?

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,080
That sounds like a hefty person.

126
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,320
You only weigh 130 pounds.

127
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,280
You physically can't, unless your urethra is a TARDIS,

128
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,880
there is literally no way that you could have that in you.

129
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,440
It's like, no, it's like the genie bottle, you see.

130
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,200
And I just said urethra as if that was some kind of body part

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,840
that's involved in the passing of babies through humans.

132
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
That is, in fact, the tube that a man's urine goes out, right?

133
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,880
Ladies have them, don't ladies have them too?

134
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,200
Like, I don't know, you may know a doctor.

135
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
So the urethra is where your baby is.

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,040
You're going to pee out that 175 pound baby through your urethra,

137
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,720
and it's going to be the worst day of your life.

138
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah.

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Enjoy that, elf.

140
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,720
You're a dead woman.

141
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
My boyfriend and I joke around and call each other by fun pet names,

142
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
like chump and punk.

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
What are some names I could call him,

144
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
or what have you called boyfriends or girlfriends?

145
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
I usually call my girlfriends chump or punk.

146
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,760
So I'm fresh out of solutions.

147
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,560
You could combine it and just call him Chunk.

148
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
Yeah, or Pump.

149
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,880
Sydney and Sidney, Sidney and Sidney, this is uncommon don't.

150
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,440
Is that normal?

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
Is that okay?

152
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
This is my girlfriend.

153
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,840
This is my girlfriend, Chunk Pump.

154
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
I love her very much.

155
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
She's very sweet.

156
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,520
This is my girlfriend, the captain.

157
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
I really love her very much.

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
I really love her very much.

159
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
She's a real sweetheart.

160
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
Chunk Pump makes me think of like the old timey way

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
that pioneers used to get creamed corn up out of the ground.

162
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,480
Got a deep vein here.

163
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
This is a nice vein.

164
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,000
It's rich.

165
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
Let me get out my creamed corn dowsing machine.

166
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,520
It's made of creamed corn.

167
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,680
Why wouldn't it be just like fossilized?

168
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
I hold a scoop of creamed corn in my left hand,

169
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
and it leads me home.

170
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
Where are you going?

171
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,400
I think we can find some elucidation

172
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,640
in the answers that have been provided.

173
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
Okay, that's good.

174
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,520
Anastasia responded.

175
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
Mr. Sweetsie Poo.

176
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,800
Lovey Snookums.

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Cuddly Kints.

178
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,320
Huggy Bear.

179
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,280
Love Muffin.

180
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,080
Snuggly Pie.

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Boo Boo Bear.

182
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

183
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
Hi, I'm Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm Professor Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

185
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm Bon Bon Bon Sugar Lips.

186
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,480
The next thing is the best thing I've ever read.

187
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,080
Badoodly Kitten.

188
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,580
What?

189
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Say that one more time.

190
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,080
Badoodly Kitten.

191
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Can I get one more?

192
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,480
Just take me to the bridge.

193
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,160
A Badoodly Kitten.

194
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,920
That would be B-apostrophe-D-oodly Kitten.

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
I didn't know that we could just like say sounds

196
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
and like mash them together.

197
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Like, Raquantia.

198
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
Like, Raquantia?

199
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,760
Like, that's Badoodly Kitten.

200
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I sensed from this email that you guys love each other.

201
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,240
I can tell that.

202
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
I sense a love there.

203
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,360
But it sounds like you guys are one good long conversation

204
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
away from getting this sorted out.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Sounds like a convo needs to take place.

206
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,000
If it's not gonna work out, there's always Griffin.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
He's, I can give you his phone number.

208
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
He's super nice.

209
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,200
Please, ladies.

210
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,200
Ripe for the picking.

211
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
Like a delicious cherry.

212
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,840
One might even say overripe.

213
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,840
One might say he's developed some tendencies

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,120
during his year of solitude that maybe are not so attractive.

215
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
Maybe a few bruises on the fruit.

216
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Maybe my rind is a little moldy, figuratively and literally.

217
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
Ladies are guys.

218
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
Line forms to the left.

219
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,120
Yeah, I'm not so picky anymore.

220
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
Just anybody.

221
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,880
Just take him.

222
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
Yeah, I got one.

223
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
I've been staring at it the whole show.

224
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,360
It's like a deep dark pit, this question.

225
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
I think we just got to dive into it,

226
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
even though we don't know where it'll stop.

227
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
It was sent in by Goodbye Babylon Babylon,

228
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,920
which wasn't that a, is that a David Gray song?

229
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,360
I don't know.

230
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ruby Heart McKinley, who asks,

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,280
what are some good warrior cat names?

232
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,440
What?

233
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,760
Excuse me?

234
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,440
I need five warrior names.

235
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
Three names for three black cats, one for a white cat,

236
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,840
and one for a brown cat, please.

237
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,400
I have no fucking idea what's going on with this question.

238
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,080
There's no more details?

239
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,480
That's it.

240
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,680
Please tell me there's more details.

241
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,400
Wait a minute.

242
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,360
That's all we've got.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
Warrior cat names.

244
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,400
Now, let me read you some of the answers.

245
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
This one was sent in by Josie J. Feather McKaney,

246
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
or rather it was answered.

247
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,520
The answer was provided by Josie J. Feather Mulcainy, who-

248
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Hey, there's your first name.

249
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,600
Name one, done.

250
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Who says, I love creating warrior names.

251
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,920
Smiley face.

252
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,840
Here's some for black cats.

253
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,240

258
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,280
Oh, Jesus.

259
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,560
Here's some for white cats.

260
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,840
Lilypad, Lilyheart, Lilymoon, White Shadow, White Claw,

261
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,480
White Knight, White Moon, White Rose, White Leap, White Thorn,

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,520
Snowfall, Ice Wind, Frostbite, Frostpool, Snow Song.

263
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Here's some for brown cats.

What about Calicas?

268
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,480
You got a Calica?

269
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,840
Hodgepodge, black and white, and orange.

270
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,280
Silly, buddy.

271
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,720
Mixed up.

272
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,160
Oh, Jesus Christ.

273
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,720
I mean, guys, there's a full page.

274
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,520
There's a full page of people providing answers.

275
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
Could you read the first name for the white cats again?

276
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,120
The first name.

277
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
No, I can't.

278
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,080
There's so many that I can't repeat them.

279
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm almost certain it was Lilypad.

280
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Lilypad was one of them.

281
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,920
That is not a scary warrior name.

282
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,160
Hey, Griffin, do you have any ideas on warrior names for brown cats?

283
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
Let's see what the other people have to say.

284
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,160
Brown cat, Bramble Pelt, Sun Fern, Sand Dust, Sandy Pelt,

285
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,640
Sandy Mist, Sand Pelt, Tabby Claw, Sand Claw,

286
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,760
Sandy Claw, Dust Claw, Sparrow Flight, Autumn Flight,

287
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
Trout Leap, Morning Dew, Mouth Fang.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
Trout Leap?

289
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,160
Rose Whisker.

290
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
Like, what the fuck?

291
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,960
What is a warrior cat?

292
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,160
This is why I am scared for humanity.

293
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Every answer to that question should have been,

294
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
what the fuck are you talking about?

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Aurora Song.

296
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,600
Like, what are we doing?

297
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,920
This is this horrifying truth that we've unearthed with this show,

298
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
is that there are whole other worlds.

299
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,560
Yeah.

300
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,440
Yeah, there are whole other things that don't connect to us.

301
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Like, we don't have any vines into them,

302
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,520
reaching into them to give us some connection.

303
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,440
It's a completely different planet that's just spinning wildly of its own accord.

304
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,760
We have some wild misconceptions about the furry community

305
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,400
that I feel like we now understand and totally accept into our hearts and collective minds.

306
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,400
But what?

307
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,200
Bramble Song.

308
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,320
What?

309
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,720
I mean-

310
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,360
Bramble Pelt.

311
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,400
Snowy Pelt.

312
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,200
Bramble Pelt.

313
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,720
What are we doing here?

314
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,760
Child Jump.

315
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm not angry.

316
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm a little angry.

317
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm scared.

318
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
I just want to know what's going on.

319
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,840
Like, are people dressing up their cats in, like, tinfoil armor and, like,

320
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,760
just, like, taking them outside and just yelling,

321
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,480
Hidden Mist!

322
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,760
Star Chaser!

323
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,320
Like-

324
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,560
Go!

325
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,600
Here's what I want.

326
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,640
I want to see this guy actually picks five warrior cat names

327
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,960
and tries to get them to all follow him in the battle.

328
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,040
Star Chaser.

329
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,280
Go!

330
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
Go!

331
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,640
What?

332
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,040
Bram- Bram- Bramble Sky, you're just licking your butt.

333
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,680
This is not a warrior, like, attitude, thorn prick.

334
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,400
Oh, God.

335
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
Apparently you're having babies every year,

336
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
so maybe with two wives you could alternate it

337
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
and they could at least have a year off.

338
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,040
Yeah, I know you're worried about your wife being worn out,

339
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,320
and at this rate she will be.

340
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,280
So I would say get a second wife to maybe carry one of the twins.

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,000
Is that-

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,040
Is that possible?

343
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
A brood wife.

344
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,120
Yes.

345
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,680
Get yourself a brood wife.

346
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
And then, like, one can be your society wife,

347
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,920
and then one can be your, you know, your gestating hive queen.

348
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,280
Hive-

349
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,160
This is-

350
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,880
This is, uh, this is my second wife, Crystal.

351
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,360
Cris-

352
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,000
Chrysalis.

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,880
Chrysalis.

354
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Her name is Crystal.

355
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,040
It's not Chrysalis.

356
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,560
I don't know why I thought that.

357
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,360
And her name is also not DX173pon, so I don't believe people saying that either.

358
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,520
And I certainly have-

359
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
I have never considered harvesting her jellies.

360
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,040
For Valentine's Day, I got you a second wife in a tank of plasma,

361
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,280
and we're just gonna use her to harvest organs and babies from.

362
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
You're welcome.

363
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
You're welcome.

364
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,560
What did you get me?

365
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Oh, a Stone Temple pilot CD.

366
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Thank you.

367
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,120
This one is, uh, this one's by yahoo answers user dragon101, who asks,

368
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm a dragon.

369
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,360
Okay.

370
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,480
But I don't know how to summon my special skills.

371
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,960
I can do some things unordinary.

372
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
Anyone have ideas?

373
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
This is kind of new, uh, and also confusing for my age, that is.

374
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
I can tell you right now that I'm under 21.

375
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,520
Anyone have ideas on what I could do because I'm a dragon?

376
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,080
Please?

377
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
Well, this is the age old question of, is it a mental thing?

378
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
Is there a muscle that you flex?

379
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,480
Is there an incantation?

380
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
It's age old questions, you know?

381
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,880
And really, it's different strokes for different folks.

382
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,840
Like for me, uh, for me, it's all muscular.

383
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,720
Yeah.

384
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,960
I've had to tone, um, I've had to develop.

385
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,120
You've had to kegel?

386
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,400
I've had to kegel my dragon muscles, um, to the, to the point where I can, um, you know,

387
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,120
execute my, my unordinary abilities.

388
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
But the thing is 21.

389
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,120
That's a, that's kind of a, you're a little late to the game.

390
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,760
You are.

391
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,280
You're getting a late start to learning your, your dragon as in the old tongue, uh,

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,560
Your draconic,

393
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,720
Your draconic abilities.

394
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Cause I mean, that's a, that's a weird age.

395
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
Dragon puberty.

396
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,400
Like, um, I had mine in middle school.

397
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
I was kind of an early bloomer.

398
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,120
You know, some things just hit me in the third age, but it was a long time ago.

399
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,680
Okay.

400
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,080
Yeah.

401
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm, I just become, I just became so terrified because I just realized that dragons have

402
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,320
learned to use the internet and we've lost our one vantage.

403
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
The one thing we had that they didn't.

404
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,600
I don't know how to break this to you, but one out of every four people you talk to or

405
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
meet on the internet is a dragon.

406
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,040
Holy shit.

407
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,480
Holy shit.

408
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
Is that a velociraptor noise?

409
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,360
Travis.

410
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,840
Oh shit.

411
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,440
Travis is one of them.

412
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,360
I didn't know this was a dragon cast.

413
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,160
If dragons aren't using the internet, then explain TMZ.

414
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
You can't, it can't be done.

415
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,040
Fuck dragons.

416
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,760
Made by, made by, gossip by dragons for dragons.

417
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
Perez Hilton, half dragon.

418
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,440
What does a dragon keyboard look like?

419
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
Do you think it has runes?

420
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
I think it has runes.

421
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
I think it's very runic.

422
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
I think it's made out of like loot.

423
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
It's made out of what?

424
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,640
It's got a loot, like dragon loot.

425
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,320
Dragons have hoards, right?

426
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,000
Just full of like jewels and gold.

427
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,880
Travis, a loot.

428
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,800
Oh, L-O-O-T, not L-U-T-E.

429
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,040
You think you made it met several little stringed instruments?

430
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
Like that's what his keyboard was made out of?

431
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,160
I couldn't, I couldn't.

432
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,960
Like Sting?

433
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
Like Sting plays?

434
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,560
Yes.

435
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Sting's a dragon?

436
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
This one was sent in by Matt Warren.

437
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,480
Thank you, Matt Warren.

438
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Megan who asked,

439
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,440
I need help naming my chinchilla breeding business.

440
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,160
Hello, I am looking into breeding chinchillas,

441
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,080
but I need a name for my company.

442
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
I want it to be something elegant and pretty,

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,960
and the last word needs to be chinchillas or exotics.

444
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
I don't want anything that says Megan's or Ontario's, etc.

445
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,760
I also don't want silly names like Jenny Chin Chin's.

446
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,040
That's the best.

447
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,480
That's the best one, though.

448
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,800
It needs to sound sophisticated.

449
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,240
For example, some names I like are Blue Moon Chinchillas,

450
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,120
Blue Moon Exotics, Autumn Breeze Chinchillas,

451
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,240
Autumn Breeze Exotics, White Rose Chinchillas,

452
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
White Rose Exotics.

453
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,680
If you need any other information, just ask.

454
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,120
Also, if you want to add in some possible chinchilla names,

455
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
I wouldn't mind.

456
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,440
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

457
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,080
Bramble Pelt.

458
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
Thanks for everything, Megan.

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720
Storm Scream.

460
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,680
Night Shadow.

461
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,600
Can I suggest Fluffy Rats Exotics?

462
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,680
Because that says what they are without it coming right out

463
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,040
and saying chinchillas.

464
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,720
Chinchillas have been on the nose.

465
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,960
Can I suggest Chin Deep?

466
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,560
Chin Deep.

467
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
Now, it does have to end with chinchillas or exotics.

468
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
Those are the rules.

469
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,840
Chin Deep Exotics?

470
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,040
Oh, that's not good.

471
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
That's not a good...

472
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,440
That doesn't work for me at a few levels.

473
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,680
That sounds like a website that opens up when you're on

474
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,200
another website you shouldn't be on accidentally.

475
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Ready to go chin deep?

476
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,440
How did you get chin deep?

477
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,680
Why is it that when someone started dumping exotics,

478
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,440
when it got waist deep, you weren't like,

479
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,720
ow, it didn't happen all at once?

480
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
I am chin deep in exotics right now.

481
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
That pit of exotics doesn't look so deep.

482
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
I'm going to jump in and just see how it goes.

483
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm chin deep.

484
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,760
What about speed rats?

485
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,880
Speed rats.

486
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,320
Because that's what chinchillas are.

487
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,600
They're like rats, but they dart back and forth very quickly.

488
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,280
Erotic exotics.

489
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,480
Okay, now we're on to something.

490
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,280
Yeah, that's good.

491
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
It's got like a little flow to it.

492
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,040
What about Mussolini's chinchillas?

493
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,520
I mean, you want something classy.

494
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,400
Something classy.

495
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
How about Sacco chinchillas?

496
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,960
Sacco chinchillas.

497
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,680
And then your best thing is like you already have a gimmick.

498
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,960
So like people come in, you're like,

499
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
how about a Sacco chinchillas?

500
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
And like they can pay extra for the grab bag

501
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
and who knows what's in the grab bag.

502
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,440
Spoiler alert, dead chinchillas.

503
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,440
There's a good one.

504
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,880
People come in like, hey, what the fuck, man?

505
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
And you're like, no, no, no, they're very much alive.

506
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,240
Would you like one?

507
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,240
It's pronounced the odd.

508
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
How about tiny shitty cats?

509
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,920
Chinchillas, exotics.

510
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,560
There's gotta be something.

511
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,800
I think we've got a curiosity.

512
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,480
Are there any answers on that question?

513
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,920
Yeah, there's gotta be some, right?

514
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,280
I mean, they're all, but they're all very,

515
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,720
how about clueless money grubbers are us?

516
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,080
That's a little mean.

517
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,720
Excuse me?

518
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,760
Breeding any animals, not a business or a company.

519
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
They're not definitely a profit.

520
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm ruining things.

521
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,960
Oh God.

522
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,320
Oh God.

523
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,640
Ragged Telecaster says, I don't know about names,

524
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
but I'll breed with your chinchillas if you like.

525
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,400
Oh no.

526
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
Dude, what?

527
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,720
What did you say to me?

528
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,720
You'll breed.

529
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
Here, do it on site and call it the worst thing

530
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,840
you've ever seen chinchillas.

531
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
The Island of Dr.

532
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,320
Moreau chinchillas.

533
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
A nightmare circus sideshow.

534
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,760
Everything you've ever feared in your life, chinchillas.

535
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,280
How about just chinchilla?

536
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,160
Maybe want to die.

537
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
How about loose and easy chinchillas?

538
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,080
Madam chinchillas.

539
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
Yahoo answers user Emerald a responded.

540
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
I like autumn breeze exotics,

541
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,480
but I am thinking chinny chinny chill la la chinchilla cool cats.

542
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,800
Or chinchilla cc's for short.

543
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,520
Chinchilla cc's what?

544
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,120
It is good to start out the name with C

545
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,960
because one of the first listed in directories.

546
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,360
And how about chinny chilled out cats?

547
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,160
Lol.

548
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,560
What the fuck are you saying?

549
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,320
Chinny chilled out cats?

550
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
How about fun dip baseball disco dance?

551
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,920
Like how about we just make a bunch of words

552
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,000
that have nothing to do with the thing that she asked about?

553
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,680
So he says you should pick something with a C

554
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
because it's one of the first letters.

555
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Like you know the first one right dog?

556
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,720
Yeah, maybe a few pages in the directory

557
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,280
that precede chinny chilled out cats.

558
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
You dumb fuck.

559
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,000
To be fair, everyone knows everyone just skips right over A and B

560
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
because those are for pussies.

561
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
You got to go right into the C.

562
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,560
That's where the meat of the matter is.

563
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,240
Absolutely amazing chinny chin chin chilla cats.

564
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,920
Aardvarks chin chinchillas.

565
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,800
This is what you call your business.

566
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,280
Aardvarks and chinchillas and not aardvarks.

567
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,600
Aardvarks, chinchillas, and just kidding about the aardvark exotics.

568
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,440
Just do a rebus with a picture of an aardvark plus chinchilla minus aardvark.

569
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,600
Because everybody knows that in the film book rebuses come first.

570
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,440
Go on in and watch a grown man fuck a chinchilla.

571
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,160
The rebus for that is going to be a nightmare.

572
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,120
Here at aardvarks, chinchillas, and not aardvarks.

573
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,840
I came here to fuck aardvarks and chinchillas and we're fresh out of aardvarks.

574
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,880
Would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list?

575
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,760
Um, well, there's there's additional details,

576
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,280
but I feel like we need to address the first question first.

577
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,240
Would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list?

578
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,560
It sounds like he's asking his parents never explained sex.

579
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I mean, that seems like a pretty important present.

580
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,280
If they skipped out on that, that I don't know about you guys.

581
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,720
I received a series of lectures.

582
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,040
Yeah, I think it's funny that he has to outsmart his parents about it.

583
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,680
Like, oh, you got me.

584
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,480
All right.

585
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,840
I guess you got to have the talk now.

586
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
You did put it on your list.

587
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,240
Good call.

588
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,600
Uh, does, is this question asker wanting this information?

589
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,280
Like, are they in need of this?

590
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,640
Like, they know how to ask Yahoo to ask their parents?

591
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
Let me, let me bust out the additional details.

592
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,540
Okay.

593
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
I'm 20 and still awful at it.

594
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,960
Oh no.

595
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,920
Now that, now we just broke through the crust into the creepy, creepy mantle of this question.

596
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,360
Wow, uh, so you are wanting sex tips.

597
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Oh no.

598
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,760
You want to, you want, you want to go to your mom and dad and say, hey, mom and dad, teach me how to dougie.

599
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Like, is that what you're saying?

600
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
I mean, he is saying something like that.

601
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm still terrible at it.

602
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
I need mom and dad to teach.

603
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Hey, daddy.

604
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Um, daddy, my daddy, I love you.

605
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Happy Christmas.

606
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Happy Christmas.

607
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Papa.

608
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Um, do you enjoy your bowling ball?

609
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Good.

610
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Uh, I'm trying to rearrange some guts and I could,

611
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
I could use some pro tips, daddy.

612
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Yeah.

613
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Uh, happy birthday, uh, Jesus.

614
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
And I know it's Jesus' birthday.

615
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Nothing's as a family get together, like sex tips.

616
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,760
And everything, but I'm getting laughed at over here.

617
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Um, I'm getting some, I'm getting some coital giggles that I could really do without.

618
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,760
So if you have like a strategy guide that I could crack the spine of.

619
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Hey, daddy, after Rudolph, could you jot me down some charts and maybe some diagrams?

620
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Just jot me out, like a Venn diagram of what to do and where to do it.

621
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Yeah.

622
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
How to do it.

623
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
How you do.

624
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user PoeticBBQ.

625
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
All right.

626
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Uh, who asks?

627
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Valentine's Day gift for my cougar?

628
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,760
I'm seeing an older woman, me 30, her 43,

629
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,760
and want to send her an awesome gift for Valentine's Day because I'm gone working on the road.

630
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,760
We've been seeing each other for a couple months and the coitus is pretty amazing.

631
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Oh, good.

632
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
And want to get her something that is classy, but not overbearing.

633
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Any ideas?

634
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Hey, Greg's mom, that coitus was really outstanding.

635
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,760
I don't want to put this in the creepiest way imaginable,

636
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,760
but that coitus felt really good on my genitals.

637
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
What are you saying? That's so gross.

638
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I know the perfect gift.

639
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Stop calling it coitus.

640
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Can we?

641
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Is it possible that he's referring to an older female literal cougar?

642
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
It could be.

643
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
There's some raw meat.

644
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
I mean, why do you get a jungle cat?

645
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Maybe you should just make a commitment to take care of the horrible bispecies baby you created with all your coitus.

646
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
During your coitus.

647
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,760
Listen, Deborah Cat, when you have our terrible, terrible cougar man, I will take care of him.

648
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I will raise him as my own.

649
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,760
I will raise him in public schools because he will consume the other children.

650
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,760
This is like the fifth episode in a row where we've had to talk about half-human, half-animal hybrids.

651
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,760
This is a very, very bestial podcast, and I'm not comfortable with it.

652
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Goose Man, that's what happened 20 episodes ago.

653
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Oh, man, what if Goose Man and Cougar Man got together?

654
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
I'd watch that show.

655
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
William H. Macy.

656
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
As everyone in the show.

657
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Everyone in Cougar Man and Goose Man.

658
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I will watch it.

659
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Oh, John Lithgow.

660
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,760
What a great coup for Penguin Man.

661
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,760
My name is Mike, and my wife's name is Darlene.

662
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
She's made of Snuggies.

663
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Her parents are also Mike and Darlene, and her brother's name, Mike.

664
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Wait for it. She wants to name our kids Mike and Darlene, but I think it's a bad idea.

665
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Am I overreacting?

666
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
He didn't sign it, but I'm gonna guess it's Mike.

667
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
That's a wicked bad idea.

668
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,760
His full name is Mike Mike Darlene.

669
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
I'm Darlene Micerson.

670
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
The third.

671
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
This is my brother, Mike.

672
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
His sister, Darlene.

673
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
My dog, Mark Darlene.

674
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
It's hard, family reunions.

675
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Somebody says Mike and the whole house just burns down.

676
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
What? Who? What?

677
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,760
What if every Mike you've ever known is up in the mix, up in this family?

678
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,760
What if this is some sort of, I don't know, some sort of legacy?

679
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Or a cult.

680
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Griffin, listen.

681
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
I know this is weird to say at this time.

682
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,760
It's the holidays and everything, but I have to tell you something.

683
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Okay.

684
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

685
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
No.

686
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
No.

687
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
That's either incest or adultery.

688
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
No, I saw Mike making out with Darlene.

689
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Don't do that.

690
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Don't do that.

691
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
What are you overreacting?

692
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
You are underreacting if you're taking the time to write to us instead of filing divorce proceedings.

693
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
What?

694
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
What is your name?

695
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
There's no way that that conversation doesn't go like this.

696
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Fuck it. Let's just call him Mike and Darlene.

697
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Like, there's no way it was like a coincidence that you came up with those names.

698
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,760
It's so much deeper than this because you're assuming that everybody in this situation had a choice of what the next generation of people's names are going to be, right?

699
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,760
So Mike and Darlene are either the parents of Mike or Darlene,

700
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,760
but whoever that child was had to go out in the world and find another person named Mike and Darlene that they can marry.

701
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Like, they're getting a fucking name monopoly.

702
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Yeah.

703
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Do you want to see what I'm saying?

704
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Yeah, I've played it.

705
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
No, listen, guys.

706
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
This is bad, Mike.

707
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
If we can call you Mike.

708
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Why don't you suggest naming the boy Darlene and the girl Mike?

709
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
I'd love it.

710
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Tell her that's the only condition under which you'll accept it.

711
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Mike is M-Y-K-E.

712
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
E.

713
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,760
And Darlene, you spell M-I-K-E.

714
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
It's pronounced Darlene.

715
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
It's pronounced Darlene.

716
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,760
There's a silent Mike and an invisible Darlene in there.

717
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,760
You know, silent Mike and invisible Darlene are my favorite new rap duo of 2010.

718
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Did you hear their new album? It was an EP. It was a very limited release, but it was really good.

719
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
You could only buy it if your name was Mike or Darlene.

720
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Don't prepare food in the bathtub.

721
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
It's like you guys have never given a public service announcement before.

722
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
It's like playing poker with my sister's kids.

723
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Do you want me to do one?

724
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Let me do one.

725
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,760
A hundred people every year get sucked down the drain.

726
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,760
They fucking look sharp.

727
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
See? That's all you needed.

728
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
They can play that. They can syndicate that on the radio.

729
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Do you want to try again?

730
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Yeah, let me try.

731
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
So this would be like free publicity for us, right?

732
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Yeah, totally.

733
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
In fact, if you even want to say like our names or like the name of the show.

734
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,760
All right. I want to try one.

735
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I don't have a good one.

736
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
God damn it, Justin.

737
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
I'm sorry. I thought I had it.

738
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
This is so difficult.

739
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Six people just died in the bath because of you.

740
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Yeah, they fell asleep because of how boring and awful you are.

741
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
All right, here we go.

742
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,760
If your fingers are pruney, that means it's the sin coming out.

743
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Ask Jesus. I love you.

744
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
My brother, my brother.

745
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
What?

746
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
That's brilliant.

747
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
You've just saved some lives.

748
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
That's good because it's got a religious message.

749
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,760
But also my people that earthly love is real and it's mine.

750
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,760
How about this?

751
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
How about this?

752
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,760
The temperature of your water shouldn't exceed 115 degrees or else it'll flake the flesh off of your bones.

753
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
And your baby's bones.

754
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
My brother, my brother and me.

755
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Hey, hey, hey.

756
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Don't jerk off in the bathtub.

757
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
That's awful.

758
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
My brother, my brother and me.

759
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,760
That washes down the drain and goes and mixes with everybody's water.

760
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
And then you get somebody pregnant and have to pay child support.

761
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
My brother, my brother and me.

762
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,760
The water you're in right now is like 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 percent cum.

763
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Have a good bath.

764
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
You'll never be clean again.

765
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
My brother, my brother and me.

766
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Good.

767
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:07,760

769
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
I don't want to be shit, Travis, help me.

770
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760

And I'm going to head over there right now.

But while this Web page is loading, I'm getting bored.

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
I'm bored. I was hungry.

795
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Now I'm bored.

796
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I'm really a fuzzy baby today.

797
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Clip shows made me so fuzzy.

798
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
So fussy.

799
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Travis, help me.

800
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
Entertain me.

801
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I mean, you could do what we've literally talked about a hundred times in the last couple of months and go to Huluplus.com.

802
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,760
How many of you are not Huluplus members?

803
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,760
What is wrong with you?

804
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Do you do you live in some kind of a spider hole cave type thing?

805
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Don't you want to watch The Prophet?

806
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Don't you want to watch Grim?

807
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Don't you want to watch Saturday Night Live clips?

808
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Don't you want to?

809
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I mean, like it's all on there waiting for you.

810
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Now you're just doing it to be spiteful.

811
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
You're just doing it to hurt me.

812
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Huluplus.com is amazing.

813
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760

Huluplus.com is the greatest entertainment service ever launched.

819
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,760
There's a new show called Deadbeat about a comedy about a pot smoking guy that talks to ghosts.

820
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
That's just there.

821
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
You're welcome.

822
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
You can just watch it.

823
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Why do you have to hurt me like this?

824
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
You're killing me.

825
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Okay, you don't want to pay for it.

826
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Oh, that's fine.

827
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
This is still America.

828
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:06,760
We do still have to pay for things, except we can get you a month for $8 normally.

829
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
That's normal.

830
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
$8 a month.

831
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
But we're going to get you two weeks free.

832
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Yeah, no problem.

833
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
No big deal.

834
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Go to Huluplus.com slash my brother and you'll get two weeks full access to Huluplus and it's completely free.

835
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Are you joking?

836
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
This is what I picture.

837
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
People are going to do that.

838
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Do the two week thing.

839
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
I'm going to hop on for two weeks.

840
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm going to watch all of it in two weeks and then I'm going to dip out.

841
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
But here's what you're going to find, people.

842
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
You can't.

843
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,760
There's way too much and you have to sleep or you'll die.

844
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
And so you're going to watch it and go, well, I can't.

845
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
I can't stop now.

846
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,760
I just have to stay on Huluplus forever because it's such an amazing deal and all the shows are here.

847
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Go, people.

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Go now.

849
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
I feel like this has been the most sales pitchy we've ever been.

850
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
It's wonderful.

851
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760

And you can also follow Scott Garner, spelled just the way it sounds, to hear what else Scott's making.

868
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
And that's available.

869
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,760
The book itself is available on Apple iBooks, on your Mac or iPad.

870
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,760
And you can even download a free chapter or buy it for half price through the end of May.

871
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
That sounds like a deal.

872
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
It is a deal.

873
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
We're full of deals today.

874
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Yeah, we're just tossing out bargains like it's a parade of bargains.

875
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,760
That's all of our sponsors for this week.

876
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Thank you so much to all of them for supporting us.

877
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,760
And now we're going to get back to the jokes, the old jokes.

878
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
The yucks.

879
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
The yucks.

880
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Enjoy.

881
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Do you want to eat or snort or somehow imbibe this PCP?

882
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,760
Sorry, guys.

883
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
PCP?

884
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
Bad for me.

885
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Do you want to help me drink this empty squeeze it bottle of PCP?

886
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
That's what they keep them in.

887
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
They melt the top of the lighter.

888
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,760
They drink to squeeze it, then they melt the top of the lighter.

889
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,760
That's why it's so popular as a drug is because there's so much impetus to squeeze it.

890
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Who are these people that are constantly having to turn down drugs?

891
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,760
And why can't they just say no?

892
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Is the dealer going to be like, that wasn't creative enough.

893
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Take this.

894
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Try again.

895
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
I need to feel it.

896
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I need to feel that you really don't want my drugs that I bought.

897
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,760
If only you had rhymed, I wouldn't be shoving this PCP in your mouth and eyes.

898
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
Or possibly ears or nose.

899
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Or ears or nose.

900
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
Perhaps butthole.

901
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
I don't know how it's distributed.

902
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,760
I don't know about PCP very well.

903
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
Angel dust, Griffin.

904
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Angel dust.

905
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
Is that what it is?

906
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Yeah.

907
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Yeah.

908
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
You know, angel dust.

909
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,760
That actually sounds kind of nice.

910
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:52,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user? who asks, I need to perform a colonoscopy to myself.

911
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,760
I need a colonoscopy performed on me but unfortunately in these economic times I cannot afford a doctor.

912
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
I'm pretty sure I can do it myself.

913
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,760
But what should I get to perform?

914
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,760
The only store near me is a Home Depot so the tools need to be from there.

915
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
What items should I get?

916
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,760
I have a very low budget so don't pick anything too expensive.

917
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,760
You're kind of tying our hands.

918
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,760
I want a homemade colonoscopy but I got maybe like eight bucks that I can drop on this.

919
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park.

920
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park and now I'm going to spend on a butt camera.

921
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Can you help?

922
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:38,760
Now, I can't imagine the kind of yoga one has to go into to operate a self butt camera.

923
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,760
The tech required is outrageous.

924
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:52,760
I would say the smallest camera that I own is my iPhone 4 and even that is going to be, if you'll forgive the term, a stretch.

925
00:43:52,760 --> 00:44:00,760
The thing that bothers me is not just that he doesn't just want to do a home one, he wants to do a home one on the cheap.

926
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,760
You can't say, you're already cutting the biggest corner, there are no other corners to cut.

927
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
It's like oblong now.

928
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
You can no longer cut corners, you're out of them.

929
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I'm all about pioneer spirit.

930
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm all about DIY.

931
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,760
I'm all about looking up shit on the internet and then doing that shit without getting help from other people.

932
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,760
But this is a bridge too far, dawg.

933
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
Yeah, it is.

934
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
I love value.

935
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Everybody who knows me, they say, Justin Bargenhauer, that's what everybody calls me.

936
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,760
This is too much, you've gone too far.

937
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Nine months ago before we started doing this show, I would have thought this was a joke.

938
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,760
But reading the answers, it's a real concern.

939
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,760
Yeah, it's a real concern.

940
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,760
Take a flexible hollow half inch diameter flex hose about two or three feet long.

941
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Stop it.

942
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Take a webcam housing off around the lens and circuit board.

943
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,760
Run a cable attached to webcam lens and circuit board through the hose.

944
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Insert circuit board into flex hose and mount camera lens even with the tip of a hose.

945
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,760
Grind a flashlight lens down into the diameter of the hose.

946
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
No!

947
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,760
Plug your computer in and turn the webcam on.

948
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Ram the device up your ass.

949
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,760
Step six, kill cell.

950
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Can I make a humble suggestion of maybe sell your fucking computer and get a colonoscopy?

951
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,760
Like as long as we're leaking outside the box.

952
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Can we start a fundraising drive to get this dude to a colonoscopist?

953
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Why is that the plan?

954
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,760
How about what are some ways I can get some more money?

955
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:49,760
I guarantee if you went to any doctor and said, I'm thinking about giving myself a self colonoscopy unless you do it for free.

956
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,760
The doctor will do it for free.

957
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,760
I'm going to hurt myself in my butt really bad if you do not come and give me a hand here.

958
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
I'm going to give it to you straight, doc.

959
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:08,760
You can either A, give me a free colonoscopy or B, dig a homemade colonoscopy camera out of my butt hole in two hours.

960
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
You decide.

961
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,760
This is how we're going to get health care pushed through Congress.

962
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:24,760
Everybody calls their local representative and says, hey, I'm about to irreversibly damage my rectal wall if you do not get this shit approved.

963
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,760
Hey, Obama.

964
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,760
Hey, Obama.

965
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,760
I'm going to hurt myself.

966
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
This one's on you, bro.

967
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,760
Yes, we can stick a webcam up our assholes.

968
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,760
Good news, I appear to be cancer free.

969
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Bad news, I'm never not defecating.

970
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,760
Anytime you see me, basically.

971
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,760
I broke whatever flange or cap is supposed to be there.

972
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,760
I would like to believe enough in humanity that it's not that every woman is instantly attracted to a guy because he is married.

973
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,760
But I think it's more that you become more comfortable.

974
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,760
You're not trying to impress anyone.

975
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,760
I mean, you've already got, you know, your significant other, so you're not working at it.

976
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Which instantly makes you more attractive.

977
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,760
So true.

978
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,760
That's 100 percent brain married.

979
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
That's what I call it.

980
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,760
You got to be brain married.

981
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,760
I like that.

982
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,760
I like that a lot.

983
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,760
How do you how deep does that that inception go, though?

984
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,760
Like, I mean, I need obviously a name for my brain wife, right?

985
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,760
I would need a name and like a story of how we met, how I met your brain mother.

986
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:36,760
I'm saying I can I can invent an entire scenario around a person and then not let anybody know about it except for me.

987
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,760
I can do that.

988
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,760
Like, I've played Dungeons and Dragons.

989
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,760
I'm totally capable of suspending entire, you know, worlds in my mind's eye.

990
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
It's ironic.

991
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,760
Those two skills dovetail so nicely.

992
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,760
Because I know that when I'm trying to stop impressing women, the first thing I do is talk about Dungeons and Dragons.

993
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,760
Hi.

994
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,760
And that and you know what, a lot of people try to keep this their brain wife secret.

995
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I say open with it.

996
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
I say, hi, my name is Griffin.

997
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,760
I have an imaginary wife and a great skill at playing Dungeons and Dragons.

998
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,760
Would you like to dance with me?

999
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,760
And you know something?

1000
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,760
My favorite December's album is The Brain Wife.

1001
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,760
So I just wanted to I thought I'd kill that conversation.

1002
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,760
What is the best way to greet a girl when you first meet her? Is shaking hands awkward?

1003
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,760
Is it appropriate to give a sideways hug?

1004
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Context.

1005
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Perhaps like on a first date or a blind date.

1006
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,760
Recently, my grandmother hooked me up with a date with this girl she met during a Zumba class.

1007
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,760
What is that?

1008
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Zumba, you know, Zumba.

1009
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
Zumba, Zumba.

1010
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Go on.

1011
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,760
Yeah, it's like it's like Brazilian yoga or something.

1012
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,760
What's your grandmother doing there?

1013
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
I don't know.

1014
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,760
I talked to the girl on Facebook and she was very much interested in meeting up with me to go on a date.

1015
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,760
How do I greet her in such a way as to give a good lasting impression that will set the tone for the rest of the day?

1016
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
God, that's tough.

1017
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,760
If you shake hands, you're setting a weird tone.

1018
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Yeah, don't shake hands.

1019
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,760
And definitely don't side hug.

1020
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
You're damned.

1021
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
Here's what you can.

1022
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
All right.

1023
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,760
I'm going to list off all the things you absolutely cannot do.

1024
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
Okay, hit me.

1025
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
Don't do nothing.

1026
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Don't shake her hand.

1027
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
That's a bad tone.

1028
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Don't hug her.

1029
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,760
Don't kiss her.

1030
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,760
Don't.

1031
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,760
No high fives.

1032
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,760
No high fives.

1033
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
No physical contact whatsoever.

1034
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
So don't not touch her, but don't touch her.

1035
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
Whatever you do.

1036
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Yeah.

1037
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,760
Don't do nothing.

1038
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
Chest bump.

1039
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
What about a chest bump?

1040
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
That's touch.

1041
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,760
Don't do that.

1042
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,760
There's some sensitive stuff up on the top.

1043
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,760
What about just the first time you meet her?

1044
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Just slow dance with her.

1045
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh, that's good.

1046
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
You know what you should do?

1047
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Zumba her.

1048
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
Just Zumba all over.

1049
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,760
You know, if you do go in for a chest bump, that's a pretty clear message about what kind

1050
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
of night the girl's going to have.

1051
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Yeah.

1052
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,760
She's like, this is going to be terrible for both of us.

1053
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,760
Give it.

1054
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,760
Essentially, if you stand across the way, just slap your chest and go, hey, bra, chest

1055
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
bump.

1056
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,760
Here it comes.

1057
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Chest bump.

1058
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
Bra, chest bump.

1059
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,760
I'm going to burst those.

1060
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,760
You're going to have a bad night.

1061
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,760
I'm not paying.

1062
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,760
I didn't bring any money.

1063
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,760
I stole your wallet when I chest bumped you.

1064
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,760
You're paying, I guess, by extension.

1065
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,760
So don't do any of those things.

1066
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Don't do anything, but don't do nothing.

1067
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Why don't we bring back kissing her hand?

1068
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
Oh, God.

1069
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,760
No.

1070
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,760
Drop to one day, kiss her hand.

1071
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,760
Yeah.

1072
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,760
Make sure you're wearing a fedora and make sure you're within eyesight of me so I can

1073
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,760
come kick the shit out of you.

1074
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,760
Yeah.

1075
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,760
Dullard.

1076
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,760
What about pinky swear?

1077
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,760
How do pinky swear that we're going to be in love?

1078
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:44,760
Hey, maybe this is the kind of thing that you should decide with her ahead of time on

1079
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
Facebook.

1080
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
When I see you, what is the proper-

1081
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,760
How should I touch you?

1082
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,760
You know, you're wondering-

1083
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Tell me how to touch you.

1084
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,760
God damn it.

1085
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,760
I want to touch you right when we first meet.

1086
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,760
You know you're wondering about the right moment to say I love you.

1087
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,760
You found it.

1088
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,760
That's right.

1089
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
This is it right here.

1090
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
She won't think about what you're doing with your hands.

1091
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
I think you want to touch me too.

1092
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
Yeah.

1093
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
I think you would like to touch me.

1094
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,240
I think I would like to touch you.

1095
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,360
We don't know each other well.

1096
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,600
I want to make sure when I touch you- No, listen.

1097
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,440
I can't stress this enough.

1098
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,760
You really have to type this whole paragraph before you send it because if you send this

1099
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,760
piecemeal, there's a good chance you're going to lose her mid-stream.

1100
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,720
She's going to see the whole thought, see it through to the end because if you just

1101
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,080
open with I want to touch you, you can't get her to slow down.

1102
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,880
Just send her an email that says could you wear clothing with brightly marked areas where

1103
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,560
it's okay for me to touch you.

1104
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,560
Just a circle here.

1105
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,400
Can you wear a hyper-colored t-shirt when you touch me?

1106
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Oh, fuck.

1107
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,400
Shit.

1108
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,760
You should probably just not go on the date.

1109
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,000
You should probably just stay home and just- I just can't eat it for you.

1110
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,640
Not in the bathtub.

1111
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:58,640
This is by Yahoo Answers user Dearest Love who asks, friend might be a robot, help?

1112
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,960
Okay.

1113
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,240
So my best friend of 15 years might be a robot.

1114
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,780
She beeps and boops and has a crazy phobia of water.

1115
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,200
And sometimes she spazzes out like a machine overheating.

1116
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,040
Should I confront her and be like, I think you might be a robot or leave it alone.

1117
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,240
Help.

1118
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,960
Now listen, straight up, everyone's immediate reaction is going to be to mock this person?

1119
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,520
No, no, no.

1120
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
Yeah.

1121
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,760
What the fuck?

1122
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
What if?

1123
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,760
It's an epidemic.

1124
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,840
Yeah.

1125
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
This is what I'm saying.

1126
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,080
If we don't listen to these people, we are losing our first line of defense.

1127
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,360
This is how they get us.

1128
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,160
Yeah.

1129
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:45,000
When you, when someone someday has a friend who is secretly a robot, when they come and

1130
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,160
they will, there's going to be at least one, it has to start somewhere.

1131
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,160
That's what I'm saying.

1132
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,160
Right?

1133
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,240
Like there has to be a first.

1134
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,000
And everyone thinks it's going to be Will Smith who's going to be that person who flips

1135
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
it.

1136
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Yeah.

1137
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But I think it's going to be people like you and me and Dearest Love.

1138
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Yeah.

1139
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,480
But here's, here's, let's, let's get the conversation started.

1140
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,720
Here's a response by Yahoo Answers user James who says, splash her with water and be like,

1141
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,820
oh sorry, I thought you were a robot.

1142
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,960
If she dies, she was a robot.

1143
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Okay.

1144
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,960
Fundamental problem right here.

1145
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,800
People aren't using their fucking noodle.

1146
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,960
If she's a witch, she'll die too.

1147
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,960
You don't.

1148
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,960
Yeah.

1149
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,960
Think about that.

1150
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,960
What's up?

1151
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
Mind freak.

1152
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:35,560
I think that that preferred response here is to close her off in a room with no access

1153
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:40,040
to electricity or food or water for two weeks or three weeks.

1154
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,040
Yep.

1155
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,880
And then if she is able to, if she like dies without electricity, robot or food or water,

1156
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
she's a robot.

1157
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
Yeah.

1158
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,880
That's science.

1159
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,080
Um, you could ask her to divide by zero to see what that does to her noodle.

1160
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,080
Oh shit.

1161
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,080
Yeah.

1162
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,080
Yeah.

1163
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Yeah.

1164
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
That's a puzzle too, right?

1165
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
Yeah.

1166
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,080
Like could God make a rock so big that he couldn't move it?

1167
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,080
Like.

1168
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Yeah.

1169
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Yeah.

1170
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,080
If it's a religious robot, I guess.

1171
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah.

1172
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,080
A religi-bot.

1173
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
I'm Bibley, the Bible-bot.

1174
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:14,520
I know all the verses.

1175
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,920
What if, what if you were to say, hey, pi, what was pi again?

1176
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
That number.

1177
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,600
And then like try to remember it.

1178
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,000
And if she goes any more than like four or five digits, I'm going to go ahead and call

1179
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
robot.

1180
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,440
Well, she might have that rain man thing.

1181
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,440
Oh fuck.

1182
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,440
Is rain man a robot?

1183
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,440
Yes.

1184
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,200
Ah, that would be so much better now.

1185
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,600
Ask her to watch AI and if she enjoys it, she's a robot.

1186
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,480
Rain man is basically Minority Report now.

1187
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,240
It's like Minority Report prequel, if you think about it.

1188
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
Holy shit.

1189
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
You are in Good Will Hunting.

1190
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
You are living in Good Will Hunting.

1191
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,200
It's like Baltimore Good Will Hunting.

1192
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,960
It's like the wire beats Good Will Hunting.

1193
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,080
I haven't seen, I haven't seen Good Will Hunting.

1194
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,400
What's it about?

1195
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:01,960
It's about two friends taking Hollywood by storm, enlisting the help of a wizard named-

1196
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Patch Adams.

1197
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,840
A wizard of comedy named Patch Adams and going on to Oscar gold.

1198
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
That's the movie.

1199
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,840
It sounds like a fucking tight movie.

1200
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
It is fucking badass.

1201
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
It is pretty good.

1202
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Is that on Netflix?

1203
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Yeah, it's on Netflix.

1204
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,400
And what they do, they hunt Patch Adams throughout the course of the movie.

1205
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
It's pretty badass actually.

1206
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,400
They do.

1207
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
This movie sounds incredible.

1208
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,720
Every time they catch him, he gives them some Hollywood wisdom like oh, like that and they're

1209
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,720
like oh, exactly.

1210
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,720
Please tell me that was your Robin Williams.

1211
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,720
My Robin Williams-

1212
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,720
Cut me off another slice of that, please.

1213
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
My Robin Williams is basically my dead knight.

1214
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,720
It's just FYI.

1215
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,720
I was like oh, daddy, a little fancy daddy.

1216
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,720
That's my dead knight.

1217
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,720
And here's my Robin Williams.

1218
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Hammer, yeah.

1219
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,720
That's not bad.

1220
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,720
It's kind of like Artie meets dead knight.

1221
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,720
Now, can you do Robin Williams doing one of Robin Williams' trademark voices?

1222
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,720
Can you give me one of those?

1223
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,720
Yeah.

1224
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:54,720
Daddy, I'm going to rescue daddy.

1225
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Who's Danny?

1226
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,720
Right back into dead knight from Daddy Shaq.

1227
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,720
Okay.

1228
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
It kind of vacillates.

1229
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
Man.

1230
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Sorry.

1231
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,720
So this is what Google hunting is about.

1232
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
Okay.

1233
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Taco B. Who asks?

1234
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,720
Ladies, X-mas gift?

1235
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:26,720
Ladies, if you sexual partner asked for you to walk on him with your high heels for Christmas

1236
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,720
and that's the only gift he wants this year, would you do that for him?

1237
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,720
Step on his privates for him with your sexiest heels if he proved it does not harm him at

1238
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
all?

1239
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,720
I like that he clears up it's the only thing he wants for Christmas.

1240
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,720
Well, I should hope so.

1241
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:48,720
You can't be like, I'd like you to crush my genitals with your sexiest heels and also

1242
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,720
a Kindle.

1243
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:58,720
I mean, this seems like kind of a shitty present.

1244
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,720
Yeah, it is.

1245
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,720
By anyone's standards.

1246
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
Even if you're into this kind of thing.

1247
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,720
Even if you were the biggest ball crush fan on the planet, this seems like-

1248
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,720
And I am.

1249
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,720
Yeah.

1250
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,720
Not a lot of thought went into this.

1251
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
Yeah.

1252
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,720
It's like Griffin really loves mixing bowls.

1253
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,720
Let's get him a mixing bowl for Christmas.

1254
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
That's far too obvious.

1255
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
That's way too obvious.

1256
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,720
You didn't think of- no heart, no love went into that decision.

1257
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,720
You know what I'm saying?

1258
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
Like you've got to flip it on him.

1259
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,720
Make him think that you're going to step on his balls for Christmas and then maybe like

1260
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,720
step on his butthole.

1261
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Like it's a new thing that he doesn't know about.

1262
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,720
But maybe he'll be just as big a fan.

1263
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Discovery.

1264
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,720
That's the real gift here.

1265
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:47,720
What she needs to do is Christmas Eve sneak into the room wearing a Santa suit and her

1266
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,720
sexiest heels and he's like asleep, right?

1267
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:57,720
He's conked out, visions of sugar plums dancing in his head and then she just crushes his

1268
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,720
balls.

1269
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,720
And his sugar plums.

1270
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,720
And his sugar plums.

1271
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
He just crushes his sugar plums.

1272
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Do you think that he would have time to get aroused or do you think your fight or flight

1273
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,720
would kick in?

1274
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Oh man, I would be out of- there would be a Griffin shaped cloud in the bed.

1275
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,720
What's a bris?

1276
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:28,720
I think it's a party that Jewish people throw when the circumcision happens.

1277
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,720
Oh so it's a party for getting your wiener cut off.

1278
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,720
Which is actually, ironically, the exact opposite of a divorce party.

1279
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,720
Yeah.

1280
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,720
Or the same, am I right?

1281
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,720
Women.

1282
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,720
That's what I was going for but- I didn't- I didn't get it.

1283
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Because she's leaving you so it's like you're going to put it back on, you know?

1284
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,720
Like you're getting the hood of your penis put back on?

1285
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
You know, like on King and Queens.

1286
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,720
Can they do that?

1287
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,720
Did you ever see that one on King and Queens?

1288
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,720
Wait, excuse me.

1289
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,720
Are you saying that there was an episode of King and Queen in which Kevin James had his

1290
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,720
wiener chopped off and then sewn back on?

1291
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,720
Had his circumcision-

1292
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Well it was an arc, I mean it wasn't all of an episode.

1293
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,720
How many episodes was that arc?

1294
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,720
I mean was that sweets?

1295
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,720
It was like a two-ep arc.

1296
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,720
It was like a season ender to be continued.

1297
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
So it was like a cliffhanger.

1298
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,720
Don't you guys remember that ad campaign between the third and fourth season when there was

1299
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,720
a bunch of billboards with Kevin James with just his penis stump exposed?

1300
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
And saying, what will happen?

1301
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:34,720
And then like, I don't know, George Costanza's dad was looking disapprovingly like, ah, not

1302
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,720
again.

1303
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,720
And then Leah Remini was like, get it back.

1304
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,720
So who in this situation cut off his wiener?

1305
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,720
Was it a mystery?

1306
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,720
Yeah, it was like-

1307
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,720
That was what provided the suspense at the button of the end of the first half of the

1308
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,720
arc.

1309
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,720
Turned out it was Maggie Simpson.

1310
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,720
Guys, this is the weirdest fucking episode we've ever done.

1311
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
Yeah, that's saying something.

1312
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,720
Have you guys ever heard of cutting a hole in the bottom of a popcorn bucket?

1313
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
Yeah.

1314
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,720
You could do that with a bowling ball.

1315
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,720
It's going to take some flexibility, and it's going to take some dedication, and it's going

1316
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,720
to take some butter, but you are going to do it.

1317
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,720
You're going to pull it off.

1318
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,720
It will not, cannot feel good though.

1319
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,720
It will not be pleasurable, it will be raw, and no, not like you're thinking.

1320
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:27,720
Dig it, dig it deep in there, like stick your prick right in the back of the bowling ball,

1321
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,720
like on the opposite side of the three holes so that when she tucks her three fingers in

1322
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,720
there-

1323
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,720
What's up?

1324
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,720
There's a chance she may graze.

1325
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,720
She puts her two fingers and thumb in there, gives you a Minnesota pincher, and you are

1326
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,720
off to the races.

1327
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720
Oh, man.

1328
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,720
But it is so important that she realizes what you've done before she bowls.

1329
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,720
So important.

1330
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,720
You have got to figure, getting into the situation, if you thought that was hard, try getting

1331
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,720
out of it.

1332
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,720
It is.

1333
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,720
Wow.

1334
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,720
Baby, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1335
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,720
My dick's in the wall?

1336
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,720
Yes, Travis.

1337
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,720
That's what we were talking about.

1338
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
I think.

1339
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:11,720
You know what I love?

1340
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,720
What?

1341
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,720
You don't kill a horse.

1342
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,720
You destroy it.

1343
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,720
The term for putting a horse down, which is like the saddest thing ever, I'm not making

1344
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,720
light of that, except I totally am.

1345
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,720
You destroy, though.

1346
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,720
You throw the horse into the fires of Mountain Doom.

1347
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,720
That's basically what we're saying.

1348
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:39,720
I guess it sounds inhumane to be like, oh, my horse can't walk, so I totally emptied

1349
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,720
a clip in his dome.

1350
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,720
Murdered it.

1351
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,720
I popped a bullet in his bubble goose.

1352
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
You don't do that.

1353
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
That's not enough.

1354
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,720
That's not what he deserves.

1355
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,720
He deserves to be destroyed.

1356
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,720
He could come back.

1357
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:54,720
Oh, I obliterated that fucking pony.

1358
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,720
Hey, Justin.

1359
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,720
Yeah, Robbie?

1360
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
Me and Robbie went to Peckers last night.

1361
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,720
Just got destroyed.

1362
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,720
Why are we riding towards Mordor, Justin?

1363
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,720
Justin, are you going to pitch me into the fires of Mountain Doom?

1364
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,720
God, this is awkward.

1365
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,720
I do need to destroy you.

1366
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:19,720
The more you say it, the more ridiculous it sounds like you're talking about your robot

1367
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,720
best friend who turned evil.

1368
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,720
I must destroy him.

1369
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,720
The horse shall be no more.

1370
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
There's a button underneath their saddle.

1371
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,720
If you push it, it sends horse meat everywhere.

1372
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,720
He has the self-destruct button.

1373
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:39,720
I love you, Secretariat, but I'm going to fucking gib you.

1374
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
You're done.

1375
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,720
I'm going to hit you with a rocket launcher, Robbie.

1376
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,720
I'm sorry.

1377
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,720
I don't know.

1378
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
Horses.

1379
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,720
What big fucking stupid animals?

1380
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,720
What other animal is like, I broke my leg, now I have to be destroyed?

1381
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,720
It's exciting news, if this is the first place you're hearing about it.

1382
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,720
It is still pretty exciting, even if you already know.

1383
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:11,720
My brother, my brother, me, has joined with the Maximum Fun network.

1384
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,720
Voltron-like.

1385
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,720
We are the left foot of the Maximum Fun robot.

1386
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,720
Right.

1387
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,720
Could we also be like Megazord?

1388
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,720
Does it have to be Voltron, or can we go into Mighty Morphin Power?

1389
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,720
I'm more comfortable with Mighty Morphin Power.

1390
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,720
Ideally, we would be like Dragonzord, and we could be like our whole other mech, but

1391
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,720
I don't think it would reach that level.

1392
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,720
I'm not going down this road with you guys.

1393
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,720
No, no, I'm just saying we pull out our magic Green Ranger flute, and we summon the Dragonzord.

1394
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
I can't do it.

1395
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,720
We don't have to make a big deal out of it.

1396
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,720
I can't do this with you.

1397
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
I can't do it.

1398
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,720
Oh, you're thinking more of like a white saber-toothed tiger, like Tommy the Red Ranger when he came

1399
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,720
back.

1400
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,720
One more word, I'll quit.

1401
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,720
I swear to Jesus, I'll quit.

1402
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,720
No, this is an advice show for the modern era.

1403
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,720
And a Power Rangers fan cast.

1404
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,720
And a Power Rangers fan cast.

1405
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,720
We used to do VR Troopers too, but that one ran dry.

1406
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,720
If we get into Beatleborgs, I quit.

1407
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,720
We had a brief Big Bad Beetleborgs face, but we grew out of that pretty quickly.

1408
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,720
Yeah, now it's pretty much just advice and Power Rangers and tattooed teenage alien fighters

1409
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,720
from Beverly Hills.

1410
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,720
Same for our pizza cats.

1411
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,720
Chick-a-chams.

1412
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,720
Put another log on there.

1413
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,720
It's a toasty show.

1414
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,720
It's funny to me that you should mention, you know, depending on your location, because

1415
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,720
just this year I realized that just because it's snowing here doesn't mean it's snowing

1416
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,720
everywhere in the world.

1417
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,720
Interesting, Travis.

1418
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Whoa, really?

1419
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,720
This is like a rap and beats level confession.

1420
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,720
Yeah, it really was like, winter here is not winter everywhere else.

1421
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,720
And I had no idea.

1422
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,720
I just assumed when it got cold here, the entire world was cold.

1423
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,720
And that's apparently not how the world works.

1424
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,720
That's like some, Trav, that's like some Middle Ages shit.

1425
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,720
Yeah, that's about the goddamn dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1426
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:01,720
Why, this is my brother, my brother, and my pet canary that somehow gained the ability

1427
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,720
to talk.

1428
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,720
Chick-a-chams.

1429
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,720
National Eye Donor Month.

1430
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,720
Okay, let's do it.

1431
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,720
Right now.

1432
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,720
We don't need to go any further.

1433
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,720
Yeah, I'm going down the list.

1434
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,720
National Eye Donor Month.

1435
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,720
Nothing beats eye donors.

1436
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,720
Friends, March is National Eye Donor Month.

1437
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,720
So, think about it.

1438
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,720
Are your kids really worth looking at with both?

1439
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,720
My brother, my brother, and me?

1440
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,720
Look around, see the flowers blooming and the children smiling.

1441
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,720
Well, some people can't, Stingy.

1442
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,720
Give up one of them.

1443
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,720
My brother, my brother, and me.

1444
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,720
That one didn't flow quite as well as you anticipated, did it?

1445
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,720
No.

1446
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,720
How about this one?

1447
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,720
You know that Jessica Alba movie, The Eye, where she gets the eye donation and then she

1448
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,720
sees demons and it really fucks her shit up?

1449
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,720
That only happens, like, one out of every five eye donations.

1450
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,720
So don't worry about it.

1451
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
My brother, my brother, and me.

1452
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,720
It's like taking your contacts out only, like, times a thousand.

1453
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,720
My brother, my brother, and me.

1454
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,720
There you go.

1455
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,720
See you back on the horse.

1456
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,720
Eyepatches.

1457
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,720
Uh-huh.

1458
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,720
What else are you going to do with all those eye patches?

1459
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,720
It's like a permanent wink.

1460
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,720
My brother, my brother, and me.

1461
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,720
Well, the holidays are coming up, and I have a big bin full of worn out underwear that

1462
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
our family has been accumulating for a while.

1463
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,720
I know I need some cushioning material for shipping out holiday gifts.

1464
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,720
Is it acceptable to use the underwear for this purpose?

1465
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,720
Of course, the present will be inside a wrap box inside the shipping box, so it's not like

1466
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
it will be inside the gift.

1467
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,720
BQ, what's your favorite winter holiday song?

1468
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,720
What kind of fucking family are you in?

1469
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,720
I think my favorite winter holiday song is, uh, you ruined our Christmas with your stinky,

1470
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,720
awful old underwear that you wrapped around the iPod.

1471
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,720
Why does your family have a bin of worn out underwear?

1472
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,720
Uh, well, additional details.

1473
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,720
Our family tries very, very hard to be eco-friendly.

1474
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,720
We don't have anything else to use, and the thought of buying extra paper or bubble wrap

1475
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,720
to waste makes me cry for the earth.

1476
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,720
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

1477
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,720
You know what makes me cry for the earth?

1478
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,720
Your stinky, awful underwear.

1479
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:18,720
The crap that you're shipping through, you're shipping it through the U.S. Postal Service.

1480
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,720
I send my rent check to my landlord through that.

1481
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,720
I could open up, you might live in my neighborhood, I might open up your mailbox and get like

1482
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:31,720
a fucking pungent, like a foamy spume of your fucking stinky old underwear that hits me

1483
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,720
in the nose and stays with me for the rest of my life.

1484
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,720
I'm so, oh, fuck.

1485
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,720
It makes me mad that it sounds like you've already made this decision, because you've

1486
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
been collecting this underwear for a while now.

1487
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,720
Yeah, what have you been doing?

1488
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,720
Where are you keeping it?

1489
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,720
Hey, uh, hey dude, if you have to send it in dirty underwear, it ain't a gift.

1490
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,720
It ain't a gift, it's an oppa gift.

1491
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,720
God damn it, I don't, like, these green questions are straight bombing me out.

1492
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,720
They're really harshing my mellow.

1493
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,720
I wouldn't give a fuck if the earth had like six years left in it.

1494
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,720
If the earth had four years left in it and people didn't send underwear through the US

1495
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,720
Postal Service, like, that's a trade off I'm willing to make.

1496
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:19,720
It can go 2012 up in 2016 as long as, as long as people stop pooping in bags and sending

1497
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,720
their dirty ass underwear to their aunt.

1498
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,720
All I can think is there has to come a moment where like you go to pull out a pair of underwear

1499
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,720
and you're like, oh this is covered in stains and the elastic is shot and your mom's like

1500
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
put it in the bin.

1501
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,720
Put it right in the bin.

1502
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,720
Get it in the bin.

1503
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,720
No, fucking throw that shit out.

1504
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,720
Throw it away.

1505
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
You're not gonna reuse those textiles.

1506
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,720
Don't, don't fucking kid yourself.

1507
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
Hey check out my new winter coat.

1508
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,720
Lots of boxers went into this one.

1509
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,720
This one was sent in by CurlyHeadPoet.

1510
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:55,720
Thank you CurlyHeadPoet, it's by Yahoo Answers user Amy who asks, oh man, does anyone know

1511
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,720
of any other grandpa names?

1512
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:02,720
Oh no, it can't listen to the parameters, please.

1513
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,720
Okay.

1514
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,720
All right.

1515
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,720
All right.

1516
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,720
It cannot be poppy, grandpa, or pop pop.

1517
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,720
Gramps sounds like cramps.

1518
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,720
Don't go there.

1519
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,720
Don't.

1520
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,720
Don't even.

1521
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:20,720
Additional, additional details and please no names in other languages.

1522
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,720
This is America We Speak English.

1523
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Did she say that?

1524
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,720
Awesome.

1525
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,720
Awesome.

1526
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,720
That's awesome.

1527
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,720
That's really awesome, Amy.

1528
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,720
Cool.

1529
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:33,720
Any P vowel P.

1530
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,720
Vowel.

1531
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,720
Sound.

1532
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,720
Yeah.

1533
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,720
You can, you're fine.

1534
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
Like pee pee.

1535
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,720
Well, maybe not that.

1536
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,720
No, not that.

1537
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,720
No.

1538
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,720
Uh.

1539
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,720
Papo.

1540
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,720
Papo.

1541
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,720
That's good.

1542
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Popey.

1543
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,720
Peepums.

1544
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,720
As long as there's two P's.

1545
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Go see your peepums.

1546
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,720
This is my peepums.

1547
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,720
Darrell, go see your peepums.

1548
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,720
My peepums.

1549
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,720
My peepums always has the hardest, crumbliest chewing gum.

1550
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,720
Don't.

1551
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,720
Now, Darrell, don't you eat peepum's nasty gum.

1552
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,720
You know what happened last time.

1553
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:12,720
Peepum's nasty gum sounds like a product that we should copyright immediately.

1554
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,720
Oh, God.

1555
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:18,720
I just purchased a pack of peepum's old-timey nasty gum.

1556
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,720
You're still in the juicy fruit?

1557
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,720
Oh, that's bitch gum.

1558
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,720
I'm in a peepum's nasty gum.

1559
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,720
Fuck your fruit stripes.

1560
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,720
The thing about peepum's nasty gum is that you have to put the emphasis on a different syllable every time you say it.

1561
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,720
Peepum's don't even give a...

1562
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,720
Oh, peepum's don't even give him that nasty gum.

1563
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,720
It's just a lot of the care for it.

1564
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,720
Um...

1565
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,720
Peepums.

1566
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
Wow, Trav, I am spent.

1567
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,720
That was just a lot of great humor.

1568
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:06,720
I feel like people don't appreciate how hard it is for us to recreate those bits in their entirety live as we're recording.

1569
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,720
Doing Griffin's voice alone is exhausting.

1570
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,720
Yeah.

1571
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,720
Thank you to HuluPlus.com for support...

1572
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,720
Not HuluPlus.com.

1573
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,720
Thank you to HuluPlus for supporting our program.

1574
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,720
They've got thousands of hit shows anywhere.

1575
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Anytime you can stream them and you can get a free trial at HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

1576
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,720
That's amazing.

1577
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,720
Yeah.

1578
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,720
Do you want to say something nice about NatureBox now, Travis?

1579
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,720
Yeah.

1580
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
Hey, do you like snacks?

1581
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
Yes.

1582
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,720
Remember what we talked about like 30 to 40 minutes ago?

1583
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,720
About snacks?

1584
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,720
About snacks.

1585
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,720
Do you remember?

1586
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,720
Go to NatureBox.com and check it out.

1587
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,720
At least do yourself a favor and go look at all the different options.

1588
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,720
I promise you, you won't be able to look away.

1589
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,720
So go to NatureBox.com slash my brother to get 50% off your first order.

1590
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,720
Trust me, it's worth it.

1591
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Go check it out.

1592
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:04,720
So you're going to go to NatureBox.com slash my brother, HuluPlus.com slash my brother, and MakingThingsBeautiful.net.

1593
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,720
There's not a slash my brother on there, but I'm sure he'll get a custom domain going eventually.

1594
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,720
Go to all those.

1595
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,720
And also while you're typing in URLs, why not go to BoatParty.biz?

1596
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:23,720
There is a big-ass cruise with all the coolest people that have ever lived on planet Earth,

1597
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:32,720
and they're sailing the ocean blue with the Atlantic Ocean Comedy Music Festival July 25th through the 28th.

1598
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,720
They've got so many great guests.

1599
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Moshe Kasher is going to be there.

1600
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:45,720
Carol Kolb, Kyle Kinane, Natasha Legaro, our dear, dear friend John Roderick of The Long Winters,

1601
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,720
and many, many, many, many, many others.

1602
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,720
So don't miss out on that.

1603
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,720
It's at BoatParty.biz.

1604
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,720
One last thing, nbnbm.brownpapertickets.com.

1605
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:02,720
That's our show in LA at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern this Wednesday.

1606
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,720
And speaking of John Roderick, I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of the theme song.

1607
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,720
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1608
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,720
I feel like we do that every week.

1609
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:19,720
And really, it's 100 percent because it's such an amazing album that people need to listen to it.

1610
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,720
I won't rest until everyone has listened to it.

1611
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,720
So there.

1612
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,720
And that's going to do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1613
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,720
I hope you enjoyed what?

1614
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,720
We have three live shows coming up in New York next week.

1615
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,720
It's going to be just a marathon day.

1616
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,720
So make sure you send in all the Yahoo answers you can.

1617
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:49,720
If you're going to be at the shows, send in questions specific, like, say, you know, 1 p.m. show, 4 o'clock, whatever they are, so that we can do your questions there live and call you out and embarrass you.

1618
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,720
And we will try to hang out after all those shows as much as we can.

1619
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,720
We're going to be a little exhausted.

1620
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,720
What with the doing three shows.

1621
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:03,720
But we will do our best because we love you and we're there to see you, really, when we get right down to it.

1622
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,720
So that's it.

1623
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,720
That's – we don't have a final Yahoo.

1624
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,720
Travis, make him a final Yahoo out of whole cloth.

1625
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,720
All right.

1626
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,720
So these Yahoo answers come from Stephen.

1627
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:16,720
Stephen asked, why is my wiener sad?

1628
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,720
That's not bad.

1629
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,720
I'm Justin McElroy.

1630
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,720
I'm Travis McElroy.

1631
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,720
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1632
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,720
Kiss your dad.

1633
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:44,720
Square on the lips.
