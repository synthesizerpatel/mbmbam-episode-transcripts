1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:56,400
This is the international episode of my brother, my brother and me from around the globe.

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Now, that's my brother, my brother and you, isn't it? Yes, right. Damn it. How's it going?

7
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,040
How are your goofs today?

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,560
Pardon me, goof maker. How much for a fresh dozen of goofs?

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,800
This is all the French I know.

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,120
Moments before the show started that today is the international episode of my brother,

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,120
my brother and me. It's the international. It's my brother, my brother and me you love,

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:50,160
but it's got a crippling economy like in Europe. Sorry, it's like when guts had global guts

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,080
and then all of a sudden there were French kids for American. And America was just whipping.

14
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,480
America was just grinding them in a prepubescent pace. They have no,

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,080
they have nothing in their culture to prepare them. They don't even put steroids in their

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,920
chicken. That radical rock had nothing. What has braced you for this? Travis, what do they call the

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:20,560
uh, the agro crag in, in France? Uh, the, the agro with cheese. Wait, no, fuck.

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,520
Thank you. You're wonderful. So we do have an international flair on this episode of my brother,

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,120
my brother, me and advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Jose McElroy.

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,760
I'm your middle-est brother, Vladimir McElroy. And I am your baby brother.

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
Wait, was that a language or did you become the scat man?

22
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,440
It's like lady smith black, my brother, my brother and me in, in portal prints. Uh,

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,200
scat man is, is the, the primary language. The national language is scat man in the city.

24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,240
The national language is in the city of Port-au-Prince. The national language is scat man.

25
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,600
He's a national hero down there. National on a city level. He's the Prince of Port-au-Prince.

26
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,920
Basically in the, in the Prince of the city because they held the elections and he won

27
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,160
the election for Prince of the city. Right. He couldn't be mayor because he doesn't have,

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,960
he does not have a, you know, a government background. So it's more of a figurehead

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,480
position. He beat out Lou Bega, which, which was quite the coup. Um, literally.

30
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,120
The Lou Bega militia, uh, had a few things to say about it. Um, this is of course, uh,

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,880
my brother, my brother and me. We take your questions, your queries, and some unsolicited

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,480
questions and queries from the, uh, terrible people at Yahoo Answers,

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
and we turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. Uh, let's get right to it.

34
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,760
My boyfriend, a PhD student, is leaving to do dissertation research in Scotland for two months.

35
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,360
Do you have any advice on how to cope with being apart? Scotland's a country, guys. Huh?

36
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,920
I, I love doing this show early in the morning cause it takes my voice down here. I sound like,

37
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,680
I sound like Rick Dees. Sound like Lou Bega. I love it. Uh, it's tough. I, I'm glad you included

38
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,080
his location where he's traveling to. Because if you were like, my boyfriend is leaving to go to

39
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,000
some whack country for two months, then it'd be like, okay, we can help you here. But he's going

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,840
to Scotland and Scotland's pretty dope. I wish he had included where she will remain though,

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,440
right? Cause if she's in the UK, then she's not there. From kicking it in, kicking it in Des Moines.

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Uh, I, I guess Skype video calling is good for this sort of thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. You could

43
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,880
Google, you could Google hang out him. You could Google Buzz him. Just hit him up on Google Buzz.

44
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
Yeah. You could, uh, both sign up for eHarmony and see if it syncs you up there.

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,840
Mm-hmm. Although I can't imagine- That sounds like a great idea.

46
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,480
I can't imagine they would pair a man in Scotland and a woman in Des Moines and maybe you should

47
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,440
take a hint, but I don't know. Maybe it's not going to work out for a couple. Have you thought

48
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,560
about taking a couple months off? Just, uh, being you, you know? So you're not saying like be single

49
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
and not like break up for two months, but just like mentally. I'm just saying mentally kind of

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,960
inception them out of your mind, right? Take that, take that, uh, eternal sunshine and the spotless

51
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,320
mind pill and just kind of forget they exist for two months. Have you seen- Think of it like summer

52
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,240
vacation. Have you seen the film you just referenced? Yes. Yes. Eternal Sun- Sunshine.

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,920
And it's just him just takes, just Jim Carrey just poppin', poppin' Xannies. He takes the limitless

54
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,960
pill. He takes the limitless pill and he forgets, but he gets, he gets it now. See, my problem with

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,920
that movie has always been that he goes overboard. So it's not just he takes the pill to forget Kate

56
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Winslet dumped him. He forgets, like Kate Winslet will go to the store. She's like,

57
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Kate Winslet will go to the store and he'll take the pill. That'll help. Yeah. Cause you know,

58
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
he didn't want to be lonely for like 20 minutes. And I think that's, that's probably a substance.

59
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,920
And then it starts to get weird when he starts to take the pill to forget Elijah Wood. Yeah.

60
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,600
And then he does it to forget algebra. And then he, and then he does it to forget that the

61
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,320
lady is actually a man in the crying game, which I don't know how they made that specific a pill.

62
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,120
Well, it's everybody remembers their first time watching the crying game. That's a magical,

63
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,720
that's a magical shock. There actually is a, I think there's a generation of people that,

64
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
and I would include myself in this generation, where they through osmosis learned the,

65
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,480
the turn of the movie, but did not actually see the movie. Oh, that's a shame. I have no

66
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,800
idea what the movie is about, but I know that the woman is a man. Yeah. Right. It's powerful.

67
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,960
It's a powerful movie. I think it's a Willem Dafoe, right? Willem Dafoe, but he has a,

68
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,800
yeah, it's like Willem Dafoe, but with a vagina. I only watch the vagina. I only watch Willem Dafoe

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,160
movies. If he's dressed like the green goblin or throwing hot wax on Madonna. That's like half the

70
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,000
movies. Yeah. It's half of his, half of his, his criterion collection is actually solely movies

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
where he plays the green goblin and or throws hot wax. Now, if we could get those two flavors

72
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:48,400
together, how about it, Coen brothers? Just, just give me that. You know, I was actually exactly,

73
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,480
pretty much exactly in the situation. Mine of course was far harder because my wife did not have

74
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:02,960
access to the high band internet required for Skype and such. And it, you will level out on the,

75
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,520
on the missing the person that will be the worst at the beginning. And then you'll,

76
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,280
you'll kind of get into a rhythm. Um, try to, if you're, if you're in a long-term relationship,

77
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,560
it's, it's going to suck because you, you get into this mindset that it's going to be the two of you

78
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,800
two of you. And it'll be weird to have experiences that are just you. Um, and that's the thing that's

79
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,040
going to suck the most, I think. And there's going to be a temptation to not have any sort

80
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:41,760
of memorable experiences, you know, for, for fear that you'll create a, a, some sort of imbalance

81
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,240
there. But you gotta remember that he's going to be doing, you know, completely foreign, completely

82
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,760
new stuff. And you shouldn't keep yourself from, um, also doing interesting things. When Sydney

83
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,480
was gone, I got into new stuff. I got into like, uh, what we've talked about on the show before.

84
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,880
I got in like geocaching while she was gone, you know, things that maybe she wouldn't have any

85
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,640
interest in, but I, I thought I'd pursue. And, uh, and, and that really helped to make the time

86
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,680
seem full, even though it obviously wasn't full because my, my best bud said wasn't around, but

87
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,680
so get like really into drugs. Yeah. Well, no, find some experience that you would be ashamed

88
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,000
to do in front of him, like geocaching, like an eyes wide shut kind of sex party. Well, Travis,

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,560
again, yeah. Imagine the thrill of him coming home and him showing you three baubles that he

90
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,920
brought for you from Scotland said, these are great, Phillip. Now watch this. And you juggle

91
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,280
them. Imagine his eyes bugging out of his head as you toss them aloft and catch them and toss them

92
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:54,880
until he gets bored, which is of course 20 seconds later. Hey jugglers, by the way, hey jugglers,

93
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:05,280
I can stream like every TV show ever made through a screen on my desk. Uh, your juggling is

94
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,840
entertaining anybody. Nobody wants to see anybody juggle ever again. Can I make a side note about

95
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,800
juggling that blows my mind? Can we just talk about juggling for juggling? Here's why I love

96
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,280
juggling. Juggling is one of the few like, uh, things that people do that requires constant

97
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,280
escalation. Like, Oh, okay. You can do three balls. That's awesome. Now do four. Okay. Now

98
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,720
do like knives. Now do chainsaws. Now do babies. If properly executed it, juggling can only end

99
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:46,080
in your death. Yeah. If you're into some like Greg Kennedy, like pro style juggling maneuvers,

100
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,200
like that can still, that's like a fucking air show. That's entertaining. He's the dude who got

101
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,320
in the cone and he juggles in the cone and he'll like throw the ball onto the, like against the

102
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,320
cone and I'll like spin around him and like this beautiful perpetual orbit and then I'll catch him

103
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,520
again and just like keep on juggling them. He sounds like an innovative juggler, which is easy

104
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,240
to remember since his website is innovative juggler.com. You know what I like to do? I like

105
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,760
to just toss to one of something to a juggler and just like go to town. Yeah. Enjoy that. It's very

106
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,480
zen. It's very zen. What's the sound of one ball juggling? I really liked there was a craze that

107
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,160
took off for about, I don't know, about a month and a half in college of, it was like single

108
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,000
object juggling. And so as a ball, you know how David Bowie just like made love to those dream

109
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:53,520
bubbles in Labra? That's pretty much all it was. You're talking about fushigi. Is that,

110
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,480
do you know what that's called? Did you pull that from? Have you never seen the fucking infomercials

111
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,600
where it's like that glittery, you know, silvery ball that you make dance around your fingertips

112
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,720
and shit. And every five seconds the crowd's like fushigi. No, but it's, that sounds like a raw and

113
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,960
primal power. I imagine that fushigi was the gift for like two Christmases that aunts and uncles

114
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,720
gave their nieces and nephews. Cause we didn't know them very well. Oh, cool. What's it? Oh,

115
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,600
devil sticks. Thanks dad. See, this is why we need to get, we needed to get a,

116
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,760
we need to get a PO box or something. Cause it seems like the kind of conversation where after

117
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,880
right people would just flood, who would just flood the boxes with fushigi balls. Yeah. How

118
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:47,440
many fushigis today, Donald? You know, I'm ordering a fushigi. Fushigi. Fushigi. You guys want a yahoo?

119
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:55,760
Yeah, please. This yahoo answer was sent in by Maxwell McCandless. Thank you, Max. It's by yahoo

120
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,760
answers user question mark who asks, is there any good dating sites for 13 year olds?

121
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:09,680
I am single and need a boyfriend ASAP. I am lonely. Oh my God. Here's a good dating site

122
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:18,400
for 13 year olds. The playground. I like to think that there's a secret context to

123
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,000
every yahoo answer question that it actually does end with an unwritten I am lonely.

124
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,320
But this person went ahead and filled that out. Additional details. Check that box. Additional

125
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,480
details. Fuck y'all. So I guess the answers that this person got. I want your help, but fuck you.

126
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,760
This is a pretty cool 13 year old actually. I'm kind of into it. I can't believe she's single.

127
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,520
Huh? Yeah. Somebody lock that down. Wait before her looks start to go. Too late.

128
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,360
How can you be 13 and lonely? You're surrounded by other 13. Oh wait. Unless homeschooled.

129
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
Trapped on an island. That's, I said homeschooled. Okay.

130
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,280
Um, that's really the only scenario I can, unless like you're just striking out at the school that

131
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,800
you're going to, which is we've all been there. Like I, I was very, I was wildly unpopular. Um,

132
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,520
in middle school, high school, elementary school. I did okay. Um, but I, I had a bunch of friends,

133
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:36,480
other schools, but I had no access to them. Right. That's the time I was 13. I dated everyone at my

134
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,040
school. You know, I just worked my way through the ranks. Yeah. I had fucked my way through.

135
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,760
What I'm, I'm very much like yourself, Griffin, especially in middle school, which I guess is

136
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,640
where you'd be at about 13. Right. Be like six. I was like, I would, I would compare myself to

137
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,920
the Chris Gaines of my middle school. People were not having it. They were not enjoying it.

138
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,760
Believe you were a real person. They didn't believe it was a real person. I didn't have a girl.

139
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:10,800
Sleep it. I can sleep at night because I knew that, man, if I was kicking it over at, uh,

140
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,280
Beverly Hills middle school, oh man, that's where my friend base was. That's where my core competency

141
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,840
is. They know me. The people know me there. You're known there. You're a known quantity.

142
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah. Take me out of Comac. Take me over to kick me over to Innslow. And I am all of a sudden,

143
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,160
I'm, I'm, you know, I'm Dougie fresh. Yeah. Is that, is he a known popular man in middle school,

144
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,280
in middle school, middle schoolers love Dougie. Take me over, take me over to Beverly,

145
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,240
Beverly Hills middle school. I'm, I'm Urkel. I'm Steve Urkel over there. Yeah. But if you take me

146
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,520
to, if you take me to Innslow, I'm Stefan Urkel, Stefan Urkel. Exactly. Although, you know, kids in,

147
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,440
if Urkel had shown up at your school, like, oh man, when you're 13, oh, forget about it.

148
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,040
It's fucking Elvis. School would have shut down for the day. Oh my God. He said the thing about

149
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,640
cheese. The red power ranger came to my elementary school and he did a backflip off of the stage.

150
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,960
And he bit his, he bit it too. I remember I was there, I was in fifth and you were in first.

151
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,600
Oh, it was hilarious. Nice try. Austin St. John, was that his name or was that the wrestler?

152
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,360
Uh, Austin St. John was the, uh, is that right? I think he was the green. Was he the green ranger?

153
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
Yeah, the red ranger. The original red ranger became the green ranger.

154
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,360
No. Fuck you. Tommy was the green ranger and then he became the white ranger. Tommy was the green

155
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,880
ranger. Dragonzord. Austin St. John was the- Oh, guys, all our girlfriends and wives just broke

156
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,760
up with us. Austin St. John is indeed the, um, is indeed the red ranger. Uh, if you were thinking

157
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,600
of Googling him to see how he has aged, allow him to save you some time. He has, uh- He looks

158
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,560
like, he looks like a young Dom Dolores and you need to get out. Didn't he do some grown folks

159
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:05,680
pictures of the, uh, all male variety? I believe he was in some all male grown folks pictures.

160
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:13,920
I may be imagining that though. Can we help this person diversify their tween dating portfolio?

161
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,400
It's, see, it's dangerous because I have no way of verifying that this is a real 13 year old.

162
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,320
I just assume anybody who says they're 13 on the internet is actually,

163
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:34,800
you just go ahead and add 20 to that. Or subtract five. Oh. Yeah. So this is an eight year old

164
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,000
trying to date up. There's what I'm saying. Okay. That's where the money is. Yeah. I assume that

165
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,080
14 year old, I don't have any money. I'm assuming 14 year olds have all the money. Is that where

166
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,240
it is all gone? Mm-hmm. You gotta get yourself a rich 14 year old. Yeah. They're pretty close

167
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,720
to death anyway, so you'll inherit it. Mm-hmm. You, I guess Facebook, I guess this is why-

168
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,200
Facebook is like the teen dating thing, right? Yeah. And by teen dating, you mean all dating,

169
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,480
all ages, forever. All ages. And not just dating. All conversation and contact with human people

170
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,600
is Facebook. Funerals. Funerals, Facebook funerals. Bar mitzvahs. Bury me. Like my casket.

171
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:29,920
Click to throw dirt. Do you guys, how far are we from more traditional celebrations on Facebook?

172
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,560
From like basically Wall-E where everybody is floating around in the chair staring at Facebook

173
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,880
constantly? Yeah. Like how long until I can just get- I'm there. I do that. Get, go to a bris

174
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,240
virtually. That, now this is largely not for convenience, but because I've never been to a bris

175
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,800
and I can never seem to get invited. So fascination. Fascination. But I want to, I want- You want to

176
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,240
live stream a bris. Let me Google your bris and live stream it from- Can I Google your bris is

177
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,520
probably one of my favorite collections of words I've ever heard. Yeah. Let me you stream that bris

178
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,680
please. Is your bris, sorry, is your, is your baby son's bris on Justin TV? Can you get that, can

179
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,120
get the stream up? How's the wi-fi at the bris, bris facility? What is that? A church? Hospital?

180
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:21,040
Or they do that? Uh, usually just a baseball, baseball field, baseball field. It's a, it's

181
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,920
always themed. You know, you see a lot of rich families will rent out, you know, rent out Shea

182
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,480
Stadium or something and it's like a- Yeah. You know. That's why when I have a kid- Put up a bunch

183
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,760
of signs that says like, Tommy's bris is a home run and stuff like that. Oh, that's nice. Cut,

184
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,360
cut the tip off your bat. Get that, get the cork out. Tommy. I don't think that's a thing. I don't

185
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,640
think you know how brises work. Cut the end of your penis off, Tommy. Tip of your dick's gotta,

186
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:57,360
the tip of your dick has to Jose Canseco. And also, uh, we have a guest bris guy, Jose Canseco.

187
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,360
It's a noted baseballman. He's, he's done slicing through the air and knocking out homers,

188
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,520
now he's going to slice through your wiener and knock out your foreskin. Jose Canseco's brother,

189
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,120
Jerry, uh, is filling in for Jose Canseco. Do not make it. Because he is, he is a surgeon.

190
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:24,160
Please be careful. It's my son's dick we're talking about. My coworker keeps peeking at

191
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,400
the personal stuff I'm doing on my laptop. Whenever she comes to my cubicle for work-related

192
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,840
stuff, what can I do to make her understand to mind her own business? P.S. You get a bonus of

193
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,160
10 internet points if you can provide a solution that doesn't get me fired. Well, if you're gonna

194
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:48,560
be picky, uh, this is from Worried in Colombia, South, South America. I gotta say, okay, don't,

195
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,400
don't come to us and ask us for the favor of giving you advice and then hamstring us

196
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,600
at the same time, you know? Right. It's like, hey, will you help me move? But you also have

197
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,120
to wear these really constricting jorts. Think of it this way, Griffin, it's like in a video game

198
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,400
where it's like, we need you to go in and steal this thing. Yeah. And you get an achievement if

199
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,120
you don't kill everyone in the process. I guess. All right. So this is completely optional.

200
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,160
Achievement. Now you're speaking my language.

201
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,000
So this is sort of like, we'll start this question like the rock in the rundown,

202
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,760
not using guns. And then if we get stuck, we will use guns. It just won't be as, as brainy.

203
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,480
Sure. Um, so don't look at personal stuff while you're working.

204
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
That's yeah. That's like work 101. If you want to do that,

205
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,040
get a job writing about the video games from your house.

206
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,200
I was gonna say, I don't think you guys are, are qualified to answer this question.

207
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh no. We are hypocrites from way back. I don't know.

208
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,960
I was gonna say, you live your life looking at personal stuff on the internet.

209
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,120
I don't accidentally write about video games.

210
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,080
I, I, uh, I'd be more concerned about like my boss's school. That used to be tough when

211
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,640
I would work at, when I worked at like offices, you're always worried about like how,

212
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,280
what if the boss sees this, this doesn't look like I can't even pretend this is for work.

213
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,720
It's two words. Alt tab.

214
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,200
Alt tab. Now what does that mean?

215
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,520
That's shady though. When you see, when you walk into somebody and you're like,

216
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,880
is that a dick? And then it flickers really quickly.

217
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
How personal do you think this is going?

218
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
They're, they're live streaming a bris.

219
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,440
I assumed it was like, I assumed it was like, they were looking at B dogs.

220
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,120
Travis, no one except you looks at B dogs.

221
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,480
R has ever looked at B dogs.

222
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,760
I think in Columbia, B dogs is pretty big.

223
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
When you say B dogs, no one knows what the fuck you're talking about.

224
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,040
I think, I think you guys will find that many people know what I'm talking about.

225
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,640
No one knows what B dogs are except you.

226
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,360
I see that B dogs is a pretty big deal.

227
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,640
I want to see how much higher you guys are.

228
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I'm going to tell you that no one knows what B dogs are.

229
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,840
I think you'll find that B dogs are pretty popular.

230
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
When do you bring up B dogs?

231
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,040
It's like listening to Mariah Carey kibitz.

232
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
When you bring up B dogs,

233
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,240
it makes everybody sadder because they don't know what the fuck you're saying.

234
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,560
And it's time for them to learn.

235
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Hey guys, I want to talk to you about B dogs.

236
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,360
No, no, no.

237
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
Fair enough. Fair enough.

238
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,200
You're not using our show as a platform for spraying your madness.

239
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,640
I've got something that might walk the line of fire firing.

240
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,140
Okay.

241
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,320
Blanket fort.

242
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,840
Now listen, you got the cubicle and the cubicle seems like

243
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,120
the perfect like chassis for a blanket fort, right?

244
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,000
You really just have to have like the one blanket for a roof

245
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,160
and then the one blanket for the entry way.

246
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,080
And then all of a sudden you you're dealing with a blanket fort situation.

247
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,440
Yeah, that doesn't seem like a big deal.

248
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
Do you think the boss can come by and be like,

249
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
hey, I'm going to need you to take this blanket fort down.

250
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
Nobody's ever said that.

251
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
I think unless you work at Pixar, it's not okay to build a blanket fort.

252
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,480
Yes. Yeah.

253
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,280
You know, the iPad.

254
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,960
If you work at Pixar, it is no holds barred.

255
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,760
Anything goes.

256
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
Six year old stuff.

257
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
Yeah.

258
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
You want to ride a razor scooter around?

259
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Whenever you come in, you have to take your shoes off

260
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,920
and put them in a cubby hole.

261
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,200
Yeah.

262
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
There's a ball pit in the corner.

263
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,000
The only sin at Pixar is to not hang up the sign that says

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
don't come in my blanket fort.

265
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm dreamagineering in here.

266
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,120
I'm trying to make a wish.

267
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
Dreamagineering.

268
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
It's one step up from imagineering.

269
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,800
That nothing good comes from imagineering anymore.

270
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,760
No one has imagination.

271
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,280
But dreamagineering is where you sort of half sleep,

272
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,040
half read a comic book and just let your muse wander.

273
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,960
You smoke like half a bowl of salvia.

274
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,560
Half a bowl of salvia and then just head to the streets of inspiration.

275
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,240
And you're like, oh, talking cars.

276
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,480
Yeah.

277
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,320
And then you make Cars 3.

278
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
This coyote is screaming at me.

279
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,440
No, we can't use that one.

280
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
But keep dreamagineering.

281
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
You'll find it.

282
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,080
And then I watched As a Bear Ate the Placenta.

283
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,600
No, that's not a good Pixar movie.

284
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
That's a bad one, actually.

285
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,360
That's a bad Pixar movie.

286
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,480
Placenta can talk?

287
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,000
Let's think about it.

288
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,640
I like it.

289
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,760
Can we get Buscemi?

290
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
Can we sign Buscemi on as talking placenta?

291
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
Can we get Ryan Phillippe into the studio to play the bear that eats the placenta?

292
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,960
That could be a good movie.

293
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,920
I would watch that movie.

294
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,120
That's what Brave's about.

295
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,640
And you could just call that movie The Bear That Ate the Placenta.

296
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
It's very descriptive.

297
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,680
And it's catchy.

298
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,200
Here's the thing, though.

299
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
It's gotta be 3D.

300
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,760
Gotta be 3D.

301
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,720
When the bear tears into the placenta and shakes it out of his matted fur,

302
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,080
I want that placenta to just come soaring into the audience.

303
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,720
Because I think it's about time kids learn what placenta is.

304
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
Yeah, I think that we could actually make it in 4D and have it reach back through time.

305
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,080
That's appropriate.

306
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,120
That's the kind of dreamagineering that you come up with at Pixar.

307
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,000
Time travel.

308
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Time travel.

309
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,360
Right.

310
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
We all used to be placenta, you know?

311
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
Why not go back and remind ourselves?

312
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
I don't think that's how it works.

313
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,880
I don't think you're made of placenta at any point.

314
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
I have to admit to you, Travis, that when you said 4D,

315
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,600
I automatically assumed that you were just going to launch

316
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
chunks of placenta at the children in the audience.

317
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
I understood that is what 4D meant.

318
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
I thought 4D was smell-o-vision.

319
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah, well...

320
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,320
Can we bring back scents around?

321
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,440
Yeah, I'm sorry, Travis.

322
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,840
Do you think you're going to get chunks of placenta launched at you

323
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,280
and you're not going to smell them?

324
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,120
How fresh is this?

325
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,240
I would love to see a movie in which they do it in 4D

326
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,440
but they remove smell from the equation.

327
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,320
Like, put on these glasses and also this noseflip.

328
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,160
Why am I going to waste fresh placenta

329
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,560
when I could be selling that to Tyra Banks for pennies,

330
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,720
for, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars?

331
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,760
I'm going to use old placenta when I chuck it at the kids.

332
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,640
Huh?

333
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:17,920
Sorry, guys.

334
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,720
The FCC is here.

335
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,840
They say that we've said placenta way too many times in this episode.

336
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
The man's shutting us down.

337
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,600
Now we have to change it to schmutzenta.

338
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,280
Now we got to change it to baby lube.

339
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,360
This is easy.

340
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,480
We change placenta, cat, bear to a dog, Milo notice 2.

341
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
I'm going to the bank in 3D.

342
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
Oh my god, his whiskers.

343
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,760
Those dogs are...

344
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
I bet all the animals in that movie are dead.

345
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,560
Every animal.

346
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Oh, Homeward Bound, it's all dead.

347
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,360
All dead.

348
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,320
All dead.

349
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Shadow went first.

350
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,240
You know it.

351
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,680
You know Shadow went first.

352
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,440
Also, look who's talking.

353
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,400
That baby's dead.

354
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,960
Yeah.

355
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
If Homeward Bound, The Incredible Journey,

356
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,320
the movie where dogs go across country to find their owners,

357
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
if that movie would play five minutes later,

358
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,800
you would just see the dogs having heart attacks and die

359
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,920
because they went so far.

360
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,560
You know, I actually know that that movie is a work of fiction,

361
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,080
not just because the dogs talk,

362
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,160
but because at no point does one of them roll over

363
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
and show you his boner.

364
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,760
You know, Homeward Bound, what they don't show you

365
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,880
is the next, like, five or ten years living with those animals

366
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
is going to be insufferable.

367
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,360
Yeah.

368
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
You know, you throw the stick and...

369
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,000
Let's go for a walk.

370
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
I don't really feel like going for a walk.

371
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,080
Oh, really?

372
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,120
Because you fucking left me in San Francisco, you cunt.

373
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,160
You remember?

374
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
You fucking piece of shit.

375
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,080
Oh, you want me to go fetch?

376
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,920
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to

377
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,280
because I fetched you from across the country.

378
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,000
So I'm cool.

379
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm fetching forever.

380
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,600
Were you going to eat all that turkey?

381
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,560
I didn't think so.

382
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
Give me the rest of your turkey.

383
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,720
So guys, do you think that there is a website

384
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
that this person could go to that would not get them fired,

385
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,640
but would also teach their coworker a lesson

386
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,560
about looking over someone's shoulder?

387
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,680
Ooh, yeah.

388
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
Oh, yeah.

389
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,720
Oh, yeah, like pipe bomb stuff.

390
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,440
No.

391
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,000
No?

392
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
No, fired.

393
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,680
Fired.

394
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,160
Fired.

395
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,720
That's fired.

396
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,960
Because I immediately went to something

397
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
that was titled like how to eat your coworker

398
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,040
but I think that would get you fired.

399
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,840
Sword polishing.

400
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,800
Okay.

401
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I think the whole internet is so weird now.

402
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,320
It's hard to think of something that's not really broken down.

403
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,720
You could get on a dating site for 13-year-olds.

404
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
Yeah, we didn't actually come up with a good name for that.

405
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,480
Do you guys have, like, Teenster sounds pretty good,

406
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,360
but I'm not sure that's working.

407
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,400
Let's mull it over.

408
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,040
Teen love.

409
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,080
Teen zone for kids.

410
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,040
Teen zone for kids.

411
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,120
Teen zone for kids and fake kids that are uncles, actually.

412
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,000
Secretly uncles.

413
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,640
You know, there's a pen and teller book,

414
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,760
and I can't remember what it's,

415
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,160
it's how to mess with your friends.

416
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,640
Is that it?

417
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,840
I don't remember.

418
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,560
I don't know.

419
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,120
But at one point, they talk about being on a train or plane

420
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,480
and somebody reading over your shoulder

421
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,160
and type out onto like a Word document.

422
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,600
Like, I know that you're reading this.

423
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,360
I know I can see you.

424
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,800
We're looking over my shoulder.

425
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,760
Oh, that's pretty good.

426
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,120
Actually, write a note to that person

427
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,800
and then make them feel bad when they scope it.

428
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,880
There's nothing.

429
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,680
Here's the problem, though.

430
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,720
There's nothing that you can do on your computer

431
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
that you shouldn't be doing at work

432
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,520
that won't be so like incredibly scintillating

433
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,160
that this person won't redouble their efforts

434
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,600
to peep your business.

435
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,000
Right.

436
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,360
Oh, you know what it is?

437
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,080
Here's what you do.

438
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,400
Have your personal website or whatever,

439
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,440
whatever you're checking out,

440
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,920
and then when they come in, close it real quick.

441
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,120
But your background is just a collage of pictures of them.

442
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,880
That's it.

443
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
That's circle gets the square.

444
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,400
Circle gets the square.

445
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,080
Travis has finally helped somebody.

446
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,640
It only took us 102 episodes, but we did it.

447
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,880
Someone has been helped.

448
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
Guys, do you want a Yahoo?

449
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:04,880
Yeah.

450
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,440
Yeah.

451
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,920
This Yahoo is sent in by Malik Marcellus.

452
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,560
Thank you, Malik.

453
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

454
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,480
Yeah, baby.

455
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:12,800
Yeah.

456
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,040
No.

457
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,960
Justin, could you say that correctly, please?

458
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,840
Yeah, baby.

459
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,340
Yeah.

460
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,920
Thank you.

461
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:29,440
Who fucking asks, what themed party can I have for Halloween?

462
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,160
I want to attract lots of lovely ladies.

463
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,040
Oh, behave.

464
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,880
Oh, no.

465
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,760
All right, Griffin.

466
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,560
I'm going to have to take this question away from you.

467
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,880
OK.

468
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,960
Can you please paste the text into our Skype window?

469
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,240
OK, you just typed, fuck you.

470
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,160
That is enough.

471
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,320
What themed party can I have for Halloween?

472
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,640
I want to attract lots of lovely ladies.

473
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
Oh, behave.

474
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,920
That is her fault.

475
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,000
It sounds like Austin Powers had a stroke.

476
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,280
I did.

477
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
This isn't my fault.

478
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,120
It's Mike Myers' fault for not releasing a new Austin Powers movie.

479
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,680
I don't know what he sounds like.

480
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,120
It sounds like your face is melting while you're doing it.

481
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,440
It's like Austin Powers had a bucket of water.

482
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,240
I got a gram, call him baby, boy.

483
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
I got a Haruka now.

484
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
Now I can't take your body.

485
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,160
Oh, you can't baby, yeah.

486
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Every day alone, I feel great Elvis Costello.

487
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,120
It sounds like if Austin Powers were a fat woman on South Park.

488
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,080
That's the sound I apparently was.

489
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,400
Yeah.

490
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,960
Oh, behave.

491
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,320
OK, I think this guy say something.

492
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,440
I think this person has their heart set on a theme.

493
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,440
I think the theme has been decided.

494
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,960
Guys, I don't want to get outside of the question,

495
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,280
but is it possible that this person has just chosen

496
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,040
to live an Austin Powers lifestyle?

497
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,480
Can I share the top answer?

498
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,200
The top answer from Yahoo Answers user Rock Titan says,

499
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,320
it's April.

500
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:38,480
Oh, he's the pragmatist.

501
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,360
Oh, that's great.

502
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,720
Any Halloween themed party?

503
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,240
The harder thing to think of is a Halloween themed party

504
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,760
that women somehow won't find a way to make sexy.

505
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,040
Is that too much?

506
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,400
What are you saying?

507
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,640
I'm saying that-

508
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,960
So you're saying like a Captain Pike themed party

509
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
where everybody rolls up in a big container.

510
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,040
Maybe this is, I don't know.

511
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,440
Maybe this isn't true anymore since none of us are in college.

512
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,280
But I feel like in college, if you had any Halloween party,

513
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,000
there would be at least one to two women there

514
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,680
who were dressed up in a scintillating way.

515
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,160
Hey, are you in college right now?

516
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,320
Can you not listen to podcasts?

517
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,160
I promise you, there will be lots of time for us.

518
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,560
We'll still be here when you're 31 years old.

519
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,200
Don't waste your college years listening to us, please.

520
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,720
Indoor us away in a vault,

521
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,040
and then when there's some kind of apocalypse

522
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,560
and everyone else in the world is killed,

523
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
there will be time then.

524
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,120
There will be time for that.

525
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,360
If you have listened to every episode,

526
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,280
that's like five entire days that you could have spent-

527
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,360
Getting it.

528
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,860
Who knows?

529
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,680
Just getting it.

530
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
Man, woman?

531
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,360
It's a good time to check in.

532
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,760
It's been a solid five months now.

533
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,360
We're, you know, we're a good way into 2012.

534
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,880
Are you guys getting it?

535
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,720
Like, are you in college and listening to a podcast right now?

536
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
Unless you're getting a mani-pedi

537
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,800
and are getting ready to go out and get it.

538
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Like, I don't- I can't think of a good reason

539
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,280
to be listening to this show right now if you're in college.

540
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,120
It's a fucking owl!

541
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,240
Think about that one thing that you want to do,

542
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,160
but you're too afraid to do,

543
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
but you're too afraid to do.

544
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,400
Hit the pause button and just go fucking get that thing.

545
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,360
Get it.

546
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,720
Get whatever it is.

547
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,080
You guys have just blown my mind

548
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,400
because there is probably a pretty solid group

549
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,080
of our listeners that have one month of college left.

550
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,600
Oh my god!

551
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,440
They will graduate at the end of May.

552
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,720
Never to- never to be in school again.

553
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,640
This is it.

554
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,040
My last month of college was the best month of school time

555
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,880
that I ever had in my entire life.

556
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,520
And if you are not- if you are not dipping-

557
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,440
you're- you're just drunk on, well, pabs.

558
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,080
But you're also drunk on, like,

559
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,440
fear of what's going to happen once you get out of school.

560
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,960
You're drunk on, like, excitement

561
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,120
that you're about to be finished with college.

562
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,600
You're- you're just- you're drunk on power

563
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,720
because you're the highest.

564
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,600
You're the highest.

565
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,520
Hey, if you're a little nervous about leaving, don't.

566
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,560
I treated-

567
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
Van Wilde that shit.

568
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,800
I treated myself through year five and I don't regret it.

569
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,360
Well.

570
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,760
You know what?

571
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,160
You guys know why I had to take a fifth year of college?

572
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,880
Because I failed Spanish.

573
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
I never knew that.

574
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,320
I thought you just, like-

575
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,680
I thought it was-

576
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,720
I thought it was a choice.

577
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,800
I thought it was because you wanted to change your major.

578
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
No, I failed Spanish.

579
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,320
Shh.

580
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,640
Okay, so don't- don't rage that hard.

581
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,600
I raged so hard I forgot my sign language.

582
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,680
Hey, do you know why I failed Spanish?

583
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,360
Because I walked into the class

584
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,600
and the motherfucker is speaking Spanish.

585
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Dog, I don't speak it.

586
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,680
I know this is the fourth one of these I've had.

587
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
Like, I don't speak this language.

588
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,400
Can you please?

589
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,720
He would make assignments in Spanish.

590
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,200
I don't even know what that work was.

591
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,880
You would show up with a picture of your family

592
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,320
you had drawn in red crayon,

593
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,440
like, is this- is this it?

594
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,120
Is this what you wanted?

595
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,680
Is this it?

596
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,880
I baked empanadas.

597
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,320
Is that what you wanted?

598
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,840
Did you want this?

599
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,000
Did you want these empanadas?

600
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,280
This is what I made for you.

601
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
Say that again, please.

602
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,840
Empanadas.

603
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,360
Start to sound like Marlee Matlin taking a Spanish class.

604
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,480
Justin is either-

605
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,520
He has an aphasia or he's having a stroke in real life, IRL.

606
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,960
Empanadas, empanadas.

607
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,760
Okay.

608
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,120
Nope, your tongue is melting.

609
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,000
Get to the hospital.

610
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,000
Time loss is brain loss.

611
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,360
I got time-illitis.

612
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,040
Let's-

613
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
Can I take it to the bridge?

614
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,440
Yeah, take it to the bridge.

615
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,320
Can I take it to the bridge?

616
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,280
Yeah.

617
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:41,840
Guys, this is an exciting time for my brother and my brother and me, busy, busy time, so

618
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,160
many people to say that we're thinking about them and other people are thinking about them.

619
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,560
I would like Griffin to tell me about this first- first group.

620
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,800
This first message is from Alex and Kate for their good friend, Dan Kober.

621
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,160
Happy birthday, Dan Kober.

622
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,320
They have been friends with Dan Kober.

623
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,640
God, I hope I'm saying that name right since I'm saying it a lot.

624
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,720
They've been friends for over 10 years.

625
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,440
They met in 10th grade chemistry and Alex was the best man at Dan's wedding.

626
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,080
He and his lovely wife, Shannon, live in Grove City, Ohio.

627
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,600
They have a shit ton of cats.

628
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,760
He likes home brewing.

629
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,680
He likes video games and a computer engineer, so he sounds like a neat guy.

630
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,480
I mean, Griffin, it says four cats.

631
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,080
You know what you're making sound like?

632
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,360
He has the most cats.

633
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,360
There's a possibility that he will die and his body won't be discovered for five days

634
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
and he'll be partially consumed by all of his cats.

635
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,720
If you have one cat, that's cool.

636
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,640
If you have two cats, they better do like tandem tricks.

637
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,440
Any more than that, it's a metric shit time.

638
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,920
Anyway, happy birthday to you, Dan Kober.

639
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,440
I'm not judging your number of cats.

640
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,400
Fill your life with love.

641
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,000
Measure it in love.

642
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
Seasons of cats of love.

643
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:02,080
Guys, in the spirit of 20 Does, our next advertiser quit their job, packed their bags,

644
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,280
moved away from Seattle and applied to grad school, then spent a month making his first

645
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,360
iOS game, Singing Star.

646
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,560
The idea is that you travel through space seeding barren plants with life using musical

647
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:21,520
shooting stars, which is basically what Cher has been doing for three decades in a metaphysical

648
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,240
sense.

649
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,880
No, in the literal body of a spaceship.

650
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,720
Cher has a spaceship.

651
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,360
I did the art programming and sound design, everything.

652
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,320
He's not a pro game developer, so maybe Travis could review it since he's not a pro either.

653
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,240
So search for Singing Star in the app store and download it and let everybody know that

654
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,120
I'm going to get it right now.

655
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,680
Now, if you go impregnate, impregnate some planets.

656
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,160
I think that's impregnating planets, basically.

657
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,080
Here's another one.

658
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,280
This one was sent in by Peter McCaffrey for his dear wife, Megan McCaffrey.

659
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,960
He says that he wants to wish his wife, Megan, good luck delivering their third child on

660
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,680
May 29th.

661
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,280
She's 20.

662
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
She's 25 years young.

663
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,440
She's getting it done.

664
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,200
She is a saint, and all women would be so lucky to be like you, and I am a lucky so-and-so

665
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,240
to be with you.

666
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
Keep getting it, honey.

667
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,320
20 does.

668
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,960
Get it.

669
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,160
Just effing get it.

670
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,600
I like this guy.

671
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,480
He really goes on a tear there.

672
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah.

673
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,480
I also think this would be the most amazing Lamaze class.

674
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,880
Yeah.

675
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,600
Go.

676
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,000
Get it.

677
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,240
Get it.

678
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,040
Fucking dig deep.

679
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,960
20 does.

680
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,520
I think that this is actually Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser, and he's just like, tear

681
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,000
it up.

682
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,040
You can do this.

683
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,520
Get it.

684
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,480
That is.

685
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,680
You guys know Bob Harper?

686
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,000
Please don't be ridiculous.

687
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,960
What are you talking about?

688
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,240
What the fuck are you talking about?

689
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,280
He's the man on my workout DVDs, and he's like, reach deep down inside yourself.

690
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,080
Find your soul.

691
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,640
Rip it out.

692
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,000
Griffin, can I ask you this?

693
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,720
Use its power.

694
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,760
Eat the placenta.

695
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,600
Has there ever been a moment before that has worked on you?

696
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,720
And ironically, please be honest, this is for posterity.

697
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,400
No, well, it makes me angry at Bob Harper, which is my own source of energy.

698
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,560
When I'm working out on his expert edition workout, I am fueled by a small son of hatred

699
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,160
for Bob Harper that I keep inside me.

700
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,800
Megan, maybe if you can focus on a small sphere of hatred for Bob Harper, you can get through

701
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,760
this pregnancy.

702
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
Congratulations to you and Peter.

703
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,120
Travis, we have, let's all go to the movies.

704
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,480
Let's all go to the movies.

705
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,240
Let's all go to the movies.

706
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,360
Let's all go to the movies and hear some guys talk about stuff.

707
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,840
Well, have you guys checked out cinemabums.com?

708
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,040
I love cinnamon buns.

709
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,760
No, no, cinemabums.

710
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,480
Travis, you're saying it?

711
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,240
I'm just hearing cinnamon buns and I'm-

712
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,760
No, cinemabums.

713
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,260
Okay.

714
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,600
I think they make cinnamon buns.

715
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,320
It sounds like if a little kid tried to say cinnamon buns.

716
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,200
It's adorable, Travis.

717
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,480
I just ate a bunch of peanut butter and I want to talk about cinnamon buns.

718
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Pretending you're one of the characters in Family Circus and it's adorable.

719
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,200
If you follow my footsteps back, you can get the cinemabum stuff.

720
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,920
Now I can't even say it right, you assholes.

721
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Jeffy eat it all the cinemabums.

722
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,440
cinemabums.com, Travis, what is it?

723
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,520
I don't even want to talk about it now.

724
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,400
You guys have made me so conscious.

725
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,040
Well, you have to.

726
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,680
They paid us.

727
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,000
It's a great webcomic.

728
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,760
It comes out every Monday and Thursday and it's funny takes on movies and they talk about

729
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,400
movies that are coming out now and just cinema in general.

730
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,280
I'm sure that will appeal to the perplexingly gigantic webcomic audience that we have.

731
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,440
It's got its own style.

732
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,840
It's a distinctive style, which I appreciate.

733
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,480
They're not trying to blend in here.

734
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,040
And I'm I read some of these before we started and I got a big kick out of it.

735
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,120
cinemabums.com is the name of the site.

736
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,320
You can go and read the webcomic and enjoy it.

737
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,840
We would recommend it.

738
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,720
Go go on updated Mondays and Thursdays.

739
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,320
So there's a new one right now.

740
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:19,760
Do you guys have any ideas of how to weave these fucking two things together?

741
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,720
Nope.

742
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,040
Great.

743
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,360
Thanks.

744
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,480
You're very, very helpful.

745
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,640
Hey, what's that smell?

746
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,680
I think that it's cinnamon buns.

747
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,960
You tell me it's not, but I'm a grown adult.

748
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,280
You say it is cinema bums.

749
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,560
I said, that's what I said.

750
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,720
Then you say it's a webcomic and you can't eat those.

751
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,920
I say, watch me.

752
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,480
So I eat the webcomic and I get real sick.

753
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,560
I have to go to the hospital for a week.

754
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,760
And while I'm there, you say, Hey, I know how to occupy your dilated filled hours.

755
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,720
It's an app called singing star.

756
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
And so I get it and enjoy it.

757
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,200
There it is.

758
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,800
Threaded the needle.

759
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,160
No, like Josh didn't read his hay day.

760
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,400
Hello, fake radio listeners.

761
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
I didn't see you over there.

762
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,360
This is judge John Hodgman relaxing in his chambers.

763
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,440
You know, I've resolved the greatest moral conflicts of our time, like the potluck problem.

764
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,760
Snob versus slob.

765
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
And of course the toot dispute.

766
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,280
Do you have a pressing issue that needs swift, decisive justice?

767
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:46,560
Visit us at www.maximumfun.org slash J J H O that's JJ Ho for judge John Hodgman.

768
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,920
And here are the results of each case on my weekly podcast.

769
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,120
Judge John Hodgman.

770
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,240
You can subscribe in iTunes or find it online at maximum fun.org.

771
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,600
This is the sound of a gavel.

772
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,200
That is all.

773
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,520
This question comes to us from, well, I'll tell you at the end.

774
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,040
Many of your letters are about how to deal with unintentionally douchey family,

775
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,120
friends and acquaintances who I think probably just got comfortable with their surroundings

776
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,640
and slid into doucheyness.

777
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,840
How can we police ourselves so we don't make such a slide?

778
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,160
That's from moderately comfortable in the Midwest.

779
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,200
You got to, you got to surround yourself.

780
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,720
You can't, you can't police yourself.

781
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,480
I don't think you got to surround yourself with douche.

782
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,440
Slithmus tests that you can, that you can all, you can police them.

783
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,960
It's like a circle of trust, you know?

784
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,040
Ooh, I like that.

785
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,400
A circle of accountability.

786
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,880
Jack, can you scoot a little closer to your mic?

787
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,080
I hear quite an echo.

788
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,640
Yes.

789
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:40,960
Thank you.

790
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,280
Sorry.

791
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,200
Um, you gotta, you gotta, fuck, record every conversation that you have.

792
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,360
And then like go.

793
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,480
Hire a stenographer.

794
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,080
Well, you don't have to go that far, but you can just like listen to every conversation

795
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,200
that you have that you've recorded.

796
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,560
I think you should hire a stenographer because here's my thing.

797
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,840
You can create a job and that's what this economy needs.

798
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,160
Thanks.

799
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,160
You're right, Travis.

800
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,760
Thank you, Travis, for thinking about our economy when the government's so selfish.

801
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:12,800
Thank you.

802
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,720
And then hire a stenographer for your stenographer, a tinier stenographer.

803
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,240
I actually think that if you have a stenographer writing down all your stuff,

804
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,600
you're going to say cooler stuff because you're going to know there's that,

805
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,280
there's that accountability there.

806
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,440
And you get to yell stuff out, like read that back to me.

807
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Can I get a copy of that?

808
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,560
No, actually, Vicki, you can see here what I said was that I will do the laundry when

809
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,320
I get some time, as you see here.

810
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,080
That would be actually really good for marriage.

811
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,680
If you can get a marriage stenographer, it would be hugely helpful.

812
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,840
And I sound like I'm about to go on a Tom Pappas bit,

813
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,160
so I'm just going to steer, steer, steer off here, pull off on the junction.

814
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,920
Pump, pump the brakes there, men of a certain age.

815
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,040
I don't know.

816
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
I really enjoyed the concept that douchiness is caused by comfort.

817
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,240
I like that idea.

818
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,360
Like douchiness is like a pair of sweatpants you slip into.

819
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,200
It's not, I don't think that it's quite that matter of fact, but like,

820
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,360
I think that is the way that it happens most of the time.

821
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,880
You know what?

822
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,520
Fuck it.

823
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,200
If you become a douche and all your friends and family become douches too,

824
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,400
like just, just try to like corral that and keep it inside your own bubble,

825
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,080
but then just like live in it.

826
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,120
It's fine.

827
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,720
Hey guys, can I read a question?

828
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,280
Oh shit.

829
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,160
I know, but I really like this question and I feel like if Justin reads it,

830
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,520
he'll cop out halfway through.

831
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,000
Okay.

832
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,400
Okay.

833
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,680
That's always a good sign for me.

834
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,160
As long as it's not about pee or farts.

835
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,600
Oh no.

836
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,280
My fellow coworker and I are having a debate and we need you to settle it for us.

837
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,160
One day we both happened to use the urinal at work at the same time

838
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,760
and my coworker passed gas.

839
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,880
I told him you can't do that in public bathroom,

840
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,120
only in the privacy of your own home.

841
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,000
He disagreed.

842
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,880
He stated that it's perfectly acceptable to fart in a public bathroom

843
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
because that is what goes on in the bathroom.

844
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,480
Please shed some light on the situation.

845
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,160
And that's from Flatulent in Fargo.

846
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,680
I don't want to do this.

847
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,800
I can't talk about this.

848
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:09,680
Yep.

849
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,160
Come on.

850
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,880
Farts.

851
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,840
I don't want to do this.

852
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,400
I don't want to talk.

853
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,760
Why don't you guys want to talk about farts?

854
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,160
Be an adult, talk about farts and pee and poopy and stuff.

855
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,840
Okay, but I don't want to do any of that.

856
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,280
No, but like an adult.

857
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,160
Talk about it like an adult.

858
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,560
No, but I don't want to do that.

859
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,520
We'll call it flatness when you release flatness.

860
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,120
Let me answer this question in like 10 seconds

861
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,160
and then we can all move on with our lives

862
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,920
and pretend we never talked about duty.

863
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,420
Okay.

864
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,560
Farting is 100% okay in the bathroom

865
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,760
because you poop in the bathroom

866
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,000
and what are you, some kind of fucking hypocrite?

867
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah.

868
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,480
Yep.

869
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,760
Right?

870
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,520
Farting in the bathroom, totally cool,

871
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
and everybody pretending like it didn't happen.

872
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,320
The FCC's back, they said, oh, you might as well

873
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,080
title this episode Fart Placenta

874
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,920
and then put a little sticker on it that says

875
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
do not release and then don't release it.

876
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,120
Oh, this one's going in the fucking Disney vault.

877
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,200
Right next to the Blu-ray of the buried in placenta.

878
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,840
We're going to bring that out back in 2030.

879
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,360
Audiences will think that's tame by then.

880
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,440
They'll be completely over the whole bear placenta thing.

881
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,040
Let's do something else.

882
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,920
Anything else, please.

883
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,760
But farting's totally cool.

884
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,800
Okay, next question.

885
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,880
Next question.

886
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,040
Did I ever tell you guys this story?

887
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,280
I was in an airport bathroom

888
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,880
and this dude was in the stall obviously on his phone

889
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,800
having a conversation with someone

890
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,840
and just going to town like some of the

891
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,640
raunchiest toots I've ever heard

892
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,240
and was just not holding back

893
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,960
during a fucking conversation on the phone

894
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,480
in a very public restroom.

895
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,760
It was like a trumpet solo in a Chicago song.

896
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,680
Yes, it was amazing.

897
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,000
See, this bothers me.

898
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
This is why phones should...

899
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,520
They should actually collect your phones

900
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,960
before you go into a bathroom

901
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
because by going into a bathroom

902
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,960
you're entering into like a

903
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,960
I know what you did last summer situation

904
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,640
where we're all doing terrible things

905
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,280
but we promised not to.

906
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,240
It's the counter silence.

907
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,000
Exactly, exactly.

908
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,200
And you promise that the things that are happening in there

909
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,560
you're just going to pretend never happened.

910
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,080
And it's embarrassing when you're in a stall

911
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,360
next to somebody else in a stall

912
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,400
who's on their phone and they're like

913
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,600
hey man, what's up?

914
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,640
On their phone and you're like

915
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,440
not much.

916
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,760
I had some Taco Bell earlier.

917
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,840
I had some Loco Drites.

918
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,720
This is, why are we...

919
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,720
Then he's like yeah, she's doing okay.

920
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,960
You're like ah fuck, god damn it.

921
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,920
And then you gotta pretend like

922
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,840
you're having a conversation on your phone.

923
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah, yeah dad.

924
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,880
Sorry I haven't called in a while.

925
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
I had a couple minutes free and...

926
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,360
We've talked way too long about this.

927
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,840
Here's a Yahoo answer that was sent in by Sam McKay.

928
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,400
Thanks Sam.

929
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Haley who asks

930
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,400
Cute inside jokes?

931
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,360
I'm writing my friends' notes.

932
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,040
Like you know the ones you pass in the halls

933
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,120
and I don't want to be lame and repeat past things.

934
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,080
I'm out of ideas.

935
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,120
So are there cute inside jokes or funny things

936
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,400
you and your friends talk about?

937
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,840
Like examples from me.

938
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,880
Banana face.

939
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,760
Examples from me, banana face, inside joke.

940
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,800
Neon nerds, with a Z, code name.

941
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,600
Let's go eat ice cream.

942
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,360
Random, choo choo, IDK.

943
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,600
Stuff like that.

944
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,280
Anything I could put down to be cute

945
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,440
even though it might be a code name to someone else

946
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,800
but just something cute for me.

947
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,560
Please, smiley face, heart Haley.

948
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,640
This is the grossest thing I've ever heard.

949
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,400
Choo choo, IDK.

950
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,040
Ice cream, random.

951
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,160
Jelly bracelets.

952
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,280
Dr. Scholls.

953
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,440
Hey, I don't know how to write this to you

954
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,120
but this was asked by a 50 year old man in high-focals

955
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,560
eating Chef Boyardee out of the can.

956
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,160
So it was a middle school plus 20.

957
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,200
Yeah, he just wants to,

958
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,920
just what are you guys talking about?

959
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,000
What is happening there?

960
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,960
I just want to know.

961
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,080
I just want to know what the things are.

962
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,080
Sneaker snappers, what's up?

963
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,560
Edamame.

964
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,080
You guys are really bad at this.

965
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,800
Mop and Glow.

966
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:24,560
Why?

967
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,760
Power of Pine Soul.

968
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,360
IRS form 1099.

969
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,880
Why?

970
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,240
Fukushimi.

971
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,040
Fukushimi.

972
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,400
It's Fushigi.

973
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,960
Fushigi.

974
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,440
Umari.

975
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,600
Yakitori.

976
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,040
Kwanzaa.

977
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Shamil Shamal, Little Paws, Pepper Incorporated.

978
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:45,600
Random.

979
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,680
Random, Kwanzaa.

980
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,160
What do you think kids are talking about, Travis?

981
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,240
Apparently I do not know.

982
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,640
I thought I did until about five minutes ago.

983
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,240
I thought I had my finger on the pulse.

984
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,440
Pokemon cards.

985
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,960
Words, LOL.

986
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,320
I thought they talked about the Green Ranger

987
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,600
turning into the White Ranger.

988
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,240
Raffinator.

989
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:04,880
That was way off.

990
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,600
So yeah, any of those things that we just said,

991
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,080
or you could just like collect two random words

992
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,080
off of, I don't know, anything,

993
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,160
and just say them with like a smiley face

994
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,000
or like a lull, I think works.

995
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,760
You can put lull in there.

996
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,920
Do kids still use Tamagotchis?

997
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,240
Can you talk about your Tamagotchi?

998
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,840
They replace it with Fushigums.

999
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,520
Fushigums?

1000
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,400
Fushigums?

1001
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,000
Hey, get over here, Fushigums.

1002
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,640
I can actually twirl my Tamagotchi.

1003
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,200
I can twirl my Tamagotchi between my fingers

1004
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,520
and elbows like a magic trick.

1005
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,400
He loves it too.

1006
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,360
He has such a good time.

1007
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,840
He makes a sad face and then poops

1008
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,560
and then I can play with him between my fingers

1009
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,160
and then I'll give him a walk.

1010
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,640
Those things are so fucking...

1011
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,880
You're playing with a calculator, idiot.

1012
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,400
Idiot Griffin from 2000.

1013
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,040
Stupid 1998 Griffin.

1014
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,160
Griffin, do better.

1015
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,680
I like how you retconned your age

1016
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,360
at which you thought Tamagotchis were incredible.

1017
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,320
I never bought a Tamagotchi.

1018
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,200
This is a true story.

1019
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,960
I was walking home from school one day.

1020
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,640
It was actually made in a giga pet.

1021
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,360
You remember that?

1022
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,400
It was like a knockoff.

1023
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,880
Anyway, I found it lying in the grass

1024
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,200
while I was walking home and the screen was cracked

1025
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,720
as if to insinuate somebody was like,

1026
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,400
you fucking giga pet and threw it to the ground.

1027
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,440
Like, I'm done with you.

1028
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,640
And that person is making someone a wonderful parent right now.

1029
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,140
Yeah.

1030
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,840
Fucking Timmy, get out of here.

1031
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,920
I'm sorry to have to do this,

1032
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,000
but I do think I need the rest of that story.

1033
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
What happens after you find the cracked giga pet?

1034
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,800
Do you throw it in the garbage?

1035
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,000
No, no, no, I kept him.

1036
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,000
Did you nurse him back to health?

1037
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,880
I mean, there was some structural,

1038
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,160
there was some hardware damage.

1039
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,720
Let's remake Homer bound with giga pets.

1040
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,720
You can think of something sadder right now.

1041
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,520
If you can think of something sadder right now

1042
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,120
than 12 year old Griffin playing with a cracked screen giga pet

1043
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,520
like some sort of war refugee.

1044
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,920
Please let me know what it is to watch this image from my mind.

1045
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,840
I couldn't be more depressed right now.

1046
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,800
He's wearing pumps, but our parents can afford pumps.

1047
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,760
They're squeezers.

1048
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,520
You're killing me now.

1049
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,080
I kept that giga pet very happy for two weeks

1050
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,680
and then the screen bled out

1051
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,120
and then I kept interacting with him

1052
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,640
even though I couldn't see him anymore.

1053
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,960
And then about two weeks after that, the battery died.

1054
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,840
I walked in on Griffin sucking out the juice

1055
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
from the liquid crystal display.

1056
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,960
He wanted the giga pet to live inside him forever.

1057
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,280
My body is just like a big mech suit

1058
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,960
for the giga pet that lives inside me.

1059
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,600
Okay, so this is when our dumb ass stupid show

1060
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,720
about placentas and shit called My Brother, My Brother, Me

1061
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,320
an advice show for the modern era.

1062
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,120
Thank you for listening for whatever dark purposes you have

1063
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,320
for doing that every week.

1064
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,400
Especially if you're in college, you should probably stop listening.

1065
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,280
Big love to the show.

1066
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,000
Big love.

1067
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,640
Big love.

1068
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,160
Bill Pullman.

1069
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,360
Getting it every day, Bill.

1070
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,320
Congratulations.

1071
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,280
Mace in your face just listened to 20 hours of Bim Bam

1072
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,200
on a long, long drive.

1073
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,720
So thanks to him.

1074
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,200
Thanks to everybody tweeting about the show

1075
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,720
with the M-B-A-M hashtag.

1076
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:41,840
Nick Wustrak, Lil Socrates, Heron Bird, Aurora Hack, Buzz Click, Miluno, everybody.

1077
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,800
I want to thank Sean Roderick and the Long Winters

1078
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,840
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure off the album,

1079
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,880
putting the days to bed.

1080
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,640
Said it before, I'll say it again.

1081
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,200
It's a good band.

1082
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,200
Hey, Justin.

1083
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:57,700
Yes?

1084
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,160
On a personal note, I want to say that I'm very, very glad that Sydney is back

1085
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,240
and you guys are doing the satellite dish again.

1086
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,440
Oh, the satellite dish.

1087
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,680
You mean the satellite dish that you can find on iTunes

1088
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,200
by searching for satellite dish.

1089
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,960
And it's a comedy podcast about TV.

1090
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,400
That's correct.

1091
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,520
That I do with my wife.

1092
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,560
I missed it.

1093
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,800
You know what I didn't miss because it's still been here?

1094
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,240
The In Case of Emergency cast.

1095
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,840
What can you tell me about the In Case of Emergency podcast?

1096
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,440
About emergencies and you do it with two people

1097
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,280
and at least one of them is an Australian.

1098
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,720
That is correct.

1099
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,680
At least one of them.

1100
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,280
We haven't confirmed the other one yet.

1101
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,920
We're not sure.

1102
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:39,040
To my knowledge, at least 33.3 repeating percent of them are in fact Australian.

1103
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,160
And in case of emergency, you can find that on iTunes.

1104
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,840
Just search in case of emergency.

1105
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,160
Oh, you guys want to talk about Rap Zone?

1106
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,400
Yeah, Griffin.

1107
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,920
Tell us all about Rap Zone.

1108
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,000
Well, Rap Zone is a new podcast.

1109
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,120
It's not comedy based.

1110
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,400
There's nothing funny about rhyme.

1111
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,440
Like rhyme will come up with rhyme battles when you're battling

1112
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,960
and you have to rhyme somebody really fast.

1113
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,560
So Rap Zone is like my podcast.

1114
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,440
It's like an advice show, I guess.

1115
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,480
People like calling and ask their rap questions and I advise them.

1116
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,120
That sounds great.

1117
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,840
Now, can people find that on the Zoom marketplace?

1118
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,400
They can't.

1119
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,160
You have to hack into my sub network on Linux.

1120
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,680
It's more of a private chat.

1121
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,800
If you're a Linux user, I can send you my FTP.

1122
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,800
And if you see Griffin in public,

1123
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,400
he'll just give you a jazz disc that has the show on it.

1124
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,040
Yeah.

1125
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,080
And a jazz cigarette.

1126
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,440
Everybody has a jazz player, right?

1127
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:37,920
Yeah.

1128
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,400
I also want to say, while we're congratulating people,

1129
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,000
I want to give one more shout out to Chapman Cara

1130
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,120
because her Twitter icon is her wearing a shirt of ours

1131
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,720
in front of a poster of ours.

1132
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,760
And it makes me happy.

1133
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:54,640
Thank you.

1134
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,840
And we haven't mentioned it in a while,

1135
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,560
but go check out all the other wonderful Max Fun shows

1136
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,600
if you haven't yet.

1137
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,520
Especially, it's brand new.

1138
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,440
It's our newest one, Throwing Shade.

1139
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,480
If you haven't checked it out yet,

1140
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,880
it's every episode is consistently awesome.

1141
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,000
What's great about Throwing Shade is that

1142
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,600
they're only like 30 episodes in.

1143
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,960
You can like listen to all of them.

1144
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,000
And then you can be caught up.

1145
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,360
Do you guys realize how hard it is to stay up on a podcast?

1146
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,920
Like, and have it all listened to?

1147
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,400
It's basically impossible.

1148
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:20,640
Yeah.

1149
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,520
But you can do it now.

1150
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,080
Get on board.

1151
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,760
Get on the Throwing Shade train

1152
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,360
because goddamn, it's the funniest.

1153
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,280
You've earned it.

1154
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,040
So that is our show.

1155
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,960
We really hope you enjoyed it.

1156
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,440
And we hope you will come back.

1157
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,120
Subscribe to us on iTunes and stuff.

1158
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,240
If you don't already.

1159
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,360
Which, how are you getting it?

1160
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,560
You piece of shit.

1161
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,760
Justin just dropped.

1162
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,240
Oh no, Justin.

1163
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,640
Justin just dropped a copy paste of an Amazon receipt

1164
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,560
for a Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball.

1165
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,160
You son of a bitch.

1166
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,360
And it comes with a CD.

1167
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,200
Is it the ball and CD-ROM?

1168
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,480
I think it's a combo.

1169
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,520
God, I hope so.

1170
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,000
If I just get the CD-ROM, I'm gonna be very put out.

1171
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,480
You could use Apple, maybe.

1172
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,880
This final Yahoo was sent in by Tom Powell or Thom Powell.

1173
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,760
Thank you, Tom Pom.

1174
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Frank, who asks,

1175
