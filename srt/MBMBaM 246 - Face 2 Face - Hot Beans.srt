1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,040
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,400
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,720
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:33,040
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:01:01,960
I wish I had more things to pull out of my pocket.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,520
Seriously, serious question before I sit down.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,920
Jacket on or off?

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,620
You know what that...

10
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,240
This is a no jacket required show, my friend.

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Welcome to my brother...

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,480
Oh wait, like, uh...

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,920
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me...

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Holy shit!

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,400
Okay, we're going to start again from the top.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,920
You guys pretend we just came out and not too not familiar.

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,200
There's our sleeping baby.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,520
By the way, Sidney's back there now, so don't worry about being quiet for the baby anymore.

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,600
I want you all wild out.

20
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I appreciate that.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Thank you.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Thank you.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,400
That's a cool night for me, so I do appreciate it.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,920
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:08,360
Like Chilean miners emerging from the depths of the Twin Cities, here we are in Minneapolis.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,960
Juicy Lucy, is that a thing?

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
What?

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,000
I didn't have a lot of preconceived notions about Minneapolis before I came, but then

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,320
I showed up and everybody here is so nice.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
You know what, Justin?

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,040
I would say the greatest audiences in the world live here in Minneapolis.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,920
No, I'm serious.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,680
We are staying at the beautiful Courtyard Marriott.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Please don't come find us at Marriott.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,760
I can't recommend it enough when we're not there.

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:50,440
Right next to our hotel, there's a place called Town Hall Brewery that we had some great cheese

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,680
curds.

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Some really great local brews.

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,280
Some great local brews.

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm traveling with a baby, as you know.

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
We had some great local babies.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
Sydney was a bit worried about how she was going to get home.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
She wanted to leave in the middle of the show if her baby turns into a disaster, which is

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
prone to happen.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Welcome to parenthood.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,520
I said, you can just get an Uber home.

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,360
She said, and this is a few weeks ago I should mention, she said, well, what about that show

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,680
we saw where the guy was using people's Uber data and pretending to be an Uber driver and

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,960
then killing them?

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,360
I said, well, that's fair.

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,840
I don't want you to be killed, so I'll abandon that plan.

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,880
I was recounting this story to Travis yesterday, and I said, how did he do that?

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,040
That doesn't make any sense.

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,720
He said, well, he hacked into Uber's system, and at that point, I realized, wait a minute.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Are you talking about the first five minutes of that episode of CSI Cyber we watched?

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Sorry, my dear wife, who's also a physician.

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,760
Do you remember the documentary?

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,440
Ripped from the headlines by Patricia Arquette.

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Take that.

63
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Thank you.

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
So that was fun.

65
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Here's another fun thing that we had this morning, this is a 100% true Minneapolis story

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,360
for you.

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,440
We were having breakfast.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,100
We tried to find someplace to have brunch, and then we're just like, ugh, it's cold.

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,920
We're just going to go down to, it's called the Bistro, but it's in the ground floor lobby

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,200
of a courtyard in Marriott, so it's not really a bistro.

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,680
I was a super dad, and I asked them to blend up some strawberries.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,660
He's a super dad because he forgot to bring baby food.

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,360
When some lose some, I guess, and they blended up some strawberries with some Oolala super

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,280
food juice or something like that, and she got about three bites in.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:06,240
I look to the right for a second, and she just grabs the cup right onto my lap.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Now this isn't a funny story.

77
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,600
It was sad because it was all over the table, and it was all over the crotch of the only

78
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
jeans I brought.

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
That, okay, that part.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,040
We're on tour right now.

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,360
We're on a four-day tour, and you are a one-jeans packer.

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:33,840
I live my life one jeans at a time, but I- You live your life one jeans at a time.

83
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,560
The frequency of your jeans is not an issue because you just got the one.

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,280
So let me get the end of the story.

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,280
My dear sweet daughter, who I hope is listening to this sometime in 2030-

86
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,840
When podcasts are outlawed.

87
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Dump a Bacchus.

88
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,280
And only outlaws have podcasts.

89
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,200
The front of my crotch is covered in red, and Griffin, without missing a beat, but also

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,800
not with any help whatsoever, looks at me and says, you know, I've got a Judy Blume

91
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
book you should read.

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,560
That's a pretty good bit.

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,760
That was a cool trap.

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,260
Let's do the thing where we do the advice, okay?

95
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,880
So if you haven't listened to our show before, we take your questions and turn them alchemy-like

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
into wisdom.

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Has anybody not listened to the show before?

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Cool.

99
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Welcome.

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Welcome.

101
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
I didn't do that during Sawbones.

102
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,680
That's always a good- Is there anybody who has listened to the show before?

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Anyone here from Minneapolis?

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,360
Anybody here from South Dakota?

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Yeah, what's up?

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Not as me.

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,240
I was just surprisingly- I knew that because you bought us cookies.

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Let's read a question.

109
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Okay.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Thank you.

111
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Now pump the brakes, South Dakota.

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:59,400
Trying to sound a little North Dakota- Holy shit.

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Let's just name more states, Ohio, Indiana- Okay, I get it.

114
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
I have a problem.

115
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm a fun-loving young man, but since I'm one of the more responsible people in my circle

116
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,760
of friends, I love to say the occasional lame pun, and I'm often labeled as the dad of the

117
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
group.

118
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,480
How can I ditch the dad persona and show my friends that I still know how to party?

119
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,280
And that's from Not Lame in Lakeville.

120
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Are you here?

121
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah.

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Great.

123
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Hold on.

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm getting some dad- Let me see.

125
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm gonna do my dad's thinking- Okay.

126
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,480
You appear to be a very young man.

127
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,840
You look like one of Mumford's sons, not Mumford himself.

128
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,280
I don't wanna see them anymore.

129
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Yeah.

130
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Choice.

131
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,040
That was a perfect shameful fade.

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Can you give us...

133
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Can you just sort...

134
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,840
I know I'm putting you on the spot right now, and I apologize, and if you don't wanna do

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,280
anything, just remain quiet, and it'll be wicked uncomfortable, but can you bust us

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,880
out an example, a slice of your oeuvre?

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,680
Your lame puns is what he means.

138
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,600
Wait, hold on.

139
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
Just come on up.

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Come on to the microphone.

142
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
There's a microphone right here.

143
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
Now, come on.

144
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
First...

145
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
No, he's too...

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Come on.

147
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Come on up.

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Come on.

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Ride the snake.

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Here we go.

151
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
There's a microphone there.

152
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
You are in the perfect exact middle of the aisle, too.

154
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
Right in the middle.

155
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Good crowd control.

156
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Anyone here from Minneapolis?

157
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Oh, man.

158
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm gonna ask that in Chicago, too.

159
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Okay.

160
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
So, here he comes to the stage.

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,960
What's your name, pal?

162
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Oh, no.

163
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
There we go.

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Okay.

165
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
It's hot.

166
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
It's hot.

167
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Say it again.

168
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Travis.

169
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
Yeah.

170
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Nice.

171
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Nice.

172
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
The middle-est, brother.

173
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Pretty great.

174
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I gave you a little...

175
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I like that.

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
I gave you a little bit of stalling time.

177
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
What you got?

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,840
What you got?

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,640
We have a hypothetical restaurant full of menu items with punny names.

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Uh-huh.

181
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Yeah.

182
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Fleetwood Mac and Cheese.

183
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Yeah.

184
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Solid.

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
That's...

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,360
I mean, it's not on point, but that's what makes it, like, great.

187
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,560
It's what makes it really good.

188
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,080
Notorious BLT.

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
That's super good.

190
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
Pretty good.

191
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
That's pretty good.

192
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
I'd tell that one.

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
That's good.

194
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Do you got one more?

195
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
That's Comedy Rule of Three's.

196
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Ashley, any help here?

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Come on, Ashley.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Ashley.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ashley.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, Ashley's not here.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ashley's not here at all.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ashley.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He needs you.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's gasping.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Ashley wants no part of this, Dad.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Help.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think...

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, you know what?

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, that's good.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Comedy Rule of Two's.

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

212
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
It's a new thing I'm working on where I just say two things, and I...

214
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Listen, we're millennials.

215
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,640
We can't wait for a third thing.

216
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Yeah.

217
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Just come up...

218
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,240
After the show, we'll do a private pun session, and you can...

219
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,600
Where are you gonna get puns from, Griffin?

220
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Okay.

221
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Okay.

222
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Thank you very, very much.

223
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I feel bad for you.

224
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Everybody, Travis.

225
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Go sit down, Travis.

226
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Okay.

227
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
We were backstage.

228
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,360
We'll jump back to talking about your thing, Travis.

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,240
I swear to God, this was not planned.

230
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
We didn't pick this question because we found this wonderful artifact.

231
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
No, this is the great spirit.

232
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,560
There's a word of the day calendar backstage that I think somebody here at the theater

233
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,640
may be made because there's a picture of a person pointing at you, and it's full of amazing

234
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
puns.

235
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Like...

236
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Guys, no kidding.

237
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
These are so good.

238
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
These are best in class.

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,080
Whoever said it's a word of the day calendar, it's a pun of the day calendar.

240
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Yeah.

241
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,960
Where do you learn to make ice cream?

242
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Sunday school.

243
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,800
Which US president was least guilty?

244
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,960
Lincoln.

245
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:54,320
He was in assent.

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,000
We thought this would be funnier.

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
In our defense, we didn't think this would be funnier.

248
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
This one's the best.

249
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,440
This one's the best, in my opinion.

250
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh, why?

251
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,880
Because I can cut a piece of wood just by looking at it.

252
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
It's true.

253
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,520
I saw it with my own eyes.

254
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,960
That shit's awesome.

255
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,920
I think lean into it, right, because now you can wear calculator watches, and that's a

256
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
cool look.

257
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,640
Travis, can I tell you something?

258
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,560
It's totally awesome to be the lamest person at the party.

259
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
It's so great.

260
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,040
It's like a ripcord when you're at parties that you don't want to be at anymore, like

261
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,160
lame.

262
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,040
No one has ever looked at the lamest person at the party leaving early and said, oh, no,

263
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,560
come on.

264
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,440
No one wants the cool dude to leave.

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,880
They're like, you got to stay, but when the dad of the party leaves, it's like, great.

266
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,560
Now we can get to some shit.

267
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:58,220
Listen, Travis, it's exhausting being a trendsetter.

268
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,760
Don't be like me.

269
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,960
I got to stay up with the latest looks.

270
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,280
I got to listen to the latest music.

271
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,520
You fucking ruined your jeans today, and in lieu of them, you wore black basketball shorts

272
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:19,280
with a nice sweater and your nice shoes with almost knee-high white socks on.

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,800
A fanny pack spontaneously sprung from you.

274
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,280
You were wearing a very bright salmon-colored Doctor Who shirt.

275
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,400
I remember every goddamn detail of your ensemble today.

276
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,160
Here's the worst part about that is that last night, Travis and I went down to the lobby

277
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,240
trying to secure some Johnson & Johnson's baby wash, dad of the year, and again, forgot

278
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,560
to pack it, but I guess dad of the year, et cetera, et cetera.

279
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,360
And they told us there was a gas station nearby, so I walked to a gas station that was not

280
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
nearby.

281
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,320
It was over an overpass about a quarter mile away wearing a salmon-colored Doctor Who Dalek

282
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
t-shirt.

283
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,000
Just took that one on a two-day ride, huh?

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Navy blue huge basketball shorts and brown, like, dress shoes.

285
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,040
These bad boys that I'm wearing right now with shorts and white socks, and on the way,

286
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,120
two Chinese ladies laughed at me.

287
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,640
But this morning, Trendsetter saw those two same Chinese ladies wearing pink Doctor Who

288
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,240
shirts, so I don't know, what's your game, ladies?

289
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

290
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Yes, please.

291
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,040
Listen, it's not a public question.

292
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
It's just the two of us.

293
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
It's for us.

294
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,800
This one was sent in by Ashley Shannon.

295
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Thank you, Ashley.

296
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ariana Rose, who asks, is it possible to have a Disney character

297
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,160
with you all day on your birthday at Disneyland?

298
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,940
I'm going to Disneyland for my birthday for free, and I just wanted to know if it's possible

299
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,560
to have a Disney character with you all day.

300
00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:00,120
Like, going on the rides with you and having food with you all day.

301
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,760
Can we all agree that there's such an age question to this question, where it's like

302
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,200
a weird bell curve, where if you're like six, that's totally fine to ask this question.

303
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,400
And if you're like 26 right now in our modern day and age, it's like, yeah, I get why you

304
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,040
asked that question.

305
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
I get it.

306
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,140
Basically, you're paying for companionship.

307
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,000
We can all agree that the number one best pick would be Gaston, because I bet that two

308
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
can't party.

309
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Right, but-

310
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That'd be annoying.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,360
No one drinks like Gaston.

312
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Sure.

313
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,800
No one spits like Gaston.

314
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,160
In a wrestling match, nobody bites like Gaston.

315
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,720
He's especially good at expectorating.

316
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Everybody.

317
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Oh, what a guy.

318
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Gaston.

319
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,520
It's like a quarter million dollars that we have to pay to have that on the show.

320
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Thank you.

321
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm saying you won't get Gaston.

322
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
You're not going to get Gaston.

323
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
You had to show-

324
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
We don't get a Gaston.

325
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,280
You had to show up at 6 a.m. if you want a Gaston.

326
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,040
For all day, you can get fucking flotsam from the Little Mermaid.

327
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,400
You can have a shriveled up Moray eel, like, what's up, happy birthday.

328
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,240
You get the really racist guy from Pocahontas.

329
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,440
I just hope there are no savages.

330
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,160
Happy birthday, I guess.

331
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,640
Do you want to go to Mexico at Epcot?

332
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,440
You mean with the Aztecs?

333
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,040
No, I do not.

334
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,240
I will stay here at the World of Tomorrow.

335
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Was that guy Foghorn Langhorne?

336
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,880
He was like, Foghorn Langhorne meets Tim Curry.

337
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:45,240
It was actually a perfect uggie boogie and you just didn't nail the landing.

338
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
I wish Tim Curry would go to the Disney World.

339
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,000
Justin, I know the best place for a nice cheese pizza.

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,200
It's in Italy, in Epcot, unsurprisingly.

341
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,840
We'll go on Spaceship Earth.

342
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,120
Let's go hang with my homie, the dream master.

343
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,960
Him and his little buggy figment.

344
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,120
God, it's an impeccable Tim Curry.

345
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Why is that?

346
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,840
It's a family impression.

347
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
We all can feel it.

348
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,600
You do an amazing impression of what you think Tim Curry sounds like.

349
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,800
Our dad can't do a sick Tim Curry.

350
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,840
The only thing I can think is that our dear departed mother must be a bitchin' Tim Curry

351
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
that we never heard.

352
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
It's in our genes.

353
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
It's a recessive gene.

354
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
It's a recessive gene.

355
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,880
I've isolated it.

356
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,680
The Tim Curry impression gene, duplicate it.

357
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,320
Here's a secret to doing a Tim Curry, I'll give it to you guys right now.

358
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
The secret is-

359
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,440
Don't give away our family secrets.

360
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,440
The secret is to just do it and then go, awesome.

361
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Nailed it.

362
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Perfect.

363
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm gonna say, that was Tim Curry when you finished.

364
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
You guys got that, right?

365
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
It's so key you identified it.

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,280
You just have to say cheese pizza.

367
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Cheese pizza.

368
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,680
Will you please read another question?

369
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,880
Thank you for being so kind about our Tim Curry impression.

370
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,560
We live in a Truman show like Bubble in which our Tim Curry impressions are fantastic.

371
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,400
If one of you yelled, you're terrible, this stage would collapse.

372
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,640
Every time my coworker says cool beans, a part of my soul dies.

373
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,000
What should I do?

374
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I like that.

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
In and out.

376
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm a justice of the peace.

377
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,840
Who sent this question in?

378
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,080
Okay.

379
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
Can you give us an idea of the frequency?

380
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Always.

381
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Always.

382
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
Every where.

383
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Cool beans, cool beans, cool beans.

384
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,920
That must be a horrible existence they live in.

385
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,800
Cool beans to you, sister.

386
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,520
I assume he's the pope.

387
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah.

388
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Or a cult leader.

389
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,280
Is this a business, is this like a serious business place that you work at that-

390
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,080
It's a bank and she says it in a baby voice.

391
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,880
If you're at home listening, she just said, it's a bank and she says it in a baby voice.

392
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Cool beans.

393
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Cool beans.

394
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,320
That's about as good as, you should get Charlie out here and see what she can do.

395
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, she loves being up in front of people in front of hot lights.

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,920
Could you counteract it by using hot beans to describe a negative scenario?

397
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,800
Travis, can you give an example of how hot beans would be used negatively?

398
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh yeah, Steve's funeral was this weekend, right?

399
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I wasn't able to make it.

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How was it?

401
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
It was pretty hot beans.

402
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
It was pretty hot beans.

403
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:48,960
His widow couldn't stop crying and I was just like, oh man, hot beans.

404
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,160
I thought it was going to be like a really cool beans way to say goodbye to our friend.

405
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,440
At least lukewarm beans, at least.

406
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Those beans were hot.

407
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,400
Did you guys see the new Lars von Trier film this weekend?

408
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
It was, I mean, I'm not going to admit it, it was hot beans.

409
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
It was hot beans.

410
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's bracing.

411
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,040
It was like he just got up and dumped hot beans everywhere.

412
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,480
What if every time she said cool beans, you adopted a fanciful hobo voice?

413
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Like cool beans?

414
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Why would anybody want cool beans?

415
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
You need to start a nice trash fire.

416
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Get some hot beans.

417
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:28,080
Make you up a, whip you up a sterno oven and get those beans a going.

418
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,800
You can put your beans on a cheese pizza.

419
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
No way.

420
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
No way.

421
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Hold on.

422
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Hold on.

423
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Hold on.

424
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Every, okay, so we've done 13.

425
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,440
This is our 13th live show, which explains why it's so terrible.

426
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
I think everyone has had-

427
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Is that what?

428
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
How many?

429
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
This is our 13th.

430
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Whoa.

431
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Yeah.

432
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,760
And every one, you guys do your fucking Tim Curry impression and it's, if you chart it,

433
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,960
it's like a black hole in the center of the show that the rest of it just gets sucked

434
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
back down in.

435
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,040
No, I think we all know what the black hole in the center of our live shows are.

436
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Speaking of.

437
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Oh no.

438
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
No.

439
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
No.

440
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
No.

441
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
No.

442
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
No.

443
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
No.

444
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
No.

445
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,360
Earlier, we were talking about doing some Minneapolis research and learning a little

446
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,960
bit about your lovely, lovely city.

447
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Stop.

448
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
And so-

449
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Stop.

450
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,000
I wrote a little report about Minneapolis.

451
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,080
Let's get meta right now because Justin, you birthed this.

452
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,160
No, I tried to stop it.

453
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,440
I tweeted last night, 23 hours ago, exactly.

454
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,640
If this tweet gets 100 faves, I'll let Travis McElroy do a Sad Lives in Minneapolis tomorrow

455
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
night.

456
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,440
Please, all caps, do not fave this tweet.

457
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,920
That's a honeypot.

458
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,320
That's a fucking bait tweet.

459
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,680
10 minutes later, 150 faves on the tweet.

460
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,440
People who aren't going to be here at the fucking epicenter.

461
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
They catfished you, people.

462
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm sorry.

463
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
There's 150 people that click.

464
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Fuck you, Minneapolis.

465
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
For real, though.

466
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,520
Long story short, I said, well, I'm jacking it up to 500.

467
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,080
That way, we definitely won't have to see Sad Lives as of this exact moment.

468
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
That tweet has 718 faves.

469
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
You're all scum.

470
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,160
Raise your hand if you've faved that tweet.

471
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
It's on you.

472
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm out.

473
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Thank you.

474
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,400
I would like to read to you now.

475
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Can we leave?

476
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Are we allowed to-

477
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,280
The brief report I have written about Minneapolis.

478
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Ahem.

479
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,680
Minneapolis, officially, the city of Minneapolis.

480
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,440
This is a fucking Wikipedia page.

481
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,400
You fucking chopped and screwed the Wikipedia page.

482
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,680
I'll start again.

483
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,880
You get paid to do this show.

484
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,640
Minneapolis, officially, the city of Minneapolis is the succulent seat of Hennepin County.

485
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,520
And larger of the twin wangs.

486
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,800
That's not how it originally reads.

487
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Do you guys get it?

488
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,280
The 14th largest metropolitan grundle in the United States.

489
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,560
Containing approximately 3.8 million fannies.

490
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,120
As of 2013, Minneapolis is the largest Jabberwocky in the state of Minnesota.

491
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,920
And the 46th largest in the United States with 400,070 titty sprinkles.

492
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,280
Minneapolis and Mountain Doom anchor the second largest Fauntleroy Center in the American

493
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,200
Midwest behind Chicago.

494
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,040
Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Luda River.

495
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,240
Just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River.

496
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,000
And adjoins Funkadocious, the state's capital.

497
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The city is abundantly rich in mangoes.

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,240
With 20 lakes and wienerschnitzel.

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,240
The Doug Funny River, creeks and aardvarks.

500
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Many connected by picadillos in the chain of lakes.

501
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,560
And the Grand McGuffin National Scenic Byway.

502
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:59,040
It was once the world's anime capital.

503
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,160
And a hub for Blastoise.

504
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,060
And today is the primary onomatopoeia center between Chicago and John Cena.

505
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:19,040
With Minneapolis proper containing America's fifth highest concentration of fish titties.

506
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:27,040
As an integral link to the global economy, Minneapolis is categorized as crumbelievable.

507
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,880
Thank you.

508
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
I think Justin's just gone.

509
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Oh, there he is.

510
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,040
We could just do like 30 of those and that could be the whole show.

511
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Do you guys want that?

512
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I have 29 more.

513
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,560
What's that podcast nobody listens to?

514
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,200
Oh, my brother and my brother, where they just do sad libs over and over again.

515
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I hate that show.

516
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Hey, everybody.

517
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,240
Sorry to break in, but we got to make money.

518
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,200
We did make money on the live episode that you're listening to already, but it's all

519
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,840
about diversifying your portfolio.

520
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,160
We owe a lot of people a lot of money and they won't take no for an answer.

521
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,600
Paint us a word picture, Justin, of why we sound so weird right now.

522
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,040
Because we're passing around a microphone and I'm in a robe and we're splitting a seat,

523
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,200
you and I, and I'm straddling the seat and you're sitting on the seat and that's not

524
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
a joke.

525
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Who's hungry?

526
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
I am.

527
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
For NatureBox.

528
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,520
NatureBox is a snack service with zero artificial flavors or colors or sweeteners, no trans

529
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,440
fats, no high fructose corn syrup.

530
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
It's nutritious.

531
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,880
It's food you feel good about putting in your body.

532
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,960
Important to note that we're in a hotel because we're about to go to a live show.

533
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,200
This isn't like a thing that we do.

534
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,800
It's just like have buddy-buddy hotel nights every now and then.

535
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Yeah.

536
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Go to NatureBox.

537
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,800
You can get some stuff like sriracha roasted cashews, white truffle popcorn, peanut butter

538
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
nom-noms.

539
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Yes, please.

540
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Or personalize your favorites.

541
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,200
I think that's a note for us.

542
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,760
That's probably for us to do, but those actually are my favorites.

543
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,640
My favorites are the lemon almond tea biscuits.

544
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
They are delicious and buttery.

545
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,000
I like the sea biscuit.

546
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,720
Oh wait, I wasn't thinking my favorite snack box food, NatureBox snack box, I was thinking

547
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960
my favorite VHS tape of Blockbuster.

548
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,640
If you go to NatureBox.com slash my brother, you can get a free trial box of their favorite

549
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
snacks.

550
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,200
So like that's an awesome deal.

551
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,040
NatureBox.com slash my brother, you get a free box.

552
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Free snacks.

553
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,280
Certainly you're reading that wrong.

554
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,880
Free trial box of your favorite snacks.

555
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,320
So there will be a court involved and jury of your peers and then it's unanimous, yummy,

556
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,120
and that's how the movie The Judge ends with Robert Downey Jr.

557
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,320
It's not a very good flick.

558
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Also if you want to make a website about how good this advertising break has been and who

559
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,600
can blame you, it's been great.

560
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,640
I would suggest you run, don't walk.

561
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,160
Run and then slow down because you're holding a computer.

562
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,680
Walk the rest away, you're going to get exhausted.

563
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Guys is tonight's show going to be a fucking catastrophe?

564
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,360

Build it.

578
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Two, three.

579
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Build it.

580
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Build it.

581
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Build it.

582
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Beautiful.

583
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Beautiful.

584
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
Sorry, the syncing is off.

585
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Let me try it one more time.

586
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Read this next message.

587
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Who's this next message?

588
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,560
Who's this next message for?

589
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,440
Poppy and CJ McElroy?

590
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
Yeah, it's not what you think.

591
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,720
It's a completely different McElroy family.

592
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,400
There's more than one.

593
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,760
I'm not sure I feel about that.

594
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I knew there was a guy who played on the Colts that was a McElroy, a Greg McElroy, I think

595
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
he was-

596
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,440
It's all for Joe McElroy, Corey McElroy.

597
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,760
This is from Mama and Papa.

598
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,720
Happy first birthday, you cool babies.

599
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,200
Your first year has been an adventure and everywhere we go, people love you.

600
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,200
We've learned how to say twins in three other languages and we're ready to learn a couple

601
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
more.

602
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
We love you.

603
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,760
That's the most precious thing and are we related to them and am I everybody in this

604
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,040
question's dad?

605
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Justin, I'm getting texts and it's vibrating really close to your pizone.

606
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,700
Happy first birthday.

607
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,680
This is the most heartwarming message.

608
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,720
Confirm yes or no.

609
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Check yes or no.

610
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
Am I everyone's dad in this message?

611
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Thank you.

612
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Who is this next message for Griffin?

613
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,280
It's for Chris Legue.

614
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,120
I really crushed the pronunciation because they provide it.

615
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,760
And who is it from?

616
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Dan Aiyel.

617
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Shit.

618
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,460
Dan Aiyel writes, I'm just kidding, it's Danielle, I can't see it because Travis has fucked

619
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,740
up the browser.

620
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,000
Thank you, Travis.

621
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,440
Dan Aiyel says to Chris Legue, Chris, please put your clean clothes in your drawers, not

622
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,180
back into the hampers.

623
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,060
Thank you from your loving wife, Danielle.

624
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,420
And also Sydney, please do that as well.

625
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,360
And then it says here, you toast.

626
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,200
It doesn't say that, but that's like an extra burn that I added for Danielle to you, Chris

627
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Legue.

628
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Check yourself.

629
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,360
You toast.

630
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Now back to the show.

631
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,620
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

632
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,740
How about, oh man, there's so many good ones.

633
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,240
This one was sent in by Sarah Gorman.

634
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Thank you, Sarah.

635
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Yahoo answers user Skye who asks, can a ghost puke on you?

636
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,720
Weirdest thing happened to me.

637
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
One more time.

638
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,960
Can a ghost puke on you?

639
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,800
Weirdest thing happened to me, I woke up just now and realized that there was puke on me

640
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,520
and next to me.

641
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,280
Nobody in my house did it.

642
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,460
It wasn't my mom, my sister, my stepdad, or any of the animals.

643
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,320
It happened in the last three and a half hours because it wasn't warm.

644
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,240
It was my body temperature.

645
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,600
What the fuck CSI?

646
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Don't touch anything.

647
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,440
This is a crime scene.

648
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,400
This was extremely gross.

649
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,960
Can anyone please help me?

650
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
It was the stepdad.

651
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
It was the stepdad.

652
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,960
We can all agree it was the stepdad.

653
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Or the stepdad's birds.

654
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
The stepdad's train.

655
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Go.

656
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
What did you say?

657
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Somebody puke on you?

658
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
I don't know.

659
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Have you explored the occult?

660
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
I can feel a cold spot in your room.

661
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
I wasn't in there, but I heard.

662
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:56,240
Now, Darlene, I mean, to be fair, I did tell you to not play with the Ouija and you did.

663
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,040
Is that her stepdad, Barack Obama?

664
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,480
Travis, are you telling me that I do a perfect Barack Obama impression?

665
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,760
Because I can add that to the repertoire.

666
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,440
Now, what if Tim Curry and Barack Obama sat down?

667
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
I think it might sound a little bit like this.

668
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,800
Here's Johnny.

669
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,200
That's my Jack Nicholson.

670
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,240
We can't rule ghosts.

671
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,240
I mean, rule of thumb for just life.

672
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,720
We can't rule ghosts out.

673
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,880
No, but I guess my question is, why wouldn't you start with, did someone break into my

674
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,520
room from the outside, just completely straight up, puke on me, and say, my work here is done,

675
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
and leave?

676
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,040
I really had that coming.

677
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Wait.

678
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Let me check.

679
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
I'm going to see if this is...

680
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,640
Okay, so this is from October of 2010, not from April Fool's Day, because that'd be a

681
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,600
fucking great goof.

682
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Just walking like...

683
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Good morning.

684
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Did you see the puke?

685
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Yeah, that was me.

686
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
AFD.

687
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Get it?

688
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Did you get it?

689
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Did you get it?

690
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,520
It's a commentary on how politics made me sick.

691
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,000
Also, I hate you.

692
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,640
And I needed to yack, I don't know.

693
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,440
Those three things hit together.

694
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
She a night puker?

695
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
What?

696
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Did I say night?

697
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
I'm sorry.

698
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
Hold on.

699
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
I literally...

700
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,240
One more time?

701
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,560
Can you give it to me again?

702
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:30,680
You know that REM song, Night Puker?

703
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,960
What I'm saying is maybe she's a night puker.

704
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Night puker.

705
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Perfect.

706
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
That's Bay Sleeper.

707
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,720
That's a two-sympath song, which, by the way, Michael Cypher, come on.

708
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,360
Do we have another really super good question?

709
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,660
I think I might have one here.

710
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,040
My husband, Jesse, has been growing his beard out for a year now.

711
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,760
It's large, unruly, catches everything he eats, along with somebody on...

712
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,320
Somebody named Jesse in the audience right now is like, fuck.

713
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,920
It's large, unruly, catches everything he eats.

714
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I know which one it is.

715
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,600
Let me talk about Jesse first.

716
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,080
You don't have to point to him, I fucking see him.

717
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,840
Can I finish talking about Jesse for a second?

718
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
It's large...

719
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,080
It says here, he's also a really great guy with a kind soul.

720
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,320
It's large, unruly, catches everything he eats, along with the fact that he looks like

721
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,300
Harry from the 1990s show, Harry and the Hendersons.

722
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:34,080
His podcast network is going great, but Jesse Thorne joke for...

723
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,720
He's got a big beard now.

724
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,000
It's just nasty, et cetera, et cetera.

725
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,280
Here's the end of the question, which I do want to take a quick break.

726
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,800
The 1990s show, Harry and the Hendersons?

727
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,000
What we're talking about is the TV show, not the fucking great movie with John Lethgow.

728
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,480
The movie I cry hardest at in the entire world, other than Iron Giant.

729
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Not the film.

730
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,980
Which has a lot of similarities, if you think about it.

731
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,440
Not the TV show, which is basically Alf, anyway.

732
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Tall Alf is what...

733
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,360
The original TV show was Super Tall Alf.

734
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,520
This Sunday on Fox, Tall Alf, followed by Big Wonders.

735
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
I don't know.

736
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,960
We're throwing some spaghetti at the wall.

737
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
I don't know.

738
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Listen.

739
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
Empty house.

740
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
I don't know.

741
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Fuck it.

742
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
Whatever.

743
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Reverse it.

744
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
There's an end to the question.

745
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,160
My question to you, I'm intimidated because there's nothing we're going to say that's

746
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,000
funnier than the end of this question.

747
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,800
What is the best way to auction off my husband's beard?

748
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
As from Kim.

749
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Quick question.

750
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
What?

751
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
You...

752
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Okay.

753
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:50,640
So, auctioning off a beard, that's complicated because you might get a guy come up to you

754
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,080
at the end of the auction when you get the clippers out, Jesse, and you're ready to shave

755
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
it off.

756
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
He's like, no.

757
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Leave it on.

758
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
I own that beard.

759
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Check the small print.

760
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Check the small print.

761
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,200
I own that beard exactly where you bought it.

762
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,160
What if he comes in when you're trying to eat some soup or some gazpacho and he covers

763
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,060
your beard with laminates and nothing happens to it because he owns it.

764
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,560
I own that beard.

765
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,040
It's possible.

766
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Yeah.

767
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,400
Ghosts are puking on people.

768
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,760
Stranger things have happened.

769
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,920
I appreciate you jumping just straight into, we're going to auction the beard off.

770
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,000
Not how to convince him to shave it.

771
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No, no, no.

772
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And I like that because I think the three of us maybe could have gotten there on one

773
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,440
of our patented goof riffs that we like to go on, and you just saved us the trouble like

774
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
you guys were going to talk about auctioning the beard.

775
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Right now.

776
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
We're starting at $5.

777
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
$5.

778
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
I got $5 right there.

779
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
$5.

780
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
$10.

781
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
$10.

782
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
$10.

783
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
$20.

784
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
$20 right there.

785
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Do I have $50?

786
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
$50.

787
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Don't buy it unless you mean it because you know we're going to make you pay cash right

788
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
now.

789
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I got 50.

790
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
I got 50.

791
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Can I see 50?

792
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Wait, wait, wait.

793
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Do you really have 50?

794
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Who's 50?

795
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Who has $50?

796
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
$50 for a beard.

797
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Do I have $75 for a beard?

798
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
It's a great beard.

799
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
It's a great beard.

800
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
$75.

801
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
It's like Landland.

802
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Like Landland.

803
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
50 going once.

804
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
This feels illegal.

805
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
50 going twice.

806
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,440
This is not binding at all.

807
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Sold.

808
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Sold.

809
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
What are we doing?

810
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Give Jesse $50.

811
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
You guys can't just fucking do shit.

812
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Sell your beard to a man.

813
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Give him your beard.

814
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Sell your beard.

815
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Let him build a nest.

816
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
We don't have a fucking structure in place for removal.

817
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Paypal him the money.

818
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Paypal him the money.

819
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Paypal him the money.

820
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Paypal him the money.

821
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Paypal him the money.

822
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Paypal him the money.

823
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Paypal him the money.

824
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Paypal him the money.

825
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Paypal him the money.

826
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Paypal him the money.

827
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Paypal him the money.

828
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,040
After the show, you two settle up, which I mean shave your beard and give him $50.

829
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,720
Buy three and one-third posters and just give them to him.

830
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Granddad, explain this back.

831
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I like that.

832
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
I get a slice.

833
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
There we go.

834
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Perfect.

835
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
That... Okay.

836
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,040
We were just handed the smallest pair of baby scissors.

837
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,300
He sold them from Baby Charlie.

838
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,080
This is Justin's baby scissors that we're going to use to cut...

839
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,680
It'll take us 16 hours.

840
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,480
We'll finish this just as we arrive in Chicago.

841
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,600
We just sold a man's beard.

842
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,280
We are golden gods.

843
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,960
I'm going to check in with you every 60 seconds just to see how you feel at that point in

844
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,120
time about your money-making decisions in life.

845
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Wait, Hardy.

846
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,160
Why can't we afford to pay rent this month?

847
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
I don't know.

848
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
I bought a man's beard.

849
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,280
I got caught up in the magic.

850
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,000
I got some kindling for a soup-scented fire.

851
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,600
You remember how you said I should get a merkin?

852
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Good news.

853
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Good news.

854
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,280
I'm finally investing our money, not wasting it.

855
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm building a future for me and the kids and you.

856
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Should we get some folks up here?

857
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,420
No, not yet.

858
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,640
Let me ask this one... Oh, I just called.

859
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Is that a touch screen?

860
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
What'd you just do?

861
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
I just archived it.

862
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Hold on.

863
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Oh, shit.

864
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Shut up.

865
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Hold on.

866
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
Wait.

867
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Wait.

868
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,720
Here it comes.

869
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,620
How do we get my wife's family to stop giving us shit we don't need or even have any use

870
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,620
for?

871
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,640
We live in a small apartment with a tiny yet perfectly functional kitchen, and they've

872
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,040
given us things like electric griddles, dessert, coops.

873
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
What's that?

874
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Coupes.

875
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Coupes.

876
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
All right.

877
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,280
It's a fucking... It's a tiny... You went to culinary school.

878
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,320
It's a fucking rad drop-top car that you drive cakes around in.

879
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,560
And a giant plug-in roaster we've literally never used.

880
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,800
They've also dumped tons of crafty shit and clothes we don't need on us.

881
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
They're not rich.

882
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,640
They just like to express their love and affection through stuff.

883
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,800
Ah, fuck them.

884
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,240
As from too much stuff in the Twin Cities.

885
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Now, Justin, it actually says too much shit in the Twin Cities.

886
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,760
Did we hit our limit on cursing?

887
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Then you're like, oh, that's it.

888
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
We're done.

889
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,000
We hit our limit on cursing in 2012.

890
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,820
This was y'all who have the stuff problem.

891
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,860
Here's what you get to do.

892
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,680
This is awesome.

893
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,680
You get to be like adult to younger friend Santa Claus.

894
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,880
22-year-olds love crafty shit.

895
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,880
You're saying a 22-year-old's going to get a roaster and be like, yeah.

896
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,040
They won't even know what it does, but they won't have one already.

897
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,760
Just pour fiddle-faddle onto it while it's turning.

898
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
I don't...

899
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
Am this roasting?

900
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
You're right.

901
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
It's the flavor.

902
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Yeah.

903
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Absolutely.

904
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
This sucks.

905
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
I think...

906
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:48,960
Well, the obvious solution, of course, is to take all of it to Antiques Roadshow.

907
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
A lot of people do that.

908
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Wait, wait.

909
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
No, wait.

910
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Stop.

911
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Antiques Roadshow?

912
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Yeah.

913
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
They're not like, oh, crafty shit.

914
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,120
No, this is crafty shit from yesterday.

915
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,000
No, no, no.

916
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,920
I'm saying a lot of people do this, and it's like a Antiques Roadshow hack is...

917
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,560
I read about that on BuzzFeed.

918
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,160
Are you tired of enjoying Antiques Roadshow like all the plebs?

919
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,180
Well, now it's time to find the express lane.

920
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,280
If you plug your Antiques Roadshow into a watermelon, you'll never believe what happens.

921
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,440
Okay, tell me about your Antiques Roadshow hack.

922
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,280
You take all your garbage to Antiques Roadshow, and they'll give you a little lot, and you

923
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
stand there, and you put all your shit there.

924
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,680
And then they come back, and they're like, all right, Baker family, you're...

925
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Hey, where'd you go?

926
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Oh, no.

927
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
They left all their shit.

928
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Another one.

929
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,800
And then that is their problem, and they have to deal with it.

930
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
It's a pretty circuitous...

931
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,000
Mark Wahlberg, take care of this garbage.

932
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Are you...

933
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Okay.

934
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,480
And they're like, oh, my God, wait, this was President Roosevelt's roaster.

935
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,120
It's engraved, yummy, yum, it's chicken time, President Roosevelt.

936
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,480
It says it right there.

937
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,160
He used this to win the Spanish-American War.

938
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,320
Is that a thing that he did?

939
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
I like the idea...

940
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Shh.

941
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,880
There were two of them, so your odds are pretty good.

942
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,920
I like the idea that the Antiques Roadshow people will, even if it's not old, fake it.

943
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,960
Oh, this is old.

944
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Yeah.

945
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,840
This bedazzled tea, well, might surprise you to learn.

946
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,200
Betsy Ross was big into bedazzling.

947
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,600
The original American flag was hyper color.

948
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,320
Not a lot of people know that.

949
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,000
A lot of people don't know that.

950
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's get some people up here.

951
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Does that help?

952
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Okay.

953
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Right here.

954
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Now, here's the thing.

955
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Come on up.

956
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,320
There is one rule when it comes to the questions.

957
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
No bombers.

958
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Right.

959
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
They gotta be comedy.

960
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,560
If you are bombing, we will throw you off the stage.

961
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Come on up.

962
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,680
You got any more Diet Coke in that can?

963
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,000
I didn't bring any mixers.

964
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Just booze.

965
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Nope.

966
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
All right, ma'am.

967
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Hi.

968
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hello.

969
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Hi.

970
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Hey, how's it going?

971
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Good.

972
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Great.

973
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What's your name?

974
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Really good.

975
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We're in Minneapolis.

976
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So am I.

977
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,280
Anyone here else from Minneapolis?

978
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Just a quick question.

979
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Anybody actually projecting tonight?

980
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
I'm not from here.

981
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
She's just in Minneapolis.

982
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Okay.

983
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

984
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
What's your name?

985
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Katie.

986
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
I'm Katie.

987
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Hi.

988
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Hi, Katie.

989
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Hi, Katie.

990
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
To be fair, I'm not from Minneapolis.

991
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
No.

992
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Easy, Katie.

993
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Nice.

994
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Listen, I'm not gonna...

995
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
It's the biggest of the twin wags.

996
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
This is a short mic.

997
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Okay, what's the question, Katie?

998
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
I'm gonna crouch.

999
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
How can I help?

1000
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
How can I help?

1001
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Yeah, this will help.

1002
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
How can you help me?

1003
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,280
One of my part-time jobs is really super related to pizza.

1004
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,400
Okay.

1005
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,720
Is that possibly at a pizza place?

1006
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
No, it's not.

1007
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,760
It's really adjacent.

1008
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
It's really...

1009
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,000
Do you describe what pizza looks like to blind people?

1010
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's...

1011
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,080
I got that out.

1012
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,880
I eat it for them and then describe it.

1013
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Well, they can taste the fucking pizza.

1014
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Hold on.

1015
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Stop eating better than sighted people.

1016
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
That's how that works.

1017
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
I know.

1018
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Stop eating blind people's pizza.

1019
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
I know.

1020
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
I have not a job, Katie.

1021
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,880
You're just a dick.

1022
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I don't even...

1023
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
How's the pizza, Katie?

1024
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Money, please.

1025
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
I don't even have a question.

1026
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,880
I just wanted to point out what an asshole I am.

1027
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Okay.

1028
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
Take care, Katie.

1029
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
It's a nice cheese pizza.

1030
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
I don't need to stand up like a human.

1031
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
What's your pizza job?

1032
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,400
Hey, so one of my part-time jobs is very pizza related, as I said, and as a consequence of

1033
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,480
that, at least two to three times a day, I get people posting on my Facebook wall pizza

1034
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,720
related things like, hey, look at this pizza decorated car.

1035
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,160
Look at this three-tiered pizza wedding cake.

1036
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,440
And almost every time, they're like, it's right up your alley, this pizza thing.

1037
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,760
It's really hard to relate to this because we three brothers don't have anything that

1038
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,720
we've publicly said we liked, or a Facebook group where people might post things about

1039
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
that constantly.

1040
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Hey, I found some horses to try this.

1041
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,080
To be fair, you did create the group.

1042
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
You kind of asked for it.

1043
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
That's true.

1044
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,680
All the ghosts and horses are your fault.

1045
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,280
I would love a horse dumpster that I just am the admin of.

1046
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,760
I would like a well that people-

1047
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
HorseDumpster.com.

1048
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
HorseDumpster.horse.

1049
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,000
I would love a well in my backyard that people just threw horses down all day.

1050
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
All right.

1051
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,400
So the problem is just people think you're the pizza person now, and you've left.

1052
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Yeah, so it's this.

1053
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Okay.

1054
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
It's very job.

1055
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
I don't really know why.

1056
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,440
So there are people even that I haven't spoken to for 15 years that just by virtue of knowing

1057
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,680
me on Facebook will post these pizza related things.

1058
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,040
And I don't expect really to be able to get it to stop.

1059
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
That's not going to happen.

1060
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,000
But I'm out of responses.

1061
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,040
Like I'm at the point now where I'm like, yeah.

1062
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
Zombie.

1063
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
Like.

1064
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,200
I'm not just like, hi, cool.

1065
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
That's like my response.

1066
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
It starts to feel disingenuous.

1067
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah.

1068
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
For sure.

1069
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
Okay.

1070
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I see your point.

1071
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
Katie.

1072
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
Yes.

1073
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I have two suggestions.

1074
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,960
One, just Google commonly said words by the Ninja Turtles.

1075
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,000
And every time somebody posts anything, just like, cowabunga.

1076
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,960
I was going to say, I'm copy pasting cowabunga from here on out.

1077
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,520
Just do that every time.

1078
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,320
Secondly, I can tell you how to make it stop.

1079
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,960
In your question, you stated that it's a lot of it is people who you haven't spoken to

1080
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,600
in 15 years.

1081
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,200
And the thing is, and this is real advice, you guys.

1082
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Stop chuckling.

1083
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Oh, man.

1084
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
You know what I'm going to say.

1085
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
You need to kill them.

1086
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
No.

1087
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,920
No, but what it is, is it's people who want to catch up to you, want to relate to you,

1088
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,640
but they only know the one fact about you.

1089
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,000
And that's the worst part of it.

1090
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,120
I'm a very multidimensional person.

1091
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
I like a lot of things.

1092
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Right.

1093
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
So what Travis is saying is you got to.

1094
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
I like Batman.

1095
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,120
You got to start sharing.

1096
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,120
Other things.

1097
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,760
You got to start posting more on your Facebook.

1098
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,800
Like really excited for this new Batman thing.

1099
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Go hard.

1100
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,440
You got to be like, can't wait for that new Batman movie.

1101
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,120
Also fuck pizza.

1102
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,280
I'm done with that pizza week shit.

1103
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,160
Also, I'm really glad I get that money for my pizza job.

1104
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
But it ain't what I'm about.

1105
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Did y'all see Interstellar?

1106
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
It was crazy.

1107
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,640
I'm really into space now.

1108
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,640
Not pizza so much.

1109
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,200
My favorite thing about Interstellar was how little pizza there was in it.

1110
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,160
There was like zero pizza.

1111
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,560
Matt Damon woke up and said, oh, my God, another person.

1112
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,200
Did you bring pizza?

1113
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
That would have been a way better scene.

1114
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
That would have been super good.

1115
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,200
Thank you so much, Katie.

1116
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Thank you, Katie.

1117
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Katie!

1118
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
Let's get somebody from this side.

1119
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Yes, you.

1120
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,200
First hand, I saw go up.

1121
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1122
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1123
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Do I have time to get more ginger ale?

1124
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,120
Because I'm going to get top 10 drunk if I don't slow it down.

1125
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,240
I'm asking you.

1126
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
You're my brother.

1127
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
Oh.

1128
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
Do you want us to go get you ginger ale?

1129
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,240
No.

1130
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
Do I have time to go get ginger ale?

1131
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
We're in the middle of the show.

1132
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Wait a minute.

1133
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,920
Do you have time before he gets up here?

1134
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Is this the show?

1135
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,640
I thought we were just getting them hot.

1136
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Getting them ready.

1137
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,440
Getting you warmed up for the third podcast of the evening.

1138
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,440
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Night Vale.

1139
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Yeah!

1140
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:54,600
Look at that fucking crushing it.

1141
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,960
Just for those of you listening at home, ginger ale happened.

1142
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
Hi, what's your name?

1143
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Hi.

1144
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,520
My name is Mark with a C from the Twin Cities.

1145
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,080
Oh, good, because I was going to say Mark really hard.

1146
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,480
Mark, is your question a bummer?

1147
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
No, it's not.

1148
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Okay, great.

1149
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
No, no, no.

1150
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
God!

1151
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Unless.

1152
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,480
Unless.

1153
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
Unless you don't make it a bummer.

1154
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Well, don't put the onus on us, Mark.

1155
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,480
It's up to you guys.

1156
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,560
If your question leads us to a bummer, you're equally at fault.

1157
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,960
I thought it was my brother, my brother, and me, not my brother, my brother, and a

1158
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,840
guy named Mark, because then...

1159
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,640
It's also not called throwing shade, Mark.

1160
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,360
Mark, what is your question?

1161
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:44,040
Yeah, so I have this thing where I never text my friends back in a promptly manner.

1162
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,040
Cool.

1163
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
It's not...

1164
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
Someone just yelled the worst.

1165
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
Katie, your time's done.

1166
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:54,880
There's a real Greek choir thing happening in this audience right now.

1167
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,080
It's a Minnesota thing.

1168
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,080
Minnesota people speak out.

1169
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,080
Yeah.

1170
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
I like that about you all.

1171
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Don't ever change.

1172
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,800
So I don't text people back in a timely manner, and it's gotten really bad to the point where

1173
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,100
one of my friends started an Excel spreadsheet where they calculate how long it takes me

1174
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
to respond back.

1175
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Cool.

1176
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Great.

1177
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,100
Like over there.

1178
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Okay.

1179
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
Go ahead.

1180
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,080
And a lot of it, it's not like I don't want to respond.

1181
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,080
It's more like...

1182
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,600
It's usually questions like, can you hang out tonight?

1183
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Can you hang out this weekend?

1184
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,480
A lot of it's like, I don't know yet, because I have a job that's very random and dynamic

1185
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,560
and I work weird hours.

1186
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,800
So I just don't text anything back.

1187
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,200
And it's starting to feel like I'm the asshole in this situation, which is...

1188
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,200
It's starting.

1189
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,880
I am fixing to fix my hands.

1190
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Which is true and valid.

1191
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,880
But it's more like, I don't know.

1192
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Is there a thing I should say?

1193
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
Thanks, sound dude.

1194
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
Okay.

1195
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,880
Mark.

1196
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,880
Is there a thing I should text?

1197
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,920
Is there a thing I should do?

1198
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,400
Do you just sometimes not respond?

1199
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,080
I just don't respond.

1200
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,080
Okay.

1201
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
Yeah.

1202
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,080
Hmm.

1203
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,880
This is my favorite type of question, Mark.

1204
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,880
Because the answer is...

1205
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,880
It's a short answer.

1206
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,880
The answer is, start texting them back.

1207
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,880
Yeah.

1208
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,880
Thank you.

1209
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,120
No, no, but my point is like, I don't know what to say, right?

1210
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,680
Because I don't know my schedule.

1211
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,920
All they're looking for is recognition that you've received.

1212
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,280
So all you gotta say is like, I'll let you know.

1213
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,180
How about just a cordial gotcha?

1214
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,040
Just like, yup.

1215
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,160
You don't have to...

1216
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,440
Or just send back animoticon.

1217
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,480
Just a smiley face every time, so like, I don't know what that means, but clearly he

1218
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
got it.

1219
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,040
He said, dog, dog, pizza, pizza, and then the poop one.

1220
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,720
So I think that might be a yes.

1221
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,720
I think he might be right.

1222
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,720
Yeah.

1223
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,720
Just text them back.

1224
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Has anyone checked on Mark lately?

1225
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,720
He's lost his mind.

1226
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
He's very into...

1227
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,720
For now, Mark, if you don't...

1228
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,720
Sometimes you don't know what to say.

1229
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,000
Just text him a link in bmbam.com.

1230
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
What?

1231
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
TeenGoogle.com.

1232
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
TeenGoogle.com.

1233
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,560
TeenGoogle.com for all your teen...

1234
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,560
No, just tell them...

1235
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,800
GriffinSpaceJam.com.

1236
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
I feel you.

1237
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
I feel you.

1238
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
I really do feel you.

1239
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
I feel you.

1240
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,920
I really do.

1241
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,600
But you got to tell them about your absence of information that you have that you can't

1242
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,880
plan shit yet.

1243
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
I want to do that.

1244
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Let me see if I can make it work.

1245
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,760
Mark, next time you get a text and you don't respond, I want you to imagine staring the

1246
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,280
person dead eyes.

1247
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,280
Just staring them dead...

1248
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,880
Staring their persona in the eye.

1249
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,840
Just staring them dead in the eyes and not saying anything.

1250
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,440
Just imagine that's your text response to them just...

1251
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
You have to say...

1252
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,760
If you were in your real life, in RL, you would say, a something.

1253
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,280
You take that and you just type it, and then you're good.

1254
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,280
We fixed your life, Mark.

1255
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
Thank you.

1256
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,280
You actually really helped.

1257
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,280
That genuinely helped.

1258
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,280
Travis, do you want to pick one?

1259
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,280
You haven't picked one yet.

1260
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
Oh, okay.

1261
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
Let's see.

1262
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,280
Who else has picked one?

1263
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,040
Oh, okay, let's see, who else has one?

1264
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,000
She's reaching really hard and she's far in the back.

1265
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah, come on up.

1266
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Come on up.

1267
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
There's a center aisle.

1268
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
If you can get to it.

1269
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,160
Oh, Sunday school.

1270
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:08,200
I just got it.

1271
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Cause ice cream.

1272
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,560
Yeah.

1273
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Sunday school.

1274
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,780
That was like bad joke inception.

1275
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,920
The best punch line for that is, French class.

1276
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
It's classic.

1277
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Honey, I shrunk the kids.

1278
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Any honey?

1279
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,920
I shrunk the kids.

1280
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
Holy shit.

1281
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,920
You...

1282
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Get up here faster, please.

1283
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
Jesus, I'm dead.

1284
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Well, in three days.

1285
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
All right.

1286
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
I'm so sorry.

1287
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Oh, wait a minute.

1288
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
We forgot to make the joke.

1289
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,920
Travis just made a really...

1290
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,920
Hold on.

1291
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:41,760
Travis just made the worst Good Friday goof in the goddamn history of speech.

1292
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,000
We were going to make a great goof about how this is our Good Friday.

1293
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
No way.

1294
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We were going to make a great Friday.

1295
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
No, but that's gone now.

1296
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Now that's gone.

1297
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Hi, what's your name?

1298
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
My name is Lauren.

1299
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Hi, Lauren.

1300
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Hello, Lauren.

1301
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Hi.

1302
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,280
So I have a couple of roommates in the house that me and my fiance live in.

1303
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Okay.

1304
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
And one of them cooks quite a bit.

1305
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,280
Is your fiance here?

1306
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Yeah.

1307
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
He's right there.

1308
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Long hair.

1309
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,280
Hey, how's it going?

1310
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,280
Hello.

1311
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,280
Okay.

1312
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
Sorry.

1313
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
Go ahead.

1314
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
And basically she cooks a lot.

1315
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,280
Makes a lot of dishes.

1316
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
We're cool with that.

1317
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,280
We can sometimes eat it.

1318
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Or we do...

1319
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
We sometimes eat it.

1320
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,520
She leaves the stuff out on the countertop, usually overnight, and open in the fridge

1321
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,520
for days.

1322
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,520
No!

1323
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,520
How?

1324
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
Is she an animal?

1325
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,520
Like gonzo?

1326
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Is she a beast?

1327
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
Did you allow a wolverine into your home?

1328
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Maybe.

1329
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

1330
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,520
Right?

1331
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,520
And I read the newspaper.

1332
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,520
So braggy.

1333
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
Also, it's highlights.

1334
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,520
But go ahead.

1335
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:48,880
What do we do?

1336
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,880
Okay.

1337
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Yell at her.

1338
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,880
Yell at her really, really...

1339
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,880
Like this.

1340
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,880
What are you doing?

1341
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,880
That volume is the...

1342
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,880
If you do it any less, she's not gonna get the...

1343
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,880
What are you doing?

1344
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
You're ruining everything.

1345
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,880
This isn't what George Washington in The Founding Fathers did.

1346
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:13,240
What if she's watching TV, she's enjoying some Dance Moms, and you just walk over with

1347
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,200
an open container of rigatoni and just dump it on her lap?

1348
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,080
Peel the fucking skin off everything and then weave it into a fucking jacket and give it

1349
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,800
to her for Christmas with a note card that says, fuck you, on it.

1350
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,360
You're the worst.

1351
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
I have one...

1352
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,440
I have a clarification question.

1353
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,400
When she cooks this stuff, is she cooking it under the auspices of like, I am cooking

1354
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,480
for you, I'm cooking for the house, or is she cooking and she makes too much so everybody

1355
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,480
gets to eat the leftovers?

1356
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,480
Great question, Trav.

1357
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Thanks.

1358
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,080
So her name is Hannah.

1359
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
She's super sweet.

1360
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
She just...

1361
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,080
Fuck you, Hannah.

1362
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,080
Go ahead.

1363
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Come on.

1364
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,080
She's not here.

1365
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
Hey, will you play that for her?

1366
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Is she listening?

1367
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Is she listening?

1368
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
No.

1369
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Play that for her.

1370
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,080
Okay.

1371
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
I will.

1372
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,080
I think we might have libeled her, but go ahead.

1373
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,280
I want this human to know where she's at with me.

1374
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,640
So she loves to cook, and anybody who loves to cook just cooks for an army.

1375
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:18,080
What you're describing is she likes to start to cook and then not complete what I would

1376
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,320
call the most important step, finishing.

1377
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,320
Yeah.

1378
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,080
Somebody just yelled cleaning up.

1379
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,080
Yeah.

1380
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,080
Thank you.

1381
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Thank you.

1382
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,080
Yeah.

1383
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,080
You got there ahead of me, but you're right.

1384
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,080
Wait, wait.

1385
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,080
He's talking about cleaning up.

1386
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
I'm going to nail this.

1387
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,080
In case he forgets the words at the last second, I'm going to give him those words, and I'll

1388
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,080
appreciate that.

1389
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,080
What's it called when you have the shit out and it's dirty?

1390
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,680
It's like, it's dirty, and you need to do something about it to make it not dirty.

1391
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,400
God damn it.

1392
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
Cleaning down.

1393
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Oh, shit.

1394
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,400
Dirty up.

1395
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
Nope.

1396
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Fuck.

1397
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,600
I'll get there.

1398
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,040
I clean up as I could.

1399
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,080
I put stuff away as soon as I serve the plate.

1400
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
I put it away.

1401
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
Brag.

1402
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,080
Brag, brag, brag.

1403
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,080
It bothers me if something sits out.

1404
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Are you reading the newspaper like, no, polish, polish, polish.

1405
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,520
Do you have a house spirit?

1406
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,520
Because that might be...

1407
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,880
Wait, but you have other roommates, right?

1408
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,200
This is one of a couple.

1409
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,640
So it's me and my fiance.

1410
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
He owns the house.

1411
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,400
We have one roommate who is also here.

1412
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Corey.

1413
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,400
Hi.

1414
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
A victor.

1415
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
The winner of the...

1416
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
Hey, out there.

1417
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,720
A victor.

1418
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,800
You're going to need to nail a board list with house rules up on the door.

1419
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,800
It's just like, one rule, clean up.

1420
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,760
You're the Martin Luther of rigatoni cleanup.

1421
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,400
You are going to need to get a Martin Luther costume.

1422
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,840
Do you have one already?

1423
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Okay.

1424
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,820
No home should be without.

1425
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,000
For sale over there, posters and Martin Luther costumes.

1426
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,720
Has any of this been good?

1427
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
Huh?

1428
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,720
Yeah.

1429
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,720
Oh, yeah.

1430
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,720
Oh, God.

1431
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,720
You weren't even paying attention.

1432
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
All right.

1433
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Yeah, yeah.

1434
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,720
Something like that.

1435
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,720
There you go.

1436
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,720
Thank you, and I love your nail polish.

1437
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,720
What's that?

1438
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,720
I love Travis's nail polish.

1439
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,720
Thank you.

1440
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,720
It's beautiful.

1441
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,720
How sweet.

1442
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,720
Nobody ever says anything about it.

1443
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,720
Thanks, guys.

1444
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,720
Thank you.

1445
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,720
Quick, quick, quick.

1446
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,680
It's almost over, but let me holler at you just one last time.

1447
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,480

Let's close out.

1451
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,040
I'm excited to get to the final Yahoo because it's so fucking transcendent.

1452
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,040
Okay.

1453
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,840
So, Minneapolis, thank you so much.

1454
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
It's been great.

1455
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,920
It's been a super good show.

1456
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:45,440
You guys are like the most fun ever.

1457
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,660
Don't forget about the posters.

1458
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,660
They're really, really incredible.

1459
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:54,280
Please, listen, I do not know what we will do with posters that say Minneapolis on them.

1460
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,160
If you don't buy all of them, we're fucked.

1461
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,160
So grab them.

1462
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,680
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for using our theme song, It's a Departure

1463
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,320
Off the Album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1464
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,320
Is he here?

1465
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,320
Is he here?

1466
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,320
No?

1467
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
Okay.

1468
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,320
Somebody just went, hey.

1469
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,320
Hey.

1470
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,320
Oh, shit.

1471
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,320
I almost forgot about John Roderick.

1472
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I know this part.

1473
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Thank you to Sawbones for doing an amazing job opening for us.

1474
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,880
Thank you to everybody here at the Cedar Cultural Center.

1475
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,000
This is like, this is a pretty fucking rad venue.

1476
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,800
You guys didn't get to go back in the green room, but it's pretty cool.

1477
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,360
There's a baby back there and everything.

1478
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,080
It's a fully stocked green room.

1479
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,160
Yeah, everybody's been really, really nice.

1480
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Yeah, this has been tremendous.

1481
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,160
Thank you guys so much.

1482
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,960
Yeah, Minneapolis, you've been super, super, super nice to us.

1483
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Finally, I...

1484
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
Yeah.

1485
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Okay, I'm gonna read...

1486
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Okay, buckle up.

1487
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,000
It's gonna go for a while.

1488
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,720
Every episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me, we have one final Yahoo Answers question that

1489
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,040
we will ponder over the next week.

1490
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,040
And then...

1491
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,040
This one's meaty.

1492
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,040
This one's gonna have...

1493
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,520
You're gonna be chewing on this one for a while.

1494
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,200
So as always, stick with us.

1495
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,800
We return to it next week and we talk about it.

1496
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Every time.

1497
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
Don't.

1498
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Every time.

1499
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,040
We've always done this.

1500
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,360
And Griffin, do you have one to close this out this week?

1501
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360
I do.

1502
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,920
I wanna read the actual question, and this is unprecedented, I'm gonna read the additional

1503
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,920
details to you.

1504
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
So...

1505
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,920
This is really fucking good.

1506
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,920
Stick with it.

1507
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,480
A ton of people sent this in, including John Jarzymski, David Jackson, Zoe Kinski, and

1508
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,400
probably a bunch of other people.

1509
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Thank you all so much.

1510
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Frankie, who asks, can I get my dad arrested for not letting

1511
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,440
me drop out of school to become Zane Malick's replacement in One Direction?

1512
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,760
That's nothing.

1513
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,760
Okay.

1514
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,680
So, I want to drop out of school forever, because I am tired of this teacher bullying

1515
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,680
me.

1516
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,600
Today he said I smelled like a whore's handbag.

1517
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,640
WTF is he even talking about?

1518
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,080
I was smelling like aftershave, a nice one.

1519
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,040
So I drew up a plan to show my dad I am very serious about this.

1520
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,200
It goes, one, leave school, two, be a zookeeper.

1521
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,040
But then I heard about Zane, so I'm willing to take that vacancy.

1522
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,280
Cool trajectory.

1523
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,600
I have got better at faking English accent, and I would like lots of girlfriends.

1524
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,780
He didn't even look at my plan.

1525
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,960
He just got mad, saying for the last time, I'm not leaving school.

1526
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,840
Said next time I mention it, I will automatically get a slap.

1527
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,120
This is a democracy.

1528
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,420
I'm tired of him saying no to everything.

1529
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,420
Can I get a parrot?

1530
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,420
No.

1531
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,920
Can I go to Manchester with my friend?

1532
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
No.

1533
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
Can I have one more beer?

1534
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
No.

1535
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Can I have some money?

1536
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
No.

1537
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,560
So I started saying no to everything he says to me, and he had the audacity to get mad

1538
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,400
at me and yell, you don't tell me no.

1539
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,400
I am the dad.

1540
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,760
I do this for you.

1541
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,920
I do that for you, blah, blah, blah.

1542
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,840
I am a massive dickhead, blah, blah.

1543
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,960
Please arrest him, and I will have fun.

1544
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Fun.

1545
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,440
I'm Justin McElroy.

1546
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
I'm Travis McElroy.

1547
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1548
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:21,120
It's been my brother Robby, kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1549
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:36,960
I'm Travis McElroy.
