1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:45,760
Hello everybody and welcome. My brother, my brother,

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,000
I hate this so much. It's not good to see your meat.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I don't like it. You guys are going to be able to see me. We're recording in the same

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,720
room for the first time since we got together and when we weren't like live on stage.

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's true. And I don't want you guys to be able to see me because then

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,120
you'll see when I zone out and stop listening to you so I can come up with jokes.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
It's basically literally as soon as you finish. There you go. Bye, Travis.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,920
There he goes. So we are recording in my home here in beautiful Hinton, West Virginia,

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,040
because we're about to start production on our new TV show. We're done with our old TV show.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
It's time for the new one. Yeah, maybe you've heard of it. Frasier.

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,680
Griffin, you said Frasier wrong. No, it wasn't Frasier. It was Frasier. So that was F-R-A-Y.

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,080
You know how that one company made like Atlantic Grim and that kind of stuff so that grandparents

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,680
would just scroll through and buy it. That's what we want. We wanted kids to scroll through and buy

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,120
Frasier for their grandparents. It was dark Frasier. This is very dark.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,080
But anyway, that's over with now because now we're making My Brother, My Brother and Me

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
Untitled Project. It's not Untitled. I think it's just going to be called-

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,440
It's just called The Kelsey Grammer Show. So now we've gone Hollywood and-

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,600
A lot of stuff has changed. A lot of stuff has changed.

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,760
How has your life changed, Justin, since we went to Hollywood?

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,840
Well, I don't have very bad diarrhea. You know what? Me neither. Now Griffin-

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
That's weird how that happened because I strangely, as soon as I made the switch to go

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,560
Hollywood, my body was like, you've gone corpo. Anyway, I've got the norovirus and it's a fun

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,680
way to start out the shoot. If you watch the show early next year and you see Griffin, you say, boy,

30
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,760
that boy look empty. There's a good reason. It's actually a fact that one in three people

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,800
who could go Hollywood have wicked bad diarrhea. If you've ever seen Ocean's Eleven, one in three

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,480
of them was having wicked bad diarrhea. I can't run the math on that, but it's a good number.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Three to four of the- Let's see.

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,440
Three and three quarters.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's think.

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
That math's no fun.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Clooney definitely had it.

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
Uh-huh. Cheeto.

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,120
Don Cheadle has it all the time.

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
There's all the time. Don Cheadle's body is actually allergic to fame, but he can't stop.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,840
He's got a slender profile and it's because of that noro, that Hollywood noro.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,000
We scheduled a few days early for everybody to get in and get in the-

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
Get in a rhythm. Just get comfortable with each other again, relearn each other's bodies,

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,840
each other's rhythms. Griffin has spent the entire time on the couch in my den,

45
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,480
watching the OC and playing Phoenix Wright on CBS.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,360
And just fucking-

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Just fucking-

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,360
Just driving.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
Yeah.

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
It's been a miserable, miserable weekend.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
Excited to get fucking started though.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,800
Just so ready.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,680
Making the red carpet. Making the red carpet right there, laying it down and stepping on it.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Walking all over the red carpet.

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah.

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
Thanks for listening.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
Are these going to be regular?

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,680
What's going to be different about these?

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Because we're going to have three of these episodes where we're doing it all together.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,800
They're going to be shorter because we got nothing in the tank.

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,760
We have not-

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,880
I especially look at my belly.

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,680
Do you see that?

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,320
How it says there's a needle pointing to E?

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,720
I have nothing inside to power my goofs anymore.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,680
He's clinging to an action figure of our dad for strength.

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,240
Thank you, dad.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
Should we get started and just do some advice?

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,920
Yeah, that sounds-

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,200
Can we holler at Rob?

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,720
Rob is editing the show for us.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
It's the first time we've ever had anybody, not me.

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
Well, I guess you guys have edited every once in a while.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
I did a really shitty job twice, I think.

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,200
But Rob is going to do a great job.

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,520
Do you think Rob's going to put in any fun sound effects?

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Let's listen in.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
That's really good, Rob.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,720
We're going to call you great job, Rob.

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,360
Very funny.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
Great job, Rob.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
So listen, I hate this.

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
I cannot stress enough how distracting it is to see

85
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,040
your stupid faces in the same room with me.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,560
It's weird.

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
It's like trying to shit in public.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
Griffin, do you know anything about that?

89
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
She like shitting in public?

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,200
He's not that diuretic.

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,240
He's not just like, could everyone please look to their left?

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,520
I don't like how blue this is.

93
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
It's very blue.

94
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Okay, here's a question.

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,960
A woman I went to university with works at my local Starbucks.

96
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,760
It's called college, get it right or pay the price.

97
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,400
We knew each other.

98
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Starbucks is called college?

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
Yeah, it's called coffee college.

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,320
I went to Starbucks, you.

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
I majored in foam.

102
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,760
I have a latte debt.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
Shut up, that wasn't even good.

104
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
That was good.

105
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,480
Yeah.

106
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,320
Now you're ready to really start making the beans.

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
A woman I went to university with works at my local Starbucks.

108
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,760
We knew each other and I would happily say hello to her

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,560
and reintroduce myself, except for one problem.

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
She had an identical twin.

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
Bum, bum, bum.

112
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
And I'm not sure which twin it is.

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
Do I have to move now?

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,360
This is.

115
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
That's from Confused Coffee Trigger.

116
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,840
Listen guys, you don't have to jump straight to moving away every time.

117
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
Yeah, I lost my keys.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Do I need to move away?

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Good luck with that.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah, you don't need to move.

121
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,920
No, you're fine.

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,720
At the very least, there's probably other coffee shops in your area.

123
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,600
Unless the identical twin works at the other coffee shop in your area.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,480
Oh no.

125
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Better coffee shops with less corporate greed, probably.

126
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,840
Wait, hold on.

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
How do we feel about Starbucks?

128
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,560
Where are we at?

129
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
I have the easiest solution to this.

130
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
She works at Starbucks.

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
She's wearing a name tag.

132
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,240
I have the same name though.

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
It's the fucked up thing.

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh no.

135
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,400
Yeah.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,840
But spelled slightly differently?

137
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,640
No.

138
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,680
Spelled the exact same?

139
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,160
Exactly the same.

140
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
We're both Joanie.

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,200
We probably saved a lot on personalized license plates and key chains and stuff.

142
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,480
And as a responsible parent, you gotta think about stuff like that.

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,600
That license plates cost so much money.

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,480
You think they just get printed at prisons?

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Yeah, that's why we're naming our daughter Hamilton.

146
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,280
She'll be able to find stuff everywhere.

147
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,640
It's a good thing that you are so concerned about this because I'm certain this is the

148
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,040
first time she's ever had any issue.

149
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,040
It's good that you are personally-

150
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
No, I'm Julie.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
Oh, did you confu- No way!

152
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,720
We're two different people, you monster.

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
How could you, Darren?

154
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
How could you, Darren?

155
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
No, it's not me.

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
It's my identical brother, Barron.

157
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
That's a good reversal if that happens.

158
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
How could you?

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,400
This is so not- Also, man, I've had two hour long conversations with people in which I

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,080
did not use their name once.

161
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,280
It's gonna be super cool to like, hey, how's it going?

162
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,200
I won't tell Dale Carnegie you said that.

163
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,600
Thank you.

164
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
No, I'm not a good person.

165
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,480
I don't wanna share the problem.

166
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,880
It's just, do both twins work at the Starbucks?

167
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
No, I don't think so.

168
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,640
It's just that you don't know, you've never known, you've never ever known which twin

169
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
this has been the whole time.

170
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Wait, I've got it.

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:33,840
Okay.

172
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,760
You do like a fun, like, college buddy thing, use their last name.

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
You just walk up and you're like, Johnson, what's up?

174
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,000
Right?

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
Because like, you're going to be right 100% of the time.

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Okay, but Travis, this person has been to this Starbucks a few times, enough times

177
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,560
that they're writing in to us about it.

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,600
This is, how fucking weird is it that after acting like a stranger for weeks, suddenly

179
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,200
they're like, hey, Johnson, do you remember me, Johnson?

180
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,320
No, you just gotta put a question.

181
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,400
You can't do it like a challenge, like how did you not remember?

182
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
Do you like a question and you go, Johnson?

183
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,600
Oh my God, are you aging backwards?

184
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,040
I never would have believed we went to college together.

185
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,840
You look great.

186
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,640
Something like that.

187
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,040
You know what else would work, you say, you know what would be fun this time is you write

188
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,440
your own name on the coffee cup, but then they write like a diaper and it's like, why

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,600
did you write, it's all we know.

190
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,000
It's like a twist on that, I lost my phone number, can I have yours kind of thing.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
Except you're like, I lost my name.

192
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
I lost my identity, can I have yours?

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
A coffee buyer has no name.

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,200
This says Shusen, Shusen, is that, okay.

195
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,680
How about a Yahoo?

196
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,240
Yeah.

198
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,680
This one was sent in by level 9,000.

199
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,560
Yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu, yadu.

200
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,520
Is asked by Yadu.

201
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,560
Hey, Rob, could you just insert ground saying Drew down?

202
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
Could you fix it, but don't really, leave that in.

203
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,920
It's from Yadu answers user.

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
Well, they're not listed.

205
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,120
So I'm going to go with the next name down, which is death dealer.

206
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Death dealer asks, I think magicians are hot.

207
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
I can't afford to go to circuses.

208
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,880
Is there any other places that magicians hang out or I could meet them?

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,840
Nope, just there.

210
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
Just there for circuses.

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,080
Dammit.

212
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,580
Dam.

213
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,540
What, what venue?

214
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,820
Okay.

215
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,500
I haven't been to a circus in a grip.

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,580
I don't know how much a circus, how much is a circus?

217
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,460
Justin, you've got kid.

218
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,820
How much is a circus?

219
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,460
1750 usually 18 bucks.

220
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,780
Okay.

221
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,820
Because there's not going to be a Vegas show cheaper than going to like a Ringling Brothers

222
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,540
circus.

223
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:37,780
Yeah.

224
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,140
I mean, it's like, or like even a bad circuit, a worse circus than that.

225
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,740
There are many off brand.

226
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,460
You can go to like uncle Jimmy's like cut rate circus where there's like golden retrievers

227
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,540
in mains and like the magician guy is just like making your money disappear.

228
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,980
And all the clowns are babies.

229
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,260
Well, hold on.

230
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,300
You charge extra for that.

231
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,420
You want a clown baby?

232
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,260
I don't want to go to this circus now.

233
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,540
It's a pretty good circus actually.

234
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,060
Now that I've been describing it, this would be a really like easy entry point for kids

235
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,780
who like are afraid of the circus or like, no, it's just a dog in a wig.

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,220
And you're like, okay, this is all right.

237
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,900
Well, you got to build to that.

238
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,420
If you want to start, you're in circus.

239
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,580
Nobody's going to give you an elephant day one.

240
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,900
You got to start with like, what do I have around me?

241
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,300
Okay.

242
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,420
I have dogs.

243
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,460
I have babies.

244
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,500
I have mains.

245
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,420
You got, I can put a main on the baby.

246
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,220
No, that's not right.

247
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,860
I'll get there.

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,820
That's a good point, Justin.

249
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,100
Cause you can't just like say I have a circus now and expect people to like give you lions.

250
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,020
You got to prove you're responsible for lions.

251
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,300
How do you start?

252
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,220
How do you get your first elephant?

253
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,580
Cause it seems like people, first off, I guess elephants aren't in it anymore.

254
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,100
No, elephants are all retired.

255
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,660
Thanks, Obama.

256
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,460
They've all returned to their native home of Nebraska.

257
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,420
This is what the book Water for Elephants was about, is about a young circus man.

258
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,740
He falls deeply in love and he has to take care of elephants.

259
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,020
It's like, you better give them water.

260
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,140
They love that stuff, man.

261
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,980
Elephants, they're crazy about this stuff.

262
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
They will die without water.

263
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,020
That much I know about these elephants.

264
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,020
That's Elephant 101.

265
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,860
Oh, you get a Timothy Elephant and then he comes and you can prove you're responsible

266
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,340
for him.

267
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,980
And then they give you more.

268
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,900
That's what the book Water for Elephants.

269
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,380
You got to, you got to drop factor.

270
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,900
You got to drop like facts about your knowledge of elephants.

271
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,020
Like, hello, I'd like to buy an elephant which need water to live for my circus.

272
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,540
That was the test and you passed.

273
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,660
Here you go, young man.

274
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,820
What is this part called?

275
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,380
The trunk.

276
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,100
That's right.

277
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,660
You did great.

278
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,300
You did great.

279
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,580
And what do they need to live?

280
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,900
Water.

281
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,780
That's also right.

282
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,740
Here you go.

283
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,100
Hey, you're not going to hurt it.

284
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,820
No hurting.

285
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,380
All right.

286
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,780
All right.

287
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,060
Enjoy your circus.

288
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,820
I think that to take over a circus, you have to first apprentice with like a ring master

289
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
because you can't just say like, I'm a master now.

290
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,380
You got to start as like a ring apprentice and then eventually kill the ring master.

291
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,020
Take his big hat and whip maybe and hoop.

292
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,460
And now you're the ring master.

293
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,540
Well, you have to make it look like an accident.

294
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,100
Oh yeah.

295
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,180
He's got to get, I see.

296
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,100
What's a good circus accident?

297
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,980
Jesus, Travis.

298
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,220
I mean, circuses were literally made for murders that look like accidents.

299
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,580
Yeah, but like you don't want to fall into the one of like, oh, he got crushed by cotton

300
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,140
candy.

301
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,180
No, he didn't.

302
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,580
Barnum and Bailey were like, we need to murder a bunch of fools and make it look like accidents.

303
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,780
How can we create the most dangerous environment possible?

304
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,220
I know we're going to get lions.

305
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,700
We're going to put motherfuckers heads in the lions.

306
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,500
What's up?

307
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,740
We're going to make people walk on like really thin wires, super duper high up.

308
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,500
Well, we got to make sure they won't be missed.

309
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,260
Well, we'll just travel around all the time.

310
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,380
No one will think to look for.

311
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,980
We'll give them fake names and shit.

312
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,940
We'll paint their faces.

313
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,700
No one will even know what they look like.

314
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,100
This is it.

315
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,740
Wait, hold on.

316
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,060
Wait.

317
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,380
This is a real, we're explaining a lot here.

318
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,900
It makes a lot more sense to me now.

319
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,180
It's the perfect murder.

320
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,460
Circus murder is the perfect murder.

321
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,220
Circus murder.

322
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,300
Here are some other ways you could kill somebody in a circus.

323
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,020
Okay, please.

324
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,060
Poison cotton candy.

325
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,780
Yes.

326
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,260
That's it.

327
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,140
That one's easy.

328
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,060
Poison hot dogs.

329
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,620
Two.

330
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,020
Okay.

331
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,420
Make, don't give an elephant water for a really long time.

332
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,260
Then have them walk into the elephant zone with a bottle of water and the elephant will

333
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,500
just go fucking ham on them.

334
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,500
Rub peanuts on their clothes.

335
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,540
Is that water?

336
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:01,940
Oh, wait.

337
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,060
If you, if you dehydrated an elephant, it could talk.

338
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,780
Yeah.

339
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,740
They get thirsty enough.

340
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,860
Offer like an amateur sword swallower booth because, well, that's a little on the nose,

341
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,260
isn't it?

342
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,380
Try sword swallowing.

343
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,700
You've heard so much about it.

344
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,980
Oh, you think it's so easy?

345
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,140
Yeah.

346
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,060
Then you, oh, get a very standoffish sword swallower to join your circus.

347
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,860
Well, then you do it and then like that just takes care of itself.

348
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,140
You've read about it in my book.

349
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,500
You've seen it on Travel Channel.

350
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,620
Now is your chance to experience sword swallowing for yourself.

351
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,380
You think when Cirque du Soleil got up in it, they're like, here's my idea for a circus.

352
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,500
Two, two steps.

353
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,340
One, weirdly sexual.

354
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,540
Two, let's take the murder out of the equation.

355
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,140
That's the only reason that Cirque du Soleil is so popular is cause the audience don't

356
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,220
get the same murder vibes they get from the circus.

357
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,540
Yeah.

358
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:53,460
It's, do you think that this idea was sort of the impetus for Spider-Man turning off

359
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,260
the dark?

360
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah.

361
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,020
We miss all the murder.

362
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,820
Where's the murder?

363
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,620
Where's the murder?

364
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,580
The old circus days, old vaudeville days.

365
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,700
Bring it back, you two.

366
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,220
Okay.

367
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,500
We'll, we'll both bring it back.

368
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,380
You got, okay.

369
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,420
Sorry we took it.

370
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,140
Done.

371
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,260
How about a question, Justin?

372
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,420
Yeah.

373
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,380
I got one for you.

374
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,740
And please stop looking at me.

375
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,780
I really just can't.

376
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,740
My office buys food for lunchtime meetings.

377
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,860
After the meeting is over, the food is placed in the break room.

378
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,860
I learned from our receptionist that she throws away any food at the end of the day if anything

379
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,740
is left.

380
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,300
Sometimes there are containers full of food left.

381
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,780
I have decided that rather than let the food go to waste, I would bring containers on the

382
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,580
days that food would be available and try to bring it home in my good.

383
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,500
That's from not quite dumpster diving in Fishers, Indiana.

384
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,020
I love this blackhawk down.

385
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,820
Leave no ma'am, leave no, leave no delicious taquitos behind.

386
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,740
It all depends on your timing.

387
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,300
Okay.

388
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,020
Because like, if you're, if they serve the food at like 1215 and they ordered a bunch

389
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,620
of pizzas for lunch and you go through with a plate and a Tupperware and you're like,

390
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,660
you're not going to eat all this.

391
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm taking it with me.

392
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,260
You're a jerk.

393
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,940
Yeah, Travis, that's food theft.

394
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,980
But if you wait until like 459 and you just barely beat the receptionist to like the thing

395
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,140
and save the pizza, you're a hero.

396
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,100
If you drive your Ford Focus into the front window of the Papa John's and then jump out

397
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,780
and steal all the pizzas before it's even delivered to your office, then yeah, that's

398
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,180
not acceptable.

399
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm just saying there's a thin line between like a pizza theft and a pizza hero.

400
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,740
You know what I mean?

401
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,180
And it's about four hours.

402
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,020
There is a good point there of like-

403
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,580
Is there?

404
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,060
Extra pizza.

405
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,700
You found it?

406
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,900
No, there is one.

407
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,540
If you have extra pizzas, okay, somebody brings in a stack of pizzas from Papa John's, right?

408
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
They're all piping hot and fresh as every-

409
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,700
They're delicious.

410
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,260
They're amazing.

411
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,140
They're delicious.

412
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,100
You can get that thin crust, you can get a little bit of sprinkles on it, it's so good.

413
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,380
If somebody walks in as soon as the doors are open and they're like, this one's going

414
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,780
home with me, that's a monstrous thing to do.

415
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,300
At some point during the day, it becomes okay for them to be like, I'm taking one of these

416
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,740
and everyone will be like, oh, thank God.

417
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,700
What is that point?

418
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,140
I think it's when everybody's full of pizza because when you're full of pizza, there's

419
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,540
nothing more deplorable to you than pizza.

420
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,060
You just have to go cubicle by cubicle like, Dan, you full?

421
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,260
Susan, you full?

422
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,980
Yeah, and actually-

423
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,940
You want some more?

424
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,420
What kind?

425
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,060
I will get it for you.

426
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,100
I got to expedite this process.

427
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,780
Have you ever been so full of pizza that you watch someone else eat pizza and you're like,

428
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,140
what are you doing?

429
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,020
That's disgusting.

430
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,140
You're the devil.

431
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,740
Also, no tea, no shade, but at the end of this question, I thought it was going to end

432
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,340
with, I would bring containers to some sort of hunger thing or shelter place.

433
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,260
Yeah, one of the things that hunger places prize the most is if I can say a last pizza

434
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,100
at a Tupperware, you brought for work.

435
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,980
Oh, thank you.

436
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,780
This will feed no one that's returning it in the trash.

437
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,900
That was a good zone out.

438
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,500
I just caught a really juicy one.

439
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,380
Is that 30 seconds?

440
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,820
Because I think I've come up with a solution.

441
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,940
What you need to do is you need to organize with whoever the office manager is who takes

442
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,580
care of food and you need to take however much is left at the end of the day and then

443
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,940
minus that much from the next time they order food.

444
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,100
Because what appears to be happening here is your supply and demand is way off.

445
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,820
You need to get the supply lower so the demand is higher or else you're just wasting food.

446
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:11,140
And not only wasting food, but you could create a game here where you know if there's 100

447
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,780
people in your office, there's only food for 99.

448
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,820
So who's going to be the 100th and that 100th just doesn't get food on that Friday.

449
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,660
That's fun because then you can also have an office pool and whoever loses the office

450
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,140
pool has to get the food the next time.

451
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,420
I'm broken I think in a way because there's nothing less appetizing to me and I don't

452
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,420
know if maybe I'm alone in this, but like anytime food is provided on like a table and

453
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,340
everybody's waiting in line to eat it, that's profoundly unappetizing to me.

454
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,740
I never want to eat in that scenario and I think partially it's because I'm overweight

455
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,460
and I feel like it's such a bad look to be like, I can't even wait for this.

456
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,980
And I feel like I'm always the person when dinner is available, they always say,

457
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,940
somebody get us started off.

458
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,900
Griffin, come on.

459
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,940
And I always wonder why I'm the hunky boy that has to fire the starting pistol.

460
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,020
I think the thing that trips me up about it is if you're in line for food, what you're

461
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,100
saying is, I'm really worried there's not going to be enough for everybody and I want

462
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,300
to get my taste.

463
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,300
And especially if you're the first one in line, it looks like you're like with your

464
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,100
body language saying, stay back, stay back.

465
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,300
These potatoes are mine.

466
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
You know I'm the hunky boy.

467
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,740
What are you even doing?

468
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,780
Then, but of course, see that bites me in the ass sometimes because we were at Max Fun

469
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,420
Con East last weekend and there was some, I went up to get, I waited a little bit too

470
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,940
long and then I went up and there was a thing of three cheese tortellini in the thing and

471
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,700
I missed out and there wasn't any in there.

472
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,180
That's okay.

473
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,780
There's plenty of other food for the rest of the fucking weekend.

474
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,220
All anybody wanted to talk about was this three cheese tortellini.

475
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,180
It was really good.

476
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,380
Get in there.

477
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:49,860
Get in there.

478
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,300
I missed out.

479
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,700
I just love how much we're talking about that good, good food.

480
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,940
Okay.

481
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,660
Here's the problem.

482
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,580
Here's the problem question, Oscar.

483
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,940
I've just realized the issue here.

484
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:07,300
How many times can you do this in a row before you gain the reputation as the one who takes

485
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,980
food home every time?

486
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,620
Well, because you'll start to hear these jokes at 1215 when the pizza gets there, like, oh,

487
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,980
make sure you leave some for Stan.

488
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,020
Am I right, Stan?

489
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,980
And you guys think like, I just told him, he feeds it to his weird birds.

490
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,060
I told you guys, I don't have birds.

491
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,300
I don't have birds and the pizza just gets thrown away.

492
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,780
Oh yeah.

493
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,740
You love trash pizza.

494
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,700
It's a very angry workplace.

495
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,020
It's for my ferret named Stan's bird.

496
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,420
Stan's bird loves pizza.

497
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,980
My ferret Stan's bird loves pizza.

498
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,820
Um, as long as we're talking-

499
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,660
Where are people even getting ferrets?

500
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,980
Hold on.

501
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,180
We've spiraled.

502
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,060
Yeah, we've spiraled.

503
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,340
Can I read a Yahoo that's like maybe the best transition we've ever had on this show?

504
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,900
Hell yeah.

505
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,140
Sent in by Aaron Keys.

506
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,300

Just let him get through it.

513
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,260
Look at how weak he is.

It's from Yahoo Answers user Calvster who says, who asks,

517
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,220
would you eat a bag of bread rolls that have been mysteriously left at your doorstep?

518
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,900
What?

519
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,460
What?

520
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,380
It's a really good transition.

521
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,020
Wait a minute.

522
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,060
Would you eat a bag of bread rolls that have been mysteriously left at your doorstep?

523
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,180
Let's put some parameters on this.

524
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,540
You got home at five.

525
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,260
Five thirty.

526
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,420
Who is it?

527
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,300
Nobody's-

528
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,260
Who left this bag of bread rolls on my doorstep?

529
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,300
With a note saying, I can't care for these bread rolls.

530
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,900
Please, please adopt these bread rolls.

531
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,700
I made too many.

532
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
Sincerely, a neighbor.

533
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,580
A bag of bread rolls that have been mysteriously left at your doorstep.

534
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,460
You know, my biggest worry would be the first thing I would think was,

535
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,020
what, what am I putting out in the world?

536
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,740
Like what, maybe you'll see me day to day, but they think,

537
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,580
I need to get that man some rolls.

538
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,700
That man can't, he's not responsible enough to get his own rolls.

539
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,060
I mean, look at him.

540
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,940
Look at him over there.

541
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,740
So roll-less.

542
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,680
Could.

543
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,180
Could.

544
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,880
I mean, would I eat them?

545
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,280
Okay, there is a temperature at which these rolls would be served,

546
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,640
where it would arrive on my doorstep where I think, whoa, nice.

547
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Somebody just breaks some fresh bread rolls.

548
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,920
Oh, you're saying if they were warm.

549
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,120
No, I'm saying there's a temperature at which I would think,

550
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,000
oh, someone made freshly made rolls.

551
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,440
Like if an oven on a truck rolled up and they pulled rolls out,

552
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,720
threw them in a bag and see, I was going to go the other way, J-Man.

553
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm saying if I could just finish,

554
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,360
there's a temperature at which I would make that assumption.

555
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
There is another temperature.

556
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,760
It is one degree next to that one where I think, what the fuck happened to these rolls?

557
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,600
Did you leave them in your car?

558
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Did you leave them underneath your seat?

559
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
Where these rolls come from?

560
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,480
I think if they're frozen, I feel a lot more comfortable.

561
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,560
If somebody brings me like pop in the oven set to 350 for 45 minutes

562
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,080
and these rolls will be done rolls.

563
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,760
I'm like, okay, you went to the store.

564
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,040
You bought too many frozen rolls.

565
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,760
Do you got it?

566
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,080
This mystery frozen rolls left on your doorstep are the act of an assailant.

567
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,200
You would rather have hot rolls like so delicious, can't say no to these.

568
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,400
Guys, we got a new like hot, would you rather thing.

569
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,720
It's the new cake or pie, Elvis or Beatles.

570
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,040
Would you rather eat mystery frozen bread rolls left at your door

571
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,240
or mystery hot and fresh out the kitchen bread rolls left at your door?

572
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,000
I would like to make one argument.

573
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,960
I think we'll settle this.

574
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,040
I'll mediate because I'll eat both those motherfuckers.

575
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,240
If they're frozen, you're going to bake them at 350 for a set amount of time

576
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,480
and bake a lot of evil away.

577
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,520
If they're hot and fresh, you just pop them straight in your mouth.

578
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,760
Anthrax, anthrax burn right off.

579
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,560
Burn that right off.

580
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,960
You burn any tiny bug germs off there.

581
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
Toast that, Thrax.

582
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,640
You're going to get, but you're just going to get a hot pipe and bag of rolls

583
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,920
and just pop them in your mouth.

584
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,880
Just in your rebuttal.

585
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,560
That's a lot of work.

586
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,760
And I think that I would not, I think a hot roll is a roll from a friend.

587
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,280
A frozen roll is a roll from somebody who wants to waste your afternoon.

588
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,600
And I would trust the first person more than I would the second.

589
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,880
Who in your life would you find out you got a hyping hot rolls from?

590
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
And you go, that makes sense.

591
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,120
One of my greatest regrets is that I've not cultivated a life

592
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,560
in which I've drawn people around me that would leave piping hot rolls on my doorstep.

593
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,520
I think I have many mystery admirers who would bring me frozen rolls

594
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
and that would make sense to me.

595
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,360
They'd be like, here, I took three steps.

596
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,400
You take three steps.

597
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,360
We meet in the middle.

598
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,480
I got you some frozen ones.

599
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,280
You bake them yourself.

600
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,080
And now we're best friends.

601
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,240
It is weird to think about, like, there's definitely a period in history where,

602
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,320
like, if you were to watch a movie about Robin Hood

603
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,520
and he was just like left a basket full of piping hot rolls on a poor family's doorstep,

604
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,720
they'd open the door and be like, oh, it's amazing.

605
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,760
We'll live through the week.

606
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,640
And there's something that happened at some date where somebody's like,

607
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,520
what have you done?

608
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
What the fuck?

609
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,360
What is this?

610
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,960
I also want you to know that in my mind,

611
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,440
the sound that Robin Hood made when he dropped those rolls off was,

612
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,800
thwip, Robin Hood away, which I'm pretty sure is not correct.

613
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,480
I just want to say top answer here from Forte88ing says,

614
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,640
nope, I'd either take it to the park for youngsters to feed the ducks

615
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,400
or give it to my neighbor as I don't eat bread other than dark rye.

616
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,120
Forte, how do you know they aren't dark rye rolls, bud?

617
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,800
They might be dark rye rolls.

618
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,760
And what if your neighbor put them there and now you look like a real dick?

619
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,520
If you're like, somebody dropped these rolls, I don't want them.

620
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,080
Gross, right?

621
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,480
Your neighbor's like, yeah, gross, I guess that would be.

622
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,560
What if the rolls came-

623
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,520
The one thing I can say concretely about the person who answered that question

624
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,120
is that they have never met a young child.

625
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,600
Yeah.

626
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,760
Because if you're running stats on whether or not

627
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,200
these kids are going to pop one of those bad boys in their mouth, job one,

628
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,000
you have not met a little kid because that has happened.

629
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,720
That's the first thing they do is going to put that right in their mouth.

630
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,720
And I remember when I was a tot and I would walk around the park so forlorn

631
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,840
because I just didn't have random rolls to feed the duck.

632
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,440
Just hoping for some roll hero to bring me some mystery rolls.

633
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,920
You'd grab bread out of the fucking duck's mouth

634
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,840
just so you could throw it back to other ducks.

635
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah.

636
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,400
They were like, no, duck, you've had enough.

637
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,120
What, as a parent, I cannot imagine a reality in which I was like,

638
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,880
hey, I got some, I got a piping hot roll for you, youngster.

639
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,080
You see, I only eat dark rye and somebody left these on my doorstep.

640
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,280
Then the creepy roll man away.

641
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,560
Why does everyone have Spider-Man?

642
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,080
You gave everybody Spider-Man abilities.

643
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,120
Should we go in the money zone?

644
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,680
Yeah, we should.

645
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,120
First monster this week I want to tell you all about is Casper.

646
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,520
I've been sleep on that Casper.

647
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,080
Griffin, actually Griffin, why don't you do this one?

648
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,120
Because you've been sleep on a Casper.

649
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,440
You could-

650
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,680
Let me say this about Casper and I don't want to read all this stuff

651
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
because I'm very tired.

652
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,120
I've eaten six crackers in three days,

653
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,840
but it's made for a wonderful bed for my convalescence.

654
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,680
If you are going to get severe diarrhea-

655
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,800
If you're planning-

656
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,840
Can we just say illness, please God.

657
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,880
If you're planning to be out of commission for several days.

658
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,840
Yeah, this is the bed you want to be running from every half hour on the hour.

659
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,200
It's easy to get out of and it's easy to ease back into.

660
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,720
This is going to be perfect for you.

661
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,480
This is the exact bed you want to be thinking about getting back into when you're on the toilet.

662
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,560
You know, sometimes you lay down on the bed and you sink in.

663
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,440
You got to push yourself out, but sometimes you shit your bones out.

664
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,320
You can't push yourself out of a bed anymore.

665
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,680
But Casper-

666
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,240
If you need a bed in which to regrow your skeleton.

667
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,800
Casper has a risk-free trial and return policy.

668
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,640
Try sleeping on it for a hundred days

669
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,320
with free delivery to US and Canada and painless returns.

670
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,360
Matches are made in America.

671
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,480
You know those dogs that have been mistreated

672
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,520
and so anybody tries to show them kindness, they try to bite their hand?

673
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,560
I feel like sometimes we act like that with our advertisers.

674
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,360
Like we're trying to push them away to make them prove their love.

675
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,040
We don't deserve your love, Casper.

676
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,880
We don't deserve this money, Casper.

677
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,160
Here's the story about convalescence.

678
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,280
But here's the good news.

679
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,440
Casper mattresses are so affordable.

680
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
You won't worry about putting a sick relative in them

681
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,520
because you love them, but you can replace them at a reasonable rate.

682
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,080
Because like, okay, listen to this.

683
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,000
$500 for a twin size mattress, $950 for a king size mattress.

684
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,040

690
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,480
We've been working on our TV show, trying to get our look right.

691
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,880
And the one thing I didn't worry about is a gray sweater.

692
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,760
You know why?

693
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,720
Because of Trunk Club.

694
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,240
Because 90 degrees in Huntington, why do you need a sweater for?

695
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,000

696
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,800
You're gonna call them, you're gonna tell them about your look,

697
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,280
what you need new clothes for, what your sizes are, things like that.

698
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,480
After you work with a stylist, they're going to ship you a box of clothes

699
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,960
that was handpicked for you to wear from over 80 top brands.

You keep what you like and what you don't like, you send back.

702
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,200
That's where I got that great, great, great, great sweater from.

703
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
And I wear it all the time.

704
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,520

with a new clubhouse opening this fall in Charleston, South Carolina.

You can go to a Trunk Club clubhouse and work with stylists there.

717
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,840
You had so many problems saying Trunk Club and you kept saying Chunk Club.

718
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,880
Okay.

719
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
Or Chunk Cub.

720
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,400
Okay.

721
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,760
Well, you've belittled me.

722
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,480
I thought you did great.

723
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,080
Welcome to the Chunk Club.

724
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,600
trunkclub.com slash my brother.

725
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm gonna get you some fashion at the Chunk Club.

726
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,040
This is a message for Michael from Cindy.

727
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,840
You are the absolute best person I could ask to marry.

728
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,880
You are so good, I know you won't be mad whenever this shows up,

729
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,200
even though I promised to do this in June of 2015 and completely forgot.

730
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,960
Also, brothers, please weigh in.

731
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,240
Would the last name for Richardson make us sound like sexy bank robbers?

732
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,720
V-R-I-C-H-A-R-D-S-O-N for Richardson.

733
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,000
Only in the sense that when you make a deposit and like,

734
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,720
what's your last name?

735
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,520
Richardson.

736
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,440
And then they spend an hour trying to spell it.

737
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,600
And by then, like, they're like, okay, I think I finally,

738
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,800
wait, the vault's empty.

739
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,000
And where's all our pins?

740
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,960
Where's all our pins?

741
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,080
And that's your signature.

742
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,960
You see all the pins.

743
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,440
We tell people this all the time, you don't have to take the heat

744
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,240
for forgetting this stuff.

745
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,800
We'll do that.

746
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,440
Put it on us.

747
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Why, I remember back in June of 2015 when Cindy first sent this message in.

748
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,600
There you go.

749
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,280
I want to tell everybody about Heath Sledge.

750
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,080
My dear friend, Heath Sledge, is not someone I have met,

751
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,920
but she is an academic writing consultant who wants to make your academic writing

752
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,760
tasks feel less stomach achingly awful.

753
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,800
She's a freelance editor with a PhD in English and 10 years of experience

754
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,320
working with academic writers.

755
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,040
And Heath wants to help you finish and or publish your journal article,

756
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,440
grant application, dissertation, book manuscript without tears,

757
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,200
ulcers, excessive drinking.

758
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,560
That was probably tears.

759
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,480
Do you think that Heath would help me write like a book of sad libs?

760
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,080
Or I actually have an idea for a play that I'm not allowed to discuss

761
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,680
until I complete other projects.

762
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,080
If Heath did that, Heath could be tried for war crimes.

763
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,880
And I don't think he-

764
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,840
The play would be good.

765
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,040
The sad libs would be bad.

766
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,800
Yeah, so heathsledge.com, go there and make your writing better.

767
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,640
It can be scary to start a writing project

768
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,400
because you sit there like, well, this is bad.

769
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,640
But Heath is going to sit there and both make it good

770
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,160
and tell you it's good so you don't have to worry about-

771
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,880
I think you should start your project before you get in touch with Heath.

772
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,000
I don't think he's going to walk-

773
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,160
Call Heath and say, I have an idea for a dissertation.

774
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,280
What do you think?

775
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,920
You shouldn't call Heath and be like, yo, Heath, what are we doing?

776
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,480
Heath, I want to make a bespoke presentation.

777
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,760
Heath, what's a book I could do for writing?

778
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,480
It's quite possible.

779
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,560
I need to call Heath to find out what the word bespoke is.

780
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,080
I use it a lot in my day-to-day life

781
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,280
and I've just realized I'm not a hundred percent-

782
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,480
That's an easy job for Heath.

783
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,080
Heath would appreciate you giving her a job like that, easy.

784
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,880
What's bespoke?

785
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,240
Well, I'll tell you.

786
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,800
Job over.

787
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,360
Hi, are you a fan of Star Trek The Next Generation?

788
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
Well, that's weird because it's a corny show.

789
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,880
But my friends Ben Harrison and Adam Pranica do a lovely podcast about it.

790
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,480
It's called The Greatest Generation and it's on MaximumFun.org.

791
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,960
I thought that this podcast was a bad idea, but I was wrong.

792
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,280
Please listen to The Greatest Generation on MaximumFun.org.

793
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,720
Three weeks ago, praying mantis showed up on our back door.

794
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,040
After a week, I put her in a box and moved her in my neighbor's garden.

795
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,120
But the next day she was back in the same place.

796
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,920
Oh man.

797
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,800
I don't want to kill her, but she's been very big.

798
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,040
And my wife and I are both too nervous to use the back door in case she jumps on us.

799
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,080
Very real danger.

800
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,600
True, real danger.

801
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,160
Plus she hangs out on the screen and is always watching.

802
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,960
What should I do?

803
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,840
Creeped in Chicago.

804
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,960
What are you doing in there?

805
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Have you heard the good news?

806
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm a praying mantis.

807
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,560
I do, listen, I'm not a big bug, spider, you know, tiny crawly thing person.

808
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,760
You're not a big spider, Travis.

809
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm not a big spider.

810
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,280
We've covered this.

811
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,720
But I would say that, like, there is no amount of big that that praying mantis is,

812
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,640
that it is any threat to you.

813
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,920
Yeah, but that doesn't scare you.

814
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
This is, here, I'll murk a spider.

815
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't fucking care.

816
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,160
A praying mantis is so exotic and beautiful and yet also scary.

817
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,200
This is the perfect bug for this situation to be about.

818
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,320
Because like, I couldn't kill a praying mantis because it's got too much personality.

819
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,120
Two reasons why.

820
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,800
First reason, too exotic.

821
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,640
I, they may be, they may be like.

822
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,600
It could grant wishes.

823
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,560
It could grant wishes, I don't know.

824
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:09,960
For sure.

825
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,600
The second thing is they have too much stuff.

826
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Like, if I gooshed a praying mantis, like, they have too many parts that I would see gooshed.

827
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,120
Like a mosquito, you just like, blap, and it's just like a.

828
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,600
Dust.

829
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,240
Dust, man.

830
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,280
You just dust them.

831
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,000
Praying mantis would be like, I don't know, stepping on a crab or something.

832
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,120
Like, there's too much stuff.

833
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,360
I would also say that of all the bugs in the world,

834
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,320
the praying mantis is the one that I could most see like having as a pet.

835
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,640
Sure.

836
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,840
Because it seems to have personality.

837
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,720
Does the head tilt?

838
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,120
Well, it's going to go crazier because its hands are swords, so.

839
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,720
What I'm saying, when it looks at you, it like does, it seems to have personality.

840
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,920
It has a little bit going for it that I don't see in other bugs,

841
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,600
but I see a praying mantis like hanging out and I'm like, hey, how is your day?

842
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,360
And it seems to be really interesting in mine.

843
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,240
Well, you know what?

844
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm going to go out on a limb more so than a goldfish.

845
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,080
I think a praying mant, maybe that's it.

846
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,920
Maybe this praying mantis, just like a dog, if a dog kept showing up on your porch,

847
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,880
you wouldn't put the dog in a box and take it over to your neighbor's garden.

848
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,760
No, you would like, well, maybe adopt a dog or you'd call someone.

849
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,440
It depends on if you're a dog person or not.

850
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,400
If a cat kept coming around, you put a little dish of cream for them.

851
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,880
You know what I mean?

852
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,920
I'm saying maybe this praying mantis has scoped inside your house from the back door.

853
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,560
It's like, wow, that's a pretty sweet setup in there.

854
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,680
I would like to get in on this.

855
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,720
Happy part of your family.

856
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,160
I would like to be in your, it's cold as shit out here and it's bad.

857
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,360
And then you put me in a garden.

858
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
I came all the way back because I love you.

859
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,640
You ever seen Homeward Bound?

860
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,840
I just did a small version of that.

861
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,960
I did a small Homeward Bound.

862
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,280
And you know, Homeward and Bow and they put the dogs in a box

863
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,720
and they put them in the neighbor's house.

864
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,920
And like three minutes later, they're right back.

865
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm saying maybe open your heart and let a praying mantis in.

866
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,320
I think if I'm your neighbor also, by the way.

867
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,720
Thank you.

868
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,040
Thanks.

869
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,440
Thank you.

870
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:44,680
Thanks.

871
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Probably what would probably facilitate this is the neighbor looks out and they see a box

872
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,960
in their garden and then they go out there and they're like, what the fuck is this?

873
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,800
Even better if they see you doing it.

874
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,520
What are they doing?

875
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,920
It's like Steve's in our garden with a box.

876
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,280
Should we call somebody?

877
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,920
Oh, I know.

878
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,280
This is some bread rolls for me.

879
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,400
Yee pop.

880
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,880
What?

881
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,380
No.

882
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,520
There's not bread rolls in your house.

883
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,240
This isn't bread rolls.

884
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,120
This is a bug.

885
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,560
Very nice bug.

886
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,360
This is a bug with swords on its hands.

887
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,240
This is a bug with a sign around its neck that says you're a problem now.

888
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,760
I'm looking at pictures of praying mantises and guys, I just cannot get behind this.

889
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,080
Look at the personality of that praying mantis' face.

890
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,040
His eyes are red.

891
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,400
Why do you like this?

892
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
I don't like it.

893
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm just saying that that praying mantis looks to me like it's going, hey.

894
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,400
How about this one?

895
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,040
This yahoo.

896
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,080
You guys want this yahoo?

897
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,440
Wouldn't it be manti?

898
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,240
Praying mantis?

899
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,800
It's not important.

900
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,760
Do you guys want a yahoo though?

901
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,560
How big are they though?

902
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,920
They can be arm length.

903
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,560
They can be-

904
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,520
You're kidding me.

905
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
See, I've been talking a big fucking game.

906
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,160
If that boy's longer than like two inches long, we don't have a discussion.

907
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,200
There's not a discussion here.

908
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm calling the authorities.

909
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,960
Yeah, I would call the cops probably.

910
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,040
We call the police.

911
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,880
We've got like a it came from the desert kind of situation here that I'm not comfortable with.

912
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,320
Hi, it's me, Justin.

913
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,280
We have an it came from the desert situation at my house.

914
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,160
We'll be right there.

915
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,480
You, of course, remember the IBM classic.

916
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,880
Are you familiar with the Pokemon Scyther?

917
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,000
It's real and it's happening to me.

918
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,960
Do you want a yahoo?

919
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,720
Damn, I haven't thought about it came from the desert.

920
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,520
Oh, damn.

921
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,720
We are never going to get to this fucking yahoo.

922
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,760
I miss you guys.

923
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,640
It's a good game.

924
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,680
It's a good game.

925
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,560
Hey, do you guys want to maybe do a yahoo?

926
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah, I love that.

927
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,520
This one was sent in by riding high, Rachel Rosen.

928
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,080
Thank you.

929
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,720
Wait, no, that's Zoe Kinski saying son of a game recognized game.

930
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,520
Rachel Rosen.

931
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,080
Sorry, I'm I don't have any bones from yahoo answers.

932
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,680
User no name.

933
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,720
So we're going to go to the next one, which is Supernova Mike Eleven.

934
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,360
Supernova Mike one through ten was taken.

935
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,560
Yeah, Supernova Mike Eleven asks in all caps.

936
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,000
Can a paleontologist like Jurassic Park or no?

937
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,480
I hear people say all the time.

938
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,160
Nobody who truly likes dinosaurs should like be a fan of Jurassic Park because it's inaccurate.

939
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm an aspiring paleontologist and I adore the movie.

940
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,120
But can I still like it if I'm an aspiring paleontologist?

941
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,280
That word's a lot of word to wrap your mouth around.

942
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,360
People act like you cannot like both frown face update.

943
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,560
People call JP fans all the time fanboy and say they know nothing of real dinos.

944
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,520
I do.

945
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,040
This movie is what made me want to become a paleontologist.

946
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,640
I know some dinos have feathers.

947
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,440
I know all this.

948
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,880
But can I still be a massive fan of the movie if I become a paleontologist?

949
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,160
How often?

950
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,280
Hold on.

951
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm going to pick right out of the middle there and say,

952
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,960
how often does it come up that you're standing in a circle of people and you're like,

953
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,320
I like Jurassic Park in circles.

954
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,200
Fanboy.

955
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,960
Well, I'm I'm betting if you're a paleontologist more than you would think.

956
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,360
Aspiring paleontologist, Justin.

957
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,920
I wonder how many times this versus around other paleontologists before you have to stop

958
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,360
being an aspiring paleontologist and you're just a paleontologist at that point.

959
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,720
Because if you're an aspiring paleontologist, you're a person who likes dinosaurs.

960
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,600
See, that word is a real, it's a trouble, it's a problem.

961
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,960
And I think it's paleontology.

962
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,680
If you're hanging with a squad of paleontology.

963
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm actually going to say let's not let's stop saying trying to say paleon,

964
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,720
paleon, paleo.

965
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,680
To say paleos.

966
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,360
And let's just say dino boys.

967
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,160
If you're a dino boy and you're hanging out with other dino boys.

968
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I just watched Justin his face on his microphone.

969
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,520
Dumb animal.

970
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,840
I what I'm trying to think of other examples of movies that would fall under this.

971
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,320
That's the problem.

972
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,960
You don't have a lot of dino options if you're a dino boy.

973
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,160
No, I'm saying like if you want to be like if you're an aspiring doctor,

974
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,400
can you say your favorite movie is Patch Adams?

975
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,000
You know, like what's what's the other ones?

976
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,040
We're like, if you're if you're a vampire slayer, you just can't like Van Helsing.

977
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,520
Well, no, that one actually works if you can't be a vampire fan.

978
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,240
Because here's the thing.

979
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,440
JP one, they don't really do nothing to the dinos, really.

980
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,920
But by the time you get to JP four or JW,

981
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,600
they just are like, it's just Andy from Parks and Rec.

982
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,680
Just shooting dinosaurs in the mouth with shotguns over and over and over and over again.

983
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,320
And it's hard to be like, hell, yeah, fuck them up.

984
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,280
But also be like, I want to study these beautiful beasts.

985
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,320
I'm trying to do you think if you're like a historian,

986
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,720
any movie about the past falls under this or like I can't like like 75% of movies.

987
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,440
I cannot enjoy.

988
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,720
I would say that like, there's a vast swath of like,

989
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,640
medical shows that Sydney can't enjoy, or at least not without like a heavy scoff and a sigh.

990
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,680
But I think you can still like them even if they're inaccurate, right?

991
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,200
Like Grey's Anatomy is like, yeah, okay, they did the spinal tap.

992
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,080
And that is how they did it.

993
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,800
But then they fucked them right there on the bed.

994
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,560
Yeah, that's just why we have to test that spine.

995
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,000
It's like now you don't.

996
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,240
I'm about to spinal tap that dick.

997
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,440
What?

998
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,280
That's not even the saying.

999
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm about to tap that dick.

1000
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,920
And then like, and then like the shin starts playing.

1001
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,080
Shonda get at me girl.

1002
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,960
Do you need a showrunner?

1003
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,480
Shonda, it's time.

1004
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,000
Let me fuck up that spot.

1005
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,760
Let me get all up in Grey's Anatomy and get crazy in there.

1006
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,320
It's time.

1007
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,120
My little bro taking shit on Grey's Anatomy or what?

1008
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,440
We're all ready for it.

1009
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,320
Well listen, the one thing is no production really can last longer than a half hour.

1010
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,000
Because Griffin is really gonna have to step up.

1011
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What's the worst thing you could let me do in one episode?

1012
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,960
Kill all the characters?

1013
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,400
You already did that Shonda.

1014
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,960
Come on.

1015
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,120
Let me get crazy.

1016
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,840
One episode.

1017
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,560
That's all I want.

1018
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm gonna bring Kyle Chandler back.

1019
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,160
Yes, he did explode in that one episode.

1020
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,000
But I've got a way around it.

1021
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
I put him back together with sex.

1022
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:45,880
I guess it was sexiotomy and I put all the exploded meat back together.

1023
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Half the characters of Grey's Anatomy are ghosts and they're falling in love with each other.

1024
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,000
It used to be people pining for ghosts but now the ghosts fall in love and they have

1025
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
their own ghost adventures once the lights are out.

1026
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,880
Spinoff.

1027
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,600
Yeah.

1028
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,320
I love it.

1029
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,520
I would be the best Grey's Anatomy showrunner ever.

1030
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,520
This is actually why I can't watch Maren.

1031
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,160
Because I'm like that's not what podcasting is like.

1032
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,520
I can't do it.

1033
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,440
And also because he keeps shooting podcasters over and over again.

1034
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,080
It's like I can't celebrate this thing.

1035
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,120
I'm not okay with this.

1036
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360
How long have we been going Juice?

1037
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,400
Well sir?

1038
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,440
44 minutes.

1039
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:22,920
Wow.

1040
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,200
It seems a lot longer when we're sitting in the same room, doesn't it fellas?

1041
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,560
No fucking shit.

1042
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,120
But we did record the intro already.

1043
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,480
What do you mean?

1044
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,560
That's included in the span of the 44.

1045
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,120
Cool.

1046
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,760
Yeah.

1047
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,960
We're doing great.

1048
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,240
Another question Justin.

1049
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,520
One thing I will say is we're making better time through questions than we normally would.

1050
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:44,760
Yeah.

1051
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,320
It's just because we're not being as funny because we're all together and we're so tired.

1052
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,720
I'm not tired.

1053
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,440
I feel great.

1054
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,600
And I'm ready to make a television program.

1055
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,160
Awesome, great.

1056
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,080
My little, the only thing that's slowing me down, my only baggage I'm carrying right now

1057
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,680
is I'm very worried about my little brother.

1058
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,720
Your little brother's dying.

1059
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:01,960
Yeah.

1060
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,840
That's the only problem.

1061
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,080
He's getting littler and littler as the day goes by.

1062
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,360
I've lost- He's three inches shorter.

1063
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,800
I've lost like seven pounds.

1064
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,160
Did you weigh yourself for sure?

1065
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,640
Yeah.

1066
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:09,880
Yeah?

1067
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,280
That's so good to get TV ready though.

1068
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,000
It's so bad to not.

1069
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,880
You're doing great.

1070
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,280
Yeah, I'm not TV ready though because you need bones to be on television.

1071
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,560
You need them TV bones.

1072
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,480
Read out a question Justin.

1073
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,600
A few days ago I was on a four hour flight to LA.

1074
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,960
The flight attendant handed out snacks to me and the other passengers in my row.

1075
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,240
A few minutes after I finished my cheese nips and peanuts, the man standing next to me picked

1076
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,160
up his unopened snacks and motioned them as if to say, would you like these?

1077
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,880
I read ahead.

1078
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,200
I motioned what I felt like was a firm no and said thanks anyway.

1079
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,200
And he placed the snacks on my tray and said, maybe you'll change your mind later.

1080
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,240
I didn't know what to do.

1081
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,720
I placed it in the seat pocket in front of me and put it on my tray.

1082
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,000
When the flight attendant came around to collect trash, I handed her the unwanted packs.

1083
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,120
Am I good?

1084
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,080
How can I avoid being the trash man for my fellow passengers?

1085
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,160
That's from Snack Attacked in Kansas City.

1086
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,640
That's exactly what this was Kansas City.

1087
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,320
This was a snack attack.

1088
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,600
You got attacked by snacks.

1089
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,320
Do you look, when you fly, do you dress yourself like a Dickensian orphan?

1090
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,520
Was he like trying to look out for you in like a paternal way?

1091
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:19,960
I just want to say that like the real, I want to know more about the character in this story

1092
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,840
that looked at you and said, you might want these later.

1093
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,560
And what I would say is a very mysterious way as though that person has some kind of

1094
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,280
precognizance or perhaps like is like, trust me, you'll need these cheese nips.

1095
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,960
Oh, shit.

1096
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,200
You're saying like at the airport, a pack of wild dogs gets loose and it's coming to

1097
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:38,760
attack you.

1098
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,200
And if you'd have the cheese nips, you use nips on dogs.

1099
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,280
Have you ever seen the movie Paycheck, which is a terribly named movie for what is actually

1100
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,680
a really cool concept where Ben Affleck sends himself a bag of cheese nips and he's like,

1101
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,640
you'll need these.

1102
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,520
It's that kind of thing.

1103
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,800
Only it's a passenger.

1104
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,840
Maybe from the future.

1105
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,560
I don't know.

1106
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,920
But I can't imagine another scenario in which I would look at a human being I didn't know

1107
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,760
and say, you might need these later.

1108
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
But OK, that was weird.

1109
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,040
That was a good movie.

1110
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,280
It was a good movie with a terrible, terrible name.

1111
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,560
A Philip K. Dick story, which I can't remember the name of.

1112
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,240
Do you remember the name of the story?

1113
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:22,280
It was Uncle Craiggy's funny day at the office or Colin or a wacky time machine ride to the

1114
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,480
future starring Ben Affleck starring Uma Thurman's boyfriend.

1115
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,640
I think I picked that up at the Scholastic Book Fair one.

1116
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,760
I picked it up and it was Uncle Craiggy's.

1117
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,760
OK, this one's on Philip K. Dick.

1118
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,960
OK, he did call it Paycheck.

1119
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,400
That's a terrible name.

1120
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,160
Then blame fucking Philip K. Dick, Travis.

1121
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,800
I would never.

1122
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:53,480
I don't know how much you have traveled, listener, but I think it is the highest form of hubris

1123
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:01,080
to not slip those snacks in your bag because I guarantee you here in about an hour, you're

1124
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,280
going to be in a cab and you're going to be trying to find your hotel and all you're going

1125
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,200
to be able to think about is the trash.

1126
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,040
You're literally going to think about calling the airline to say, those are legally my nibs.

1127
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,920
Can you please fish them out?

1128
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,120
Did somebody grab those?

1129
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,400
Did somebody save those nibs?

1130
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,480
This whole time, just a quick poll.

1131
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,320
Have I been have have we been saying nibs or nibs?

1132
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,080
I've been saying nibs.

1133
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Is that not where the P?

1134
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,200
OK, is that nibs?

1135
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,840
I found I almost missed my flight here to Huntington.

1136
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,960
I missed my connection, I should say.

1137
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,880
I barely had time to run on and I was like two and I had not eaten lunch and luckily

1138
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,200
past me had left little Delta biscotti's and a Clif Bar and I was like, hello, sunshine.

1139
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,280
When I was flying here from anyway, and then I got norovirus, so maybe it was the biscote.

1140
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:55,000
When I moved here when flying from L.A. to Huntington, I was given a meal because I

1141
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,560
purchased a special seat because I'm a special boy.

1142
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,360
I was given a meal.

1143
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,560
I got a hamburger and I bit into that hamburger to find chunks of porcelain in it because

1144
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,680
the corner of the of the plate had broken and it had stuck to the lettuce and tomato

1145
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,960
that I put on the hamburger.

1146
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,480
And the point of this story is I scraped that porcelain off and I finished.

1147
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,080
Oh yeah, it's your fancy sky burger.

1148
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,920
I'm not going to turn down the sky burger.

1149
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
That's good mood food, baby.

1150
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm not turning down that burger.

1151
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,200
And so did your cheese nibs have porcelain in them?

1152
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,440
Because if not, you have no excuse and Travis, you said you told me when I heard this story

1153
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,600
previously that you try to get another sky burger and they were like, no, we only brought

1154
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,200
we brought exactly enough.

1155
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,720
That's some great of both options because it was like it was a chicken salad sandwich

1156
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,120
and a hamburger and they like they bring like six and six, I guess.

1157
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,320
And like, that's that's a crazy gamble that like that you have exactly enough like

1158
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,120
we're in the air.

1159
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,240
What if I'm hung?

1160
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,640
I really actually am very uncomfortable now with the fact that like I get sky hungry.

1161
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,920
The only sort of assurance I've had is that like if I'm sky hungry, someone is going

1162
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,360
to be able to hook me up up there.

1163
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,800
The fact that they have literally enough rations for everyone aboard.

1164
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,760
Yeah, that's terrifying.

1165
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,040
Not everyone aboard, Justin.

1166
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,920
Everyone in the front.

1167
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,600
Like 10 rolls at the front.

1168
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,160
Oh, it is.

1169
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,560
And if you're in the back, I've seen them run out of the little snack trays that have

1170
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,840
grapes and cheese in it.

1171
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,240
Yeah, there's there's no there's nothing that will.

1172
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,680
You didn't bring enough Pringles for everybody.

1173
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,400
Betray your privilege quicker than like, hey, let's slow it down.

1174
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,520
Hey, not every.

1175
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,440
There's lots of great snack options.

1176
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,320
Sometimes sometimes.

1177
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,760
You don't have to get Pringles.

1178
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,800
I want the hummus, please, not the hummus.

1179
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,360
Sometimes when I'm sitting in the back of the plane and I'm walking to get my seat

1180
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,360
and I'm just walking past the people and like the first class in the front, like 20

1181
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,480
bros and like I just see all the people wearing the like shirts that say like good, good Pringles

1182
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,280
boy on it.

1183
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,360
They have little signs that say like, I can't wait to slam some Pringles and like little

1184
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,600
badges that say National American Pringles Convention.

1185
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,480
I don't know why it's both National and the American Pringles Convention.

1186
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,320
And some of them are just like big boys with Pringle crumbs in their mouths.

1187
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,280
And I just think like, I'm not going to get any fucking Pringles on this.

1188
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,720
They're not going to make it back to me, are they?

1189
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,240
Unless the Pringles start in the back of the plane.

1190
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,280
And that never happens.

1191
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,760
Never because that's what that's what they call it.

1192
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,040
Pilots privilege.

1193
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,480
Have you ever thought about pushing the button and when she comes in and they're like, how

1194
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,960
can I help you?

1195
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,480
And you're like Pringles.

1196
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,320
I'm like, no, we'll be bringing no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1197
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,240
I ran a quick head count on my way in.

1198
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,040
You're not making it.

1199
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,480
Sir, we have a lot of Pringles.

1200
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,440
You shut up.

1201
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,000
Stop it.

1202
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,480
Shut up.

1203
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,800
You listen to me now.

1204
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,080
Look at all these Pringles fans.

1205
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,680
Count them with me.

1206
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:38,840
Yeah.

1207
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,640
One, two, three, four.

1208
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,360
There's too many.

1209
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,800
There's some Pring heads in here.

1210
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,880
Listen, I understand you can't bring them now.

1211
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,760
What I have in my hand is a $10 bill.

1212
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,560
This $10 bill could be in your hand.

1213
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:55,080
If maybe you just slide one underneath one of the wheels or that's not a good place for

1214
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,480
Pringles.

1215
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,000
No, you're on the ground.

1216
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,520
You're in Tulsa.

1217
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,680
I'm gone.

1218
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,120
What a what a terrible waste.

1219
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,520
After the snack service, go to the toilet.

1220
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,440
There'll be one remaining Pringles.

1221
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,840
Reach inside the hand, the lotion, the hand sanitizer.

1222
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,440
Pull out individual Pringles.

1223
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,880
Find a series of Pringles hidden underneath each thing.

1224
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,560
Fucking 15 rows in front of you hear a little boy like, thank you for buying me the chips,

1225
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,120
Daddy.

1226
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,800
And you're like, they're crisps.

1227
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,640
He doesn't even deserve them.

1228
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,280
They're reconstituted potato granules.

1229
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,560
But can I have one?

1230
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,080
Is he going to eat all of them?

1231
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,240
But do ask your boy to hit me up.

1232
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,480
Should we end the thanks Pringles for the thank you Pringles for the sponsorship.

1233
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,640
You know that then that's going to do it for us on our program.

1234
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,000
I was just about to talk more about Pringles and how they legally can be called.

1235
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,280
No, I know you talked about it.

1236
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,520
I can't tell you how many times you talked about this on the podcast.

1237
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,280
What episode of what episode of how Pringles are made?

1238
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,080
Did you watch?

1239
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,560
Go ahead.

1240
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,600
You guys wrap it up.

1241
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,320
No, you.

1242
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,840
I read an Uncle John's bathroom reader.

1243
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,440
Travis, did you have anything to add?

1244
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,600
No, I just going to say that I wanted to hear your story.

1245
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,640
Just I was excited to be in the same room with you for the first time.

1246
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,880
You know, for a while, you know, for a while.

1247
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,960
Are you drooling the Pringles?

1248
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,400
No, because I'm not talking about Pringles anymore.

1249
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,880
I'm talking about margarine for a while.

1250
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,680
The butter lobby made it so that margarine couldn't be yellow.

1251
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,320
So margarine, when you bought it in the store, we actually come with a little coloring packet

1252
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,760
that you that you would squeeze into your margin and stirred around to give a color.

1253
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,600
Would it be just white, just white?

1254
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,040
Yeah, that's so much fun.

1255
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:44,760
We need more interactive foods caused by lawyers, caused by lawyers and lobbyists.

1256
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,840
Anyway, that's my story about, this has been a Justin McElroy food fact.

1257
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,240
All right, that's going to do it for us.

1258
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,160
I'm so weak.

1259
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,360
You're going to live Griffin.

1260
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,240
I believe in you.

1261
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,480
I would like to encourage everybody because we are starting filming tomorrow or today,

1262
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,680
whenever you listen to this.

1263
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,200
And we're going to be like trying to do updates and pictures and stuff like that.

1264
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,200
So you can check out our Twitter at NBNBAM.

1265
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,720

1266
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,040
my brother, my brother and me all one word because someone has claimed NBNBAM.

1267
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,560
My brother, my brother and me all one word and we'll post photos and maybe some videos

1268
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,320
and stuff like that over the next couple of weeks.

1269
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,640
We have a PO box where people have sent us things.

1270
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,040
And I want to say some quick thank yous.

1271
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,360
Thanks to David for sending along the cereal.

1272
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,480
You're very kind.

1273
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,400
Vince, thank you for the meat sticks.

1274
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,840
Brenna, thank you for sending your book.

1275
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,680
Glenn Tickle sent us a copy of his CD.

1276
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,720
Yes, really.

1277
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,240
Available in stores now.

1278
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,360
So you can check that out to check that out.

1279
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,520
And I should hold on.

1280
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,560
Let me grab that box.

1281
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,760
I'm going to grab a box.

1282
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,680
We should also say we're going to be doing our candlelight show at the end of the month.

1283
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,720
So if you have candlelight specific questions, start sending them in now with the with the

1284
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,800
subject line candle nights.

1285
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,760
And if you're going to be at the show, try to include that either like in somewhere in

1286
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,200
the body of the question or afterwards to let us know so that we're not sitting up on

1287
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,320
stage going, is Steven here and like a Steven.

1288
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,120
Well, that's a horrible name.

1289
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,360
But if it's like Steven's not a horrible, well, no, I mean, horrible example name can't

1290
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,800
like candle lights and and kills or whatever.

1291
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,400
And like, we'd want to know that name before we try to see if they were in-house.

1292
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,800
So, yeah, things are going to be a little weird for a few weeks.

1293
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,480
So just like thank you for hanging with us.

1294
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,400
It's your fault that we're in this.

1295
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,040
You made this out.

1296
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,000
Your support made this happen.

1300
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,520
Yeah, like as God intended, as it's supposed to be.

1301
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,000

1304
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,880

You're going to fall in love with all of them or your money back.

1310
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,760
You didn't pay any money to be there.

1311
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,120
