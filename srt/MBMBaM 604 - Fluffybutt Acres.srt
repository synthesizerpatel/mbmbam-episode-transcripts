1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,420
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,820
Hello everybody and

13
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,460
I didn't give you the briefing ahead of time, but I would like us

14
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,060
We're recording this the day before April Fool's Day

15
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,860
It will come out after April Fool's Day, of course

16
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,140
But we can keep the spirit in our hearts all year long

17
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,300
I would like to try to focus on April Fool's jokes that everyone can smile and chuckle at where there's no

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:09,420
there's no but but that's but that's the jet like that's the like I would never I would never be like what's up fucking

19
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,260
ugly numb nuts dirt dirt bag numb nuts assholes shrimp dick

20
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,140
assholes

21
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,660
Gass holes April Fool's Day. I would never guys I would listen to me. I would never

22
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,780
Ever say something like that and that's the joke of it. Hey Griffin

23
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,220
Can I tell you my problem with that run? You just went on wasn't so much the offensive language as I couldn't tell where the

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,220
Punctuation was in it and what what nouns went with what verbs and what?

25
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,280
Was shrimp dick asshole one?

26
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,660
Idea or is that sort of one?

27
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,740
Incredible private part. Oh, it's one amazing private

28
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:00,740
The Ouroboros the shrimp dick itself. It's like a shrimp cloaca. Yeah, it does a lot of stuff. It's a it wears many hats

29
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,700
Justin do you want to try an April Fool's? It doesn't matter cuz I didn't mean it cuz I would never say anything like yeah

30
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,820
But for a second Griffin, there's a second there where I thought you did mean

31
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,020
Mark of a great April Fool's joke. Okay, Justin. Hey, should we um, should we try to prank dad?

32
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,180
I don't know. He's what would be a good prank on dad? We can tell him what do we call him?

33
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Yeah

34
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,020
It's doctor

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,340
You know that tests that you had done and it's like it doesn't matter with that because he probably

36
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:47,300
I'm not on board with it so far. But reel me in. Okay, we did it. We have to do it again deeper. Oh

37
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,300
What do you know? I'll like the test has to go be deeper

38
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,780
He had done we're gonna do it again, but like more and harder and deeper so we can make him so then it's not like he's unhealthy

39
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,780
Right. We can be like, hey, it's me your doctor

40
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,060
The results are looking great. We don't want you to fret at all about that, but you do need to come in and let us

41
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,300
Do it deeper just so we can be a hundo

42
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,860
We just need a good deal we need to push harder and it's gonna be wider this time

43
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:27,100
Right. It's gonna be a much bigger instrument say that a bigger deeper instrument now

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,580
I don't I don't know how to break it to you guys, but our dad's kind of a big nerd

45
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,940
Yeah, okay, maybe we could call him and be like, hey

46
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,020
It's your doctor and we did the test and we've never seen anything like it before you've got the mutant gene my friend

47
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
No, he's not gonna believe that no

48
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,900
Like hey, it's it's me

49
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,580
You know Larry McMurtry or something, you know, hey true believer, it's me Stan Lee. Oh, that's good. That's good

50
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,020
Yeah, I faked my death so that I could live in in anonymity

51
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,300
But I'm ready to give over my comic fortune to you if you can answer me this one question

52
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,380
What spider-man's real name and then then also be like and also you need to go back to the doctor because they gotta go deeper

53
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,060
They gotta go deeper and more and more of it with a wider instrument

54
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
true believer true

55
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,540
Celsius Celsius. I

56
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,300
That's funny. Yeah, he's got a heart. Yeah, he's got enough going on

57
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Maybe we could have dad prank Justin

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,380
Well, I'm here we could have like dad called Justin like hey, it's your doctor and you know that tests

59
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,420
We gotta go deeper, but now I think juice will see that one coming only but only

60
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,660
because

61
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:51,300
First off. I'm a virile young man who never needs any sort of medical. I've never been to the doctor. Yeah. Yeah, I don't uh, and

62
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,420
But but more than that like I just I'm here

63
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,220
Did you just second-guess calling yourself a virile man a virile young man?

64
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,980
Or did you become afraid that your wife might overhear you saying that you've never been to the doctor and talking about I don't need

65
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,900
It out of the doctor because I was questioning I I

66
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,060
I can we just talk can we said jokes out of the room first? Yeah

67
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,500
Because I'm about to get vulnerable with you guys. Okay, now you're where you need a test of some sort

68
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,900
No, I'm gonna get vulnerable with you guys. And I don't know what I was pausing there to think was if

69
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:35,100
Virile like I've had a vasectomy that's and I don't know if virile is specifically about your jizzies

70
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,660
They're not right. You're saying you're saying you could nut

71
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,620
If it weren't for the elective you've decided not to nut

72
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,940
Essentially is what you've that I think is like true virility is

73
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,780
Deciding not to the power not to know. No, I still not it's just oh, look at this braggart over here

74
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,780
It's all right big man. We get it

75
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:05,420
Completely clear. Yeah, I mean like water sand. Oh, no the other side. Yeah, like what kind of a sex me did I have?

76
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,620
Huh? They must not if you're not sure if you're not blasting water with every jizz

77
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,020
Go ahead juice. You're not blasting water with every jizz and you did not have a vasectomy. They lied to you

78
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
They gave you something else. Yeah

79
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,940
Yeah, but I don't know. Can you still be virile if you're they still in there if it don't work?

80
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,060
That's what I'm saying. It's in there and it could come out. You've just decided to make it not

81
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,120
Hey, it's like, you know, Willy Wonka closed his factory, but it's still popular

82
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,040
You know what? I mean, he's still a millionaire. Even though people aren't going in or out. I

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,440
Didn't I don't even stop to think about what's going on with all the little boys in there

84
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,480
They're just kind of in there forever, huh? Yeah absorbs. Oh, man

85
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,120
Yeah, well that or it's just your balls are getting bigger and bigger. It's both

86
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,000
I mean, that's the thing it gets reabsorbed to create more mass

87
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
Right

88
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,600
This is a bad conversation that I hate April fools April fools

89
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,380
We knew it was bad. We would never talk about these huge balls huge. Yeah, I can't believe you bought it

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,400
It would say that sit here and talk about how their balls are as big as the swing of Tiger Woods come on

91
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,520
Come on, everyone. Come on April fools. I

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,160
I recently left my job and as a departing gift my old employer had given me a

93
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,960
$100 gift card to a local Canadian coffee slash donut shop. I mean, that's a lot

94
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,520
It's Tim Hortons, but that's a lot a hundred dollars at Tim Hortons a lot of Tim Hortons. It's probably Bieber

95
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
This is probably from Bieber

96
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,360
The only reason that happens is because your boss your boss was like you need to make a good impression at your new job

97
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,680
Donuts for everybody. I'm giving you a leg up. Here you go. It was sent to me via email

98
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,480
The only thing is that it was sent to my work email and I hadn't realized this until now

99
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,720
Which is a problem because it has been almost a month since I left that job. Is that money gone now?

100
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,280
What do I do? That's from cardless in Canada. Oh boy. Oh

101
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,920
That's a toughy. This is not enough people talk about right?

102
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,000
But how much how like in a year, right?

103
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:30,160
Retail places have to be like crossing their fingers every time a gift card is bought. It's like, please lose it

104
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
free money

105
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,520
Now wait a minute who is in this example Travis who is thinking that because it's not the cashier who's like no

106
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,000
It's like mr. Sears or like, you know, the lady Macy's, you know

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,440
Like oh, it's the people who it's the it's the people who run it. Professor Katzouk's exactly. Thank you

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Jeremy journeys

109
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Yeah, I

110
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,640
Want to I want to open a store next to it by the way called destination and people are like it's not about that

111
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,600
Right because I want to help journeys good. That's really fucking good

112
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Okay, do you think this is Canadian

113
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:15,560
Like money or American like comedian. What's the Canadian dollar trading for juice? It's 80 80

114
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,760
To our our dollars. So that's so easy. That's like a really easy conversion

115
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
I hope they keep it locked right there at that night. Yeah, lock it right in and that's easy to do

116
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,320
So I think everybody should just lock it into everything equals $1 by the way, cuz I can't do god

117
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,760
That would be so much easier. So confused because they say it's a local Canadian coffee shop

118
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,560
It's like do you mean it's a local Tim Hort?

119
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,480
Like why would you say local and Canadian your friendly neighborhood Tim Tim? Maybe Jim Hortons?

120
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,920
No, it was like in are they in Canada or not? That's all I'm trying to figure out. I think so

121
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
Let's just assume it. Okay, so $80

122
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,080
No, but we don't know how much coffee costs. Let's just call it. That's what I'm working on right now

123
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm working on that for you. You're

124
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,080
Googling how much how this math could not possibly be so important that it would require you

125
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,160
I can't I don't think we can have here's the thing. It isn't $80

126
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,960
You have to let go of that. We have to figure out what the conversation. Okay, do you understand?

127
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Yes, is it worth 30 coffees is what you're saying? That's what I'm that's all I'm saying. Yeah, probably not

128
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Is yes it is

129
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Because we have to assume

130
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,640
Right that there was enough goodwill

131
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,800
Built up over the you worked hard enough and did a good enough job that when you left your boss gave you a hundred dollar

132
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
gift card

133
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,320
All right, it's you you got us

134
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,040
We got to stop because they're not bringing the question is not can I bring this Canadian gift card to America?

135
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,840
And then have the value of our currency judged against your own

136
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,920
Can I mule some doughnuts across you know with international lines in Canada?

137
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,760
It does he is you can I hoop some Tim bits?

138
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,680
in Canada a does he is gonna cost you

139
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,800
899 right. Okay. Now, I don't know if they do taxes over there or what but let's just assume they actually give you money back

140
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,840
Let's assume that it's ten dozen doughnuts. Okay, that's a hundred and twenty doughnuts

141
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm sure now if you think about that if you can contextualize this question now now

142
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
It's something you can talk about because now you're talking about

143
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,020
Somewhere in the bowels of the Internet are a hundred and twenty doughnuts just for you

144
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,280
It's like one doughnut a day for a third of a year like that. I don't do actually more math

145
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,880
Okay, I'm so I am I hating this I am actively mad at the question asker for the amount of math that they have brought

146
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,120
It's just like to be fair Griffin. Sorry Griffin Justin if I may the question asker didn't ask us to do this math

147
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Justin has voluntarily assigned

148
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,080
They gave us one number and Justin right turned into the fucking number muncher

149
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,160
$120 120 doughnuts. Yeah trapped in my email. Here's okay. Don't do this. Don't do it

150
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,300
but

151
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,220
What don't reach out to get back in the email? Oh what you're about know what you could do is go to

152
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:22,420
Whatever the story is. Let's say Tim Horton's order the stuff and then when they're like time to pay then you say

153
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,300
well, I had a gift card, but I lost it and

154
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Then at this point

155
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:37,340
Tim Horton's is the needles Tim Horton's is let's just say pot committed because the chances are they've already started boxing the doughnuts

156
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,940
Right, they've already punched it into the computer, right?

157
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,700
Okay, but if you walk up to whoever's by the cash register and the first thing you say is is there a way to figure out?

158
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,060
I had this gift card, but I lost it and I have zero information about it

159
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,300
Nothing's happening here. Nothing's happening here. You the Tim Horton's employees would rather

160
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,100
Let you watch and look on in horror as they shoved doughnut by doughnut into the garbage disposal

161
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,980
One of them give them to you for free. Like there's no way that this plan will work. I

162
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,260
I it is channel. I'm not saying give them to you for free

163
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,900
I'm saying once their pot committed now they have to look at now they have to get in the computers and figure it out

164
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,780
Yeah, we're gonna have to like hack the matrix and figure out where no

165
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,220
1950 where they have like a little tiny box with index cards with each individual customers name

166
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,740
It's also not 1950 where any business cares about any individual experience

167
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Period like yeah, they don't care. They don't care

168
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,200
They would rather pull out a bucket of dirty mop water and shove all your

169
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,140
And then you tweet about it once and they're like, sorry you had a back

170
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,620
No one care like they don't care how it goes for you they wouldn't even do the gift card with the tweet

171
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,220
They're just be like, oh that sucks. Sorry. We love a chance to make this right? Yeah

172
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,360
Come in and they're like, oh good. I'm glad you're here. We've got all your mom

173
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,620
Can you DM us with more details of the experience and you're like, yeah

174
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,180
You dumped them all my donuts in the dirty mop water and you like I'm so sorry. I hate that for you

175
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,420
Oh, that's so bad. What did you do?

176
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Call your impression of Tim Horton

177
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:31,140
Yeah, I'll be that's so weird that they did that that is not company policy we actually have signs telling

178
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,740
We're gonna definitely look into this this actually sounds like a franchisee issue

179
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,540
So yeah, I'm going to improve our our training on that front

180
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,740
I mean the problem with this is if you reach out to the you can't reach out to the boss. Why not be okay?

181
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,760
Run it through like imagine it to you if an employee or that you like enough to do this gift card, right?

182
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah, if an employee reached out to you and they're like, hey, I don't want to be like rude or anything

183
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,120
But I couldn't I can't access that gift card

184
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,680
You got me because I don't have access to that email address anymore

185
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,820
What can you do and if they can't they're gonna feel so stupid? Yeah

186
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,120
God idiot, they're gonna feel so stupid about sending it to your work email

187
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,860
That they might end up feeling obligated to get you another hundred dollar gift card

188
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,220
like yeah, so that is what I would do in that scenario because I would feel like such a guilt cuz it's a

189
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,660
Person I mean it's a purse and you're not gonna feel good about that

190
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:39,620
There you won't feel good about you are assuming that they would not because you because you would not feel good about that

191
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:47,380
Right. I'm just saying that that is a solution. It is perhaps the most direct solution. Is it the most

192
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,900
High road solution. No, no, of course not. But I would also argue that within a month

193
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,780
The chance that your boss has some kind of receipt for the transaction right that they could like contact

194
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Contact Tim Horton's customer service

195
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,940
What did you just giggle at just the idea of like calling Tim Horton's customer service like just hey

196
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,900
My boss I fucked up real good. I bought a hundred dollar gift card for the employee. Please help Tim Horton's

197
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,720
I just like that idea. There's a gaping hole in our donation a real

198
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,300
There's a real gaper here that we're missing out on and that is

199
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
the the

200
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
reason for your departure

201
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,700
From the job the the the quality of your departure from the business that you are no longer employed at

202
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,120
You don't get a hundred dollar gift card is an implication that it was

203
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,540
amicable

204
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,420
That's a good point. Yeah, I've never been like yeah get the fuck out

205
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,740
But also real quick before you go take this with you. I just want you to know this is this is $100 of doughnut hush money

206
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Unless unless

207
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,980
The boss knew that you would not be able to access

208
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,180
These non fungible donut tokens and so then it's sort of an empty gesture, right?

209
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,460
Oh, I'm gonna give you a million bajillion dollars in

210
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,380
Donut money and it's gonna be waiting for you in your work email and then immediately when you get off the phone

211
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,420
They call IT and just like get the shut it down fucking shut it down

212
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,860
Start the timer. I want their email closed before they're off the premises

213
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,720
I think you can I think email them and just get your fucking doughnuts

214
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,620
Why don't you why don't you go to Tim Horton? Just just go to their website and just like talk to him

215
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
person to person

216
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,340
Just tell us to talk to and we don't do that anymore

217
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Thank you. We don't

218
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,580
contact

219
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,980
Website people anymore to say hey, yeah, you know human to human

220
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:02,060
Human person what can you do? What can I do? And hey after this you want to see a movie and hang out?

221
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,900
Let's become real-life buds and they'll feel good for helping you get

222
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,780
120 doughnuts. Yeah, and like ten of those donuts are yours my friend

223
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:18,920
That's a finder's fee and they'll say I wouldn't eat that with my worst enemy's dog's mouth. I know it's been in the mop water

224
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm from mop water. Did they come to not water? It's wilts to base to return

225
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,060
Do you guys think it's weird? Yes, that Tim Horton's doesn't have a possessive apostrophe

226
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,840
So the actual name of the actual business is just plural Tim Horton

227
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,580
Just like many Tim Horton's lined up Tim's ready to serve you and every one of these is me

228
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
eat up my doughnuts

229
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
So I hope that helped

230
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,200
Hey, do you want to go talk to the wizard about what they have for you today? I want him to come to us. We're

231
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,880
Off to see the wizard the magical wizard of cloud here. He is a wizard was just like Chris sewed-out

232
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,160
Remember now from bridesmaids. Yeah, really turned in a great performance Chris. So don't

233
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
He was in the IT crowd

234
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Yeah

235
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,200
This one I think you guys are gonna really need for to get through this

236
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,320
This April's Day because it is how to get your little brother to stop bugging you. Thank you

237
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I've been I've been wondering about this for

238
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
35 years

239
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,960
And Justin for 38 38. Yeah, Tori sent this and thank you Tori

240
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,080
So you can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family a younger brother can be a pain

241
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,080
And now hold on I've watched the fast the furious franchise. You can definitely choose your family

242
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,480
Well, that's a good point trap. Yeah, so really a pointer. Yeah, man family. It's just blood

243
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
No, it's it's oil

244
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,680
car

245
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,720
Oil is the blood of cars a lot of cars and brake fluid, which is the sweat of cars

246
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,760
No, it's the jizzies. Okay drink up this oil for it is my blood

247
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:11,960
I look at that white when she wiper fluid is my spit what what is what body fluid is Corona?

248
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,200
It's Corona's what interrupted the filming of fast furious 10. That's where the current

249
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,120
Okay, so hey so here's how to get your little brother to stop bugging you when he's being a real shithead

250
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,480
Okay, step one give your brother some attention

251
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
The first one is give

252
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,920
Quit give him what he wants what he wants. Well, okay. I mean it would be cool if you guys actually listen and took

253
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Okay, sorry, you're right

254
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,480
Go ahead. I'm giving you attention. It does if I want I need it. I'm so

255
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,260
Okay, so set aside sibling time if your brother is always pestering you while you're hanging out with your friends or chilling in your room

256
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
then then

257
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:04,540
Try scheduling a special time to do something with him. Yeah, like once a week record a podcast together

258
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
There you go. That should keep him

259
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
Satisfied. Yeah, I don't think I don't think they were talking about that

260
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,720
It's like fun stuff

261
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,680
You could plan a specific time each week to do something fun with your brother such as Saturday afternoon when you have free time

262
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,240
I asked him like Thursday mornings at like 10 a.m. Oh, you know what Griffin we have our weekly meeting on Mondays

263
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,560
That's fun, right? That is fun. We do adventure zone, you know now pretty regularly

264
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,200
Yeah, that's fun. Yeah, it's it is it is pretty fun

265
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,180
But you could also do Saturday afternoons. You could ask me what's fun to do and we could come up with an idea together

266
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,520
Okay, Saturday afternoon. What do you want to do?

267
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,360
Probably be asleep. Okay, but that's not really a group activity. Well, we can take naps

268
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,640
Simultaneously separately. I mean they got some suggestions here

269
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,240
You might even begin a weekly tradition such as going bowling or watching a movie together on Friday nights

270
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,760
What are you guys up to this Friday night?

271
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,040
Do you want to watch a bowling movie like alley cat strike or I wouldn't fucking love to watch any cat strike

272
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,120
Introduce him to friends. Maybe your brother nags you to hang out all the time because he doesn't have friends

273
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Well, I mean this one's not true

274
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,080
clearly

275
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,200
Maybe he's shy and has a hard time meeting people if he has friends. He'll be less likely to pester you

276
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,960
So if your friend has a younger brother about the same age as yours plan to do something together so that they can meet

277
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,040
Never set me up with your friends as brothers. None of my friends is have brothers

278
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,440
Yeah, that's a good point. I mean like if you think about it, right think about all my best friends Griffin

279
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, no brothers there. All right. Well, how about this one? You guys should be able to do this one set aside a hobby

280
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Suggest a hobby. I mean don't set aside one. That's not what it says. It says suggest a hobby

281
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
so

282
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,960
No, I'm already obviously doing that help your brother find other interests than bugging you hobbies that your brother can do by himself

283
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,980
Will be the best one to suggest I can't podcast by myself. You all know this you couldn't mod game boys by yourself

284
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:09,800
You can make candy that habit was too expensive and also I welded my flesh to a copy of Pokemon silver

285
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,880
Are we still talking about the game boy or about candy?

286
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,960
I'm talking about the game boy. Okay, and candy is also very dangerous

287
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,520
So again, I would need a non-dangerous one

288
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,960
Or else you could really Johnny Tremaine yourself with some like hard candy very nearly did very nearly did. Yes

289
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,840
Griffin you could get into cosplay. Will you just let him do his bit? I'm trying to help one way

290
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,000
He is trying to help me and in fact because I care about Griffin Justin

291
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Hey guys teach me a sport

292
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Oh, okay. That's a big ask. Maybe I try mirror when you and I tried to learn cricket

293
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, that went pretty good

294
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,560
Maybe your brother really wants it me. Sorry

295
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm gonna start just maybe I really want to hang out at the skate park

296
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,640
But I don't know how to do any tricks if you spend more time with me showing me how to practice

297
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,520
I will be more confident and going to the skate park by myself

298
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,320
I will likely meet other kids who skate and make friends on my own now Griffin. Here's the deal

299
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,800
I will make you I do not know how to skateboard or or skate very well in general

300
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,520
I will watch videos on it and I will learn the

301
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,480
Theoreticals and then I will stand on the ground and coach you on the board at the skate park

302
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,360
That's not what I'm looking for. I want to spend time with you. I'll be with you or teach me a sport

303
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,320
I don't have enough money for a skateboard or basketball sneakers. So you could help me earn some extra cash

304
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,760
Now wait, hold on pay your brother to stop him bugging. It was basically this for instance. If yeah if dad

305
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,280
Offers to pay us for cleaning the garage

306
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
As he is wanted to do

307
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,600
Offer to help me do this extra chore, but don't demand any of the money. That would be cool guys. That would be cool. Like

308
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,520
Yeah, I mean this is a problem is like you're giving your brother what he wants

309
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:58,880
Yeah

310
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,120
Yeah

311
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,000
like I need I have other things that I want to do in my life and I don't want to do these if I had

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,720
Time for my brother. I would be giving time to my brother. That's not help it. This is not helpful and just as a small

313
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,360
Diversion from this every time I have to clean my garage

314
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,640
I finish and I call our dad and I'm like, hey 20 bucks, please and he's like, what are you talking about?

315
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,060
And I'm like, I clean my garage pay me and he's like, that's not how it works. You're 38 now

316
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,760
And it's your garage and I'm like you set up an unfair standard sir. Yeah, that's right

317
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,440
That's trying to imbue in you an entrepreneurial spirit

318
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,640
But basically he just set up a Pavlovian response that when I do a chore dad you should have to pay me

319
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,060
So that does actually say here offer a reward or bribe

320
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,200
So it says here loan me your iPod or let me pick the television show

321
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,080
What?

322
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
That we're watching together

323
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,600
And I'm doing it

324
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,240
You guys never let me you guys never let me watch the stuff. I want to watch. What do you want to watch? Yeah

325
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Really super violent anime like okay really really very okay done. Yeah, we'll watch no no

326
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,360
No guys, don't just agree to it that fast. You have no fucking idea how gnarly this anime is so violent like Avatar

327
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Like Yu-Gi-Oh or

328
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,400
Because there's fights in those like like a little more intense like perfect blue you want to go back to the like twice

329
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,480
Classic twice what avatar does you will barf whoa you'll barf when you see it

330
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,840
I'm talking about vampires like making people I made you that special fan made avatar cut super cut

331
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,400
Yeah, just to fight them and then and Justin added some like red slashes on the screen

332
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,460
Yeah, you added your own blood to avatar, which I thought was super cool

333
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,220
That was protect your space and your belongings help your brother understand help me understand

334
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,860
It's possible me doesn't understand why privacy and personal space is a big deal

335
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,620
Begin by talking to me and explaining why it bothers you that I go through your things every night when you guys are asleep

336
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,420
Hold on

337
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,700
Hold on. I don't take anything. I just go I just go through it just to make sure you guys

338
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,900
Just a sniff or two it's not even a big deal. Yeah, so explain to me why that's bad

339
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,140
Cuz I don't know actually yeah, I don't think there is actually a good reason listen

340
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,460
If someone's gonna go through my house at night one with sleep

341
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,880
I'd rather it be Griffin because if Griffin's there then I know if somebody else comes in

342
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,020
Griffin's gonna be like bark at them and be like this is my territory

343
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,380
I go through the stuff yeah, or I could tell them where all the best stuff is so that they can get it like

344
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,660
Why would you do that?

345
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:40,740
Well if someone's gonna burglarize your house don't you want them to just get in do the damn thing and get out

346
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:47,100
I don't want to have to interface with then why did I let you come in my house and go through my stuff Griffin if

347
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,160
You're not gonna call dibs when a burglar shows up. I'm gonna help the burglar go fast

348
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,500
Yeah, no, I understand that that's my that's the issue. I don't sound like you do oh boy

349
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,180
You know you could if your brother annoys you and bugs you all the time you could do what I've done

350
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:09,560
Which is spend a long time many decades making yourself have like a weird sense of humor

351
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,780
And kind of like what I don't is that funny. I don't get what that is and like you're a little bit weird

352
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460
And maybe give yourself like a weird voice

353
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,660
That's gonna be hard to listen to for a long time, and then eventually your little brother's like you know what?

354
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,000
You know I'm good. I'm just gonna go over here. I'm good. I'm gonna move to Texas

355
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,020
You know something like that, so you're saying that you gave yourself. I'm confused what you just said

356
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,940
This whole Travis that you guys know is a construction because Griffin was so annoying when he was like three years old

357
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,460
Oh, I can't and I was like this stuff. I was so fucking cool when I was

358
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,540
Can you even do your real voice? Oh let me see?

359
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,060
Hey everybody, how's it going? It's not that different. It's me. It's me Travis. It's me

360
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Steven Johnson

361
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,940
Real it's me the real Steven Johnson

362
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Now you're Steven Johnson, not Steve Johnson. Okay. I'm Steven Johnson. I'm over here riding my motorcycle

363
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:17,660
And I'm doing fucking cool-ass flip. Yeah, I would bother the shit out of Steven Johnson would not get a moment

364
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,660
All I do is watch R-rated movies and drink

365
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,660
Some fucking heavy ass amber ale. Steve Johnson, do you like super violent anime? I love super, are you kidding me?

366
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,980
The more violent the better. I mean once where people- Can I have a request that Steven Johnson hang out for the rest of the episode?

367
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm done with Travis. I'm gonna bug the shit out of Steve, he knows. This actually feels way more comfortable. Oh fuck yeah, dudes

368
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,740
Let me take a sip off this cool bourbon, hold on

369
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Wait, is the bourbon, like, some way, like, temperature cold or is it like- It's got sunglasses. I can't believe I'm gonna ask that square

370
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
I thought you were cool

371
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,260
He's right, he's necking me and I'm loving it. Yeah

372
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,100
Take away the temptation if possible. That's essentially what Steven did do

373
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,480
Ask your parents for a lock. Travis did lock, or I guess Steven Johnson locked himself away

374
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,320
To make- It was so dark in there, you guys. In a Travis prison. Where have you been, Steve?

375
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,280
Mostly hiding behind Travis's eyes watching Supernatural

376
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Can you imagine being in prison and forced to watch Supernatural and not say, oh we're starting Lucifer now, great. Oh great, my favorite

377
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,280
No, actually Lucifer is pretty good. Don't knock it, you guys, if you haven't watched it, Tom Ellis delivers

378
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
It feels like Travis's, that was a real Travis thing to say

379
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,440
No, it's fucking cool as shit. He's the devil, guys

380
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:47,360
Oh, that is cool. Yeah, good point. You haven't fucking thought about it. He's the fucking devil. That's really badass

381
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,000
That's cool. Yeah, dude

382
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,780
Yeah, as opposed to Supernatural, where it's just a cool older brother hanging out with his little nerdy brother who won't leave him alone

383
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,560
Fucking sucks. Yeah, I really related to that. Yeah

384
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,080
Can we- there's a next tip here that's really- Oh my god, is he still talking?

385
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Hey, Steve, you don't have to be rude about it because you're gonna feel actually pretty guilty when I do this next one

386
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,940
Uh-huh. Think about the reason your brother me hugs you or bugs you, it says bugs you

387
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,400
I thought it said hugs you because in the image it does look like the little boys hugging the man

388
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
So I will actually keep it my wrong

389
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Interpretation and I want you guys to think about why I hug you. To get your stink all over me. To pick my wallet

390
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,280
Yeah, that's right

391
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,720
Yeah, it's both of them. Talk it out

392
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,240
Talk to me when I try to hug you and you don't want it and you're wearing a badge on your shirt

393
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,200
That says CEO on it. Hold on. Wait, I have to read this. No, it's a phase

394
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,520
You don't want to behave in a way that could damage your future relationship with me

395
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,800
It might not seem like it now, but when you get older, I might just turn into your close friend

396
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,800
So this is you in your CEO shirt and you're thinking about the time that I tried to hug you

397
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,080
Wait, it's a CEO shirt? Well, sorry, no- Can I get an image, Griffin?

398
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,480
Yeah, let me let me do a screen. I know that's not the most conducive to to audio. No, but it's confusing

399
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
It's a good image. This seems

400
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
This seems worthy of posting on Sushi after

401
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Okay, so okay

402
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
imagine a man

403
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,120
Okay, imagine

404
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,080
There's a man

405
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,720
Who is writing on paper and his brother is reaching from behind him and choking him

406
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
But it's more of a hug

407
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,200
Sorry, I walked away for a long time to go get some jerky, but I'm back now

408
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,960
Yeah, whoever that smaller person is is gonna kill that bigger. Yeah, he's choking that but then there's another man

409
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,900
Like so that image is vignetted and then there's another man in front of that image

410
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,880
it's the same man from earlier, but he's a man now and

411
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,320
And he's wearing a shirt like a button-down shirt with a tie and where you would expect there to be like a name tag

412
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
And at a retail

413
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,960
Store, there's just a tag that says CEO in huge letters and then underneath the CEO

414
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:17,200
It says chief executive officer, which is great because it's like hi. I'm in charge here. Hey, wait, what does CEO mean?

415
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Well, let me explain these. Okay, real quick

416
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,240
Travis is back here. Um, okay two things. Maybe the person's name is CEO. You don't know

417
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,000
Because it says chief executive. That might be a coincidence Justin. Oh to clarify it's clear

418
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,640
I'm a CEO well because before he was the chief executive offer he had to have a different thing there

419
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:43,600
But also you can tell by the eyebrows and forehead wrinkles of the memory person

420
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:50,680
He's very surprised by what is happening. This person has snuck up on him to do whatever dastardly deed

421
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,020
They're planning on this man's neck. This is not like a like, hey, I would like to hug you brother

422
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,640
This was like whoa. Oh my god, like yeah, this is a problem

423
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,420
He also looks younger as the CEO and he does

424
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,240
Yeah, he's Benjamin buttoning. I do want to the rest of this isn't as

425
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,160
As as great or useful I think for any of us but the last tip in this article says be a role model

426
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,300
To me I am going I am probably hugging you so much because I want to be like you

427
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,440
Even if I'm being mean to you the fact that I'm paying attention to you

428
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,520
It all proves that I want to be around you do the right thing and show him

429
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,400
how to handle difficult situations with grace and then one day I will thank you and then there is a there's a

430
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,280
Preacher pretty choice JPEG with this one too. I think we can maybe post this one on so she too because it makes for a

431
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
good pairing

432
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
with the other one

433
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Yeah, there it is

434
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
That guy was hiding behind

435
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,960
The vignette in the first one like the memory faded and he was like, yeah, that's right guys

436
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,200
This one is the exact same man with the CEO name tag

437
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,360
But instead of the memory behind him now, it's a very similar looking man in an ill-fitting shirt

438
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,580
Yeah, what appears to be a piece of torn-off tinfoil that he has written CEO in sure

439
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,100
He's about the talented mr. Ripley his ass

440
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah, I just fuck around with you guys cuz I want to be a CEO too one day like you guys are uh-huh

441
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:26,800
I'm not exactly sure what the org chart looks like for our shit now Justin and I are co-ceos. That is true

442
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,600
That's it. And I just want to be that and Griffins are jester

443
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,240
Okay

444
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,520
Dance for me Griffin. Okay, that feels actually like a pretty important role

445
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,020
Business that we have created for us. You know, I know you're funny. Yeah, right Travis. I'm the funny one

446
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,960
And you guys are the business boys. That's fine. I'll wear that badge

447
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,080
The seat the gesture badge the gesture we wear the CEO badges. Yeah

448
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,640
Let's uh, let's take a break and I just want to know if you guys feel like you learned anything

449
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,860
Yeah, girlfriend. I'm gonna completely treat you differently now. I'm not

450
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,780
Oh, that's my I like my treat you worse. Yeah. Whoa. Why?

451
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,140
Well, cuz I kind of miss Steven Johnson

452
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,580
I'm being honest now that we know now that we know what Travis could be if it weren't for my incessant hugging worse

453
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
Yeah by comparison

454
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:33,380
My kids wake up in the morning my kids

455
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
the only thing these kids want

456
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,660
Croissant toast and the only place that I know where to get it is from imperfect foods. So it doesn't matter

457
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,140
about all the food waste they're gonna save saving time on grocery shopping the fact they're gonna send you

458
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,300
beautiful produce that is not quite perfect for store shelves

459
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,100
But it's gonna be just ideal for your dinner table

460
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:05,180
It's fresh and delicious and they deliver it to your home with sustainable groceries that embrace the natural imperfections in food

461
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,340
None of that matters

462
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,740
Because they have croissant toast and you have to buy it from them or your kids won't love you anymore

463

Yeah, so that's where I'm at. See go to imperfect foods calm. Yeah, see if they deliver in your area

465
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,580

You can personalize your weekly grocery order with fresh seasonal produce pantry staples like croissant toast that make your kids love you

And they deliver weekly by neighborhood, which is a unique model that produces

476
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:26,420
I have to and it doesn't matter if it's the best commercial. It's the truth and I am nothing

477
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,180
Okay, if not like Charlie Sheen before me, I am speaking truth to the wow

478
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,980
I don't wait wait what power you want to be?

479
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:41,340
What these advertisers who think they control us they paid us just they paid us to say yeah

480
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:47,960
They think that they and we're supposed to dance like permits. No, thank you. No, we have the dance like pumice

00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,100
Hey, guys guys, hold on. Hold on. Yeah, please

489
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:31,460
It was going really good Squarespace wouldn't want me to say this

490
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:40,220
What if you use Squarespace to make a website that helped people design websites? Oh, Jesus Christ. Can you imagine?

494
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,460
We're not gonna get paid for this not because they'll be mad at us, but because they're not gonna have any money

495
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,460
New better

so

498
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:26,420
Yeah, he used too many different ports and aliases. This is great. We should talk about Squarespace. I call their services

I've never seen a threat in the ad copy before God knows I have

512
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:41,740
I guess all ad copy is a threat of if you don't say these things you will not be paid for the advertisement

513
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,300
That's just a sort of like that threats always looming

514
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:54,660
Hey, were you a reader as a kid maybe you read a lot of fantasy novels or horse girl books

524
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,300
movies and music and books things like sneezing or

525
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,740
the idea of rain

526
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,540

528
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:22,060
How about another question, okay my father Clint McElroy what won't let us get sorry my father

529
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:30,720
Won't let us get chickens despite myself my mother and the rest of our family desperately wanting to raise some we have the funds

530
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,200
The space a big yard in the suburbs and the chicken loving attitude. There is no reason

531
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
He should be saying no and yet here we are brothers

532
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,520
What can I do to convince my father to let us own some hens?

533
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,760
That's from clueless as to why we're cluck less in Metro, Detroit doing hens or chickens

534
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
Go on

535
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,760
It's that Mike I have asked my question

536
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,560
Question hens are chicken, but okay. That's what I asked a hen is a Griffin a hens a chicken

537
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,560
No, not all hens are chickens

538
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,960
Because you know, there are P hens to go with peacocks

539
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,480
And so there are different kinds of hens for sure

540
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,040
But I think we can infer from the question Griffin that they want some chicken hens. What about a rooster?

541
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,640
No, you don't want a rooster. No, they're gonna wake you up

542
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,720
Okay, so you're definitely not getting it you chickens for Christmas Griffin because you don't know anything

543
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,320
Rock a doodle. Come on, man. There's no egg. I understand. Can I can I take your dad's side?

544
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, sorry, but you came to three days. Yep. I'm gonna take your dad's side

545
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,900
You are living like right now. You're living your best chicken free life

546
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:49,960
There will come a time when the chickens are pecking at your hand and they didn't lay eggs and they hate you and it stinks

547
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,520
like

548
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,040
so little but the smell they make is

549
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,000
Unimaginable and you're gonna be cleaning up dookie from these chickens and you're gonna be like God

550
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,600
I wish I'd listen to my dad

551
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,320
Cuz I hate I miss the days before I had to wake up at 6 a.m

552
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:13,880
To feed these stinky vermin and like don't just don't do that. Like don't do that

553
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,140
I have been I've been a kid and I've been a dad and let me tell you from both sides of the scenario

554
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,780
every

555
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,740
Every not dad person will say in the household. Don't worry

556
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,260
I'll be the one to take care of them

557
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
but I'm telling you right now if

558
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,960
This decision is enough that one person in the house

559
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,660
ie your dad is saying no and that's enough to veto it then I'm going to infer that that is because your dad is

560
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,720
The person in the house who responsibility falls to and no one else does it?

561
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,300
Wow himself and he knows that he's not gonna watch and let these chickens just die

562
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,960
Yeah, just go to seed, you know, right while his family ignores them

563
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,320
And so your dad is like, you know, the answer is no because I know you

564
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,160
I'm in love with the chickens. I love the chickens. He won't be able to

565
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,120
Take their eggs. Yeah, it's you or the chickens, you know, I can't care for that many beings all at once

566
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,280
it's you or the chicken I think and

567
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,280
And chickens isn't like a weird high. It's not like I'd like to learn to play guitar. Oh, I ended up not liking guitar

568
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,160
Let's put the guitar in the closet. You can't put chickens in the closet. No, you can't put chickens in the closet

569
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,520
They're living beings. I mean, they'd probably be okay for a little bit, right?

570
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,240
I mean depends on how big the closet is like a coop is

571
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:39,800
You know a closet is a coop without an exit and that's bedding and food and water. That's really that's beautiful

572
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Yeah, I think whoever works on chickens most gets to eat the eggs

573
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,980
Can we at least agree on that? Yeah. Yeah, you earn it

574
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,360
okay, that's all I had to add to the question is like

575
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,000
Tell your dad like don't worry. I'll work on the chickens or else I won't eat eat up the eggs

576
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,800
I don't get to eat up the eggs if I don't work on the chickens. So you have nothing to be scared about is there a

577
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,760
a you know, like a bag of flour

578
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,800
Equivalent that you could be like I'm gonna get a test chicken to prove to you

579
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,400
that I can be responsible for this chicken and

580
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,380
That chicken will not be I don't know what that is because an egg is more on the nose

581
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,100
What's more low stakes than a chicken right? Uh-huh

582
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:38,180
Uh-huh, uh-huh. You could get let's see what's what's a bird you could get that if all else fails would definitely take care of itself

583
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,140
That doesn't exist pigeon birds are famously kind of weak needy

584
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,380
Yeah, I feel like a pit like vultures, right? Oh

585
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,180
You get a vulture to show your dad how good you would be at taking care of a chicken. Yeah

586
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,580
Yeah, I don't think if there's anything wrong with having a vulture at your house

587
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,740
And I will say this right now if if my family

588
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:08,740
Started being insisted on chicken and I was like no and they're like, what about a hawk? I back. Hell. Yeah, like that's yeah

589
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:15,100
Yeah, that's a bird of prey. Try like you're not gonna love you're not gonna you are not gonna love that

590
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,820
Are you telling me that I Travis McRoy?

591
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,780
Would not enjoy having a hawk land on my outstretched arm and gaze

592
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:31,220
Upon the neighborhood with me as people walked around like doing their thing or whatever as I and the hawk both, okay

593
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,620
Yeah, that's a beautiful dream that you have

594
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:40,180
Uh-huh as opposed to the hawk like eating your balls through your pants because it's a bird of prey

595
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,420
And you have you have not I'm wearing a codpiece Griffin

596
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,220
Did you not hear me say that the hawk would land on my outstretched arm?

597
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:54,000
Do you think I'm doing that without a codpiece? Come on, that's hawk raisin 101

598
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,460
Read a book. Did you refer to your penis as a hawk raisin?

599
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,780
What does that even mean? No, it's my balls my balls are hawk raisin. Okay

600
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,500
Cuz they're all dried out from the vasectomy

601
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,100
All right

602
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,060
Let's be cool here and say like here's how you can convince your dad to take care of these

603
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:21,520
Chickens for you when you get it and don't take good care of it name it after your dad dad, Jr. Oh, that's good

604
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,480
Yeah, yeah, this is my this is my chicken Bryson. Isn't your dad? Yes

605
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,740
It's a beautiful tribute Bryson senior is also a good way to go like

606
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,060
Junior put like this is my dad's dad a chicken. That's cool

607
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:44,380
Yeah, name it after your dad's dad and then it'll be like well, I can't get rid of dad. You know, you know, I bet okay

608
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,640
This is a like I bet you can foster a chicken

609
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:55,740
Wow, that's cool. I bet you can have a foster chicken that you don't have to be long-term responsible for

610
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,980
but you could have the experience of owning a chicken until someone else adopts that chicken and

611
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:07,400
Then you go back to the chicken-free household how boy howdy though that the interview process

612
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,240
You will fall in love with this chicken the interview process

613
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:19,600
Required to make sure that this person is not like a secret man-wolf. Do you know what I mean? Like? Oh, yeah

614
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,560
Question one you're not a fox, right? Well, why would you even huh?

615
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,200
That's not a no

616
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,120
I'm offended you would even ask see how my tail is twitching in an offended way now. Wait a minute. Wait, hold on

617
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
Anyway, I'd like you to meet my wife

618
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
What did you just

619
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,980
Wait, are you a fox married to a wolf? Yes. We're very progressive

620
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,280
No, but in my example the

621
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,520
What wait, hold on in mine

622
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,360
Yeah, one of the people was a fox and then you said awoo, and I was like, okay, so that's a wolf

623
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,520
I mean, what were you think that the Fox could make that noise if it was no a fox goes

624
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,860
You know that I love that fucking song

625
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,840
There's don't get chickens just fucking do Valley and a dozen chickens in there virtual chickens

626
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,880
I don't know. I don't know that you want. Oh giga pain

627
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:30,200
Head on over to backyard chickens calm and head on over the forums and read some of the horror stories in there

628
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,520
You don't want this. You don't want this life. Can you read this something? Are you there right now?

629
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,520
Yeah, okay, cuz there's no way you would have pulled that website without actively being on it

630
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,600
I could see Charlie or I was asking for chickens and Justin has done this research previously

631
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:50,400
Yeah, I mean just to give you like the top form third right now is I killed my rooster today

632
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,120
It broke me Wow. So like why did they do that? Doesn't seem like you should have done that

633
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Do you want to know why sort of for its incredible eggs?

634
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:07,320
Today it's a rooster. Oh, and why would you kill it to get the eggs? They're not all inside there

635
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
They were stuck not coming out

636
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,800
They needed they needed they only lay one egg a day, but I needed two and I knew that

637
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,320
Hey, no rooster. The eggs are not coming out of this rooster. I'm gonna have to go in there and get them

638
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,040
Yeah, so roosters are illegal with this person lives. So where do more chickens come from then?

639
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:35,920
I'm not gonna read this story. This is a personal story for so but they have like there's threads on here where people just update

640
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,680
This is so sweet. They have threads on here where people just update like here's what's going on with my flock and that

641
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,200
Fluffy butt acres has its own

642
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,480
Fluffy butt acres

643
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:56,440
Has a forum thread and you can enjoy it all. All you need to do is make a little time to read all

644
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,840
8,000

645
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,540
714 pages

646
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,080
pages I

647
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,080
Thought you were gonna say posts

648
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,480
page

649
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,480
There's eight

650
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Thousand

651
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:16,880
Seven hundred and fourteen pages of discussion about fluffy butt acres

652
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,840
Is it a real is this a real thing or is this like a blazeball sort of situation?

653
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,320
No, I mean that would be act actually amazing

654
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,080
But no, it's not that it's just

655
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:37,120
8 people follow the drama. So like I killed my rooster was like the capper of

656
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,800
That's not on fluff. Okay, I was gonna say roosters are not illegal in fluffy butt acres

657
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
but like

658
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,200
Geez

659
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,400
Are you lost in the sauce a little bit right now, but oh my god guys. I got it. I got a pull

660
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
I

661
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
Want to be free free

662
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,800
I want to break free

663
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Free

664
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,960
Hello, welcome to much squad. It's weird

665
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,560
Munch squad used as a flotation device. Yes. I have pulled the lever. Yeah, I've pulled the the the strap and I'm

666
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:25,200
Hurtling towards the surface and hopefully a lifeboat will pass by and scoop

667
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,920
Munch squad bins if you go a little too fast out of chickens

668
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,320
There's not really one the Munch squad for both of us jack

669
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:38,800
The lifeboat to pick me up will be piloted by Warren Buffett because our first story is about Dairy Queen

670
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,800
adq is

671
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:47,040
Coming with the biggest menu rollout in 20 years. They've got him. It's time for

672
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,540
stack burgers what

673
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,680
It's time for stack burgers like two patties

674
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,160
They're stack burgers because it's like these burgers are like a stack of things

675
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,840
What a stack of things is a stack of wait, so yeah

676
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,920
there's a usually like bread on the bottom of the stack and then they have like toppings and meat and

677
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,840
Cheese and bacon and stuff and then there's usually bread on the top of the stack. Oh

678
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,140
a vertical a vertical burger a

679
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
horizontal vertiburger

680
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,120
Yeah, like it's things are stacked on top of each other like a bun is at the top of the bottom

681
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,800
And then the toppings are between the bun hats

682
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:35,600
That's really interesting because it's so messy when they put all the burger stuff out in a row instead of a column

683
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Yeah, and I also I never know in that scenario. Am I supposed to assemble something with this?

684
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,480
Do I eat it piecemeal like wait, where do I start? You don't want to be?

685
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,760
You don't want to be some sort of glue, right? It's just sort of flaunt right? Yeah

686
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,020
I'm way better than a large pile burger too. I don't care for those loose pile burgers

687
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,400
Our hot food menu served at DQ Grill and Chill restaurants is

688
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:07,180
key to our business goal to become a balanced leader in both food and

689
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,260
Treat items. So what they're saying here is that like, you know how

690
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:16,820
The only time anyone has ever seen a burger at Dairy Queen is when they're looking at the menu

691
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:20,580
They're like, oh weird. They have burgers here too. I'll have to never try that

692
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,860
Anyway, can I have a Butterfinger Blizzard now?

693
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:30,020
How dare you besmirch the chicken basket are just as good as the cool treats Justin and I know I know listen

694
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,020
You know, I fucks with the chicken basket

695
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,820
They got gravy in there? You can't get that anywhere else

696
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:43,240
We know that means innovating and expanding our everyday food offerings and the new signature stack burgers go beyond

697
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,100
Typical cheeseburgers that you find at Quick Service. Okay, here you go

698
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:54,320
What Troy Bader is saying here and admitting tacitly is like much like the Dairy Queen on Fifth Avenue

699
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,180
You could be waiting there for like 30 minutes

700
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,820
Even if you're just trying to get a Sierra Miss after Taekwondo class, you know, it takes forever

701
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,260
It's not quick service slow service

702
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,940
They got five varieties that are gonna keep fans coming back for more

703
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,740
They're created as an everyday offering to defeat burger boredom

704
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:20,780
Wow, these signature stack burger menu comes in five flavor varieties in the US

705
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:28,860
Yeah, they got one pound one third pound doubles and one half pound triples and they got a bun and B

706
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,580
Sure, and I mean I could tell you what the burgers are, but honestly, it's just like

707
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:41,380
Who they're taking a victory lap? Yeah for making up burgers and not side-to-side burgers is what it seems like instead

708
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,720
I want to step over here real quick to memory lane

709
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:50,140
to remind everybody of the one time when we went on tour and it was Riley's birthday and Riley was with us and we passed

710
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,300
My a Dairy Queen we went there to get

711
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Lunch and we're like, we'll get a cake because it's Riley's birthday

712
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:01,980
So we got an ice cream cake and when you take them right out the freezer, they are boulders. They are solid stone

713
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:07,640
Yeah, and so we had to ask for a knife from the people we had the way metal one

714
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,260
Yeah real a real knife which was a fun ask to be like hey

715
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:18,620
give me like a real ass kitchen knife employee and then we had small slices of cake and had oh

716
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:23,700
Oh, let's say seven eighths of a cake left and at one point

717
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,260
We tried to give it back to the employees to say you can eat that again

718
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,700
It's not a refund seven eighths refund

719
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:37,100
We said this is for you and the crew to eat if you want it and they looked at us rightfully

720
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:41,580
So like we were monsters. Yeah, we don't want that back. What are you talking about?

721
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:45,420
You know, we have access to any of this stuff whenever we want right like

722
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:51,140
It's not a gift. It's a burden. It was why and then I think we walked around to

723
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:55,860
Like the two other tables of people that were there and said do you want any of this cake?

724
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:01,700
It was one of our lowest moments as a family and had to be her most special birthday ever

725
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:08,900
We know our fans are looking for cheeseburgers that offer big flavor and premium ingredients that keep them coming back for more

726
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,900
So what they're saying is daredevil fans are looking for burgers that they get

727
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,540
Fucking yeah, I can't stop thinking. Yeah, the signature stack burgers meet that craving

728
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:21,340
I have one other very quick story to tell you about Subway brand

729
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,140
No

730
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,100
Subway brand is expanding into consumer goods categories. What like yes

731
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:36,940
Okay, so they want new and exciting ways for fans to engage with the brand across multiple retail channels

732
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,180
so I mean

733
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:45,540
Bioworld merchandising is gonna make a wide range of apparel and accessories. That's wild

734
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,260
to me, but I

735
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,620
guess

736
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:57,740
Subway on it. You are more than welcome to do so. It's the next one that I have a problem with

737
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:07,060
Um, uh, Zuru is making collectible toys, huh? Now I can only think of one character from the Subway

738
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:23,980
That would be a collectible toy and I don't think you want that heat I don't

739
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,940
You know what? No, I don't believe so. I don't think you want the bad man

740
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:34,060
No, I will say this the bat the bad big pet man. No, no, no, but if you could

741
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,900
reignite the 90s

742
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,740
fervor for

743
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:43,860
Non-human characters with abs and do some like different like Subway sandwiches

744
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:51,460
Anthropomorphize with abs and like different or different sandwich related weapons. Forget about it. I'm going wild. Call me

745
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:57,340
They call me Subway. I'm a I'm oh my god, dude. I'm so into that. Are you kidding?

746
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:04,260

Doing a role-playing Subway restaurant set out where kids can serve their favorite Subway sandwiches and serve them to friends

757
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,820
God, my kids are fucking

758
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:07,540
Then you got me so excited because I thought you're gonna say a Subway role-playing game like a Subway RPG

01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:14,900
Pin and paper fuck that would be out of this world. I'd be out of this world. So so keep an eye out for Subway

773
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
Would be so unpalatable
