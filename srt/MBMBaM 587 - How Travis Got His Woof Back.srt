1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,220
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Better it's better

8
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:09,500
It's better it's better with you

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:17,340
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother

10
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:25,940
Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis big dog. Woof woof McElroy. He's back. He's back on that horse

11
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,940
Good job, Trav. This is Griffin McElroy the youngest one of them guys. We've got a watch

12
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,620
I'm really excited a big-budget rom-com movies are back. They're back coming back on times day

13
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,580
2022 I could say just like movies for adults, you know

14
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:52,100
Films are back shit. They're back. Marry me starring Jennifer Lopez aka JLo and

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,720
Owen Wilson aka Oh will and I'm so excited

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,640
Classic pairing. Oh my god, guys. Let me tell you this is a by the book right down the line

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,400
Thank you classic story, right? So here it is JLo. Can I guess can I guess actually?

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Okay, marry me a story of

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,640
Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson. They are at a wedding venue in Vegas like a

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,840
Cineplex of wedding venues and they're getting married but then they look across at the other venue

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,500
like across the hallway and they see each other and they're like want to switch and so they switch

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,980
Married this is starting to feel like a Stanley Kubrick. Yeah

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,020
Psychosexual in your first experience are their partners also cool with this. Yeah, they love it. Oh, they're cool with it

24
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,020
They definitely like it. Hmm. That's actually less

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,040
Less than the actual marry me plot

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, then but then Owen Wilson and JLo they were originally gonna get married

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,920
They switched and now they have to find their way back together. Oh, right. Oh, they were originally gonna get married

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,880
But then they have to go through two very messy divorces and that sort of legal

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,360
Battle is what occupies most of the runtime of the film. It's like Kramer versus Kramer versus Kramer versus Kramer

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,880
No, which is the alternate title screenwriter John Rogers of leverage and magicians and a lot of other fame wouldn't deliver such a

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,640
Let's say milquetoast plot as you've just outlined Griffin the marry me plan

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,720
You know, he's a family show right what yeah I did no I know he and I talked about this movie last night

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm legitimately excited about this. Okay, so here's what happens. Hear me out

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,440
Okay, JLo big famous musician big like famous famous famous

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,320
And she is gonna get married to her fiancee on

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,120
Stage in front of like the crowd and a live stream of 20 million people while they debut their new song

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,880
Marry me but just before the concert. Oh

39
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,320
Also cut to Owen Wilson single dad his friend Sarah Silverman

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,760
Convinces him to take his teenage daughter with them to go to the concert, right?

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,520
Just before the concert JLo discovers that her fiancee has been cheating on her

42
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,840
So she goes on stage by herself and she's like I was supposed to get married

43
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,600
But you know, sometimes things happen. She sees Owen Wilson holding a sign says marry me and she goes, okay

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
Yes, and then they get married on stage

45
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,280
Wait, what just like right then just right then baby and that's the beginning of the movie

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,360
That's the beginning of the movie. What happens next then they have to fall in love. Oh

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,880
Marriage before the love but see here's the thing Justin. Here's the thing

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,920
She's super famous and he's like a math teacher or some shit. So he's not boring

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,920
He's not ready zilch. No one cares about exactly and he's not ready for it

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,280
And then people are live-streaming and they're like he looks like he's in math club and he's like I am in math club

51
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Cuz he's a fucking dork. Oh

52
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,680
I wouldn't why not call this movie nodding thrill. Oh

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,760
Like she leads this thrilling, you know rock star lifestyle

54
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,640
And then they get married at first sight another real television show on the Lifetime Network. Thank you very much for that gift

55
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,680
So like I this sounds like an exciting film, but I've seen about 11 seasons of it

56
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,560
Well, here's the thing. I I assume that they haven't given everything away in the trailer, which is a very good trailer by the way

57
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
So maybe I don't know there might be like a zombie attack in it or something. Oh

58
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Can I give you a different just to spin it a little bit?

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,800
She looks out and sees someone in the audience and she's like fuck it

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,280
Yeah, let's get married you and Owen Wilson's like yeah, and he gets up on stage and she's like no not you

61
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,680
Oh the big the big the big hunky boy right behind you and it's been who should walk. It's it is the

62
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,000
The hunkiest boy Vince Vaughn classic current movie. Yeah

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,240
They're back together him and almost the dream team fucking dr. Hardbody Vince Vaughn

64
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
And that's and that's gonna be

65
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,680
But then Owen Wilson so embarrassed

66
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,900
but there's another person in the audience that sees sad Owen Wilson on stage and is like

67
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll marry you and then we're getting closer back to the plot of my original pitch for marry me

68
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Um, can the person who then is like I'll marry you be a bigger like more famous star than or stronger or harder body

69
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,640
Even stronger harder body. No one's stronger or harder

70
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,740
Than Vince Vaughn. Yeah, you're right. Maybe it is also Vince Vaughn. It's Vince Vaughn's twin brother twins Vaughn

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,440
No, a real quick. I come I came up with a new bit. Is this called lightning round impression?

72
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,760
Okay, Oh of Owen Wilson. No, it's yeah, it's like we all go around we have to go in a circle anybody can call

73
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,620
This at any point right, but it's a lightning round. I'm only explaining the rules once

74
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,220
Okay, okay lightning round. You just call it and then everybody has to immediately do their impression of the person in order

75
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,240
I called it so I get to go last. Okay, good. Who are you calling? Is that Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn? Oh

76
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Let's start with a neutral. Oh, okay. You want me to start? Yeah

77
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm all right. Oh me. I'm all right. I'm a Royal Tenenbaum. No, you're not even trying

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,440

80
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,320
And then I'll do my Luke Wilson doing an Owen Wilson impression which I'm okay

81
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Okay, come on big. Come on big blue. It's old-school time. It's pretty good

82
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,400
Here's my fuck. That was Luke. Well, I did loose. I did fucking Luke again. What's Owen Wilson look like?

83
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,680

92
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Thank you, you know what Griff yeah, I had it in my heart and I didn't think it would land

So I thank you for going there because it's put me in the headspace to just give you up. Yeah, sure

Who gets to pick the next one? This is fun. I like it now. That's it

95
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,520
Yeah, it's just somebody comes up in conversation. Oh, right, right anybody can call it

96
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,320
Whatever cuz it's like I feel like if we're gonna start referencing these people we have to prove our bona fides

97
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,720
Yeah, so expertise or else we're Joe or else. What do we even do? What are we doing here? Yeah

99
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,380

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,940
Do we we the people whoa?

101
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,460
Hey brothers, I

102
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,740
Lived the end of the hallway in my apartment building next to each door is a wall socket

103
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,840
Someone put one of those plug-in air fresheners next to my door, but no analysis. Oh

104
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
man

105
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,660
Wait, hold on, but no one else's I don't think my apartment stinks. No trash or

106
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,400
Unkempt kitty litter or anything and the hallway and building doesn't smell bad. So I'm gonna loss here

107
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,340
Do I leave it and have everyone think my apartment stinks? Do I remove it?

108
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,660
Did I put the the landlord put it there? Was it a rude tenant? Help me. That's from putrid apartment in Portland

109
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,900
P.s. If it matters. Thank you for this. Yes. Thank you for this

110
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,940
Because you could have just kept that quietly to yourself and been worried about it like internally like I don't know

111
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,700
But and it says you chose to tell us and tell the world

112
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,040
Thank you need to you need to pretend like we're the doctor and you're like I do have this weird when I move my arm

113
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,500
Like this it makes me barf. You know, it's like and then you don't want to leave the room be like should I have told?

114
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,020
If you're gonna tell anyone about moving your arm and it making you barf it should be a doctor just to be clear

115
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,420
Yes, if it matters, it's a generic flower smell. Yeah. Okay, you know what fucks this up for me is a by the way

116
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,220
I remembered another Wilson impression someday. Somebody's gonna come around

117
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,300
That Wilson Wilson that's Wilson Phillips Wilson Wilson Wilson Wilson

118
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,540
Alright, so what fucks this up for me is that they live at the end of the hallway?

119
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,900
If it was in the middle of the hallway, you could say oh they just placed it there for maximum

120
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:06,700
Dispersal of the flower scent you live at the end of the hallway that is covering at best, you know

121
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,500
Ten feet. It's like just for you. It's only for you. There's no other argument

122
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,820
I'll tell you what has to be because of something you did

123
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,460
I'll tell you what I'm worried about what I'm worried about smell acclimation

124
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,820
Where you get in there and you're like, whoo, something smells bad, right?

125
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,260
But then like 20 minutes later, you're like, oh, I guess it went away, but it didn't go away

126
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,100
It's just faded into background smell for you, right?

127
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,180
And then somebody like else comes in like what smells so bad and you're like what?

128
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,060
Oh, no, right like this is what I'm worried about is this might not even be your fault

129
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,860
You might have an inherently stinky apartment that this landlord knows is a problem, right?

130
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,140
That they were hoping you wouldn't notice when you're in it

131
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,340
I think that's why when you came in all the windows were open

132
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,860
Right when you first moved in because he knows it's stinky in there, right?

133
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,900
There's some kind of like smell poltergeist and that smells never going away

134
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,540
And now he's just trying to give you a big boost of smell as you walk in

135
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,940
So you won't notice it every time and complain because he's not gonna open up the walls and get whatever is in there out

136
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,180
I'm such an old man when I read this all I could think was like who's paying the bill for those outlets out there?

137
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,060
Oh boy. Yeah unattended outlet. Who's picking that up? Are you are you paying the electric bill for the

138
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,460
Air freshener someone saddled you with hey, wait, hey just life hack if each apartments paying for their own

139
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,540
Just plug in an extension cord in someone else's outlet and run it into your house

140
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,260
Yeah, how were everything off of one power strip my dude free power

141
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,140
You can power the hot plate your parents sent you and your guitar amp. Hell. Yeah, the whole everything, dude

142
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,260
Yeah, man, your keys down the people waiting by the payphone even better, dude

143
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,140
Just rewire an outlet so it goes out the wall and set into the wall, right?

144
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,620
And then move out of the apartment park your van right next to the apartment building run an extension cord up to that outlet boom

145
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Free power it couldn't have been easy. It couldn't have been easier. That's what they won't tell you. I know this hack

146
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,460
They don't know I don't know how your place smells, you know

147
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:14,680
Yeah, they say that I heard a life hack that if you're gone on vacation for a while when you

148
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,760
Um get back pay really good attention to how your house smells because that's how it smells to guests

149
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,920
Where'd you hear that life hack Justin probably on tick-tock. Yeah, probably and it's like

150
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,840
Okay, but what I do with that, you know, I mean, yeah, it's just my house has a smell everybody's house at the smell

151
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,640
Well, that's why I remember JW Neal's house had a great smell cuz he was the richest kid. I knew yeah

152
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,000
And like that was a baker. Yeah, man his house smell great

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,120
And then like he would come to school and his clothes smell though his house. Oh, yeah. I'm like, how do you smell rich?

154
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
That's amazing

155
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,480
That's why I mean for me it was if I smelled gushers and like you guys got

156
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
Yeah, if they had like gusher if they maybe it was just like a

157
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,160
Psychosomatic thing we're like I saw them have Pringles and gushers in their lunchbox and I was like damn

158
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,900
So whenever I go to their house, I'm like, oh, this is the Pringles and gushers kids. It was fucking great in here. Yeah

159
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:14,220
I got a knockoff star crunch in here. Yeah, it's labeled crisp disk. I've got

160
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
Gushers in here. Oh, no

161
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
Hey, what do you want to trade

162
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,180
Three out loud I exclaimed gushers and I got a pixel to the school psychologist

163
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,460
Counselor you're going to

164
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,800
Jarrow DC, but it's but it's not again

165
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,420
Really good if you try them you get used to

166
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,960
Box gushers you get used to after a while. Fuck. Yeah, I got I got a hot pocket Pringles and gushers

167
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,500
What'd you get Griffin? Um an uncooked raw egg and prompt prong ease and

168
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,340
gushers

169
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,900
If you eat them all together if you get it all in one bite, it's pretty good raw egg and prong ease

170
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,320
I'm sure more liquid filled and no one knows why yeah, it don't leave the factory that way

171
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,340
That's the surprise. It keeps you guessing

172
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,820
Can you go to your landlord and say it's a medical?

173
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,340
Stink and that you can't do anything about it

174
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,460
This just makes it worse you upset the medical stink when you try to get rid of it and it comes back in full force

175
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,620
My wife would flip if somebody did this because she's got allergies

176
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,040
I know my wife. Yeah, she hates Richard's thing. My friend Richard sink because

177
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,540
Because it bothers her allergies and I read her. I

178
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,380
Told her she didn't have to worry about that until our first episode of winter when he'll be back

179
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,580
Like frosted the snowman, you know, I'll be back someday. Yeah, but every season only quarterly

180
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,340
Yeah, he does our financials. Yeah, he'll do like a financial report with investors

181
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,780
and talk about, you know, even on

182
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
some of the other

183
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,460
You know ROI to the big names big hey, can we

184
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,540
Can we supplicate ourselves and in front of the Wizards?

185
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,500
Marriage, thank you. Okay. Well Gwilliam sent this one in. Thank you. It's

186
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,720
It's a wikiHow article it was there's always a thing that says author info

187
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,320
But it never like actually says who the offer the author is. It's just sort of a collaborative team effort on behalf of

188
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,040
How anyway, this is how to be perfect

189
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,040
Parentheses kids teens. Oh

190
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,680
And it makes me feel bad

191
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,700
This article does because pretty much everything on it. I

192
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,400
didn't

193
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:50,040
Do or even attempt to do so that makes me think that I was a real stinker of a kid teen

194
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,680
Because these steps I just never it would never be stuff I was interested in like step one make your bed as soon as you

195
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,600
Wake up. Okay. Now wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on when you say many children many children don't often do this

196
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,840
So it'll be a nice present for you

197
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,600
So you're saying how to be perfectly behaved for your peers not how to be the like perfect like no

198
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,640
Get to more stuff

199
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,680
But like you've got to have a launchpad and making your bed immediately in the morning the second you wake up

200
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,120
um

201
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,800
Like you're frightened of the bed and you must clean it so to leave no trace of yourself

202
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,520
Which including the last line in this this little article this this part of the article check for any stains or lingering odor from your pillow

203
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,800
Case bedsheet or blanket and toss them into the washing machine. Oh, so every morning then

204
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,800
Every morning that I can't make my bed immediately in the morning because I have to wash

205
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,960
Pretty much all those things pillowcase bedsheet here. Are you watching again? Yeah, I'm perfect. Yeah

206
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm doing a perfect job. I left a small stain

207
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,960
I left a small stinky stain and you guys shouldn't have to interface with that Deborah and Mike

208
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,720
You guys have a lot on your play. I'm watching my bedding a lot

209
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,600
Now, yeah

210
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Your bedding is like a promise you made to yourself that you're worth it

211
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,240
You know what? I mean? Yeah, go along. No one's will ever say this is a life hack. They don't they don't know

212
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
I know this

213
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,040
No one will ever say anything about it. You know what I mean?

214
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,520
But you must you must as a gift to yourself wash your bedding. Yeah, that's true

215
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,880
Not none of my friends are coming over to hang out and being like oh man

216
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,920
Is that a new glass and did you wash your bedding?

217
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,680
Like nobody people will notice almost all other laundry you do right if you don't do any other laundry

218
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,720
But this is the one where it's like it's for you. You know me like this is laundry

219
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,200
Sure, like when I wash my toilet paper and put it back out. Everybody appreciates that like, oh, did you wash the toilet paper?

220
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,400
That's nice, but no one ever noticed this when I changed the bedding, you know

221
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,680
Cuz then I put the duvet over it anyways, right so you don't even sometimes

222
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,480
I just leave the sheets off there and I like to rub around on that weird silky feeling top of the mattress

223
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Yeah. Hey, you guys are

224
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,220
Not perfect kids or teens. Yeah, like you have only covered a single facet of it. I wish you guys

225
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,480
Very next one number two prepare a nutritional breakfast

226
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,920
on

227
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,840
the there's a picture and it looks like just a slice of uncooked bread with

228
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,640
It looks like a hundred basil leaves spread across it with a sunny-side up egg on top of the basil leaves. Yum. Yum. Good morning

229
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,880
Whip up a bowl of porridge with plump juicy berries cinnamon nuts and whatever you like on top that will keep you full until lunchtime

230
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,600
Don't be tempted to eat those sugary cereals not a big fan of porridge

231
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
No

232
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:40,240
Bus there are plenty of but there are plenty of other healthy breakfast options to choose from like egg bread leaf toast

233
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
Hey, it's like leaf toast egg egg

234
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
leaf toast

235
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,800
Like biggest disappointments of being an adult and there's so many of them

236
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,440
But one of them is I really thought that when I became an adult

237
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,160
I would just know what a quote-unquote balanced breakfast was

238
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:01,480
Because it seemed like a thing that everybody talked about on TV all the time and then I'm 38 now

239
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,440
And I'm still like does that mean like bread and fruit? Does that mean I gotta have some OJ in there?

240
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
They only used that phrase

241
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,360
when talking about

242
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,080
Cocoa Krispies or whatever because they'd be like make sure you eat it as part of a healthy balanced breakfast my cocoa

243
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Chris what is it balancing out? What's the other side right?

244
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,000
Counteract that by eating just a fistful of Metamucil and ride that shit right to school

245
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,680
You're gonna be high as a kite all fucking day

246
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,320
They're gonna balance the highs and lows man. You can't just do the cocoa because he's got hit that with some quaker oats

247
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,080
You got to bring yourself down with with

248
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,520
Clean up after yourself wash the bowl spoon and cup and put it in the dishwasher again

249

251
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:58,200

252
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,520

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,440
Fuck Monday's sweater or something. What if it has an asterisk instead of a you? Oh

Great area here. I don't know. There's more perfect stuff pack everything in your backpack, etc

266
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,480
Pack a healthy lunch

267
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,880
Okay, just make it if it's a lunch you like but it's unhealthy make it healthier by using less salt oil fat and adding

268
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880

00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Healthify that hey mom

271

This is the second time that it is mentioned doing your homework for the day

278
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,200
Number nine go to your room and change out of your school clothes

279
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,280
Hang it up in a place that's nice and tidy in your heart into a bag. See a little life

280
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
What are you talking seal up a bag and seal all of your farts?

281
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,520
You must do this bury them in the backyard at night. So no one sees

282
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
I

283
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Eat your dinner make sure it's floppy sloppy hog slop. Just kidding. It needs to be

284
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,020
Remind me what we're trying to achieve with perfect child. So sure Justin work how to be perfect kids

This is gonna cover you from like age 4 to 19

287
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,080
This is a good 15 years of your life that you need to be doing the bacteria that accumulates on your parents like a plank

288
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,920
Yeah, can we agree? We're all parents in this call if one day my child started doing these things

289
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,360
I'm like, oh no, they killed someone they're red

290
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,160
They're flying as low off the grid as a child possibly can they did some fun shit?

291
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,680
The best part of eat your dinner is if you can't eat your dinner anymore

292
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,920
Give it to one of your siblings and take smaller portions next time. Awesome. Cool. Hey, does anybody want my

294
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,800
I want you to I want you to have this for me now and for the next I have to say once again

295
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,000
I got two kids if we be trying to pull that shit. I was like, I'll just give this the dot

296
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,480
I'd be like, that's not perfect eat it. That's not perfect at all. You must eat this you must have this

297
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,440
And then read a book for a while

298
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,400
If you can't go to sleep set an alarm to go off an hour before school starts so you can get ready

299
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,120
Huh? I feel like my entire like primary school going career

300
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,600
I made a game out of how little time how close you can I give how close I can cut it

301
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,080
I wanted I wanted to make sure I left a window so I could watch a pop-up video in the morning before catching a bus

302
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:57,000
But other than that, yeah, absolutely. I had that when I was in college. I invented a class before

303
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,280
My world history class that I could be pissed off at every time I showed up late to world history class

304
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
Like oh this fucking guy you wouldn't believe it

305
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,320
Again with this fucking shit this guy and the fit the literally like probably tenth time

306
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,880
I did it. The teacher is like I'm gonna need his phone number. I'm gonna call this teacher. This is gone. This is

307
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,680
Ridiculous. I'm like, oh no, he would he's you don't know this guy. So I'll take care of it

308
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,160
He'll cut you down in the streets. You don't want to mess the last teacher. They did that dead

309
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,360
Yeah, his name's Carl real guy

310
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Real son of a bitch

311
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,160
There's some real cool extra tips on here

312
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,480
But the best one is magazines and TV are fine in moderation

313
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,680
But you should try reading novels or other nonfiction texts truth can be stranger than fiction. It's true. This is my perfect son

314
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,960
He's gonna play with you guys today. Cool. We're watching Pokemon. Oh, you know, does anybody want to read infinite chest?

315
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,320
Audubon's guide to birds and that's kind of like real life

316
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:11,920
Oh, come on, we're playing fortnight idiot. Um, actually I'm perfect. Oh, no

317
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,000
What did you have for breakfast this morning huh chicken nuggets and pudding

318
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Oh, hold on I gotta go change clothes

319
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,000
I think these gotta get it slip into something a little bit. I'll close the mother must not wash them. I

320
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Have special clothes that I'm allowed to sweat into

321
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,880
Special rubber sweat free clothes. There is there are no community questions on this the community read this article

322
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,840
They're like, yep. Got it. Sounds good. Sounds good. Yep. Don't expect to be perfect in one day. It'll take time

323
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,920
Well, that's a shitty like excuse. That's it

324
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,360
I need to start being you can't tell me how to be perfect and then I knowingly continue to be unperfect

325
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,520
I have to immediately there's nothing in the right track couldn't just change in a day

326
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,180
Right. There's nothing complicated here

327
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,960
But I do like Griffin this article because it now begs the question what the target audience is

328
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,880
Because if there's a child who wishes to be perfect, they're probably already doing these things

329
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,760
And so is there an imperfect child though? There's like there's got to be a better way

330
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,000
Every morning. I just eat some absolute dog shit. I'm wearing these stinky old clothes for six days in a row. This can't be it

331
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,300
This whole article was written by an incredibly overbearing parent to relieve other incredibly overbearing parents who like get on Google one day

332
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,880
and they're like, I mean Jimmy's got straight A's and the body of an Olympic athlete, but

333
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,880
Is he perfect though? They should have titled it like how to be the super coolest kid

334
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,120
And then that one kid with like the really nice haircut will think you're cool

335
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,340
And it's just all these things and it's because that's that's the only way a kid is ever gonna buy into this

336
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,240
Absolutely how how Connor can become the

337
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,440

338
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,320
Yeah, you got to stop smoking Connor that's on that is on there sorry well

339
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,000
I think it's a high time that we take a break. Thank you. We're working so hard

340
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,600
Yeah, it's hard work and it's time for us to earn our money. Oh

341
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
It's in the money zone. Okay, come on

Good place to get it in the sidecar. Okay, I'm in there's two of there's two of them one on either side

343
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,840

344
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
It's cool

345
00:28:50,840 --> 00:29:03,120
I don't know if you've noticed when you shut the

368
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,480
Right. I was paying such a high markup at the website store

369
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,040
And then I thought I'll just do this myself and then I thought I don't know how to do this myself

370
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,800
Oh, why did I say that out loud in front of the website store guy?

371
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,440
And now he's looking at me like oh you're gonna design a website yourself and I said, yes smart guy

372
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,000
I am and so then I went home and I listened to a bunch of podcasts and I heard about Squarespace

373

397
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I

398
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
Was on a zoom meeting with my boss and around five other people and my boss was sharing her screen

399
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,720
She clearly forgot because I watched in horror as she pulled up a chat window to me

400
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,640
And started talking smack about another person on the call. Oh my god

401
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,120
Nobody mentioned anything and the meeting just awkwardly ended with nobody saying anything about it

402
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,760
But my boss still seems completely unaware

403
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,160
That her screen was live

404
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,360
My question is do I mention this to her after the fact so she can make amends with this other person?

405
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
Or do I just let it go?

406
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,960
I have to work with this other person

407
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm, pretty sure it's going to be awkward now, even though I didn't respond in the initial chat while everyone was watching

408
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,640
Irrelevant. Hmm. I think very relevant but also shameful

409
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Yeah, I would say semi-relevant

410
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,040
It well it is your boss, right? You don't want to be like actually

411
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,440
Victoria is a friend of mine and I

412
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,680
Think that she does not have a silly first name and I think that you're being rude

413
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,920
Yeah, no, i'm saying the fact that you did not chat back is irrelevant because in liktoria's mind

414
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
She's like oh, so they go. Oh, yeah

415
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:36,240
Yeah, no one sees that especially like while a meeting is still going on and thinks this is the first time they've ever done this

416
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,240
I think you have to go to liktoria and be like that's pretty fucked up. What was that all about?

417
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,200
Does she does she talk bad about me to you?

418
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,460
Yeah, this is gonna have to be like when you play your parents to go to a sleepover

419
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,420
And you kind of got to play you got to play both sides of it like when I used to go to mom

420
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,800
And then I would go to dad and both times i'd be like I want to go to a sleepover

421
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
And that didn't work because it was nothing

422
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,240
So maybe this is you hadn't got an invitation

423
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,740
You're just expressing that you wish you had been invited to a sleepover. There's very little they could do about that

424
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,380
yeah, I would go to dad and I'd be like

425
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,660
Mom said I could go to a sleepover and I'd do the same thing to mom

426
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,980
But then both of them would talk to each other and be like son

427
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,260
You didn't get invited to a sleepover and then I would have to be like

428
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,860
Yeah, I did a real cool one. So this is going to be more or less just that exact same play

429
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
hmm

430
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,500
I

431
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,820
I think you're probably lucky that no one is ever paying attention to a zoom meeting ever. Yeah, that is a good point

432
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Yeah, no one is lucky like if someone starts sharing their screen with me

433
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:53,300
That is an open invitation to go to another tab and check my fantasy football scores, right?

434
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:00,500
This is okay. Absolutely. Okay. Sorry. I'm trying to make the short show more relatable to a broader audience. I'm trying to

435
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:09,460
Everyone just heard a different uh activity that I could have been doing. It's it's uh algorithmically generated for you. Yeah, that's awesome

436
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:16,820
Nobody said anything right nobody even like reacted then no one was paying attention because if that had happened

437
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
anyone they would have done like a uh

438
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,220
um

439
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,540
No, no, they would have saying completely much what?

440
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,540
Because they're not getting dragged into it. They're not gonna be going to a party to it

441
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,980
Yeah, this is this is a we're playing werewolf at this point because there's like there's no way of knowing

442
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,600
Who knows what but for me it's more about percentages

443
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:43,000
There's there's six people on this call, right? Oh, no, no, no wait the question asker the boss

444
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,440
And five other people so there's seven people on this call, right? Yeah, don't think about yourself or your boss

445
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,000
There's five other people that could have potentially seen this and you know, I mean if liktoria saw it it's game over whatever

446
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,760
So there's four other people that if one of them saw it, you know, they're going to tell liktoria. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay

447
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,640
Okay. Okay. The next time you see liktoria, you need to do some leading like, huh? What a meeting, huh?

448
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,120
Or that meeting, huh?

449
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,440
But if liktoria knows like if liktoria knows that it was your boss chatting to you

450
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
She is going to be aggro crag

451
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,400
From the from the start of that conversation, maybe you're just like poof that meeting

452
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
right and like yeah

453
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,080
Do you have

454
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,240
This is why hr does exist though

455
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,440
You know

456
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,840
Like this is this it shouldn't be your unless you are hr. Or if your boss

457
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,480
This is a whole nother or if liktoria's hr

458
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,280
Oh, that's hey liktoria, I just wanted to complain about

459
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,040
I have an issue I need to bring to you about uh, this person I work with let's call her victoria. No, wait

460
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,960
Um

461
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,880
Jesus this is a bad you've got it

462
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,800
Okay, take it to hr assuming one of the three of you is not hr if you're hr

463
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Then just consider it resolved

464
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,720
Yeah

465
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,800
You have to get you have to get a different job or addresses. I think there's two options. Oh and this economy

466
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I know I know

467
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,920
Try not to fuck it up next time so bad. I guess this is a learning experience. Good luck with your new part your new employment

468
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,840
Yeah, but then you get the different job and you're in a zoom meeting

469
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,680
And then the boss of the new job is talking to one of his flunkies and he's like

470
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,280
man

471
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,840
Gregory sure sucks shit. I heard he quits whenever he sees some dank shit

472
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,080
On a screen chair. He doesn't have a real coward kind of a world competitive role of auto detailing

473
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,920
This dumb shit just can't keep his mouth shut, huh? And then like there's no winning in that one

474
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:56,280
If this ever happens again and god forbid it ever does when you get that message sent to you you respond something along the lines of

475
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,960
Uh, who is this or I think you sent this to the wrong person or what good joke. Hahaha. That's another good one

476
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,640
Oh, is it sarcastic day again? That's a good one

477
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,720
Oh, oh go to lectoria and say like pretty funny, huh? You did you buy it?

478
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,520
Uh, did you see like that was a prank? We okay hilarious prank we did

479
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,920
I can't believe we were waiting to say something so we could be like, ah prank time

480
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
But then you're gonna have to get your boss in

481
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:32,280
On the like it was a prank and there's no way they're gonna be able to like pull that off like yeah

482
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I'm into pretty transgressive stuff

483
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,040
I think some real i'm on i'm on some real andrew dice clay shit

484
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,080
I think once you introduce them like hey, you fucked up real bad, but we can turn this around

485
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,160
I just need you to stay with me on this one. Okay, following my lead we can fix this

486
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,280
Mm-hmm. That's I tell you who's fat is really in the fire here. It's your boss who's yeah

487
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,960
Just let it be because yeah, listen lectoria might be a little pissed at you

488
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,800
But a much bigger issue is the person in charge just like hey

489
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,520
This fucking girl over here. Am I right?

490
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:12,680
Right in front of like the entire zoom call your damage is minimal

491
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,480
You could just you should if it had been if you've been thinking quickly you could have been like

492
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,280
What a great joke boss. I love saying that about a person that we really care about

493
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,760
Yeah, just as a good respect so much because we'd never say that in front of them on a zoom call

494
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,760
It's a it's past that point now though, right

495
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,220
So now you're gonna have to get help of all of your other co-workers

496
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,180
And we're reaching yes pretty gaslighty territory at this point. That is probably a bridge too far

497
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,420
but if you can get the rest of your co-workers to casually drop in conversation like

498
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,140
Oh derek and the boss. Yeah, they're the real like hearty boys of the uh of the

499
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,980
I don't think the hearty boys are always pranking people, right?

500
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,340
They're the real jerky boys of the skype. You know, the jerky boys were the ones who solved crimes

501
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,300
Yeah, I got them flipped and switched just a little bit

502
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,740
uh

503
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun

504
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,740
I was wondering

505
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,300
Burger burger burger burger burger burger burger burger burger burger burger. I want a much

506
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,820
God, I hope it's a burger because you just said burger a lot burgers. I want to munch

507
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,180
Welcome on squad's podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

508
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,980
I wanted to wait until we did a second question because I have so much fucking shit to go through

509
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,660
this month the segment is back and better than ever and I

510
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Normally, I would not burn this many things in one episode, but there's so much to cover. Honestly. Okay

511
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,260
Did you guys hear that? DJ Khaled is doing a wing

512
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,580
Thing he's doing a wing thing

513
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,940
Another wing is what it's called. Wait, what?

514
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:56,540
Yeah, dj khaled's doing a wing store of a chicken wing restaurant. It's a virtual concept called another wing

515
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,780
and it's um

516
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,460
It's a dj khaled. Um wings. Is it a wait, but i'm the time the name

517
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,980
I don't understand why you're confused legitimately. It's dj khaled does no I get that. Hey, that's not the thing

518
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,420
I'm trying to figure out if another wing is a play on words or some kind of it's a it's a play on another one

519
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Of course it is another

520
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,700
Another one dj khaled. Okay, but that's it but it's more like another thing than that

521
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:26,860
That's no but travis is dj khaled says another one. I know that

522
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:32,300
That's but it's just one of his great sayings, but then you just switched one whole word. That's not a play on words

523
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,420
You just changed one word to a different word

524
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,140
Like just real quick. I have so much other shit to go through. This is not even the story this week

525
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,380
I just want to tell you guys the flavors

526
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Uh un-un-unbelievable buffalo. Okay, don't quit nashville hot, huh? You loyal lemon pepper

Honey, honey hot sriracha and the signature. They don't want you to win truffalo. Wow

528
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
I'm a little lost somehow

529
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,100
You can or you can order a la carte

530
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,300
Or choose from combos like the all I do is wing

531
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:11,820
See now that's good your key meal. All I do is wing is amazing play on words another wing

532
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,100
All I do is wing

533
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,420
Maybe would have been a better. Yeah, but i'm not here

534
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:23,820
To get I bet all I do is wing was the first thing they came up with like before even the concept of a restaurant

535
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,140
Like he was yeah, he just said it wrong one day and they were like, well, let's do wings

536
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,340
Did you excuse me? Khalid? Did you say all I do is wing? Uh

537
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,580
Yeah

538
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,940
It's um

539
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,860
A combo a rest. It's a restaurant. I'm doing you're doing it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

540
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,640
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I didn't misspeak. It's a restaurant

541
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:53,120
Um, I I wanted to just tell walk you guys through some of the um, thanksgiving offerings from brand eating because you know

542
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,560
They're not content to let you eat at home with your family. Nope

543
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,000
um, and there's a there's a kind of different varieties there's like some people are doing like

544
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,480
Stuff for you to if you want to bring the flavor of fast food to your dining table. A lot of people have that for you

545
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,400
Thank god this year

546
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,760
7-eleven is celebrating the season with the thanksgiving turkey sub boy

547
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,920
It's packed with butterball turkey sharp white cheddar cheese and cranberry mayo

548
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:26,960
I'd fuck that up the debut of 7-eleven signature stuffing flavored roll. You read that right? The roll is stuffing flavored

549
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,640
What's the role the role of the bread roll sandwich? The bun is a sub. It's a sub the bun

550
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,280
Oh bun is stuffing flavored and it's the debut of it and I would have to also imagine is the finale

551
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,880
Well, but it's a grand finale because like what are the applications beyond this thanksgiving sub stuffing is 90 bread and like

552
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:52,480
rosemary and sage anyways, yeah, so they put some of that in there whatever it's branding but whatever man

553
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,480
Um, the there's a lot to be thankful for this year says verisha sharif the 7-eleven fresh fruit product director

554
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,840
We know how much our customers look forward to our seasonal offerings

555
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:08,240
And we're delighted to contribute to the fun and spirit of thanksgiving with satisfying food that reminds our customers

556
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,360
Of those comforting holly day moments. So just uh, just a quick reminder

557
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,880
Uh, the spirit of thanksgiving is like coming together with those you love

558
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,380
And be a family or found family to share an experience together. And so here is a sandwich you bought at 7-eleven

559
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,240
Yeah, if you want to be reminded of better thanksgivings while you're sitting in the passenger seat of your ford fiesta

560
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,960
Because there's because the driver's seat is too stained

561
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:40,160
And uh, this is the sandwich for you and it says here what would a thanksgiving turkey sub be without a side of chips, huh?

562
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Oh no, you fucking

563
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,780
Tell me what is it with the side of chips? It's an all new experience

564
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
If we are trying to normalize

565
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,440
My son hates all thanksgiving food. So if we want to start normalizing throwing some

566
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,200
chips

567
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
on the table, too

568
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,800
Have your have your stuffing have your corn, you know salad and all of your other wild

569
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,880
Not ordinary foods on thanksgiving put some chips in there. How about the dino shaped chicken nuggets?

570
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Thank you. Oh my god. Yes

571
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Hey, why are there turkey nuggets get my five-year-old in the mix?

572
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,840
Don't oh, we're very close to the beef nugget discourse again

573
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,800
Which I would rather take 10 steps away the honey baked ham company is rolling out some holiday meal options

574
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,360
Wait for thanksgiving because stay out of this honey baked ham. No, are you kidding me?

575
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,840
You can't find turkeys except for handbag. Yeah, that's how to get them what?

576
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,160
Yeah, it's like a turkey shortage behind big ham. They'd know a guy who knows guy

577
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,720
There's different options here

578
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
um, and for the season host

579
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,520
There's a signature ham and turkey feast that will feed all guests with leftovers to follow and you can choose from some fine

580
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,320
And sides like a cranberry walnut chutney or or a green bean casserole

581
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,000
And then it says here my mouth is literally watering here is

582
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
for a small party of ham lovers

583
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
That's not what we call ourselves

584
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,560
Honey, honey, what should we put on our wedding rsvps? Um

585
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,560
Um, we want it to sound pretty casual. Can we call it a small gathering?

586
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,160
Doug I said we like to pork to pork

587
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,840

Try honey baked bone-in quarter ham meal what it's a quarter ham

589
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,800
imagine if you got a small party of ham lovers together on this on the the

590
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:41,280
Agreement that you were all ham lovers and you unwrapped a delicious quarter of a ham for everyone to enjoy

591
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:47,120
As as the four of you huddled in the darkness lest you be exposed as you enjoy your quarter ham

592
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,920
Yeah, meet at the sign of the ichthys and there we we shall consume

593

our beloved ham

594
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,680
For the traditional holiday host wait, what's that? There's a fleck of something in the corner of your mouth. Is that is that turkey?

595
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,440

usually

649
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,080
like

650
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,080
People who come up with thanksgiving food. It's sort of a rising tide

651
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,680
lifts all ships situation and not a

652
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Hey, what's up? It's us stuffing

653
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,640
Like you need to you guys work together whoever wrote this hates turkey and assumes everyone else quietly does too

654
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,400
And we've all just been looking for an excuse to like pull the ripcord and get out

655
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,760
But everyone's been too afraid to leave the way but not alice crowder alice crowder's like hey, let's fucking say it

656
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,600
We all know stuffing's the star right for too long

657
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,240
We're all just waiting for stuffing

658
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,840
Um the last thing it says here oh boy

659
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
um

660
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,800
This crystal recipe was introduced in 2014 and has been a fan favorite over the holidays

661
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,640
to create this

662
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,840
Get some paper

663
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:22,800
To create this stuff and pin to create the stuffing recipe guests should purchase one steamer pack of 24 crystals

664
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,040
if you can imagine that it's like a small like sliders basically

665
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,200
The recipe serves between 10 to 15 people and requires 20 of the square burgers

666
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,640
Your calculations are wrong. There are intentionally an extra four crystal burgers for the chef

667
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,960
So they can enjoy a little treat. That's just standard practice

668
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,240
They'll go to any restaurant and like if a chef makes you a steak they cut off just a little bit of the steak and eat

669
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,840
It themselves just enjoy a little treat for their work in the kitchen

670
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,760
And that's awesome because like your family's gonna be like, uh, hey, tommy

671
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,880
When's uh, when is thanksgiving food gonna be ready and you can be like five minutes ago, idiot

672
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,880
Go idiot

673
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,520
Um, the recipe is great because it says uh, the directions are

674
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,880
Enjoy four crystal burgers now. Oh boy. Okay, then place the remaining 20 crystal burgers

675
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,800
Without cheese or pickles and oh god, we should have mentioned this earlier. I already bought them. Oh, no

676
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,620
No, god. Oh god. Don't put cheese or pickles in the stuffing

677
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,660
You put in the refrigerator you let them cool overnight and then you brush a casserole

678
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,860
Dish with butter or cooking oil or spray with non-stick

679
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,420
It's a spray with non-stick spray

680
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:44,260
Tear the burgers into bite-sized pieces and place in a casserole dish and then you pour chicken broth over. Hey mom

681
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,180
Are you okay?

682
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,820
Yeah, honey. I'm just tearing the crystals apart. It's just

683
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,220
We just love it if you would come in and spend some time with the family. You've been in here a really long time

684
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,700
I'm hold on the next step in this recipe says barf a hundred times

685
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,820
God, these look really good

686
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,400
Of course, it does eat tiny hamburgers covered in chicken broth

687
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,660
Hey guys, just hold on one second guys

688
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,540

00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,100
I was I was trying I was trying to drag this

690
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:24,740
This I was trying to drag this image of stuffing over in the slack so you guys can see

691
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,840
And I actually drug it into my recording interface

692
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,420
I accidentally dragged it into my da and so now there is a track

693
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,140
There's a track on this episode that says stuffing

694
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:51,800
252 pixels, huh? Why did you let me do that? So now we have a message heading within

695
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:59,560
Yeah, it'll show up in the itunes metadata. Oh fuck is it it that's weird just because in the middle of this episode

696
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:05,560
It it just I heard a fourth track going burger mess burger mess burger mess burger mess

697
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,840
It did it like 20 times and I thought it was a a possession

698
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,800
I don't actually this this may be the first time juice actually

699
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,360

705
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,000
Uh, I think i'm pretty sure I see pickles up in here or unless you have to also cut up celery in there

706
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,840
I've dropped in also just so you can see for point of reference if you had to pick the most delicious looking

Maximum fun.org comedy and culture artist owned audience supported

799
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:32,060
Do you sometimes wonder whatever happened to the kids at your school who really loved star trek?

800
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:37,420
You might remember a kid like me the one who read the star trek novels and built starship models

801
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:41,900
I also took music classes to avoid taking gym classes that required showering after

802
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,020
But I don't see what that really has to do with or a kid like me

803
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,700
I introduced myself to kids at my summer camp one year as wesley

804
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,900
But when the school year started and some of those kids were in my new class

805
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:57,500
I actually had to explain to my friends that I had tried to take on the identity of my favorite star trek character

806
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,340
The shame haunts me to this day

807
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm sure some of those star trek fans from your childhood grew up to have interesting and productive lives, but

808
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,660
We ended up being podcasters on the greatest discovery

809
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:14,300
You'll hear what happens to two lifelong star trek fans who didn't grow up to be great people

810
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:19,980
They just grew up to be people who love jokes as much as they love trek season four of star trek discovery is here

811
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:26,080
