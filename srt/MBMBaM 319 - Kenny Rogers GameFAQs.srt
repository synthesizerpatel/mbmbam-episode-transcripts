1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,640
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Brother Mean Advice Show for the modern era. I'm your oldest

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,280
brother, Griffin McElroy. This is the best idea we've ever had. This is a bad idea.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,520
It's Trolls Watch.

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
Trolls Watch. It dies cast.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Nope. Stop. You guys have to put your fucking backs into this bit, or else it won't work.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,160
Griffin, did you not hear me say, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep?

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,960
That was mostly for Justin. This is solid gold we've got on our hands, all over our hands. It's

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,800
molten gold on our hands like Johnny Tremaine, and we've gotta respect it.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,480
Let's be legit here. It's a two-hander. Well, who are the two stars in this? Is it some B-movie

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,720
watch show? No, fuck you. It's Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake starring in this movie. That's

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
fucking roll gold right there. That's good stuff. Hell yeah, dude. That's Hollywood gold.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,880
Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. So you know there's gonna be some singing up in this?

20
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,200
You know there's gonna be at least three to four songs in this movie, Trolls.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,840
At least on average 3.5 songs.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,160
Justin, engage us in the Trolls watch. Get in on the bit.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm trying to get in on the bit. You guys are leaving such little room for me to just like,

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,960
get deep. What are you most excited about the Trolls movie, Justin? Go.

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,800
It eventually ends. Well, okay, hold on.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,280
No spoilers, but I heard it's finite. Trolls are back.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,320
I heard Dreamworks had developed a sort of procedurally generated movie technology,

28
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,560
so you can turn on the Trolls movie and it just goes forever because the movie's making itself

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,720
as it goes and you kind of follow the Trolls along from their life and then to their death

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,960
and then it moves on to new Trolls.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,360
Let me talk about some of the other adaptations of Trolls that Trolls has to follow in the

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:44,480
footsteps of. One such example is a reskinned game that was originally called Dudes with Attitude

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,560
that was modified into a game called Trolls on Treasure Island.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
Instead of just reading this Wikipedia page about Trolls things that there have been,

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,640
Justin, I want to, this thing's just not, this whole vehicle's just not gonna fucking work.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,720
If you personally aren't excited about Trolls, so I want you to tell me about what your favorite

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Trolls thing is about Trolls. Mike Mitchell co-directed this film with a person named Walt

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Dorn. That means Mike Mitchell was looking at the scope of this project in the alpha stages

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,440
and he said, this is too much for one man. I cannot steer this ship by myself.

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,040
Justin.

41
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,840
Yup.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,160
Tyler McElroy.

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,240
What the fuck? I'm not fucking around anymore. Now I'm getting mad.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Mm-mm. What the fuck do you love about Trolls? Not the movie, the whole brand.

46
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,560
The very concept.

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
The concept of the Trolls, Justin. And I swear to God, if you tell me one more fact about the

48
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,880
Trolls movie that you're just gonna make fun of out of hand before the Trolls movie's out,

49
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,160
I'll quit the podcast. So the stakes are high. What do you love about Trolls?

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,320
I like the, I bet they all have-

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,720
Please use love. Please use love. Please use love.

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
Okay.

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
Please love Justin. You know the tagline, please love Trolls.

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:22,560
I think that I love something about them that they all have their own sort of quirks. You think

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,160
that they just all be the same. You like that they're bespoke individuals, but each one has a

56
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:36,400
soul and an individual set of likes, dislikes, and allergies that make them a unique creature

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,680
in the world.

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Now, Justin, I hate the papu now that you're finally actually showing some love for the

59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Trolls. It's a pretty big jump to jump straight to them having souls. I don't know if I'm

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,640
comfortable with that. Listen, I love Trolls as much as the next guy.

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
I love Trolls so much.

62
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,120
But I don't know if Trolls go to heaven, you know?

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm going to start hitting you, Travis. This is a quiz that's just invented to

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:09,600
build anticipation for Trolls, the movie of Trolls. I'm just going to start naming characters

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
and you're going to tell me if they're real or fake.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,520
Why does Travis get to do it? I want to do the Trolls quiz.

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:24,560
Oh, well, alternate. We'll alternate and I'll give Griffin stars and he has to tell me if

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,360
they're real and I'll give Travis Trolls and you guys have to keep your own score.

69
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
Good. Travis. Yes.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Doogie. Real.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
Fake. Fuck.

72
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
Flincher. Real.

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
Fake. Okay.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,960
Gorge the Unkillable. Fake.

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,640
Now that one's real. That one is real.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,280
And in the movie it's played by Alfred Molina.

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
DJ Suki. Real.

78
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Yes. Okay, that is a real one.

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
Griffin. Are you ready?

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
I'm pivoting. Okay.

81
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm pivoting. Steve Buscemi.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,320
Steve Buscemi is a real man in the world, yes.

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
No, is he in the movie or not?

84
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Is Steve Buscemi in this fucking movie?

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,400
I don't know if I'm supposed to know if he's in the movie.

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
Is it not enough that I know that Steve Buscemi is extant?

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,680
Real.

88
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Real. He's a real man.

89
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,080
But I'm saying like, give me, let me know if he's in this fucking movie.

90
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,560
I mean, here's the confusion point.

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
Steve Buscemi is just 200 Trolls wrapped up in a trench coat.

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,320
Yeah, do you mean is Steve Buscemi the actor playing a character in the movie

93
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,600
or does Steve Buscemi as a character appear in the movie?

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
Is there someone playing Steve Buscemi?

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
Is Steve Buscemi playing Steve Buscemi?

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
No, you've taken too many tries at this sentence, Travis.

97
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,600
You just gotta bail on it.

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm out.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,720
I don't know if Steve Buscemi, I don't know if Steve,

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
sorry, I gotta do the correct Italian pronunciation.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,160
I don't know if Steve Buscemi is in Trolls, but I do know that Trolls is him.

102
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,120
Yep.

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,400
Okay, what about Ron Funches?

104
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
That's not a real, that's not a real man.

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,320
We played Overwatch with Ron Funches.

106
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,440
We played Overwatch with Ron Funches and he's in this fucking movie.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
So I'm excited about Ron Funches' participation.

108
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,960
As am I about the, the fucking cast of this movie is amazing.

109
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,480
Russell Brand, James Corden, Gwen Stefani.

110
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,200
Real, real, real.

111
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
I've seen her on The Voice, I know she's real.

112
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,480
Christine Baranski, John Cleese taking the very real risk

113
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,160
that this will be his last film.

114
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,480
Jeffrey Tambor, like they're so, Anna Kendrick, they're so, like this,

115
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,280
this thing's a galaxy of stars.

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,600
The night sky is dark because all the stars are in Trolls.

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,520
And that's why I'm so fucking rock hard for it, Trolls.

118
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
I am fucking rod hard.

119
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,680
November 4th, I know what you boys are doing on your birthdays

120
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
and that's getting a fucking, just a Trolls load.

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,160
I'm gonna do my hair up.

122
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm gonna cosplay.

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm gonna put a little jam in my belly button.

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,600
You're gonna remove your genitals completely.

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm gonna remove my genitals.

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm gonna really define my butt crack.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,040
The movie, this, the movie has cinematography by Yong Duk Joon,

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
according to Wikipedia.

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
So Yong Duk Joon, I have one question.

130
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,320
Where are these fucking Trolls, my dude?

131
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,680
Don't hold out on me.

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,640
You've been to their home.

133
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,280
You've filmed them.

134
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,400
Where are the Trolls, Yong?

135
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,920
Where do you think the Trolls are where they live?

136
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
Where do you think it is?

137
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,760
Yong knows.

138
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,520
I don't have to envision this.

139
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,760
I don't have to imagineer this.

140
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,120
Yong knows.

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
He's cinematographer.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
But he'll never tell.

143
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
He'll never tell.

144
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,720
I bet it's like Nicaragua.

145
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,280
I bet he fell in love with a Troll woman there.

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,320
I bet he married a Troll woman.

147
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
But he couldn't bring the Troll back to America.

148
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
He couldn't bring the Troll back to America because of laws.

149
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,560
So instead, Steve Buschimi had to smuggle that,

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
his Troll wife out of Nicaragua.

151
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,920
He made his Troll wife Steve Buschimi's heart.

152
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,520
I love this movie that we've written Trolls 2.

153
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,560
Hit me up, DreamWorks.

154
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
We got the sequel already.

155
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,720
It's gonna be a multimedia piece with animation,

156
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
but with real life Buschimi.

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Like Osmosis Jones was.

158
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
One of those.

159
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
There's a Troll skateboarder,

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
and it's played by Ricky Dillon.

161
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
He's a YouTube star.

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,440
Nice.

163
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
Should we do advice?

164
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Hold on, I wanna watch the Trolls trailer.

165
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll give you minute by minute reactions.

166
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, but Trolls is coming November 4th.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
November 4th, 2016 to a theater near you.

168
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,800
See you there.

169
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,320
We'll see you there.

170
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,400
We'll be in every theater simultaneously.

171
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,200
We've paid for a hologram of us to be in the front row,

172
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,280
just like losing it.

173
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,720
Losing our fucking minds.

174
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,520
Should be good though.

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,160
I mean, it has-

176
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
Please read a question.

177
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,360
I trust Ron Funches.

178
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
It seems like it'll be a fun-

179
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,480
Yeah, Ron Funches is my co-pilot.

180
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,960
You know what I mean?

181
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,360
That's what it says on all my shirts.

182
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,920
Crap.

183
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
I work in an office,

184
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,800
and one of my coworkers has a habit that drives me crazy.

185
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,360
Every time she walks by the open door of my office,

186
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,640
which happens several times per day,

187
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
she apparently feels the need to peer in,

188
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,920
just get a good look at me,

189
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
before I continue on her way.

190
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,440
She only lingers there for about two seconds,

191
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
never says anything,

192
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
but it makes me very uncomfortable.

193
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,840
Yeah, dog.

194
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Is there anything I can say or do to make it clear

195
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,840
that this is weirding me out without being mean?

196
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,440
That's from a self-conscious intern.

197
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
The one piece of information we have failed to receive

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,240
in this question is,

199
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,160
what look is on her face when she does this?

200
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
Is this a look of like,

201
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
is she perplexed by your presence?

202
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,520
Does she look like she's memorizing every detail?

203
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,560
Is she amused by you being there working?

204
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
Like, what is, or is she just like,

205
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
oh, huh, he's still here.

206
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
And then going on, huh, still here, huh?

207
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
It's just, I just think some people

208
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
it's just being a nosy, rosy Perez.

209
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Just a nosy Parker.

210
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
Like some people, there's just nothing you can do about it.

211
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
Like, they're not checking you out.

212
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,160
They're not checking you out,

213
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,400
and they're not making eyes at you.

214
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,960
They just gotta scope out the scene of the whole office.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,840
Is it possible that at one point

216
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,080
you did something very cool in there?

217
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
Did you at one point do something like,

218
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
so choice, like some sort of, I don't know,

219
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
what would that be like?

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
Oh damn, I walked by Mark's office and I looked in the door

221
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
and he was doing a fucking 900 right there.

222
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,160
It was amazing.

223
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
He went off the desk 900 in the air.

224
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
He boneless Christ aired it.

225
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,320
He ordered a 12 of boneless Jesus with Buffalo sauce.

226
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
It was the tightest shit I ever did see.

227
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
And never again.

228
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,880
Get a nose grind.

229
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,360
He did like astral projection and I could see another Mark.

230
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880
There was the Mark you and I know,

231
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,600
and then there was Mark sort of like spewing it,

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
and he was just like floating.

233
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,160
I walked by and dreamed a dream of infinite Mark

234
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
and I could see Mark as far as my mind would allow.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,600
And ever since that day, I've just craved that high again.

236
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
And Mark has withheld it from me.

237
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
But one day I shall catch.

238
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,520
Yeah, here's a question.

239
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,920
Does your coworker like lower their sun glasses

240
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
and go like, oh yeah.

241
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,440
I mean, maybe every time this happens

242
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,520
you can just look at them and go, how am I doing?

243
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,480
And like, or like, what do you think?

244
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
And maybe just see where they're at.

245
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe they're just waiting for you to engage with.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Maybe, ooh, maybe this person really wants to be your friend

247
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
or like make some kind of connection with you,

248
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,280
but they have no, like they don't know how to instigate.

249
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,440
And they're like, if I just kind of like make my,

250
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
if I put myself out there,

251
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,600
they'll take the other half a step towards me,

252
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
metaphorically speaking, and they'll engage with me.

253
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
And then we can become friends.

254
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
Hmm.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
Or they're gonna kill you.

256
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,040
Or they're planning to kill you.

257
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
It's one of those two.

258
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
What's their job?

259
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
Hey, have you ever clarified what this person's job is?

260
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,880
Maybe they're insecure.

261
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
Do they even work there?

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,960
Are they insecurity?

263
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,920
Maybe they're just like being very thorough,

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,720
making sure there's no threats around you.

265
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,400
You know, you can, if you're a ninja,

266
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,520
you can be a potted plant,

267
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,840
like pretend to be a potted plant very well.

268
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,480
The army has all kinds of tech that they know about

269
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,200
where they, you can like hide on a brick wall or whatever.

270
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,520
Camouflage.

271
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,320
That's a good point.

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah, like they're just checking out to make sure you're safe.

273
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,720
You're welcome, by the way.

274
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,600
I mean, not that you've ever been there before.

275
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe they were standing around the water cooler

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
and they heard someone go,

277
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
you know, I think I'm gonna kill Mark later.

278
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,640
And they were like, what?

279
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,840
Not today and not tomorrow.

280
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,000
But at some point when he least expects it,

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
I will be there like a grim specter

282
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,760
waiting to gobble up his soul.

283
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
I hope no one is looking when it happens

284
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
because they'll be the only ones able to stop me.

285
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
I think I know what the situation is.

286
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,280
Uh-oh.

287
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,040
I think we have a little man situation on our hands.

288
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,880
The Wayans Brothers vehicle.

289
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay.

290
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,840
Because in that movie,

291
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,440
in that horrible movie.

292
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
In that horror movie.

293
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm gonna use the Wikipedia description.

294
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
Calvin Babyface Sims, Marlon Wayans,

295
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,840
is a very short convict.

296
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,960
Did a jewel heist and hid the gem somewhere.

297
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,760
That, anyway, the whole thing resulted in him

298
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,040
having to pretend to be a baby and Jesus.

299
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,000
Problematic.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
Problematic to the max.

301
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,160
But I think what happened here, jewel heist happened.

302
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,960
She had to stash the gemstones in your office somewhere.

303
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,840
And so she always comes in and she's never found a window

304
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,720
because you're always in there.

305
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,200
You're a workaholic and a dunkaholic.

306
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,320
And you're always in there.

307
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,000
Working and dunking.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
And she always pokes in and she's like,

309
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
are my gemstones still?

310
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,360
Fuck, Mark's still in here.

311
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,120
Mark, I've had to work at this job for like seven months now

312
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
and I'm getting really good at it.

313
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
But I need to get in there and get my gemstones.

314
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,280
Is it possible it's a big situation?

315
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
And she's been made big.

316
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,040
Oh, fuck.

317
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
She's been made big.

318
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,120
And she thinks that there might be a Zoltar machine

319
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,520
in somebody's office, but she's not sure who's.

320
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,160
So she-

321
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,480
Are you an intern at a Zoltar machine?

322
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
Are you an intern at a Zoltar repair place?

323
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,040
Are you yourself Zoltar?

324
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,080
Okay, wait.

325
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
Oh wait, hold on.

326
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,320
If you're Zoltar, you have to tell us.

327
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
Are you Zoltar?

328
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,240
Because if you're Zoltar and your office is a box

329
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
that is in the hallway,

330
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,400
you can't be surprised when this person who has been bigged

331
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
looks at you every day

332
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
because they're thinking about the decisions they've made

333
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,640
and if they're ready to go back

334
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,600
or if their work on this plane of bigness is done.

335
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
That is how the movie works.

336
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,400
He couldn't go back to small until his work was complete.

337
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,560
I'm sorry.

338
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,200
I can't shrink you again, Tom Hanks.

339
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,480
You haven't completed the task I presented you with.

340
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,320
Why haven't I shrunk?

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,080
So we've considered the little man possibilities

342
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,520
and the big possibilities.

343
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,600
Is there an average person movie?

344
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,200
Maybe it's a meet Dave scenario.

345
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,640
I was thinking meet Dave.

346
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,880
Why is that my average size?

347
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,520
Because that's about tiny people in a normal sized body.

348
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,200
Okay, wait.

349
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,680
Nope.

350
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Got it.

351
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,680
It's not a meet Dave scenario.

352
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
It's a Dave scenario, okay?

353
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay.

354
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,400
The sequel to Dave.

355
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,520
You've met Dave.

356
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,000
No, no, no.

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's the one where Kevin Kline is an impersonator.

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,840
That's just called Dave still.

359
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,640
No, I know, Justin.

360
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,520
I know it's a different movie,

361
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,360
but it's still definitely in the Dave-a-verse.

362
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay, so this person is an impersonator

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
of the original person that walked by your office

364
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,640
who's currently in a coma in a secret bunker.

365
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,360
Under the building, the very first day,

366
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,240
the day before she was emerged in the coma,

367
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,880
she did take a long look at your office,

368
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
but just like happenstance, like she just happened to do it.

369
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,120
But the imposter who is now in her place saw her do it

370
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
and believes that that's an important part

371
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,680
of her everyday ritual.

372
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,560
So it is not that the person has anything to gain.

373
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,400
They're just trying to complete this illusion.

374
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
So nobody, for the good of the country,

375
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
that nobody suspects that that is not actually Susan.

376
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
It might also be a Matrix scenario

377
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,440
where every time you see Susan stop and look,

378
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,680
that's actually a weird deja vu moment

379
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
where something has changed within the Matrix.

380
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
I would suggest checking windows

381
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
to see if they've become bricked up.

382
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,080
Maybe the stairs have elongated is, I don't know.

383
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,720
Is there like a guy in sunglasses nearby?

384
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,560
Because if so, do not trust that guy.

385
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
I haven't seen the Matrix in a while.

386
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,080
What else happened to that movie?

387
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,360
How about a Yahoo?

388
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,160
Yeah.

389
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
This one was sent in by level 9000 Yajuru Drew.

390
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Drew Davenport, thank you.

391
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,080
Drew, it's by Yajuru Answers User, question mark?

392
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,520
Only it's not like the question mark that auto fills in

393
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,800
when it's like an anonymous user.

394
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,720
Like they pick their name and their name is question mark.

395
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,120
Great job.

396
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
Like the word, wait, hold on.

397
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,600
The words, question mark?

398
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
No, it's the symbol.

399
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,080
The Unicode symbol.

400
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
Anyway, question mark asks,

401
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,880
where exactly is the F word in Now You See Me Too?

402
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,120
Okay, yes.

403
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,120
Like time code?

404
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,960
I mean, we don't have to get hidden in the background.

405
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah, I don't think we need to get that specific.

406
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,320
Well, I mean, if it's got that PG-13 rating,

407
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,960
which I think it does,

408
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
because this is a fucking magical family heist

409
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
that the family can enjoy.

410
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
And they want to just make sure the kids

411
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,600
go get some more goobers during the F word scene.

412
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,040
Oh, so this is like a run P kind of scenario

413
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,240
where we need to know like exactly when the F word comes.

414
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
So you're gonna be like, go get more butter on the popcorn

415
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
in five, four, three.

416
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

417
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
And then you hear Woody Harrelson like, well, fuck.

418
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
And it's like, no, you weren't fast enough.

419
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,840
I told you to run.

420
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,800
God damn it.

421
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
You fucking idiot kid.

422
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,840
I've always thought that this was to be the hardest part

423
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,240
of making a PG-13 movie

424
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
of like really sitting down like with the screenwriter

425
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
and the director and the stars

426
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
and like very judiciously deciding

427
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,640
where you're gonna put the fuck.

428
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,040
Yeah, Woody Harrelson opens up the script for Now You See Me Too

429
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,200
and he's like, well, most of this is garbage.

430
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
And then he waits a bit and he says,

431
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,040
oh, but I get the fuck word?

432
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,160
Oh, hell yeah.

433
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
Yeah, fuck yeah.

434
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
If I'm the one that gets it,

435
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,560
I thought you were gonna give it to Jesse Eisenberg,

436
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,120
but you gave it to me and I think I earned it.

437
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
It's my first F word in a movie.

438
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,640
I'm really excited to do it.

439
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
You're not giving it to little Franco, are you?

440
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,680
You're not giving it to the small Franco, are you?

441
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
Don't give it to little Franco.

442
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,480
Don't give it to, I don't know who else is in my damn movie.

443
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,000
Is the Ruffalo Buffalo in this movie?

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,840
Don't give it to the Ruffalo Buffalo.

445
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
I don't think Ruffalo Buffalo made it this time.

446
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,680
I don't think he made the cut in Now You See Me Too.

447
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,720
He's too busy being that Hulk there in that other movie.

448
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,160
Can the Hulk be in our movie?

449
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
That'd be pretty good.

450
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,040
Is it too late to put, we can't put-

451
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,560
We can put the Ruffalo Buffalo in,

452
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,400
but he actually has a clause in his contract

453
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,200
that demands he gets the F word in every movie he's in.

454
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
Can we say it simultaneously?

455
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,200
Might be like we look at each other

456
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,160
and in some kind of dramatic moment we both go, oh fuck.

457
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Probably my favorite scene in Now You See Me Too

458
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
where Ruffalo Buffalo and William Harrison look at each other

459
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,920
at the same time and just go, fuck.

460
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,320
And neither one of them wants to be the first one to end it.

461
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
So it actually goes for like four minutes.

462
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,000
It's like, if you had a five minute fuck in your movie,

463
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,440
does that still count as one fuck towards the rating?

464
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah. If your movie is just someone saying the word fuck

465
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,840
for two hours, but just one, then does it?

466
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
Yeah, I don't know if that counts.

467
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,040
With one boob out, just one boob out and saying fuck.

468
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,360
And like, that's PG-13, they got me.

469
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
Maybe it's not to send your kids out.

470
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,880
Maybe the easier thing is to just wait for the moment

471
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,800
and you kind of like do like they do on TV,

472
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,720
but very loud in the theater.

473
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
So just like when the moment comes,

474
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
you're just like, chother clucker.

475
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey, he's a lover.

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,440
He said chother clucker.

477
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,240
So you're fine.

478
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
Nothing's bad in this film.

479
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,000
Look at me.

480
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,480
Look at me.

481
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,280
Don't look at the screen.

482
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,200
We've danced around it though.

483
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,680
I am genuinely curious what, where in Now You See Me Too,

484
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,960
Now You Can See Me Too, does the-

485
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,000
Now You Have Seen Me.

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,080
Now You Can't See Me Too.

487
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
John Cena story.

488
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,400
I think it's the one moment when Jesse Eisenberg

489
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
blows the card trick and he's like, is this your card?

490
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,680
And they're like, no, it was actually like the queen of spade.

491
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,320
And he goes, fuck.

492
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,400
That's the one moment it happens in the first five minutes of the movie.

493
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,360
Why are you concerned about your child learning the fuck word,

494
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,080
but not concerned about them learning how to steal with magic?

495
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,600
That's not who you want your-

496
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,360
But just when you're going down to enjoy an EL fudge and you open the package

497
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
and what comes out?

498
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,800
Doves.

499
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,600
What?

500
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
My child stole the-

501
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
Delicious chocolate filled doves.

502
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,080
My child stole the EL fudge with magic.

503
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,280
You open up an EL fudge and all the chocolate crème inside.

504
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,640
Listen guys, we're R rated.

505
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
You could say EL fuck.

506
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,040
It's okay.

507
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,560
We have an explicit tag.

508
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,040
It's okay.

509
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
Hey, I do want to point out though.

510
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,880
Please.

511
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,400
We have really taken a lot of trips to the cinema in this episode, huh?

512
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,680
It's a very cinema heavy episode.

513
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,080
That's the thing about when you see or get excited about a movie like Trolls.

514
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,360
It just kind of sets you on fire for the whole craft.

515
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
Where does the F word come in Trolls?

516
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
Right at the top.

517
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
At the end, after the credits-

518
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,760
We're fucking Trolls.

519
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
At the end, after the credits, Spider-Man drops down.

520
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,320
He's like, fuck.

521
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
What's up with these fucking Trolls?

522
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,480
The movie starts.

523
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,280
The movie opens up.

524
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,240
Spider-Man away.

525
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,600
The movie opens up and it's just a white room and real Justin Timberlake just walks towards

526
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,120
the camera and it takes him a while to get there.

527
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,560
And finally, when he's occupying the whole of the frame, he just leans in close and he

528
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
just goes, fuck you.

529
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,520
And the movie starts.

530
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,000
Did you see Trolls?

531
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
Yeah, Justin signed on to do the movie.

532
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,720
It's amazing.

533
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,200
He does have this one thing.

534
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,920
Alfred Hitchcock comes out.

535
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
The story of Trolls is a long story.

536
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,160
Good evening, fuckers.

537
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,680
The lion at the beginning.

538
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:49,520
You know, Morgan Freeman is in Now You See Me 2.

539
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
Have we ever gotten an F word out of that guy?

540
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
Because I bet it's really good.

541
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,920
I bet he says it and it changes the way everybody else says it for the rest of time.

542
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,000
Fucking penguins, am I right?

543
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
What's their fucking deal?

544
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,160
Look at these black and white fuckers.

545
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,560
Look at this waddling motherfucker over here.

546
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,840
Look at this fucker just eating a fucking fish.

547
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,920
What's his fucking deal?

548
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,520
What's his fucking deal?

549
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,280
What's the fucking deal with penguins?

550
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I gotta tell you about a motherfucker named Andy Dufresne.

551
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,960
And that's what gave Shawshank Redemption its R rating.

552
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,080
No, it was PG-13.

553
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,680
He got the only F word.

554
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
Get busy living or get busy dying.

555
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,740
Fuck!

556
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,980
What if he's bad at saying it?

557
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,140
And that's why he's never said it in a movie.

558
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,820
So he's like, I want to tell you about Andy fucking Dufresne.

559
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,980
Can we get another read on that, Mr. Freeman?

560
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,420
Yeah, yeah, here it comes.

561
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
I'd like to fuck tell you about-

562
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,900
You put it in a really weird spot that time.

563
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,620
You guys ready for a trash story?

564
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,140
Oh, shit.

565
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,300
My dad was a garbage-

566
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,460
Wait, Griffin's gotta do the trash story jingle.

567
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Trash story, teach me to find myself.

568
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,820
My dad was a garbage man in my hometown of about 2,000 people.

569
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,980
There were a number of exciting finds and obligatory porn slash sex toys.

570
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,660
But the coolest thing he ever found was this unmarked VHS tape.

571
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,580
It was entirely filled with footage of purported UFOs and commentary

572
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,580
from what appears to be some kind of NASA slash military organization.

573
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,780
He said he didn't remember whose house he picked it up from, but I'm sure he did.

574
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
Don't know what happened to the tape,

575
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,020
and I'm almost completely sure that the CAIA took it from our movie shelf,

576
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,900
and that's from Cole.

577
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,940
That was a horrible rescue talk,

578
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,380
because there's a lot of VHS ghosts out there.

579
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,620
Like you do not, you absolutely-

580
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,980
I would say any unmarked-

581
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,860
In fact, even marked tapes, that's how they get you.

582
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,700
You throw in a Black Diamond Disney classic Beauty and the Beast,

583
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,540
like here we go, time to get ensorcelled by a story of transformative love.

584
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,420
But no, there's a dang ghost in there,

585
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,820
and it crawls out of your screen, strangles your dad.

586
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,380
Sometimes you get a ghost, sometimes you get a fart touch,

587
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,500
and you can never be sure.

588
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,380
I know I'm actually not sure which one's better.

589
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,540
You know there's a sequel to The Ring coming out?

590
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,380
Yeah.

591
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,220
I wonder how much of a plot point find of VCRs it's gonna be.

592
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,980
Do you think it's gonna be a plot point?

593
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,100
Like, oh, this is very spooky tape.

594
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,140
Just hold on a second.

595
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,260
I bet.

596
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,940
I'm gonna go out to the storage room.

597
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,180
There's one scene where they played on the VHS,

598
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,460
and then they played on the Blu-ray,

599
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,700
and they compare the quality of The Ring footage.

600
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,660
I'm like, this is way better.

601
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,580
You can really see all the differences.

602
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm gonna die in like seven minutes.

603
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,660
This is great.

604
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,020
This is great.

605
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,500
I love this.

606
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,940
And in the Blu-ray version,

607
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,860
you can see the cords and stuff on the ground

608
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,460
that you couldn't normally see otherwise.

609
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,020
Yes, it's unformative.

610
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,420
You know what?

611
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,700
It's not actually that scary.

612
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,220
Now that I see it, this is death.

613
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,420
It's actually not that bad.

614
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,940
I don't think I'm actually gonna die.

615
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,900
Yeah, I just watched The Ring video on Netflix.

616
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,540
It was great.

617
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,060
I just picked it up whenever I wanted to.

618
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,740
I was able to watch the whole thing in one day.

619
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,460
It was amazing.

620
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,700
So I tried to watch it with the director's commentary,

621
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,860
but the whole time the director's just like,

622
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,140
it's pretty spooky, isn't it?

623
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,060
This is a spooky scene here coming out with a little girl.

624
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,620
Hold on.

625
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,380
Wait, this is a spooky one.

626
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,780
Oh no, look at her.

627
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,900
You might not believe this.

628
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,580
It took that little girl a few minutes

629
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,700
to climb out of that well.

630
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,300
So we just jumped ahead a little bit.

631
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,900
She's gonna come up and throttle the life out of you,

632
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,780
though, look out.

633
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,580
Here he comes.

634
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,260
You see that spooky wafting tree?

635
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,300
You're not gonna believe this,

636
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,860
but that was actually my Uncle Doug.

637
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,220
He wanted to be in a movie

638
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,980
and he loaned me the money to make the movie.

639
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,940
And I said, you can be in a movie.

640
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,900
Oh, you're dead.

641
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,980
Oh no, you died before I finished my little speech.

642
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,900
I'm gonna keep going if that's okay, Silly.

643
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
This is flies on a corpse.

644
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,980
Pretty spooky.

645
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,020
I think it's supposed to represent how life continues

646
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,460
and everything's okay.

647
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,620
You know, sometimes things happen,

648
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,060
but then you gotta look on the bright side

649
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,020
and you make flies.

650
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,700
People never finish this movie

651
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,380
if you watch all the way to the end.

652
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,060
At the end, Spider-Man comes down.

653
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,420
He's just like, fuck.

654
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,660
That was actually why this did not get a wider distribution.

655
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,180
I didn't have the rights for that character.

656
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,260
All right, let's get the money, sir.

657
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,980
I would like to tell you a true story.

658
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,300
Please.

659
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,420
As Teresa and I moved across the country,

660
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,740
we had to look through our possessions

661
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,500
and make a lot of tough choices

662
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,580
as to what was going to go into a storage unit

663
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,500
and be locked away from us for a month.

664
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,220
And what we absolutely positively needed

665
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
in Huntington with us for the month of September.

666
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,100
And I could tell you,

667
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,340
one of the things on the shortlist

668
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,700
that was never in doubt

669
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,620
is our set of Bull and Branch sheets.

670
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,300
This is no exaggeration.

671
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,780
We had that shit shipped to Justin

672
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,860
so that it got here ahead of us

673
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,820
so that we could use them as soon as we got here.

674
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,060
Because we don't want to sleep on any other sheets

675
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,340
except Bull and Branch.

676
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,420
We are sponsored this week by Bull and Branch.

677
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,740
Bull and Branch is, they probably make

678
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,460
the most comfortable sheets I've ever slept on.

679
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,700
Maybe when I was like three,

680
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,980
I might've slept on some smurf sheets

681
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,940
that were really great.

682
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,620
But I think Bull and Branch probably tops the list.

683
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
Tell me about their product, Travis.

684
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,900
Well, here's the thing.

685
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
You know, Griffin, sometimes you go to the store

686
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,700
and you're looking at sheets

687
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,860
and they're so worried about thread count.

688
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,620
Thread count is not as important

689
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,500
as the materials that you put into it.

690
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,660
And, you know, they keep their prices down

691
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,820
because they don't have those like brick and mortar stores

692
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,860
you go to.

693
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,260
So you're going to get like an amazing deal

694
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,900
on the best sheets you've ever slept on.

695
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,060
And you can try it risk-free for 30 nights.

696
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,100
And if you don't love it,

697
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,860
you can send them back for a refund.

698
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,060
But you're going to love it.

699
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,620
They're great.

700
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,060
You have nothing to lose.

701
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,340
And they don't just do sheets.

702
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,540
They do towels.

703
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,060
They do duvets.

704
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,340
They do all kinds of stuff.

705
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,060
We've been using their towels for the last couple of nights.

706
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,820
And one, they're huge,

707
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,660
which is always a good thing in a bath towel.

708
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,500
And two, they're super fluffy and comfortable.

709
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,540
It makes me feel like I'm staying

710
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,980
at the classiest hotel in town.

711
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,060
And if you want to check it out,

712
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,660
you should go to bollandbranch.com.

713
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,860
That's B-O-L-L-N-branch.com.

714
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,020
And they're offering our listeners $50 off

715
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,380
their first set of sheets.

716
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,140

and use the promo code MYBROTHER, all one word,

718
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,900
and you'll get $50 off your first set of sheets.

719
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,220
Do it.

720
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,020
You'll love it.

721
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,060
Promo code MYBROTHER, all one word, bollandbranch.com.

722
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,540
Go check it out.

723
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,900
I want to tell you about Blue Apron

724
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,300
because I fucking love Blue Apron very, very much.

725
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,860
I'm going to be sad traveling.

726
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,020
And I'll be hanging out with my family for a month

727
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,140
or whatever, and that'll be cool.

728
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,780
But I'll miss Blue Apron because I'm leaving it behind.

729
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,820
Good news, Griffin.

730
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
We're going to have Blue Apron at my house.

731
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,100
So come on over.

732
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,140
The cooking's fine.

733
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,900
It's only enough for two portions.

734
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,020
Well, my wife won't eat.

735
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,980
That seems like a bad arrangement to me.

736
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,540
I won't eat.

737
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,700
That seems like a better arrangement to me.

738
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,980
So what Blue Apron does is they'll both just watch you eat.

739
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,460
That sounds great.

740
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,620
And you'll eat a portion fit for a game.

741
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,100
Yay.

742
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,580
So for less than $10 a meal, Blue Apron

743
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,140
delivers seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

744
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,260
to make delicious home-cooked meals right

745
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,780
in your very own kitchen.

746
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,060
And it teaches you how to cook.

747
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,740
And you get to make really, really tasty stuff

748
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,380
like paprika-spiced shrimp and cheddar grits

749
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,580
with tomato and sweet corn, spicy hoisin chicken stir fry

750
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,100
with baby bok choy and sesame ginger cucumber salad, eggplant

751
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,700
and chickpea, I don't even know what this word is,

752
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:46,500
tagine with islander pepper, tomato, and couscous.

753
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,460
So many great, great meals that are so tasty.

754
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,580
I love Blue Apron.

755
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,860
It's kind of changed the way that I eat food.

756
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,620
And it has taught me to cook basically starting from nothing.

757
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,060
And this is, I mean, I guess is another pretty good anecdote.

758
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,020
I'm traveling for a month.

759
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,580
And it's super easy to just pop in and pop out

760
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,700
and cancel the boxes where you're traveling.

761
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
And they really don't make a big deal out of it.

762
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,620
It's really easy to get what you want.

763
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,580
And they have different menus for different dietary preferences

764
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,700
and all kinds of good stuff.

765
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,380
So you can get your first three meals for free

766
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,620
with free shipping if you go to blueapron.com

767
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,420
slash my brother.

768
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,460
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

769
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

770
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,780
I have two new slogans for both that I've thought up.

771
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,420
OK, great.

772
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,540
OK, you ready?

773
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,820
Bowling branch, holy sheet.

774
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,500
OK, so they have holes in them?

775
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,220
Yeah, that's the first problem.

776
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,980
Well, maybe like holy sheet.

777
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,780
These are great.

778
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,420
And then Blue Apron, just eat it.

779
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,700
Well, you also cook it.

780
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,580
You have to cook it.

781
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,260
Just eat it.

782
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,580
OK.

783
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,020
Because it's both.

784
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,220
OK, get this.

785
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,100
It's both playing off of Nike TMTM.

786
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,900
And also off of the hit Weird Al parody.

787
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,620
Yeah.

788
00:32:59,620 --> 00:32:59,860
Yeah.

789
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,180
Eat it.

790
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,500
Eat it.

791
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,660
Eat it.

792
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,620
And then you can get Weird Al or John

793
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,900
Nike to come in and be your spokesman, Blue Apron,

794
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,140
or them working together.

795
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Travis, I'm glad that you are so invested in our product.

796
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,540
But we really just brought you on here for the tagline stuff.

797
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,780
So if you do actually suggest who

798
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,700
we bring on to market anything from now on,

799
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,860
that may be the end of our arrangement.

800
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,620
I understand.

801
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,340
I'm just so excited to finally get to use my advertising degree.

802
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,100
Thank you.

803
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,660
Thank you so much.

804
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,100
I'm Gregory Blue Apron.

805
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,860
And I need you to leave my office right now.

806
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,620
OK, thank you very much.

807
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,940
I'll let myself just through the door here.

808
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,300
Through the water.

809
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,180
Through the water slide.

810
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,700
Oh, the one that's marked for bad boys?

811
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,420
Yeah, the bad boys slide.

812
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,260
We actually bought the Blake check kids house as our home.

813
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,700
Yeah, so anyway, I have the door for good boys,

814
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,900
but bad boys get wet.

815
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,380
So.

816
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,260
OK, tone low.

817
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,140
No need to shove me.

818
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,020
OK, I'm going.

819
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,500
OK, thank you.

820
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,420
How did you know it was me as Gregory Blue Apron

821
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,820
this whole time?

822
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,020
I knew it was you the whole time.

823
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,940
So look, just trying to take over the Blake.

824
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,300
OK, I'm going down the water slide now.

825
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,840
Bye.

826
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:13,140
I have a personal message here to read on our program.

827
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:17,060
And this one comes to us from Ian and Andrew.

828
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
And it is for Becca Mason.

829
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,660
And it says, Dr. Reebs.

830
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,900
OK, it's not a good start.

831
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,500
It's not Becca's name.

832
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,740
Congratulations on finishing college.

833
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,860
Only took a decade.

834
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Sorry we couldn't be there to watch it,

835
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,500
but we're all so proud.

836
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,180
Nanu Nanu.

837
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,660
Timely.

838
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,180
Ian and Andrew.

839
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,660
It's forever.

840
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
They just started watching Work at Monday.

841
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,260
Alf, Ian and Andrew.

842
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,060
Harry and the Hendersons, the TV show, Ian and Andrew.

843
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,420
Well, you know how Alf would always,

844
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,340
his catchphrase was just he would shout his own name.

845
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,660
I love cats, Alf.

846
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,160
Alf.

847
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,260
He would also quote himself and it doesn't matter.

848
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,980
Congratulations.

849
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,700
It's a bad joke.

850
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,380
Congratulations, Dr. Reebs.

851
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,980
We're very proud of you.

852
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,460
It's a lot of schooling to ingest,

853
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,060
but you've really done it now.

854
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,940
And now no more teachers, no more books or dirty looks.

855
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,180
Time to fucking party.

856
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,620
I want to read the other one too.

857
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,020
OK.

858
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,900
If I could.

859
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,260
It's for Zane and it's from Radja.

860
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,100
And it says this.

861
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,740
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

862
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,820
OK, now I suggest that we take this

863
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,820
and do a couple of different readings of it.

864
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,660
Justin, could you give me like?

865
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,340
Yeah, let me try one.

866
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,060
Let me try one.

867
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,560
OK.

868
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,420
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

869
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,140
And it's like there's a mummy back.

870
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,100
I think I saw a mummy.

871
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,580
Oh, OK.

872
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,860
Can I try one here?

873
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,360
OK.

874
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,860
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

875
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,140
Now, I changed the punctuation a little bit.

876
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,260
I changed the punctuation a little bit there,

877
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,180
but I wanted to add some urgency to it.

878
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,700
As though, like, every time Zane turns around,

879
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,540
the thing behind the couch ducks down

880
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,980
and Zane's like, there's nothing there.

881
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,100
I told you, Radja.

882
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,060
Like, every time.

883
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,500
Sorry, I know I'm going out of order here,

884
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,100
but I would like to just try one more real quick.

885
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,240
OK.

886
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,420
Hey, Zane, look behind the couch.

887
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,540
So that was like Borat.

888
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,700
Nanu nanu.

889
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,740
Nanu nanu, my Zane.

890
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,820
Kind of a Borat thing.

891
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,860
So he did a Borat.

892
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,460
On that one was kind of a Borat voice.

893
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,420
I would love to hear Morgan Freeman

894
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,380
do a Borat joke sometime.

895
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,860
And one of his-

896
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,460
While dancing the dance from Napoleon died in one of his movies.

897
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,100
One thing that I wanted to mention here,

898
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,940
it did say as close to September 3rd as possible.

899
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,620
So let's hope it's not a puppy.

900
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
Or a clown that you paid by the hour.

901
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,580
Yeah, because that's going to be expensive and dead.

902
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,660
I'm Jesse Thorne,

903
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,740
and I'm curious about Jonathan Van Ness

904
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,420
and his show, Getting Curious.

905
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,820
What were you most excited to learn something about?

906
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,980
I was really excited about the Romanoffs.

907
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,020
I was really excited-

908
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,380
Why were you so excited about the Romanoffs?

909
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,340
Because I've been obsessed-

910
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,260
thanks for listening to the episode, I'm just kidding.

911
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,900
Because I've been obsessed with them since I was 11

912
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,100
from the movie Anastasia.

913
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,020
Jonathan, what's a baby brain?

914
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,740
It's a brain that's finally ready to explore.

915
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,860
Getting Curious, a show for your baby brain.

916
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,460
Download it wherever you get podcasts.

917
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,660
Tonight, we were at a very nice bar.

918
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,580
And at that bar, we met some very kind people

919
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,660
who we suspect paid our bill.

920
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,740
We're not sure if it was them.

921
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,780
Should we thank them anyway?

922
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,100
What do we do about this mystery bar tab?

923
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,260
What is appropriate to tip?

924
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,300
Do we tip the people who we suspect paid our tab?

925
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,420
What do we tip the bartenders who we do not suspect paid our tab?

926
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,580
That's from Helpless.

927
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,380
I'm Seattle.

928
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:49,060
I'm not sure they meant that, but let's go with that.

929
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,220
Because I think this is maybe written to us

930
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,900
after a night of, maybe on the night of the bar tab.

931
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,740
But it sounds from the tenor of the email

932
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,380
like it was a considerable night of drinking as well.

933
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,820
Now, I do want to make clear here

934
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,740
because they did not include in the text, like in the body,

935
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,620
but in the subject line that it was their birthday.

936
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,780
It was like after a birthday night out

937
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,380
or something was the subject line.

938
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,180
So they met these people at the bar on their birthday,

939
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,740
their birthday and not just like a random night out at a bar.

940
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,060
Then yeah, they probably paid your birthday tab.

941
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,780
I don't-

942
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,180
Did you just walk out of the bar and think,

943
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,980
I bet they paid our tab because that's so weird.

944
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,940
No one stopped us.

945
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,980
I guess someone paid our tab.

946
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,020
I guess someone paid it.

947
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,540
Well, the bouncer said, have a good night.

948
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,580
I guess we were square.

949
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,820
Okay, I've been in this position before though

950
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,260
where someone was like, oh, you're all set.

951
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,140
You're good to go.

952
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,460
And like, you don't want to question it too much

953
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,980
because like you don't want to like spoil the managing.

954
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,220
Sure.

955
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,020
But at the same time,

956
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,540
like if these like random new friends paid your bar tab,

957
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,500
you want to say thank you.

958
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,860
But if you want like picture,

959
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,100
hey, I just want to say thank you for paying our tab.

960
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,140
We, what?

961
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,220
We, we didn't like that.

962
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,900
I cannot, especially if you're drunk,

963
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,900
I cannot imagine a more awkward like bar interaction

964
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,420
than thanking someone for that.

965
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,740
See, I think-

966
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,780
Well, there's probably worse.

967
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,460
I think you should definitely get to like

968
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,380
the bottom of this situation.

969
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,820
Like you need to know.

970
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,020
It's important that you know.

971
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,660
Otherwise you owe them a life debt.

972
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,620
But some people though,

973
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,940
some people just love lording that shit over you.

974
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,060
Like for some people,

975
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,340
like it is worth the price of paying your bar tab

976
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,380
if they get to sort of immerse you

977
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,620
in a pool of your own confusion.

978
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,900
Oh, is this like one of those like internet,

979
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,740
you know, things that you see on Facebook

980
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,420
where it's like the young couple

981
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,180
and the older couple pays for their meal

982
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,700
and leaves them like a note

983
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,780
that's like when we were a young couple,

984
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,380
we also ate a hamburger

985
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,740
and somebody paid for our hamburger.

986
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
So now, so now you are like,

987
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,180
you are burdened with this generosity burden.

988
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,780
Now you have to go to a bar

989
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,180
and meet a rando stranger on their birthday.

990
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,500
I think it's-

991
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,580
And if you don't in seven weeks,

992
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,940
really bad stuff will happen.

993
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,180
Yeah, then the VHS tape explodes

994
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,700
and you, the girl comes out.

995
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,140
I think it's more like just they want to confuse you

996
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,900
and shroud you in mystery

997
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,540
and just know that that torment is worth it.

998
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,700
Dad kind of did me dirty like this yesterday

999
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,100
because we all left Max Fun Con East yesterday

1000
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,780
and Rachel and I had like three hours to kill

1001
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,660
before our flight.

1002
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,500
And so we went to this outlet mall

1003
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,380
and dad texted us as we were on our way

1004
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,780
back to the airport from the outlet mall.

1005
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,820
And he was like,

1006
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,820
did Rachel find anything at the outlet mall?

1007
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,340
And I was like, what the fuck?

1008
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,780
What the fuck?

1009
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,620
Like, how do you, how would you know that?

1010
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,380
Like, why are you, how would you know that?

1011
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,340
Were you at the outlet mall

1012
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,860
just like creeping on you, you didn't say?

1013
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:43,940
Turns out that he used Travis's phone

1014
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,420
because we have the like find my friend feature

1015
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,860
turned on for each other

1016
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,580
and just kind of scoped my scene out through the phone

1017
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,460
and then like just let me know

1018
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,700
that he knew exactly where I was at that moment.

1019
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,740
And I said, well, that's not creepy at all.

1020
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,500
And really, I'm just bringing this up

1021
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
because boys, we need to have a talk about

1022
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,060
why, when is right to use the feature

1023
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,540
of tracking the fucking geolocational position

1024
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,260
of my brothers.

1025
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
I use, Griffin, I used it to know

1026
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,420
that Justin in the eight hour drive up

1027
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,940
stopped at two different sheets.

1028
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,380
That's what I used it for.

1029
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,060
That tells me that there was a sort of ongoing surveillance

1030
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,260
of Justin's whereabouts happening.

1031
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,100
Yeah, you can't set a notification,

1032
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,180
like alert me when he stops at a sheet.

1033
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,340
Hey phone?

1034
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,060
Siri.

1035
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,100
Siri, please let me know

1036
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,860
anytime Justin checks out a sheet.

1037
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,420
That would require like more or less constant marketing.

1038
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,420
Like, did you have a lab in the back seat?

1039
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,420
I had the boys down in the lab working on it.

1040
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,860
This is only to be used if I end up

1041
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,540
in somebody's cellar somewhere.

1042
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,340
Not if you're just fucking bored

1043
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,900
and you wanna see if I'm at J.Crew, okay?

1044
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,500
I'll fucking remove, if it happens again,

1045
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,780
I'll remove it from my phone

1046
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,700
because this is a huge invasion of privacy.

1047
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,420
I was at J.Crew and I was buying some slacks for the show.

1048
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
I was buying my show slacks there, there.

1049
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,380
It actually popped up as a notification actually

1050
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,900
that you were buying show slacks.

1051
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
It's strangely specific.

1052
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,740
It let me know that Justin was getting

1053
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,340
a double chocolate bar and a cheer wine

1054
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,180
and that Griffin was buying show slacks.

1055
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,740
I hate every second of this.

1056
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,380
Please don't creep on my loc.

1057
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,580
I have had the actual thought before.

1058
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,140
Another night at home, huh guys?

1059
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,660
You guys should really get out there more.

1060
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,780
I'm gonna text them and tell them

1061
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,220
they should go out somewhere

1062
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,940
because I'm tracking you.

1063
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,700
I'm just curious how you're doing sometimes.

1064
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,220
How are you doing?

1065
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,860
What are you up to?

1066
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,420
Actually, I'm feeding my phone through.

1067
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,700
I've got a backup secret phone.

1068
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,140
I've got a shadow proxy that's bouncing off in Belarus.

1069
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,580
Griffin's in Belarus, cool.

1070
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,820
Belarus again, huh Griffin?

1071
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,460
Wow, you sure get over there a lot.

1072
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,500
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

1073
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,060
Yes, please.

1074
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,460
Yes.

1075
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,900
I just wanna send him by Morgan Davey.

1076
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,380
Keep it wavy, Morgan Davey.

1077
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,940
It's pretty good.

1078
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1079
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,140
Sorry, something's gone wrong.

1080
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,100
I'm gonna call them.

1081
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,780
Burger Man asks,

1082
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,620
what is the meaning of the,

1083
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,540
oh man, sorry.

1084
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,940
What is the meaning of The Gambler by Kenny Rogers?

1085
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,940
God, man, you tell me.

1086
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,500
I heard the song on the way home from dinner last night.

1087
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,060
We all argued on what the song was really written about.

1088
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,740
I would like to know your views.

1089
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,060
I personally think it's about women.

1090
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,300
My son believes it's about poker.

1091
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,540
My wife says it's about life.

1092
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,140
My son is very literal.

1093
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
My wife says it's about life.

1094
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,740
I can find anyone on the web

1095
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,380
where people have debated this topic, okay?

1096
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,220
Little known fact, it's about origami.

1097
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,940
Maybe y'all can help me, thanks CB.

1098
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,460
So I guess this is by Charles Bradshaw.

1099
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,980
What do you guys think it's about?

1100
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,220
Well, here's the thing.

1101
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,220
A lot of people read too much into this.

1102
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,460
I think I'm gonna go with The Sun

1103
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,940
and I think it's just like a song

1104
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,420
all about high level poker strategies.

1105
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,020
Well, I tell you, here's the thing.

1106
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,860
I think you're right on one level,

1107
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,180
but on another level, it's also about a song

1108
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,180
where someone dies in the middle of the song.

1109
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,500
And very often that portion of the song

1110
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,180
is kind of glazed over,

1111
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,580
but there's a death in the middle of this song

1112
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,660
that everyone sings all the time.

1113
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,740
Okay, here's what happens to the gambler.

1114
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,140
If you're looking for the little story of the gambler,

1115
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,500
there's two men on a train.

1116
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,260
One man looks at the other man and says,

1117
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,820
hey, you're looking pretty rough and run down.

1118
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,100
Like you don't look great.

1119
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,140
But if you give me some whiskey,

1120
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,940
I will give you the answers

1121
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,860
that will help turn this around for you.

1122
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,100
And he's like, okay, here's some whiskey.

1123
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,900
So he drinks some whiskey and he says,

1124
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,220
play poker well.

1125
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,020
Well, every hand can win, every hand can lose.

1126
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,540
And the best that you can hope for

1127
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,900
is to die in your sleep.

1128
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,820
And then as if like, and he's like winks

1129
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,260
and then he dies in his sleep.

1130
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,660
He's like, I know it was the most object lesson

1131
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,900
any teacher has ever taught.

1132
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,700
Watch, the best you can go for is dying in your sleep.

1133
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,580
Like this, watch me do it.

1134
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,180
Allow me to demonstrate.

1135
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,500
And then there's a sequel called The Gambler 2,

1136
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,820
which is like, can I get some help in here?

1137
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,460
There's a dead old man in this drink.

1138
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,660
There's a dead old man here.

1139
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,060
I gave him the wrong bottle.

1140
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,700
So let me give you-

1141
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,900
I forgot I had this pin cleaner with me.

1142
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,900
So let me get this straight, tough guy.

1143
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,420
You're sitting there with the man.

1144
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,220
The last thing he ever does is drink from a bottle

1145
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,100
you gave him and then he just dies.

1146
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,220
Just like that.

1147
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,300
Right after he says you should die in your sleep,

1148
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,500
he dies in his sleep.

1149
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,660
You really expect us to believe that?

1150
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,220
You're going to jail.

1151
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,860
Listen, you gotta believe me, it was a beautiful moment.

1152
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,420
And he told me that you got no one to hold them

1153
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,700
and no one to fold them.

1154
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,420
And I think he was talking about more than poker.

1155
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,100
And then he died.

1156
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,540
And then he died in his sleep.

1157
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,260
But I still had to get to Philadelphia.

1158
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,060
So we sat on that train for a while longer.

1159
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,020
Because you can't just like stop a train at a hospital.

1160
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,540
How asleep does an old man have to be

1161
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,100
if he drifts off mid metaphor?

1162
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,860
And it's just like, I'm gonna-

1163
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,980
Like how long are you in that car before you're like,

1164
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,820
I'm going to check this stranger's pulse.

1165
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,300
This has got, like, this has got-

1166
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,220
Excuse me, is there more?

1167
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,380
I gave you a taste of my whiskey.

1168
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,100
Excuse me, is there more to your advice?

1169
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,340
The best that I could hope for is die in my sleep.

1170
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,020
Fuck you, old man.

1171
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,100
What about like, you know, being happy

1172
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,700
and like making friends and shit?

1173
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,420
The old man like wake back up and be like,

1174
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,100
just kidding, follow your dreams.

1175
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,260
One more thing, just one more thing.

1176
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,460
Sorry, I almost forgot.

1177
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,140
What I meant, when I said die in your sleep,

1178
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,460
what I meant was wake up and have a great breakfast

1179
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,820
and maybe face a new day.

1180
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,780
And one other thing, try to keep your money

1181
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:02,180
in low risk mutual funds for, you know, as long-

1182
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:02,900
And leave them in there

1183
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,660
because you're just gonna get hit with interest.

1184
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,500
But also do die in your sleep.

1185
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:06,820
Bye.

1186
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,540
Tell your friends and family you love them

1187
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,740
as often as you can.

1188
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,420
And just remember like, you know,

1189
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,780
every day is an opportunity.

1190
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,900
And also like, die in your sleep, fuck us.

1191
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,400
Yes.

1192
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,420
Listen, all of this is-

1193
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,940
Hey, old man, are you okay?

1194
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,540
Hey, I know you were talking about I seem rundown.

1195
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,820
I'm now worried about you.

1196
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,620
Are you all right?

1197
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,500
Because all you want is my booze and to die.

1198
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,300
Are you okay?

1199
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,100
Listen, are you cool?

1200
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,600
Yeah.

1201
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,180
Listen, son, I can see you're having a rough time.

1202
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,940
I've got things all figured out.

1203
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,140
Let me see if I can help.

1204
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,500
Do poker good or do poker bad.

1205
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,140
Either way, die in your sleep.

1206
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,640
Bye.

1207
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,140
Okay, bye.

1208
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,500
You can have whatever is in my bags.

1209
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,560
Bye.

1210
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,700
My life is your life now.

1211
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,220
What is that taste of your whiskey?

1212
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,380
Did this old man just up in the bottle?

1213
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,780
I'm gonna kill myself with whiskey now.

1214
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,180
Good night.

1215
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,820
Okay, bye.

1216
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,700
Or the whiskey was poisoned.

1217
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,340
This song is a song about killing a gambler.

1218
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,340
And then I realized that I was the greatest gambler

1219
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,180
because the old greatest gambler died

1220
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,100
and now I was the best gambler.

1221
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,860
Then I felt the quickening

1222
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,100
and his gambling skill jumped into me

1223
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,260
because this is the way that gambler works.

1224
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,940
No one will ever admit it.

1225
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,100
I'm wearing all his rings

1226
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,780
and I stole his identity.

1227
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,460
I couldn't make that fit.

1228
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,100
This has been the plot to Now You See Me 3.

1229
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,300
Fuck, fuck.

1230
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,500
Listen, all of this happens in the song The Gambler

1231
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,180
but it's all really lessons about being good at poker

1232
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,780
because not a lot of people know this

1233
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,060
but most of Kenny Rogers songs

1234
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,620
are just kind of walkthroughs for various games.

1235
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,060
So he has that one called Ocarina of Time

1236
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,540
and it's like,

1237
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,460
gotta go to Kakariko Village and race against Dom Peh.

1238
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,540
Get yourself the hook shot to get in the Forest Temple.

1239
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,260
Don't ever keep a knight on the side of the board.

1240
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,940
They're much better pieces when they're active in the center.

1241
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,580
That's actually, I was watching the World Series of Poker once

1242
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,940
and Phil Mickelson was down

1243
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,780
and everybody's like, whoa, what's he gonna do?

1244
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,620
Like, he's clearly beat

1245
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,500
and they'd already gone all in, turned the cards over

1246
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,900
and he died in his sleep and won automatically.

1247
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,580
I'm like, and everybody was blown away

1248
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,180
because they'd never seen that maneuver before

1249
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,860
and then they checked his lock event

1250
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,780
and he was just listening to The Gambler on repeat

1251
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,460
and they're like, holy shit, he's a genius.

1252
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,500
That's sort of a weird through line

1253
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,780
through all of Mr. Rogers songs.

1254
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,900
It's like, scoop up the fish, go to Jabu Jabu, die in your sleep.

1255
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,340
Wait, why do I, I was just about to get the spiritual stone of water.

1256
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,420
This is a prostrat run through.

1257
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,660
If you're trying to get a hundred percent, also you gotta die in your sleep.

1258
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,340
Wait, hold on, I just can't.

1259
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,260
When you knocked the painting over

1260
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,220
to the other people in 13 Dead End Drive,

1261
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,580
then you go to sleep and you die and then everybody died.

1262
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,180
And Nathan and his brother, they're searching for the treasure.

1263
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,460
You gotta jump on the cliff and then you die in your sleep.

1264
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,260
Wait, hold on.

1265
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,100
Level up Chie Sadonaka until she learns bufu.

1266
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,900
Use it in boss fights, die in your sleep.

1267
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,820
That's just when he gets stuck in the game.

1268
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,780
I don't know what to do next.

1269
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,900
It's gotta be a glitch.

1270
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,300
Maybe die in your sleep.

1271
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,740
I mean, you will have finished the game in a very literal sense.

1272
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,420
You only made it to level two of Crash Bandicoot.

1273
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,940
What are you talking about?

1274
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,620
Yeah, but like sometimes the big giant thing rolls against you

1275
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,580
and the best thing you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

1276
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,780
Other people have beat Crash Bandicoot, Kenny Rogers.

1277
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,940
Sometimes the guru's gonna get ya,

1278
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,900
but you check the mailbox earlier and then die in your sleep.

1279
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,140
You made it 30 seconds so far.

1280
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,820
You go west and then you go north.

1281
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,660
Use key on door and if that doesn't work, you die in your sleep.

1282
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,820
Make the note, come on, we just started Zork.

1283
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,100
Make the bricks line up and make them disappear.

1284
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,100
Oops, you got a stack going.

1285
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,060
Die in your sleep.

1286
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,620
This has been our show, My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1287
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:48,020
We hope you've enjoyed yourself for this very cinema heavy episode,

1288
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,780
kind of a cinema theme, cinnabon of an episode.

1289
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:57,540
We wanted to mention we are doing a fundraiser

1290
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,340
that has been so wonderfully successful for another show,

1291
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,420
The Adventure Zone.

1292
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,780
We're not actually doing it.

1293
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,260
We gave our blessing to this wonderful project.

1294
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,620
It's called The Adventure Zine.

1295
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,660
If you go to theadventurezine.com,

1296
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,060
you can pre-order an art book that has so many incredible artists.

1297
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,860
These artists and the organizers of this project

1298
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,820
through their generosity have raised over $90,000 for this project.

1299
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,420
Jesus, that's insane.

1300
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,220
It's 306% of the goal.

1301
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:35,540
All the profits from the book are gonna go to the Facing Hunger Food Bank,

1302
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,940
which is a food bank here in the Huntington, West Virginia tri-state area.

1303
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,020
So we're hugely excited about this project.

1304
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,260
Again, it's not our baby.

1305
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,140
We've put a laughable amount of work into making this successful,

1306
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,900
but a lot of really good hardworking people are doing just that.

1307
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,180
We're extremely appreciative.

1308
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,860
So theadventurezine.com, go pre-order that.

1309
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,220
I'm not actually sure how long the campaign goes.

1310
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,860
Do you guys have any idea how long they're gonna be accepting?

1311
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,740
No, but just assume it ends tomorrow and go do it now.

1312
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,460
What are you waiting on?

1313
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,740
They've been kind of slowly leaking out some of the previews of the art.

1314
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,380
It's fucking great.

1315
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,420
It's gonna be stunning.

1316
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,020
A couple of things.

1317
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,580
I wanna say, as long as we're talking about people putting in a lot of hard work

1318
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,380
to make something awesome,

1319
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,580
we just got back from Max Funke East,

1320
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,580
and it was incredible.

1321
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,780
Not only was it a great time,

1322
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,660
all the attendees were wonderful.

1323
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,020
We did an Adventure Zone,

1324
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,860
and a bunch of people showed up in cosplay,

1325
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,140
and it was very wonderful and warmed our tiny black hearts.

1326
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,140
We're gonna be publishing that Adventure Zone this winter sometime,

1327
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,820
once Travis and I have the babies,

1328
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,820
and are gonna take some time off from...

1329
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,180
We need to figure out, by the way, boys,

1330
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,860
what we're doing with my bim-bam during that period.

1331
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,540
Unless we start gonna crank them out, but I don't know.

1332
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,660
I mean, last time we...

1333
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,780
Please let us know.

1334
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,220
Last time we had a parental leave was just when you left,

1335
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,460
and that's when we fucking launched Adventure Zone.

1336
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,340
Can you believe that shit?

1337
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,700
Who knows what's coming out now?

1338
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,900
Yeah, who knows what podcast we're gonna start while Travis and I are gone.

1339
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,940
That's how we do it.

1340
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,660
We have babies, and we take some time off,

1341
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,620
and during that time off,

1342
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:14,020
we give ourselves a lot more obligations for when we come back.

1343
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,180
I think we should just do a full episode of Smart Stuff.

1344
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,300
I think that's what we should release.

1345
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,780
That would be so good, but that's just you and Roman.

1346
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,220
Yeah, just me and Roman.

1347
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,740
That way you guys could do your own thing,

1348
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,300
and Roman and I, Roman, if you're listening to this,

1349
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,020
get at me, Justin at teengoogle.com.

1350
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,460
You also know how to DM me and shit, but let's do this, Roman.

1351
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,220
Speaking of more obligation, we also, this week,

1352
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,020
are going to start working, like really working,

1353
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:42,740
full boiler into the My Brother, My Brother and Me TV show.

1354
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,220
Yes.

1355
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,660
So we will try to remain on a regular release schedule, but if we-

1356
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,860
No, we will.

1357
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,020
We are working with somebody who's going to help us edit

1358
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,460
and get the podcast up.

1359
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,500
The, I think the result for you, the end result for you, the user,

1360
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,420
I think the Bim Bams are probably going to go up

1361
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,860
a little bit later on Mondays than you're used to.

1362
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,060
Probably not Monday mornings,

1363
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,900
probably closer to like Monday afternoon, maybe even evening,

1364
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,180
depending on like how crazy things are for us that any given day,

1365
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,940
but that'll just be for a few weeks

1366
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,100
and then things will calm down again.

1367
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,340
But yeah, just bear with us.

1368
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,740
We are so fucking excited to make this TV show.

1369
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,940
Like it has gotten to a point where like,

1370
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,140
I was so scared to make a TV show

1371
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,260
because we never do like on camera stuff ever.

1372
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,420
And all of that has just been replaced with excitement

1373
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,380
because the ideas for the show are just like so good, y'all.

1374
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,900
It's going to be so, so good.

1375
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,220
And if you keep an eye on like our Twitter

1376
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,340
and the Facebook group and stuff,

1377
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,540
we'll post some pictures from the set.

1378
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,820
Do you know CISO now?

1379
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,700
That's where it's going to be.

1380
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,660
CISO is like a TV comedy subscription service from NBC.

1381
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,580
With a bunch of like original programs.

1382
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,420
There's also like stuff like Saturday Night Live

1383
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,620
and Kids in the Hall is all on there.

1384
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,780
But there's original shows that people are putting together.

1385
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,180
You got to watch Take My Wife on CISO.

1386
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,140
It's Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher's show.

1387
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,660
It's fucking phenomenal.

1388
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,580
So like go get on it now and watch that

1389
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,380
and then watch our show when it comes out early next year.

1390
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,860
So one last thing.

1391
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,140
We're doing a Candle Night show.

1392
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,820
In case you missed the announcement last week,

1393
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,180
tickets are currently on sale.

1394
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,100
As of yesterday, there were like a hundred left or something.

1395
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,020
So don't wait.

1396
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,180
September 30th in Huntington, West Virginia.

1397
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,580
And we're going to be filming maybe not the whole thing,

1398
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,860
but like clips and bits for the TV show.

1399
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,900
So it's going to be-

1400
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,700
Some of our best poofs.

1401
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,460
Some of our best poofs and goofs and all the bloofs.

1402
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,740
It's going to be great.

1403
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,300
So it's going to be an extra special Candle Night special.

1404
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:39,800
Yeah.

1405
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,500
September 30th in Huntington.

1406
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:48,020
In Huntington, you can go to CandleNights2016.bpt,

1407
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,460
brown paper tickets, bpt.me.

1408
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,180
Get the tickets now.

1409
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,220
Come down, hang out with us.

1410
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,420
And it's not just my brother and my brother and me.

1411
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,780
It's going to be my brother and my brother and me,

1412
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,260
Sawbones, Schmaners, and still Buff Rags.

1413
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,980
So- The whole set.

1414
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,380
It's going to be really huge for 20 bucks.

1415
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,180
It's actually 21 because $1 from every sale

1416
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,300
is going to Branch's domestic violence shelter

1417
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,580
here in Huntington.

1418
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,100
So you're buying a ticket and you're

1419
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,980
doing a little bit of good.

1420
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,140
You can come down to the show and hang out with us.

1421
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:13,860
All right.

1422
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,300
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1423
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,660

00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,020

This one was sent in by Seymour Funk.

1434
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,300
And I don't know if that's a real name or not, gang.

1435
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,100
But I want it to be so badly.

1436
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,300
There's a fun progressive ad at the top of the screen with flow

1437
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,620
and she's poking her head in like, hey, what's up?

1438
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,420
OK.

1439
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,220
All right.

1440
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,700
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Beemore, who asks,

1441
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,380
is it soup weather yet?

1442
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,180
And he was just a McElroy.

1443
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

1444
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,940
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1445
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,220
This has been my brother, my brother.

1446
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,660
I mean, kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1447
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:19,380
Hey, girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?
