1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,220
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,700
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,900
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Well, I'm your middle this brother Travis a big dog

10
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,380
Oh woof woof, McElroy and I have my

11
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,060
Baby brother

12
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,040
Tape out. Oh no. Oh, it's stuck. Oh, it's stuck in the

13
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,700
Let me shove a pencil and Griffin twist it

14
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Oh

15
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:50,180
That was the sound I make when you shove a pencil in me, hey everybody sharpened my pencil which was weird

16
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,660
So happy summer everybody. Yeah. Oh, I should say by the way before we get started

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,580
I thank you to everybody who supported us the max fund drive. I know I've said it but

18
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,340
I cure my bone fleas

19
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,580
They're all gone. So everyone can stop asking me about it on

20
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,780
Twitch, but yeah, yeah

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,220
Would you say you get?

22
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,420
Maybe a lot of questions about the pill the sharp pill for your butt or

23
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,540
Yeah, I'm more than average whatever the average number is more than that

24
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,900
So we've been doing this show for a while

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,540
We've known each other for a while and you know what?

26
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,820
I realize guys you can always get to know each other a little bit more and so on

27
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,420
I was just thinking maybe we could play like a little like I you know, like would you yeah like icebreaker games

28
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,540
Yeah, icebreaker games. This would be more like mantle breaker the mantle of the earth

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,140
We've already had fairly well past the ice and now we're burrowing into the into the center

30
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,860
But I was thinking maybe something like, you know

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,880
What's a food that you think you could eat the most of in one sitting before you got sick of it more than any other?

32
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,540
human being on earth

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,460
No, no, no

34
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,940
Just like what's a food that you Griffin McRae Justin McRae could start eating in one sitting and you think you can

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,320
consecutively eat it the longest before you're like

36
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,300
Another bite could like in a you mean in like a sort of Joe Joseph chestnut style sort of but I don't like you're trying to

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,420
Hurt yourself, but just like it's the food that for the longest amount of time. He could be like, I'll have one more

38
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,220
Yeah, right back against the idea that Joey chestnut

39
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,420
Could eat a bunch of hot dogs now like not on hot dog day. Do you know what I mean?

40
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:35,460
There's no way he got into it originally. I'm not like that's very good a good point Griffin because he may have had a big

41
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,460
breakfast

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
50,000 hamburgers

43
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,800
To prepare and a lot of people think Joe

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,700
Joseph a lot of people think Joseph chestnut the way he does is he trains really really hard to eat hot dogs all day every

45
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,660
Day all year round but his secret is that he just doesn't eat hot dogs all year

46
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,900
So that when hot dog eating day comes around he's so fucking excited for it

47
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,460
Do you think that people have ever been out to lunch with Joseph chestnut?

48
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,380
They're like so you wanna get hot dogs?

49
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,140
He's like, yeah, sure and then he goes to the hot dog counter and he's like, um

50
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,740
I think I'll have two hot dogs and the everyone is like

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,340
Do you mean 200 do you eat 200 like no just I think just two for me today

52
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,560
I think I'll just enjoy two hot dogs. Hey, mr. Chestnut. It's me hot dog Joe owner of hot dog Joe's

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,740
What's wrong with my hot dogs? No, it's nothing

54
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,340
I know I would love to eat a hundred of them dipped in water, but right now I just want two of them

55
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
Well, I'm sorry. I

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,060
Yeah, I can bring you a hundred hot dog

57
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,420
You don't think I can make a hundred eyes, too

58
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,820
If that's the problem, I just really only want to two hot dogs today. I know it's okay

59
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,780
So is there you want to answer to your question? Yeah, I want an answer. What's the food that you think?

60
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,740
You could eat the most of before you became sick of it in one sitting. I make a I make it caramel

61
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,420
cereal snack mix that has like nuts in it and it's got spice and

62
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,720
Like a hardened crunchy caramel exterior and all the pieces and a lot of a good amount of salt, too

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,920
Oh, it's a very well balanced kind of thing. And I feel like I feel like that's the kind of thing where I

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,140
Just I just keep eating. I mean like I have scientific evidence to prove. This is like it's called Saturday

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I could just keep eating him

66
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,800
And I don't think I don't I think I could get a really good clip going and you're not worried about like too much crunch

67
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,700
Hurt in the old jaw. Are you talking about a desire to continue to consume?

68
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,480
Are you can talking about physical endurance?

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,560
Require an awareness of the impact of these on my human frame. Well, I don't that's a different question

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,440
I don't think that I have a hard time separating the two because Mike a lot of bad food choices traffic

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,800
No, no, it's the worst one time. He ate beans only beans for five years. No, I remember that. I remember that

72
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
The Wind Waker. Yeah

73
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,880
The Wind Waker was very good. Thank you

74
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,840
I joke see cuz I my first knee-jerk was peanut M&Ms, you know

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,080
But after a while started to get locked on there, you know

76
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah, I think veggie straws would be my answer those

77
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,920
They're they got enough flavor and salty to be delicious, but not so much

78
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,340
That I think you're talking volume now, bud. Hey, but you're talking volume talking. That's your mass. Yeah

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,480
Yeah

80
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,360
What's yours Griffin? I don't know

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,040
No, boy fucking at this point. It's got to have a lot of protein in it

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,280
Mm-hmm to keep me going to keep me going and keep me strong. That's it. I guess it needs to be a food that is

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,520
Not gonna fill me up so much but also has lots of protein to sustain the eating motion of it and but also vitamins

84
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
I guess and

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,160
So I would say I have to say ants on a log. Oh

86
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah, man

87
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
celery

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
peanut butter

89
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,760
raisins

90
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,040
Just yours is sort of straight over the plate. No fuss. No muss ants on a log. No tricks here

91
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,440
Yeah, no zhuzhen it up. No zhuzhen it up. Don't fucking sprinkle paprika on it or anything like that

92
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,360
I want a very basic vanilla ants on a log without no almond butter. No butter

93
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,320
No, no golden raisins. You don't want a star. This is uh, this was good stuff trap. This is a good idea

94
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,440
Yeah, where did you think the comedy would come? I didn't think it would come

95
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,680
I just wanted us to get to know each other better. Sometimes it's just heartwarming and nice. You know what I mean? Huh?

96
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah, sometimes yeah. Yeah

97
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,560
Huh?

98
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Normally we don't plan on

99
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,400
Sort of an anti comedy comedy. Yeah

100
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Comedy I wasn't trying to make it sad

101
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,000
I just thought we could get to know each other sure sure sure

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
Let's maybe balance it out and do a nice

103
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,400
comedy bookend by talking about what we do think Joey Chestnut's bathroom looks like because it's a funny it's where you always go when you

104
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Talk about how many hot dogs the man eats but like for real there everybody focuses on the goddamn hot dogs

105
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,440
It's the bun that's gonna give him bathroom. Okay, I was speaking holistically

106
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,800
Duh, I was speaking holistically about the whole I'm not talking about eating just the wieners trap

107
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,420
You can't do that though Griffin. You have a kid

108
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,080
You know that you cannot talk about hot dogs as a combination food

109
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,120
Right because nine times out of ten my kid doesn't want the bun. Okay, just want the hot dog

110
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,640
Well, my kid likes the bun so I you're you're really projecting a lot

111
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,920
But what do you did he's gotta have what like a I advise him big IMAX screen

112
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,040
In there to fill the time to just fucking kick it. I

113
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,200
Have my Xbox in my back in the bathroom and that would be my own personal Xbox

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,480
I have a controller that I bring in there and I bring out of there that nobody else should be allowed to

115
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,740
Interface with I think he probably also has one of those like, you know

116
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,400
The the chairs that you see in like first class in the airplane. Yeah where they can like recline into a full bed

117
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,860
Oh cool. Yeah, it's probably something like that, right and it also has like a console and like here's the headphones that hang here

118
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,860
And there's a button to call for help

119
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,000
Definitely he just walks away. He's got Joey chestnuts got life alert for

120
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,120
Sure, he needs that button in any bathroom. He ever goes in cuz he doesn't know when it's gonna happen. I

121
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,240
Mean, it's in the shower his toilets in the shower, right? This doesn't get any sense any other way

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,720
Do you think that he hibernate? It's got me the shower cuz otherwise he finishes up and was he have five blue foots

123
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,840
It's gotta be in the shower could be a car wash situation

124
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,920
That's right room goes into that's toilet shower

125
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,400
Refrigerator all in one sort of cube that he just yeah, July 4th

126
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,080
July 5th enters the cube, July 28 leaves the cube

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,120
Yeah, Joe just gets slapped by a bunch of wet soapy nylon straps for two straight weeks, Joey

128
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,040
I like your beard. Thanks. I grew it in the cube

129
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,760
Were you asleep in the cube or were you yes?

130
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,240
Yes

131
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,200
It is friends have to explain like somebody comes to the door to get a sign for a package and they're like I got a package

132
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Here for Joseph chestnut and his daughter has to be like currently

133
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,880
My father is filth and my father will be filth for several days until the cube is that it's grim work. I

134
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Don't I I thought sir. I find it better to think that I don't have a father now because he's in a quantum state

135
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,960
But the existing and being filth a sort of LCL primordial soup in there

136
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,160
You know how no one's quite sure how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly

137
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,040
Here's one thing I could be sure sir the package the Joseph chestnut that that package was sent to will not be the Joseph

138
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,520
Emerges from the cube. He is a different father. He's sloughing off his inside and outsides. So

139
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,300
It's in a way honestly, it's in the manner and style of

140
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,360
Dr. Who I do love how every time when Joseph chestnut exits the cube

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,160
He gets to have a fun like what is this Joseph chestnut dress in you know kind of montage

142
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:40,440
He goes through his large closet and picks out a whimsical scarf. Oh, man. All right, so it's a vice show. Yeah, it's a vice

143
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,480
My boss has been stressed lately and the lighten the tension during lulls and meetings

144
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,400
I started asking silly icebreaker questions. Oh, what a great idea. Yeah, I

145
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,920
Go with anxiety by using humor so I didn't consider the consequences

146
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Along the way, my boss has dubbed me the funny person, which is not something I'm known for anywhere else

147
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,160
As a result during meeting low points, she'll say got anything for us. Oh

148
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh my god

149
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:16,440
Brothers how do I quickly shed this? Tell a joke persona that's been assigned to me without having to directly address the issue

150
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,100
That's from persona problems in the Pacific Northwest now

151
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,120
We have I know dealt with similar issues where people become like people love to label don't they?

152
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,600
Put people in the little boxes full of ticky-tack. We love to organize everything

153
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,560
Sure, organize everything in this person the thing they it's like for me. I run into this all the time

154
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,400
Where people in my neighborhood think me as the funny person? Yeah, sexy person, right?

155
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,280
You know what I mean? I mean, you know sexual powerful man and having me

156
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,240
You know, I I told one icebreaker at the beginning of this episode and people are already labeling me the funny one

157
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,520
You know, it's funny actually Travis everything. Yes, except the bad one. Oh

158
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,260
All right, that's all yeah funny in quotes

159
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,760
Funny about Travis you got a shit. You got a you got a

160
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,540
Okay, you gotta make someone else the funny person. You're not gonna change this habit of labeling, but you can start to set up

161
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,840
You know Tabitha when she's like when like Tabitha with a good punchline

162
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,720
Or even if it's not a good punchline Tabitha says anything you laugh your head off. Oh, you got it

163
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,120
That's got me cracking over here. She's talking about her. No, it's hearing this. I'm busting up

164
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,660
She's talking about it. I was watching mass singer last night

165
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,160
Yeah

166
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,480
It's a big lie cuz they won't say who it is and then it's Kermit for some reason

167
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,760
Let me offer a different possibility. Okay, because this it seems like you are doing very little

168
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Asking a silly icebreaker and being labeled the funny one seems like the threshold for funny is very low in this office

169
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,680
okay, this feels like you could buy perhaps a children's joke book and

170
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,820
Let it do the heavy lifting for you and still continue to be the funny one

171
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,240
Which all things considered is better than being like the industrious one

172
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,780
One who always undertakes projects and finishes them on time, right?

173
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,220
You could also find a brand that is so

174
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,220
sort of

175
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
comprehensive that it overwrites

176
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,220
The funny one like if you start if you like dye your hair

177
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,100
like either jet black or jet white and then you

178
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,740
Start you wear like the clothes of like a haunted like circus ringleader and you're like, yeah, I'm them

179
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,660
I'm them. Oh, that's that's Tabitha

180
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
She's the my chemical romance

181
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,660
person and

182
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,220
Yeah, or you could do half black and half white and be the big Cruella fan. Yeah. Oh, that's Tabitha

183
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,820
She saw Cruella and it changed to change your shit. You can lean into Disney shit enough to where you become the Disney person

184
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,540
Oh, yeah, that's not hard. That's not hard. I've done that

185
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,540
I did it accidentally and I just woke up one day and I wasn't dizzy

186
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,140
It was the Disney boy is what my neighborhood calls me the incredible

187
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,500
They call me the incredible Disney boy the incredible funny sexy Disney boy the incredible hilarious

188
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,180
sexual

189
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
So that's all caps. Yeah

190
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,480
Disney boy just does a lot of Disney bounding and then he struts around just flexing them perks

191
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
Yeah, it's always Maui

192
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,500
Oh

193
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,460
What Disney cosplay showcases the pecs

194
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,820
Also scar if you do it, right scar. Oh, yeah, and even if you do it wrong, it's still gonna raise a few eyebrows

195
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Also few realizations

196
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,600
Awakening I could get him out as Pumba still

197
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,720
Yeah

198
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:03,180
Really any liking characters more about the butt though. Really any Lion King character is not gonna be wearing me clothes. Oh

199
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,260
That's true. They're very few. I mean Triton you could do Triton and get the pecs out. Yeah, Triton's all a Gaston

200
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:16,140
Gaston maybe a beach Gaston. What other shirtless Disney character Tarzan Tarzan Hercules

201
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:23,140
There's there's a part of Hercules where his onesie is ripped. I misspelled all three words

202
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,900
So excited was I to make this. Oh, yeah

203
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,540
Wow, that oughta completed way too quick on my Google

204
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:38,580
You guys are gonna get some weird as you guys aren't gonna believe this but a lot of these pictures I'm seeing aren't official

205
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,440
Licensed Disney images from the films really are they like from the novels or yeah

206
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,460
They're from the novelizations of the movies. I guess I don't think this Aladdin's even wearing pants, huh?

207
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,420
What a weird wish that was it you're uh, you're bullying that wasn't in your search query in the heuristics

208
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,740
How strange wait is your safe search off Griffin? You got turn it on you gotta turn it on

209
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,580
I

210
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,300
Rachel doesn't let me turn safe search off. That's for the best

211
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:20,460
It's definitely you could be ruined by five minutes on Google Lee shang from Mulan for sure. Oh, yeah, that's a go

212
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,680
And that's a good one. Let's get down to business. Don't mind if I do these buns. Oh, we did it. Damn it. Damn it

213
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:34,300
Wow. Hey, I've got a question from the internet a little wisdom from the crowd and it's coming from a wisdom of the crowd

214
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,060
It's a good name for this. I got some wisdom of the crowd and

215
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
it's coming from a news source that

216
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:47,380
Seems like it could be I don't know. I'm excited about it because I didn't realize that there were questions on

217
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
WikiHow and Emily

218
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,420
What trap I also pulled the WikiHow article Oh for this episode

219
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,180
Yeah, how wild is it how to hide from a murderer?

220
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,780
No, okay. Well that

221
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,420
That's the one I've chosen. Don't you have so many bits, please?

222
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,500
Please leave me these the crumbs and scraps of how to hide from a murderer on wikiHow

223
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,180
Thank you, Emily and wikiHow, if you remember on it's got a little charming little doodles and illustrations of how to do things that you

224
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,460
Probably shouldn't need a guide on how to do it. I don't know. There's some helpful stuff and how to hide from a murderer

225
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:33,660
Like hiding effectively. You got to use your barricades. Stay quiet. Turn your phone on silent people. This is not get murdered 101

226
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,580
101

227
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,380
That's like the opposite from what I learned from home alone

228
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,340
Hmm. Yeah, I guess he made himself known

229
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,540
He announced his presence. That's sort of the he gets for like the scream at the bear, right?

230
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,540
style of

231
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,580
Threat avoidance, right punch the shark in the nose

232
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,220
unless you think of Kevin McCallister as the killer at which point and you do part of and and

233
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Marv or whatever their names were

234
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:08,740
So they say to choose a hiding place that can be barricaded and then number three is obscure your location and then number four is

235
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,700
Avoid hiding together and the number five is hide in behind or under something. So most of these tips so far are

236
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,180
hide well

237
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,420
And how far down the list is like make the murderer fall in love with you. It's it's coming

238
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,700
There is one that says hide in plain sight is if necessary, which just means pretend to have already been murdered

239
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,620
So if the murder is in your house and sees your body on the floor and they'll be like did I already murdered them?

240
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,100
Shit, I forgot. I got so excited with all the murdering. I lost count of how many murders I've done shit

241
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,780
That really doesn't work if you live alone, though, does it? Yeah

242
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:48,220
Run away is on their head to safety plan to fight if you must is about halfway down

243
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,580
And that means, you know get an improvised weapon

244
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:58,860
And take their knife and use the knife on them to make them die instead. Yeah, here's the problem with that being so low down

245
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
The list though Griffin. Yeah, I've already

246
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,860
If I've just googled this because I need it in the moment, right and I've barricaded myself into my hiding spot

247
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,140
Mm-hmm, and I don't have the weapon with me. They should have put plan to fight if you need to first right then but

248
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,520
It's a number the part three of this article is planning ahead and it includes things like

249
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,660
Have a safe room and make sure you have important supplies in your safe room

250
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,480
Like according to this image two baseball bats and a shotgun and no food

251
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,900
So that's great. Now. Here's why I wanted to bring the wiki how I

252
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,820
Real briefly. I will say that I appreciate that plan ahead for getting murdered is sort of like normalization of an anxiety disorder

253
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Right, which I do enjoy that. Yeah. No, some of us have been doing that since we were

254
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,340
Planning ahead for everything. Yeah all the time

255
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,340
Now I wanted to bring wiki how because I didn't realize this until Emily sent this in at the bottom of every wiki

256
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,540
how article there is a community Q&A and

257
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,140
There's some good stuff in there. The answers are provided by the community

258
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,780
The questions are asked by the community and let's just go down

259
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,780
I think they are ranked by how helpful they have been found by the community

260
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,860
So we can start at the top

261
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,660
Are we allowed to randomly throw snake steak knives at them?

262
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,620
If you someone's trying to kill you you can defend yourself

263
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,220
But throwing steak knife seems like a good way to arm your attacker, especially if you are not a skilled knife thrower

264
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,140
I can I ran randomly certainly implies that right? I mean randomly throwing steak knives

265
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,540
No, if you're targeting yeah sort of serving the jellies of the bar, right?

266
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,540
Can I calculatedly throw steak knife at the body? Yeah, that's it

267
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,700
And we do get into sort of I believe it differs state to state on whether or not

268
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,420
If you hurt the intruder

269
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,340
Then is it okay and that gets us into some weird territory. One of the questions is straight up

270
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,880
What should I do if I accidentally kill the murderer while fighting which I want to be like

271
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
listen to somebody

272
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,820
Put the cart before the murder horse a little bit

273
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,780
If someone breaks into my house to murder me and my mind jumps to oh, I hope I don't murder them

274
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:19,500
Now I do like the use of the word though in the question of allowed as though you would start throwing steak knives at the

275
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,380
Murderer and the murderer be like hey now. Yeah, that's dirty pool

276
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,940
Now another question is what if the murderer finds you in your hiding spot and they say fight back and aim for the head

277
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,300
Especially the temple neck or eyes with the weapon or the eyes neck and nose with your hands using tightly closed fists

278
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,900
Okay, am I supposed to do that or pretend to already be murdered?

279
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,860
Like what the third the third option is obviously they find you and then you say oh you got me

280
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:50,940
Okay. Now you hide and I'll seek. Yeah, see cuz 5050 that's gonna work. Yeah, and now my man gets in there

281
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,260
I don't know who asked this but it's me in another dimension asks. What if I need to use the bathroom while hiding?

282
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:04,500
Absolutely, my two concerns when murder breaks in my house is one and I I hope I don't murder them instead and two

283
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,740
this would be

284
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,660
Pretty choice right about now, and I don't know how long I'm gonna be able you could do am you could do amnesty?

285
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,820
Oh, I'm out timeout timeout amnesty timeout timeout timeout

286
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,420
See, this is why it helps to have a cube because if you have a cube, that's your panic room and your bathroom

287
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Oh

288
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,000
Open up the container and see just the the the orange liquid floating inside

289
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,220
Immediately it's air so some of Joey's

290
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:47,100
Aerosol talks into humans. It's too soon. My molecular structure, please. You've already I'm here to marry you Jeff. Joey

291
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,300
Just so you've already killed me man. This new M night movie is really weird

292
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:01,500
Traver you talking about old the new M night movie old old where people go to old beach and become old

293
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
in old

294
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,960
Catch old this summer with in night Shyamalan's old

295
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,720
Starring Joey Chester. I had it. I had a great real briefly. I my wife said to me

296
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,140
Did you hear about the new M night movie and I said?

297
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,020
No, and she briefly told me about it and she said it's supposed to be a return to form for M night

298
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm like, hmm. Okay. She said although I heard that the Ville the the visit was supposed to be good

299
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:37,380
So maybe that was his return to form and I said sweetheart we watched the visit we saw this film and she said well

300
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,380
I guess it probably wasn't a form

301
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,260
We did watch the film and not maintain any of the memories of his form is something new now

302
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,980
He has a new form

303
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,820
I just wanted to close this out with one of the last questions is what if I just gave up and let him take me like

304
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,140
If he won fair and square and they answered

305
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,100
I

306
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,260
Respect

307
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,540
That's good sportsmanship. I like that if he was a murderer then he'd most likely kill you

308
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,580
So I don't recommend this to push course of action

309
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:04,820
Yeah

310
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,860
But at a certain point also like if I don't have my weapons and I'm laying on the floor and the murder says hey

311
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,020
Straight up. I don't think I murdered you yet. Did I and I rolled over like nah

312
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
There's nothing I can do now

313
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
peace

314
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,540
Ah take me you win you did it congratulations

315
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,340
I was worried. I was gonna murder you there for a second, but it looks like that was an unfounded

316
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:38,300
First could I please do it so that my family members don't find me in a big sticky mess. Ah, let's take a break

317
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:50,580
Okay. Yeah for sure. We've been working hard

318
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,420
Hey, do you guys ever get home from the store and you're like no

319
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,300
Okay

320
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,500
I went to the store to get batteries and you come home and you've got a watermelon and you got some shredded cheese

321
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,740
Then you got a mylar balloon. Yeah, what did you forget?

322
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,540
batteries

323
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:13,860
You know, yeah. Yeah. Oh, what are you gonna do? Go back out to the store? No, you're gonna get on door-dash

324
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:20,740
That's right door-dash. It connects you to restaurants and what's that stores? Yeah groceries and stuff

325
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,300

I stitch fix since you close in a box and that's ideal because shopping for clothes is a terrible process that nobody

333
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,000
Actually enjoys and the people who say they do are lying to you to be sounding like impressive

334
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,640
But stitch fix doesn't care about that stitch fix says hey

335
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,620
tell us about you and your size and your style and your budget and then they have heart and your heart and the size of

336
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,660
Your heart and then they will have a stylus that just sends you clothes that you keep your favorite ones

337
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:35,580
And you send back the rest of them and it has free shipping with easy returns and exchanges and they send a little prepaid return

338
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,600
Envelope, so it's like no sweat at all

339
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,060
Speaking of no sweat the latest box I got from stitch fix was filled

340
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:50,260
Exclusively with moisture wicking fabric clothing and I saw this and I said stitch fix. I don't know about this one my body

341
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,260
I don't really push it to

342
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,180
I don't really push it to the point where it creates

343
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,300
generalized

344
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,420
Sort of body moisture

345
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:07,100
But you know what barely has enough of what he needs in his body at any given time without excreting he needs to reabsorb that

346
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,020
Exactly, but guess what?

347
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,100
I put some of these bad boys on

348
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,340
While I did not use them in this sort of athletic way that they were maybe intended

349
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:22,340
They still covered my body and kept me cool and dry and so well sleep clothes comfortable sleep clothes. Absolutely

new sandwich influenced by the bold flavor of Louisiana cuisine now I did want to

382
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,780
Just the most word salad

383
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,720
jumble of nonsense in this quote

384
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,740
announcing this

385
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,100
from Scott the veep of product innovation and development for Sonic

386
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,780

This delicacy the flavors make people like people are looking for in food is flavor. Okay with a smoky southern style mayo

390
00:31:51,820 --> 00:32:00,580
the popcorn chicken po boy spins a sonic staple the guests know and love with subtle notes of thyme oregano red pepper and

391
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:08,920
Paprika which complement the juicy tenderness in the chicken and bring out a harmony of flavors and a tasty delicate spice level

392
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,080
Can I please be done with my quote? Please? I can't let me go. I want to go home and see my kids

393
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,440
That's the end of Scott's quote. That is a that's good. That sounds not right. It looks like a good sandwich

394
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,360
It's on a hinge slice roll, but you know, you know how we do it here on the squad

Concert tour is munches make-believe band. Chuck e cheese is rock-afire explosion. I

412
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
Honestly, I'm we grew up in like

413
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,480
We grew up in like, you know, we grew up in a Billy Bob house right now like so I don't actually know

414
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,920
We've only ever had hydrox. I've never had Oreo before

415
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,120
That kind of thing

416
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
It's that kind of thing

417
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm trying to figure out how to listen to this this

418
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm just saying if y'all have never seen Billy you put Billy Bob up against the Chuck e cheese any day of the week

419
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,040
Billy Bob, he seems approachable. Yeah, seems like a kind of bear. You could have a beer with he's a big friendly bear

420
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,920
With a with a bird in a can and he plays but then cheese scares the shit out of me

421
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,120
Oh the teams are afraid of five nights at Freddy's

422
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,160
But I could just can't do it cuz I'm I grew up in the shadow of this big friendly hillbilly bear and I love him

423
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:44,720
So much hurt me. I trust that boy with my life now. I don't trust that wolf over there stage left

424
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,240
No, right the wolf with a puppet. Yeah, not even

425
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,440
Yeah, the wolf with a puppet the wolf who is a puppet himself who also has a puppet part

426
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,960
No, thanks

427
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,000
Good news everybody. Don't worry. I did manage to secure some tracks

428
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:17,360
From the new Chuck e cheese joint, so let's just let's just I'm just gonna let her rip. Hold on

429
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's such a perfect day

430
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:44,060
I can't wait to feel this

431
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Oh

432
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,620
Okay, so you get the well right off the bat can I acknowledge two things yeah it slaps

433
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,880
Trips and bops and fucking hits and it hits so hard. It kind of feels like this song is about the end of kovat

434
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:35,400
Oh, it doesn't kind of feel like that trap. It is that a hundred percent Chuck Charles entertainment cheeses tacit

435
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,880
Acknowledgement of the existence of kovat and how glad he is that it is passed by the way

436
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:49,040
Fucking Charles if I can speak to you over here for a minute. I saw your ads in fucking like May of

437
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,920
2020 where you're showing people cleaning tables and you're like we keep it clean. So mom will be happy to

438
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,400
Open for business

439
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,360
You've been partying non-stop my friend

440
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,520
No question. No questions on this. You've not been separate for anybody

441
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,600
You've been partying all year

442
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,080
But I also want to acknowledge that this song falls into my favorite sub genre of music

443
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,680
Which is songs about other songs

444
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,040
When you have a song that's talking about like their favorite song on the radio or like hey DJ turn that music up or like oh

445
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Hey, it's not the greatest song in the world

446
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,620
Right gosh songs about other songs that are not the song that we're singing is my favorite sub

447
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,520
Genre of music and I can't believe Chuck E. Cheese just added a new track

448
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,360
I feel like after hearing this I

449
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:48,680
Have an image of how Charles entertainment cheese conducts himself on social media, and I'm not saying that he is like

450
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:56,600
a full-blown anti-vaxxer, but I definitely think he's the type to just like be like I'm just asking the questions. Oh

451
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,120
Nothing wrong. I'm just asking questions. Oh

452
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,640
I just retweeted it to see what you guys thought you guys were inflamed to

453
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,680
discussion

454
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:15,560
Yes, can I just real quick? I'm gonna this fucking album. This is like I thought it would be kind of a goof

455
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,440
This song this album is 12 songs long. There's 12 different tracks on here

456
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,580
I'm gonna read you all the tracks and you guys get to tell me which one you want to hear 30 seconds of

Heard it was extremely good beach party bash dog days this summer. Let's be friends

459
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,600
Oh, I dare you not to laugh that sounds like kind of uh, you know, how like a lot of rap albums

460
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm like improv tracks. Oh, yes sounds like kind like that. You know, I mean, I dare you not to laugh stay positive

461
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,600
Which I'm assuming is a cover of the whole steady song

462
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,000
lend a helping hand

463
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Elray guitarista

464
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,960
game on

465
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,560
Crochet all day crochet all day disco dancing dinosaur party

466
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,860
Fuck and then the last song is called Chucky cheese is all about fun by Chucky cheese. Damn it Justin

467
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,120
We can only pick one. I know

468
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,960
Fuck, I will dip in on some of these we'll let you check out pick what you each get to pick one

469
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,960
I'll eat you Justin. I would like to hear crochet all day. I think that that's what every crochet all day is bonkers

470
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:33,200
Recently, I've been spending a little more time at home like a lot of people these days hanging out on my own

471
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,800
Time with fun things is really not that tough

472
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,660
But finding that one new passion is proving to be rough. I've done puzzles right juggling

473
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,760
Coloring magic to stuff video chat is fun

474
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Especially when it's with you

475
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,260
Gaming binge watching I even try croquet

476
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:15,260
But nothing has been quite as fun as my new hobby called crochet that is bracing

477
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,700
That is okay. The song's not great, but that that's surprise sort of

478
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:26,660
Key shift out there. Yeah, I did not sound like a little Sally Hall track. Okay, great. Yeah

479
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:33,460
Oh god, what was the one about making you laugh? I dare you not to laugh. I mean, this is a comedy program

480
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,300
Want to play a game? Do you even have to ask? Of course, I want to play a game

481
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,460
Okay, this game is called

482
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,420
I dare you not to laugh and the point of the game is to try to think of funny things to make the other person

483
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,140
Laugh and hi, it's me. Justin. I

484
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,060
Don't know

485
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
What Charles is about?

486
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,820
It has been by his admission a long fucking yeah. Yep

487
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,740
So and he may not if you're able to keep a straight face without laughing then you win. Oh

488
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:11,860
This sounds fun. All right, I'll go first. Let's see if you can withstand the silliness. I

489
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:19,420
I dare you not to laugh. I challenge you not to giggle. Do you think you can be serious?

490
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,780
No smiling not even a little I dare you not to chuckle. Oh

491
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,060
Look at this funny giraffe. I dare you not to laugh

492
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,900
Start when it's the funny shit start Charles. Oh you didn't hear that Griffin

493
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
He said that was a picture of a funny giraffe

494
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
Funny giraffe

495
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,660
Oh, yeah

496
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:49,900
How about a platypus wearing a tutu this pickle high-fiving a horse an elephant riding a surfboard

497
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:55,580
This bumblebee eating s'mores a kitty cat getting a haircut this pig taking a bath

498
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:01,860
A monkey doing a cartwheel. I dare you not to laugh. Okay, so it seems okay. Yeah

499
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,260
seems

500
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,180
Cats sometimes need to be groomed so

501
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,420
that

502
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,700
One was that one was out. It's that one was out of sight

503
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,020
I I a platypus pointed to two is fucking universally like very funny and I won't

504
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,340
Pickle high-fiving a horse frankly that one I was not expecting that it also didn't fit the mold

505
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,940
Everything else was an animal doing something and this was something doing something to an animal. Yeah

506
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,900
Yeah, it kind of feels like it feels like Charles's entire definition of comedy is

507
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,500
Okay, something doing something to an animal yes

508
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:56,860
Hey, sorry Charles, are you very busy or are you crochet? Well, I could be busy

509
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,500
I

510
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,340
Hey Helen, what are you having fun?

511
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
You get to live another day

512
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,620
This is like

513
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,100
Sorry, I try to say you you get to live another day

514
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:45,420
Yeah, I just I I hate to just really monopolize the show like this

515
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,660
But I do want to know what dinosaur disco dance party is

516
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,180
All about fun sure I love this

517
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:03,740
That's what it says

518
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,900
Adapted with the time and game distinction she wrote a novel

519
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,300
Okay

520
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,740
So, okay this rules she escaped the sink

521
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:48,500
Yeah, she's a state extinction and wrote a novel I achieved distinction. All right, that's a highlight

522
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,060
I like that one quite a bit. That was that was a good track

523
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,860
It kind of feels like they build a whole album around one single. Yeah. Yeah

524
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,660
So he's gonna be

525
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,220
Hitting the road

526
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,020

The new summer fun path. I'm not gonna read their promotion. It doesn't matter quote

529
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:22,260
We know our guests have missed seeing Chuck E in our stores. That's the other thing that's worth noting is like

530
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,300
They got rid of all Chuck E. Cheese in all stores because they're like kids

531
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,420
But maybe he'll come to his tour

532
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:37,100
He's been hard at work writing music and recording a new album that sure to delight fans of all ages

533
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,060
Said someone there

534
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:45,980
we're thrilled that Chuck E and the band are hitting the road to rock fans with our iconic fun tracks and

535
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:53,800
Signature sounds at beaches and parks across the country and we're making it easy and affordable for families to keep the summer fun going

00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,660
having the time of his life, so

550
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,020
I'm really excited about that. It's good stuff

551
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,540
Get out there and see Chuck. I'm sure he'd love to see you

552
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,980
He's been as he is apparently just telling everybody really cooped up really cooped up ready to fuck

553
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,980
I'm trying a lot of new things. It sounds like yeah, he's trying a lot of new things. Yeah, pretty much

554
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,980
He said he's open to anything. Yeah

555
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,900
He has another song didn't make the album called

556
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,300
Called that. Dr. Fauci wouldn't let me have my fun break

557
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:32,580
They had to cut that one for very obvious reasons there's another one called dr. Fauci enemy of fun

558
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,380
Dr. Fauci hates pizza is another one. That's on the album

559
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,740
Dr. Fauci won't admit he's my dad. Yeah, despite having a lot of paperwork

560
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,300
This is stone. Yeah, you want to do one more question? Maybe I want to help

561
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:55,500
You always see in movies and stuff that putting a ring of salt in the ground is supposed to protect you from ghosts

562
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,900
But how high up off the ground?

563
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:04,420
Can you get before the protection is no longer effective if I put a big ring of salt down and then fly been a helicopter?

564
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,780
Are the ghosts gonna get me or does the salt produce a sort of anti ghost cylinder?

565
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,620
That extends all the way up to the stratosphere. That's from ruminating about revenants in Richmond

566
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,500
And I mean you're thinking purely terrestrially like once you get out in a space like up and down

567
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,940
Don't mean anything anymore. So like how can you even know that you're still?

568
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,620
In this in the circle so to speak

569
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,100
Well, and I would also say you're only thinking in the up direction

570
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,180
You have to think if you put the ring of salt on this side of the planet

571
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,220
Mm-hmm on the other side of the planet. Yeah, that's stop. Okay, like it's a beam

572
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,780
why is it less able to stop ghosts through sediment right and and

573
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,260
Molten core than it is, you know

574
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,100
Is it now is it maybe just that the ghosts don't like the smell of the salt?

575
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,380
And so it's not even the shape like if you just pour some salt on the ground a ghost comes near it and they're like no

576
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:02,380
I'm trying to watch my sodium and they leave. I don't think it's the circle because this makes no blood pressure thing

577
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,960
It's a blood pressure thing or I I I think it's so stupid. Okay

578
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,460
It's so fucking stupid

579
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,660
Wow that in in the in literature and stuff

580
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:21,780
It's like make a ring of salt to protect you from ghosts. Hey, I have things to do. How about this?

581
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:27,940
How about I make a ring of salt around this ghost and go live my fucking? Oh, that's right

582
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:34,020
How about he stays there and I put up a sign that's like warning dickhead ghosts say away

583
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:39,300
Don't fuck with do not mess with salt avoid if rains if rains run

584
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,540
Please trap ghosts again. Have shit to do find salt in cabinet next to the peanut butter

585
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,980
And you know the other no on the other side, that's sugar. Don't you sugar? Don't you sugar?

586
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,620
They'll just laugh and that will bring ants and also hey slugs. Just look out

587
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,980
Slugs look out this signs for you to slug out slugs. They're good for your garden

588
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,820
You don't you don't want to kill don't kill it slugs. Just trap the ghost if it's a ghost

589
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,860
Spare the slugs. Oh, man. What if

590
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:13,940
What if us you drop some salt and it kills a slug and then the slugs ghost comes out? He's like, well fuck

591
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:22,180
No, I don't like this at all. Okay. Hey shark tank. I've got a million dollar idea. Okay, okay

592
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,860
salted belts

593
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,300
You can wear them salt always got a ring of salt with you in this and it's just that your belt is soaked in salt

594
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,020
That's good

595
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:36,140
And if you're eating some flavorless popcorn you take the little guy out and you just a quick swiper across the belt

596
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:41,500
Not too much though. Not too much because they eventually go so get through. Yeah, you'll wear down your moment Travis

597
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,020
This protects this definitely is gonna protect my thorax from ghosts and my legs and feet. I love that

598
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,540
But what about my appendages? Yeah, salty the bracelets. So bracelets. Oh

599
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,980
Hey, you're starting to play fast and loose with geometry. Okay, fine a salted suit

600
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,740
So the whole suit is circular. Is it a circular? Oh jerky's it?

601
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:09,260
Oh this that raises an interesting question if a ghost comes into my house and tries to murder me and all of my techniques

602
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,020
That I learned in this episode are proving ineffective

603
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,020
if I

604
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,940
Run into the kitchen can't find the salt, but I do grab about a bag of Chex mix and I do a circle of that

605
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:26,500
Does the does the latent salt on the Chex mix provide the necessary?

606
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,900
Chemistry to make the ghost go away. Well, here's the good news Griffin

607
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,940
I I think it does but even if it doesn't it's going to start a conversation

608
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,660
It is yeah, and if the ghost is also a vampire

609
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,340
It's gonna slow that vampire down because if you spill a bag of something in front of a vampire they have to count it

610
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:53,140
Yeah, so they have to stop and count if it's like rice or grain or whatever, which I think Chex mix pretty grainy

611
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,260
Pretty grainy. Yeah, it's gonna work. Sure. So that's gonna stop a

612
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,860
