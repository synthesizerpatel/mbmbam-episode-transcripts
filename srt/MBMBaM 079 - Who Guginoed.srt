1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,720
It's the most wonderful time of the year. Pretty sure that's exactly how you started

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,120
it last year. Is it really? That's a tradition now. Now it's not me ripping off a bit for myself

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,600
for a year ago. It's a tradition. It is the birthday episode, all three of us, November 8th,

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,520
blowing it up with our big B-day. Happy birthday to all three of us. Travis, are you stoked about

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,120
your B-day? I'm so stoked. What are you looking forward to the most? The presents, the gifts,

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,440
the cheer? The chicken fried bacon. You're gonna get some chicken fried bacon for your birthday.

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm gonna get all the chicken fried bacon for my birthday. Is that a gift? It seems like,

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,240
what's the opposite of what a gift is for your apartment and liver? It's a punishment. Now,

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,960
Griffin, what is your big birthday plan? My big birthday plan is to put myself into a state of

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,880
cryo sleep for six months until it is really my birthday. Okay, well, let's take a quick poll.

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
I feel like everybody on the show's birthday is November 8th, so let me go around and we'll see

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,920
if my birthday is November 8th. Yeah. Oh, my birthday is November 8th. My birthday is November

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,640
8th. No, wait. No, it's not. Is it not? That does not ring true. It's April 17th.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,600
Wow, that sucks. It's so fucking far. I could not be fucking further away. And it sucks because I

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,120
know the two of you were conceived on Valentine's Day. It just adds up. Don't do this to me. Don't

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,080
do this to me. And when was I? Not on this day. What could I possibly have been? Fourth of July.

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,760
I guess I could be. Those fireworks going off. It's pretty romantic. Stop it! I can't do this

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,520
to you. You're killing me. I love you. Let's conceive. Two birthday presents now is what I

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,760
need. I can't even handle this advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,200
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your youngest brother.

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,040
Most independent. Not celebrating. No birthday today. Most patriotic brother. My wife just

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,760
brought me coffee. That's awesome. Oh, man. Yeah. Wait, your wife just brought me coffee?

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,240
That's impossible. Holy shit. Time walker. It's a birthday miracle. It's a birthday miracle.

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,160
My wife's a time walker. This is, of course, an advice show for the modern era. Let's dip right

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,760
in to the help, to the advice. I feel like it's going to be a good show. We got a lot of exciting

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,840
stuff today. We got guest stars, several guest stars. Is it their birthday? Did we even bother

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
ask? It may or may not be their birthday. Let's assume it is. Let's assume it's all of their

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,360
birthdays. We got a big, big live show announcement. We've got lots of people to help and so much more.

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:34,640
Let's dip right in. My friends and I go weekly to a pub trivia night. About two months ago,

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
two strangers asked to join our team. That was fine, but then they started showing up almost

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
every week. This could have been okay, but they're both quite full of themselves. Talk over the other

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
people. Don't let people provide questions to answers. They're sucking the joy out of our

37
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,640
trivia experience. So, how do we get them off the team? And that is actually from Team Croco Swine.

38
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,560
It's one of the oldest stories in the book. I think people who have spent years educating

39
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,960
themselves on trivia, the one area in which minutia escapes them is in matters of the human heart.

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Which is why we're here. That is rarely a subject of a pub trivia night. Yeah, usually just go with

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:27,920
Superior Vina Cava. That's usually what's up. I think I maybe have done like bar trivia like once.

42
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah. Is this like a high stakes game? It gets pretty high fee. Yeah, it gets hot. It gets hot.

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,200
I've been on two award-winning trivia teams. The Amazing Larry and the Robert C. Byrd Institute

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,520
for Trivia. And both like real grand slam high stakes teams. And we got to the national

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,320
championships, won a few grando. I mean, it gets hot. I was not on that national championship team.

46
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
I just don't understand this heightened emotion where you can't just be like,

47
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,920
hey, I think maybe it's just going to be me and my friends tonight.

48
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,640
Friendship, honestly, can't factor into it because you need to build a streamlined

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,040
minutia knowing machine. You need to put together an internet of people that know everything.

50
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Yeah. You need to build it. You need to make a human Google. And it's hard to do that when you

51
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,400
let a bunch of randos in. Well, what if you just like wore a visor and carried around a clipboard

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,440
and walked up to them and said, hey, you're cut. Yeah, you're out. I think that's an option. I

53
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,440
think you could show everybody could show up as a new team next week. A reformed like, you know,

54
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080
when they, you know, when they reform a band with everybody except one guy, you're like,

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,200
wait a minute. You were a member of Jefferson Airplane. Right. You're Jefferson Starship.

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,040
We're Jefferson Trivia Starship. We are going a whole new direction. What am I thinking of?

57
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,360
Who did that? It was a whole same band except for the one person there. I mean, I guess Van Halen

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,960
is sort of like that, but they remain the same band. It'll come to me. I guess the Elvis Costello's

59
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
imposters are sort of like that because they're the attractions and they cut Elvis Costello. They cut

60
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,920
Elvis Costello out. Bad career. Now they just do Jefferson Airplane songs. That's a good that's a

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,360
good option to make a new team. Also, if they're randos, just say to tell them to start their own

62
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
goddamn team. Yeah. Like, hey, I don't fucking know you. I don't know. You're not. Please stop.

63
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,200
You're not my buddy. Yeah. We're not bros. Wait, could you do like a surgical like skip three

64
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,240
nights? Yeah. See that. I usually do that whenever, uh, like I used to do karaoke at this one place.

65
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,120
I had some clingers, you know, people liked my star power. Right. Said you have a star quality

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,760
and I'm attracted to that. I want to be near you. I want to be near eventually. I want to be near

67
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,680
and around you and eventually had to stop coming for a little bit and give them time to cool,

68
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,600
cool their jets, you know, ice their heels, let them orbit around another star for a few. Yeah.

69
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,320
See how that works out. And, uh, and, and after a few weeks I came back cleansed cleanse, but they

70
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,600
were still, I was doing them. I was doing the master cleanse. Weren't they? That's important

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,560
to the stage. The stage door Johnny's waiting. We're doing the all juice karaoke diet. Nothing

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,760
but ginger water. And, um, I was saying so good after work. No toxins, no toxins in this body.

73
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,720
That's a, that's a good remedy. That's a good home remedy tip. What about just sitting in a

74
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:41,120
smaller table? Why don't you go fucking solo? That's a power play. What? That's a, that's like,

75
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,560
that's like going solo in euchre. It's like, you gotta, you gotta have the faith in yourself

76
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,440
to achieve your dreams. If you do, if you do do it though, please refer to yourself

77
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:00,160
as Crom door of the all knowing me. No, no, no. I'm a member of team Jeff. What's your team name?

78
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,000
Dave. That is, that's just, that's my name is Dave. I think you didn't tell him to stop. I mean, like

79
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,440
America, we gotta get better at telling randos where to get off. These are randos and their

80
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,120
stop is this week. You tell them, listen guys, uh, this is kind of a French thing that we did

81
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,120
with friends and we, we need you to go. You can go right there. There's the door. Here's the thing

82
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
there. I can't think of any repercussions that could happen. It's not like you're going to kick

83
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,800
them off the team and they're going to like slit your tires or something better team. See, that's

84
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,840
all I can think is that they come back at you as like the, you know, river bottom nightmare band

85
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,520
and they take you out. I can't, I think you have to be very clear if they're the weak links in your

86
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,880
team. That's the more important thing. And maybe if you have some sort of, wait a minute, what if

87
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,600
you have some sort of trivia showdown? You say the team's too crowded. We need to winnow it down to

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,640
the essentials. And then you have a series of questions that only relate to things that you and

89
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,640
your friends remember at Steve's birthday party last year. What kind of cake did we have? Darla,

90
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:17,840
who did you blow and never tell anyone about it? It's me. Sorry, Jeff. Sorry, Randy. You're off the

91
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:28,400
team assholes. This, this situation seems to happen a lot more, more than just one than just team

92
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,440
trivia occasions. Like I have, it happens a lot and it sucks every time it does. Like if you're

93
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,960
at a concert and there's somebody there who doesn't know anybody. So there's like, Hey,

94
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,480
can I hang out with your group? And you're like, you can't say no, but at the same time, I guess,

95
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,600
I guess different question though, if it's one person, because I feel like one person,

96
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,280
that's just sort of like a nice thing you're doing. These guys are a unit, you know, like

97
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,520
they're two dudes. Just tell them to go, tell them it's time to go. I think, I think that

98
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,520
the problem is if they had been like, can I join your team? And then they would have been awesome

99
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,760
and like buying drinks for everybody and super cool and getting all the questions right. No problem

100
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,800
whatsoever, but they failed the audition. They suck at this. Like they're not getting the questions

101
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120
right. They talk over people. Like I think that you're perfectly within your rights to be like,

102
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
Hey, we let you onto our team. We tried it out and it's just not working out. Thanks.

103
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Can I, can I talk about it? A serious character deficit that this country is experiencing right

104
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:33,040
now. It seems like, and I don't know if I've ever had this kind of friend, but it seems like

105
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,200
the pushy, sort of bossy, sassy friend is gone. It's no longer exists. He's like the bee. He's

106
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,080
like the modern bee. He's gone. He's just vanished from the earth. You need a pushy bossy friend that

107
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,720
can be like, nope, everybody needs a Vince Vaughn. Everyone does need a Vince Vaughn. And it just

108
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
seems like that that's a, that person no longer exists. And I don't know why. Do you think it's

109
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,920
because of the internet? I think it's because of like PC movements and everybody trying to

110
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,880
be very delicate and careful about everyone's feelings and all that stuff. See, I'm that,

111
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,280
I'm that though. Am I part of the problem? I don't think I can, I can experience a sea change like

112
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,640
that. Or all of a sudden I can walk into a bar and be like, I don't like this. You know? Here's

113
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,800
what it is. The Vince Vaughn friend is a friend that it's, it's, it's difficult to keep them around

114
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,280
all the time because that's the friend that you end up saying like, well, if you knew him, he's a

115
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,400
great guy. You just don't know him like I know him. You're right. Right. And I think everybody

116
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,000
does have that friend, but it's harder to keep that friend as time goes on. I'm saying if you're

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,920
young and you're still trying to figure out who you are in this world, I think maybe put your chips

118
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,880
down on Sass. Double down on Sass. Double down. But not everyone can do it. I, I've known some

119
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,160
people who are just assholes, but then there's the really likable asshole and that if you can't pull

120
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,400
off likable asshole, you really got out of the game. You got to thread that needle. But listen,

121
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,840
like if you don't want these people on your trivia team, they have failed. Like that's the most sort

122
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,240
of regimented social interaction you could possibly have. There's a designated start time,

123
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,400
a designated stop time. If you don't want these guys on your trivia team, you don't want them in

124
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,640
your life. Fuck them. You don't even know them. They're strangers. It's not like there's a history.

125
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,120
You're not going to ruin your friendship with them. Guys, what if they're strong?

126
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,320
What if they're strong? What if they're grownups? Oh, they're big kids. You're saying like physically

127
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
imposing. I mean, if they're big and strong, you can't tell, you can't tell a big, strong

128
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,840
grownup where to get off. Yeah. Right. Didn't think about that. An older boy said you were on

129
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,360
my trivia team now. So I guess you are. Yeah. I talked to my dad. He said, I'm on it. So handle,

130
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,880
handle that. Hey guys, is this, is it acceptable when you have a back itch to scratch it on various

131
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,400
public services, like the corner of a wall or a shelf of some kind itchy in Indiana? Well,

132
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:06,080
Baloo the bear. Um, it sounds like you're in a tailspin. Let's pull out of it. Let's just boil

133
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:16,000
this down to the bear necessities. Oh God. Um, crap. This is, this is use your hand. Get your

134
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,760
hand back there or a friend's hand. It doesn't work. I re I reach for Richard. He's bear scratch.

135
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,000
When I'm in this situation, you may remember him. He's, he was balloon boy's dad, a real nut job,

136
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,560
but he has a device that he will sell you on the internet 30 for two. Uh, you can find this

137
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,160
at bear scratch.com. And, uh, it is the, the tagline is if you itch like a son of a Twitch.

138
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,240
Oh God. You need the patent pending bear scratch. It is basically a piece of wood that you tie to

139
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:59,040
your wall. It's basically what's up. If, if your son is a guy that you shoot into the sky balloon

140
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:07,040
boy jokes. I believe it is not acceptable, but it does feel so damn good. I do it all the time.

141
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,080
Sure. What do you say when you're caught in the act? What are you doing to that shelf? Travis?

142
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,800
I say, um, don't judge my love. Okay. Don't you? You don't know me. You don't know this wood.

143
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:30,320
Uh, he started it. He just blamed the wood. He itched. He was scratching on me on the wall on

144
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,920
retropenis bear scratch. Can you not just wear like a wool sweater and then just shimmy around

145
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,560
and it scratches all of you at once. What can you not reach? How big a boy are you?

146
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,920
That's what I'm saying. What if you just started screaming? There's ants in my clothes.

147
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,280
Okay. Who's going to judge you then? Well, it was an emergency yet. Every person. Why is it,

148
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,320
why are your clothes so sticky? Sweet. Why, why is it preferable Travis? Like why is it

149
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,400
preferable to think for people to think of you as the guy with bugs in his clothes? Yeah. You

150
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,920
can stealthily scratch yourself on a shelf, but if you yell, oh, let me throw this out.

151
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,120
The awkward part of scratching your back on an object is like you get into it and you close

152
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,920
your eyes and then you open your eyes and realize people are staring at you. Right?

153
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,160
What if you just kept your eyes open the whole time and stared right back at him while you did

154
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,920
it? It turns out this gets into a weird erotic territory. Watch me do this. Watch me do this.

155
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,640
This is the weirdest scene in Basic Instinct. Can we invent like a fun dance that you do

156
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,200
when you need to itch yourself and then people will be like, oh, he's doing the itchy jiggle.

157
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,800
Well, the bear scratch dance is actually available on iTunes if you want to grab that.

158
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
Do the bear scratch. Do the bear scratch dance.

159
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,440
I have a, one wall of my apartment is sort of just covered in stone outcroppings and let me

160
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,200
tell you, it's like, it's like God's fingernails. You just get right up against that and no, you,

161
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,680
I have never, I haven't itched since I lived here.

162
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,760
Wow. That's a good record.

163
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
It's pretty great.

164
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,200
It's a good streak. You got to keep that going.

165
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,640
It's like a loofah made of stone.

166
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
I wouldn't leave my house because I'd be too worried that like,

167
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
what if you get out in public and your back starts itching and the streak is broken.

168
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Yeah. I gotta, I gotta go home you guys.

169
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,440
Guinness. It's me. It's Griffin. It's over. Shut it down. I tried my best. Didn't work out.

170
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

171
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,520
Yeah, that'd be great.

172
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,120
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker. Thank you by Jake. Thank you by, thank you by Jacob.

173
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,840
You're welcome.

174
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jess who asks, what is the stripper etiquette for Canada?

175
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,960
Okay. This is a random thought. I have no intention of going to a strip club,

176
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,000
even though I am legal. FYI. It's just, this is bugging me.

177
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,960
First off, you're totally thinking about going to a strip club, but yeah.

178
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,760
You know how in movies they toss strippers dollar bills? Well, in Canada,

179
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,240
we have loonies and toonies. So do you like toss coins at the person?

180
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,840
Oh God.

181
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,880
Or are Canadian strippers more costly than Americans just because of our bill system?

182
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,400
In Canada, is the minimum bill tossing rule is $5 since that's our smallest bill.

183
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,760
I'm honestly not trying to be rude. So if it offends anyone, I really mean no harm.

184
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,440
I want you to know Griffin that after, what is this? Episode 79, 79 episodes,

185
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,080
you finally asked a Yahoo Answers question that made me go, wait, that's a good question.

186
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,360
Yeah. Is it?

187
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,560
Do you just throw the coins at them? That seems rude.

188
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,640
Hey, whatever happened, excuse me, whatever happened to Galaxia who used to dance here?

189
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
Yeah, that was real sad, eh? She got a loonie in her poonie.

190
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
It was a real sad situation that one, eh?

191
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,920
So a loonie, I just Googled is a Canadian $1 coin.

192
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,400
First of all, I would like to point out that I believe that this person has never been to

193
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,400
a strip club because no strip club I've ever been to

194
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,920
incorporate to just throwing money at the stripper.

195
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
Take these.

196
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,240
Like wadding up the bill and trying to hit her in the face with it. That's not how that works.

197
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,400
I have to disagree with you here, Travis. I actually saw a stripper who was, I believe,

198
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,600
a little person. If not, she was quite short, put a cup in front of her zone down there.

199
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Uh-huh, her zone.

200
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,240
Her sin spot. She put a cup in front of her zone and people took turns throwing

201
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
dollar bills in there and if they-

202
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,160
That's the worst bozo show game I've ever had.

203
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
If they sunk a shot, then they got, well, it's unspeakable what happened to them.

204
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,240
Oh, Jesus.

205
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,280
It sounds like he was not there, Travis. I'm sorry. Not there that night.

206
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,760
So the Canadian version, it sounds like whenever you go to like a Taco Bell and they have that

207
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,640
little thing where you drop the quarter in and you try to land it on the plates.

208
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,360
And if you do, you get like a crunch, a crunch wrap.

209
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,160
But instead of that, you try to throw a loonie on an old lady's bosom.

210
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,040
I understand now why every time I've gone to a Canadian strip club,

211
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,960
they have those little bus driver change things on their belts.

212
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
And you give them a $5 bill and you're like, I need three back.

213
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,640
And they're like, okay, kachunk, kachunk, kachunk. And they hand you three coins.

214
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
I get it now.

215
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
That's a very erotic exchange.

216
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
So erotic.

217
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,360
Yeah. And it's nice because you can get Snickers to strike the machines right there.

218
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,120
They hate that, though.

219
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,040
Canada, your money, your money is really weird, Canada.

220
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
You have things called loonies and toonies.

221
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,320
But this is the thing. I'm so on this tip, though, because every other country besides us,

222
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,920
like their $1 bill, they realize it's not worth anything and you can buy nothing with it.

223
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,760
So there's just a coin.

224
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,680
In England, they have coins that are worth four of our dollars. It's ridiculous.

225
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,280
Well, I love that every time we do it, every time America tries to do a dollar quarter or a dollar

226
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,080
coin, it's such bullshit. And everyone's like, what is this? Never mind.

227
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,840
And like the only time you ever need them is if you pay like a parking garage or when you go to

228
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,440
the bank and they give you like a stock at your way, a coin, you're like, ah, damn it.

229
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,680
And then it sits in a drawer forever and ever and ever.

230
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,760
Yeah, because you can never find it's like it's enough of a big deal to find a machine that uses

231
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,600
it, like it advertises it like you can use a dollar coin here. Except at theme parks,

232
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,040
amusement parks. They are crazy about the Sacajawea dollar coin.

233
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,320
For some reason, the only time the only way to get like a locker is to turn your money into

234
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,800
Sacajawea coins and then put them in the locker. It's like, why don't you just take dollars?

235
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:45,600
I this is all very funny. I think it's dangerous to throw coins at a lady.

236
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,480
Can we agree with that?

237
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
I mean, like what other circumstance would that be okay in?

238
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm looking at these loonies and these toonies and they look like

239
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,760
some heavy alloy. So you got to throw a fiver. And if that's the case,

240
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,640
Canadian strippers must be like balling.

241
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Oh yeah, like Scarface. Totally, totally rich.

242
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Well, the trick is you have to form it into a paper airplane and they have to catch it out

243
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,040
of the air or else they don't get to keep it. They can't use their hands, which I think is

244
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:25,600
awful what you just said. Is it possible that you only throw it a fifth as frequently as Americans

245
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,720
do? Are we talking about lump sums?

246
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,080
Okay, so you're saying like, it's five dollars, but the standards of performance are much higher?

247
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,440
The standard of performance, and instead of throwing like a buckaroo every five minutes or

248
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,760
so to get a look, a look-see, you throw a fiver every half an hour and then you just get the

249
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
whole kit and caboodle.

250
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
Lump sums for some lumps, it seems.

251
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:01,840
Maybe our Canadian erotic, exotic dancers are working it five times as hard.

252
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,240
That's what I'm saying.

253
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
Maybe they are getting, yeah.

254
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,360
Maybe it's like, hey Darla, you look like an American up there. You work five times more than

255
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
that. Shake it down. Get that stuff everywhere.

256
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,440
What I would like to imagine is they've just done away with like the slow, sexy takes five

257
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,920
minutes and they've just like pumped it up and it's like house techno beats.

258
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,680
Oh, they put on some dubstep and they just fucking stop to it.

259
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,600
And they are fucking sweating their asses off the whole time and it's a challenge. It's like,

260
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,640
do you want this five dollars? You're gonna have to work it.

261
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,280
Are you crumping right now? Is that Zumba?

262
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,760
Let's, let's move on to another, to another question.

263
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,720
Although I would actually, we've never asked this.

264
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,800
If you do have some actual insight to that question, I would genuinely-

265
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,720
Right, you kind of want to know now.

266
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,520
Yeah, I kind of would like, I am kind of curious about it.

267
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, no, I think instead of being inquisitive, we need to be

268
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,920
instructive and I'm going to go ahead and say, blanket statement.

269
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't throw a coin at a lady.

270
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,160
Right.

271
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,520
Don't throw a coin.

272
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
You slide it across the floor to her.

273
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah, you can, you can slide her a little, a tiny bag.

274
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
Oh, you flip it like you're an old style gangster.

275
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,040
Here's a dollar, chick.

276
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,960
Let me get a pape.

277
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,040
Like, oh, I can't. I don't have a pape.

278
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,720
I've got a pasty.

279
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,320
Hey, when does a 17 year old male get his female friend of the same age for a birthday

280
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,040
gift?

281
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,840
I haven't been to a girl's birthday party outside of family and I'm confused as to what

282
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,040
I should get her for a gift.

283
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,400
If I should even get her one at all, that's from vexed in Vancouver.

284
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,440
Yikes.

285
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,200
That's a tough one, right?

286
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Yeah.

287
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,320
I mean like-

288
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,880
I say-

289
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
He's going into hostile territory.

290
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
You get her a gift card to Brookstone worth like 15 loonies.

291
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:01,760
I think the safest way to go and what I would recommend is get her like a movie or book

292
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,760
or something that you like and you can say, you know, I like this book and I thought you

293
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
would too.

294
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,880
Well, I'm just saying like, if you don't know what to get her, don't try to get something

295
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,840
huge and elaborate.

296
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,280
Just say like, you know, this was a really good movie and I thought you'd like it.

297
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,600
No?

298
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,640
I got you Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow on DVD.

299
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,600
I really like it.

300
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,080
By the way, can I borrow that when you're done with it?

301
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,200
Happy birthday.

302
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,840
You don't have to tell her you got it because you liked it.

303
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm saying like, I thought you would like this movie.

304
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,000
She's not going to throw it back in your face and be like, bullshit, I don't like this movie.

305
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,720
You're wrong.

306
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,280
I think that- but see, here's the thing though.

307
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,800
When you're at a girl's birthday party, what if you're the only person who got her something

308
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,280
like that?

309
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,720
You don't know.

310
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,360
I have no idea what girls get each other for birthdays.

311
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,320
I could not- especially when I was 17, I couldn't-

312
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
What is the cutoff?

313
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,640
What?

314
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,680
At what age do presents stop being mandatory every year?

315
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,200
No, you do need to bring a present because that's a fate worse than death if you bring-

316
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,560
you're the only one without one.

317
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:12,160
I just feel like something that everybody- is there a gift that you could name where

318
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
you always need another one?

319
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,320
And if we could just pick that one gift that you could always get anybody and it's always

320
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,800
appreciated, what do you always appreciate when you get?

321
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,600
For me, it's those tins of butter cookies, you know, the blue ones.

322
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,880
I love those, man.

323
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
Give me as many of those as you got.

324
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,280
A fancy food item or something potable.

325
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,520
Either way, you can't lose because everybody eats and everybody likes to get drunk.

326
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,240
Yeah, especially if it's something like kind of special, not just like I got you a bag

327
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,080
of M&Ms, but like I got you this box of chocolate covered potato chips.

328
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,880
Okay, that's fun.

329
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,520
It's interesting.

330
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,240
It's different.

331
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,440
It's a girl, though.

332
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
What if she's like trying to get fit or something?

333
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah, what if she's like, are you saying I'm fat?

334
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,440
Then you get her fitness bars, Justin.

335
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,320
There's fit food.

336
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,240
He doesn't know though.

337
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,520
This is what I'm saying.

338
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,720
How could he guess what's-

339
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
Oh no, because if you get fitness bars, you're saying she's fat.

340
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,760
I had to-

341
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,800
You're straight up saying she's fat.

342
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,840
I have to talk to my wife each morning for a good 20 minutes before I have any idea who

343
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,320
she is.

344
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,120
Like I don't know what's on her mind that day.

345
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,320
I don't know what she's thinking about.

346
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,880
I don't know.

347
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
It takes me a while to get acclimated.

348
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,080
Do you think he's just going to walk into a birthday party with something?

349
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,240
Here's an item and it is appropriate.

350
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,920
Like I don't think he can, I don't see what he's going to choose.

351
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,720
Oh, I've got it.

352
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,120
A dream catcher.

353
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh, that's good.

354
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,800
That's good.

355
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,680
I think the problem here is that you are assuming, and I can say that you're assuming this because

356
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,120
of your email, that you think there's one present that's good for girls because the

357
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,640
information that you have provided us about this girl is that she is a girl and that's

358
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,520
all we know.

359
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,600
Like I need a gift suggestion.

360
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,560
Here's what I know.

361
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,200
She's a lady, period.

362
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,640
Well, let's see, yeah, I mean-

363
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
Soap, I don't know.

364
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,280
But that's as much as I knew about girls when I was 17.

365
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,520
I didn't even know how they got their hair to smell so good.

366
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,320
Like what am I going to get them that they don't already have?

367
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,040
And then you learned that they just put honey in it every day.

368
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,240
Is it possible that we could get a gift certificate?

369
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,080
Is that a good present?

370
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
I don't like gift certificates.

371
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,640
Never?

372
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,920
Never a good present?

373
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,320
Well, they can be if the person says, I would love a gift certificate to blank.

374
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,040
But just doing it voluntarily always strikes me like I couldn't think of anything to get

375
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
you so I just got you fake money.

376
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,120
Rarely do people give you that opportunity.

377
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,640
Though, like nobody's ever like, man, I haven't been to Applebee's in a while.

378
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
I would love to crush some tiny desserts.

379
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,760
I feel like the presents I always liked the best are the ones that I secretly would kind

380
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,960
of like, but would never buy for myself.

381
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,200
Like my dear friend, Jason, for my last birthday, got me an RC car.

382
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,280
Yeah, I'll take it.

383
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,320
Thank you.

384
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,360
I do want this.

385
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
How did you know that I wanted this but would not buy this?

386
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
I wanted this but would not buy this, but I do want this.

387
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,960
So you're saying, you're saying easy solution is you get her the gift that even she doesn't

388
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,120
know that she wants, but she wants it.

389
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
Good suggestion, Justin.

390
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
He's going to have a real easy time.

391
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,040
You're saying that even with even with fucking psychic powers, he couldn't divine what this

392
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,440
gift is that she wants that she doesn't know she wants.

393
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,640
Yeah, that's great.

394
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,400
Just get her that thing, duh.

395
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,880
Maybe like a gap gift certificate would be good.

396
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
Maybe like a Snuggie.

397
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,680
Everybody wants one of those, right?

398
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,680
Does she have a Snuggie?

399
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,440
Get her a slap chop and just fucking hope for the best.

400
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,320
Get her a slap chop.

401
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,840
Get her a fucking slap chop and then don't go to her party.

402
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
Because if she hates it, you'll never know.

403
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Can I tell you something right now, vexed, vexed in Vancouver?

404
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
This is the end of your relationship with this girl.

405
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,800
Oh, yeah, it's over.

406
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm sorry.

407
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
It doesn't matter what you do.

408
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,480
There is literally no there is no right thing for you to do here.

409
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,560
We've we've so just embrace it.

410
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,240
Just lean into it.

411
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,600
Just put something in the card like just give her a note that says I hate you.

412
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,080
Happy birthday.

413
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
I got you some toonies.

414
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,160
I got you some I got you some Canadian stripper battle armor.

415
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
So when people launch toonies at you,

416
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,720
I got you a shield.

417
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,640
I got you a stripper shield.

418
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,040
It's got ballistics, but sexy ballistics.

419
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,280
Yeah, it's Kevlar, but with booby holes cut out of it.

420
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,200
It's very hot.

421
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,920
Enjoy now.

422
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,520
And yeah, it's listen.

423
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
You guys have had some laughs together.

424
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,960
It's over now.

425
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,440
Sorry.

426
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
And you'll always look back and remember how great that friendship was.

427
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,440
Used to be.

428
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,440
You can't go to the party.

429
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
That's the only that's your only option.

430
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,920
You can't go.

431
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,960
Insummation, body armor, a paid vacation at Applebee's or her secret heart's desire.

432
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
Even she does not know.

433
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,320
Even she does not know is her heart's desire.

434
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,720
Yeah.

435
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,160
So just get one of those.

436
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
I would recommend the last one.

437
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,040
I think that would be a big hit, but.

438
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,280
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

439
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,520
Yeah.

440
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,360
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

441
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,160
Thank you, Krista.

442
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,360
It's by Yahoo and it's just user Cuckoo who asks.

443
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,360
It's kind of gross.

444
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm sorry.

445
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,080
OMG, my tropical fish are eating it.

446
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:23,840
What?

447
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,920
I'm so sorry.

448
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,960
Someone just into my aquarium and now my fish are feeding on it.

449
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,000
Don't let me finish.

450
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
Will they get pregnant?

451
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,560
And what kind of fish can I expect?

452
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,600
Will they hatch out like tiny mermaid things?

453
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,120
What kind of mystery is this?

454
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,360
Yeah.

455
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,800
Let's sleuth this one out.

456
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,240
You know what?

457
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,160
Not to get a girl for a birthday party.

458
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Yeah.

459
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,240
Jizzing in her aquarium.

460
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,280
Hey, look what I did.

461
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Happy birthday.

462
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,360
That beta has human feet.

463
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,640
Who jizzed in this?

464
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,840
My beta has a human face like Seaman.

465
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,800
I want to make an open appeal to the gentleman who committed this heinous crime.

466
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Why was that your best option?

467
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,080
And what was the timeline like where someone jizzed in this aquarium, skedaddled,

468
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,160
and she entered the room fast enough to see the fish eating the juice?

469
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,640
Officially anything you put into an aquarium instantly.

470
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,440
So it had to be like, done out.

471
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
Hey, they're eating it.

472
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,680
Yahoo.

473
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,600
I passed a mysterious stranger coming out of my room.

474
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,480
People say that the American Pie movies aren't having a detriment on our society.

475
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,320
But look, teenagers out there are reenacting these scenes.

476
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,160
And I did you guys see that one?

477
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,960
I think it was Banking 3.

478
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,880
Oh, the one where Stiffler ejaculates?

479
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,440
No, well, it's actually it's a popular misconception.

480
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,920
It's actually Stiffler's cousin at that point.

481
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:12,400
So Stiffler's cousin gives his seed, the gift of his seed, to an aquarium.

482
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,640
Yeah.

483
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,640
And then fish eat it, and then it creates horrible sea monsters.

484
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,840
I am so upset, like physically angry at all of this.

485
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Yeah, there's nothing good about this.

486
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,520
Think about fish with human arms.

487
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,640
No, you know what, Griffin?

488
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,560
And you think about how you'll never be able to hang out with it.

489
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:36,880
I'm eight steps back thinking about the prior situation before this girl walked into the room.

490
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,480
Was this gentleman standing there and he pulled out a chair and stood on top of it?

491
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,120
No, no, no, I'm sure it's not that big.

492
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,360
The problem is that maybe you're just assuming that this person started out

493
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,320
with the intention of, oh, I'm going to jerk it in this here fish tank.

494
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,680
I think that it was an emergency.

495
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,440
I think he was short on time.

496
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,680
Right.

497
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,880
I think he said, I need to do this somewhere.

498
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,520
So you're saying he just didn't have an exit strategy when he started.

499
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,360
His plan was jerk it, and then that was it.

500
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,320
That's the end of the plan.

501
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,200
It's honestly her fault for hanging that poster of Carla Gugino behind her aquarium.

502
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,080
What were you thinking with that Gugino poster?

503
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,960
How could you?

504
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,360
You can't just put a Gugino up in your room.

505
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
You put a Carla Gugino poster anywhere.

506
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,880
And you put it so close to the aquarium, you were almost begging for human fish monsters.

507
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,320
Ew, you nasty.

508
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,720
That's what you like, don't you, dirty girl.

509
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,760
You like it when people jerk it to Carla Gugino into your aquarium.

510
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,480
You nasty.

511
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,640
I would also like to say to this girl whose room this is

512
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,960
and who's concerned this is about horrible fish monsters.

513
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,880
Maybe you need to be more selective of the people and you invite into your house.

514
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,040
If you had a party and you don't know which one of them came in your aquarium.

515
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,800
You know, you have to know.

516
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,640
Line up the usual suspects who Gugino'd right into my aquarium.

517
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,920
Didn't think it on through, did you?

518
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,120
Typical.

519
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,480
Typical. Everyone in your life, you should only have one person

520
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,000
that could possibly have jerked it into your aquarium.

521
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,160
If you have less than that, boring.

522
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,960
If you have more than that, you're on bad girls club.

523
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,400
But you need to limit that to one.

524
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,600
One person.

525
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,880
Gotta have one sassy friend.

526
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,400
Gotta have one person who may or may not jerk it into your aquarium.

527
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,120
Just be glad it wasn't a terrarium because yucko.

528
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,560
Yeah.

529
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,440
Double yuck.

530
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,120
That was one pissed off turtle.

531
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,800
That was actually the plot of Biodome 2.

532
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah.

533
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,040
It's stuck in development hell, but perhaps it's perfectly so.

534
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,000
Jesus.

535
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,560
Jesus.

536
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,240
No, he's not involved in this one.

537
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,960
I am thinking about Polly Shore in ways.

538
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm thinking about whichever Baldwin that was.

539
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,640
Just, hey, just doing it on a turtle.

540
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,240
Just making love on it.

541
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,360
Now, why did, okay.

542
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,960
Is it possible that they would eat it and make sea moss?

543
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,000
Does she need to be concerned for her safety?

544
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
Justin, not only is it possible, it's impossible.

545
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,920
It's not a thing that can happen scientifically.

546
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,040
So you're saying not probable, but it is likely that it could happen.

547
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,160
It's not just going to happen.

548
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,760
It's happened already.

549
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
That's where Snooki came from.

550
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,120
Snooki is, she's half beta.

551
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,720
Half beta, half fighting fish.

552
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,880
That's betas, right?

553
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,800
Betas are the Asian fighting fish.

554
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,040
Is that correct?

555
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,480
Yeah, don't put two of those in a tank.

556
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,040
They will wrestle over that semen.

557
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
They can be only one.

558
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,480
I think the worst part of this situation-

559
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,800
It really is like an episode of Bad Girls Club at that point.

560
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,920
As this manfish develops, it'll probably get really annoying to constantly have to listen

561
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,680
to Leonard Nimoy describe his life.

562
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,560
Oh, semen deep cut for everyone to enjoy.

563
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,480
We're going to make jokes right now that maybe 10 of you are going to get.

564
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,600
Let's just buckle up for a minute.

565
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,320
That's the bone yard for a semen gag.

566
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,400
Just a real quick semen story.

567
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,360
We went on vacation once and left the adapter for our Dreamcast at home.

568
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,000
And flipped out because our semen were going to die.

569
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,720
Well, okay, not all of us flipped out because I wasn't, I enjoyed, I played semen maybe twice

570
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,160
and the first time it was, oh, I have given birth to men fish.

571
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,600
And then the second time was, let's see how high I can turn up the heat in this tank.

572
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,920
Cook them.

573
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,440
That's the only thing you can do to your betas, by the way, to your half beta half mans.

574
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,160
You got to cook them.

575
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
God did not intend for this to happen.

576
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,760
You've got, you've got to boil the water.

577
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,320
I'm sorry.

578
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,360
It's sad.

579
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,920
You got to think about it because God made betta fish.

580
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,520
And he also made semen.

581
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,480
So he had to assume that eventually the two would meet.

582
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,680
Yeah, but I'm going to say that that's not a part of God's wonderful plan.

583
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,000
He also made people, people of different races and religions and he never intended for them to mate.

584
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,600
So what are you, you know, what are you, what are you trying to, what are you getting at?

585
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
My, um, my man fish is a pescatarian.

586
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,040
Gross.

587
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,960
Uh, and now a message from our favorite half men, half fish, Jordan, Jesse, go.

588
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm Jesse Thorne, America's radio, sweetheart.

589
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm Jordan Morris, boy, detective.

590
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,240
Every week on our show, Jordan, Jesse go, I would say that we share a little slice of our hearts.

591
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,960
Yeah.

592
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,360
And a little peek at our dicks.

593
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,080
But every week we have a podcast where we have a little peek at our dicks.

594
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:55,200
Podcast where we have fun and funny conversations with guests from the worlds of comedy, film,

595
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,920
television.

596
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
It's all online at maximum fun.org or just search for Jordan, Jesse go in iTunes.

597
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,000
Tune in you.

598
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,480
You will.

599
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
I guarantee you'll enjoy it.

600
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,560
Guaranteed.

601
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,760
Travis, you tell me they talked about werewolf periods this week.

602
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,160
They did.

603
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,000
They talk about werewolf periods and, um, how horrible that must be for the werewolf boyfriends.

604
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,160
I, I know what you guys are thinking.

605
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,760
Uh, boy, they've got special guests out the wazoo.

606
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,960
Why don't you guys ever have any special guests?

607
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,320
And I say, listen, dad, we'll get around to it.

608
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,360
We're trying our best.

609
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,200
We had John Hodgman.

610
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,760
We had you.

611
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,120
It's not enough.

612
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,520
Uh, but actually we do have a special guest question right now from our friends, Chuck and

613
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,020
Josh.

614
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,680
Uh, Hey guys.

615
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,200
Hi, hi.

616
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,000
It's, uh, Josh and Chuck.

617
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,040
That's Chuck's voice.

618
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,120
And we have a question for you.

619
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,200
Well, we're from the stuff you should know podcast.

620
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,760
Yes.

621
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
And we have, we have a question.

622
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,120
Yeah.

623
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,760
We have a question.

624
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,560
Very important question.

625
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,200
Uh, we're both very interested in learning this.

626
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:08,000
Um, how would one, if one needed to, or wanted to say, get rid of, um, a muffin top, I believe

627
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
is the colloquialism for it.

628
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,240
Men or women?

629
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,800
Both.

630
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,240
It doesn't matter, but yeah.

631
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,800
Well, let's say, let's say a man wanted it now.

632
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,300
Okay.

633
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,760
That's, that's a question to ask our question guys.

634
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Let's hear it.

635
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
A fine, a fine question guys.

636
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,120
I'm as somebody who I have met Chuck.

637
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,240
I have not personally met Josh.

638
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,560
I don't, I do not believe either of these gentlemen suffer from muffin top.

639
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,520
I don't, I don't believe either of them are rocking that look.

640
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,600
You know, I think they're just mining us for information that they can steal wholesale

641
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,440
and then use on their podcasts, which is full of enriching information.

642
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,680
Right.

643
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,480
This is how they get it.

644
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,800
They, they send guest questions into other podcasts and then wheeze off that juice.

645
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,360
Yeah, wheeze it.

646
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,880
Here's my first, my first sort of sub, sub answer is, do you need to get rid of it?

647
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,600
Some people can lean into that look.

648
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,200
Some people don't need to get rid of the muffin top.

649
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,720
Society may want you to.

650
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
Some people don't need to.

651
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,680
Some people have a great look.

652
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,440
That Pattinson kid, Steve Pat, Steve Pattinson.

653
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
What's his name?

654
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,920
Steve Pattinson from Twilight.

655
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,720
From Teen Vampire.

656
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,200
What's it?

657
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,760
What's it?

658
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,480
He's got.

659
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,760
Roger, Roger Pattinson.

660
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,360
Roger, Roger Pattinson.

661
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,880
He's got some stuff hanging over the sides, like a Santa costume hanging on a costume rack.

662
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,560
He's, he is convex.

663
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,320
There's no, there's no.

664
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,680
He shaved like a Hershey Kiss.

665
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,840
Steve Pattinson was my favorite James Bond.

666
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,320
People talk a lot about Roger Moorings and, and Glenn Tyler.

667
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,360
I really like Steve Pattinson.

668
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,160
But I'm just saying it's a good look because it looks like a, it looks like a,

669
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,600
it looks like you got your shirt tucked in to your pants and you got a little bit,

670
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,080
well, got a little bit coming out, but that's just your flesh.

671
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,040
Yeah.

672
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,160
I think it's very natural.

673
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,360
I think most people have them.

674
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,600
Sure.

675
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,800
I've got them.

676
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,160
Just more to love.

677
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,920
Now, Travis, you're sort of our fitness go-to fitness guy because you get, you get,

678
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,320
you get active, I think, on a daily basis.

679
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,720
I do.

680
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,760
What are your tips?

681
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,040
What are your tips for getting rid of the, the old MT as we call it?

682
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,360
As you know, I research muffin tops just about every day.

683
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,840
Yeah, right.

684
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,800
And what I've learned is that there are just as many helpful suggestions as there are bad

685
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,440
suggestions.

686
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:17,840
Sure.

687
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,400
And something I learned that was very interesting is that, you know, people think of like doing

688
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,760
sit-ups and crunches and everything.

689
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,480
Not going to help, is it?

690
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,600
It just makes it more robust.

691
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,480
No, it tones the muscle underneath, but it won't get rid of the fat.

692
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,280
But my favorite suggestion that I read was buy looser clothes.

693
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,720
Okay.

694
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,080
That does, that does, it looks like you're wearing like MC Hammer shirt.

695
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,040
Well, apparently there's a concern that if you wear pants that are too tight, it forms

696
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,560
you into a muffin top.

697
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:44,960
Sure.

698
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
No, it squeezes your leg meat up to your tummy area.

699
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,920
It does.

700
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,440
It pops out like a toothpaste tube.

701
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,120
Yeah, your meat, your meat is very malleable.

702
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,320
You can, you can go all over.

703
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,480
You can make yourself conical if you want.

704
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,640
You know, in the, in the 1800s, corsets were so tight that sometimes girls' legs bones would

705
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,720
pop out of their tum-tums and it would make a bone muffin top.

706
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah.

707
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,920
I have muffin tops.

708
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,360
They call it the stale muffin top.

709
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,760
It's pretty, pretty brutal up there.

710
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,120
I have muffin tops, but they are around my collarbone areas.

711
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,680
Yeah, sure.

712
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,200
Just because that's where I want them.

713
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,480
That's where I've smooshed, I've smooshed them up to my collarbone reach.

714
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,880
But you're always wearing that adorable little Lord Fauntleroy collar cinched up.

715
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,440
I do.

716
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,240
A ruff.

717
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,480
Yeah.

718
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,360
He wears a ruff.

719
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,200
I look like some sort of judge, some sort of, some sort of old, old British judge.

720
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,440
Yeah.

721
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,760
Like some sort of old British judge.

722
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,920
He looks like Rumpole of the Bailey up there.

723
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,080
Good luck.

724
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,520
I think everyone knew what I was talking about when I said an old British judge.

725
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,160
Well, if that doesn't conjure just a clear mental image, I don't know what does.

726
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,400
Sure.

727
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,280
You know, I actually look like Ashley Judge.

728
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,920
I look like Judge Reinhold.

729
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,200
You look like Judge Dredd, but like if he was fat.

730
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,640
I look like a fat Judge Dredd.

731
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,320
Dude, that is a good look.

732
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,360
You got a muffin top?

733
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,600
You look like fat Judge Dredd.

734
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,400
I would rather have muffin tops than these damn muffin bottoms.

735
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,880
Yeah.

736
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,040
Coming out the box, kind of oozing around your, are you wearing Reebok pumps?

737
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,600
I am not.

738
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,200
What if you have these striped, striped, striped, striped, striped tops?

739
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,520
Sort of alien cylinders coming out of your hips and I don't know what's going on.

740
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,200
Are those wrapped in paper?

741
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,320
What's going on?

742
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,080
Those are, are those gel out soles for your, is that comfortable?

743
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,840
Is that a, it's for your arch.

744
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Your muffin bottom fills in the arch for your shoes and gives you a real nice, it's like

745
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,160
gliding, which you've never experienced that.

746
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,880
Hey, hey, why don't you put down the corn dog, pick up a carrot.

747
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,680
Where'd those muffin tops go?

748
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,120
They're gone and you can see really well because of all the carotene.

749
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,680
You can see everyone else's muffin tops and judge them.

750
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,600
Just, what if you were just constantly a hundred percent of the time doing like side bends

751
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,280
and twists like all the time.

752
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,240
No, no, no, no.

753
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,120
You don't want that.

754
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,600
You don't want, you don't want an hourglass shape.

755
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,880
That's what Jack LaLanne looked, didn't look what happened to him.

756
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,320
Didn't work out for him.

757
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,400
He only lived to be 143.

758
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,280
Yeah.

759
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,120
And he could bench press a Volkswagen.

760
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,240
He could beat up a fucking bull with his fists.

761
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,640
Jack LaLanne.

762
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,600
I miss you, Jackie.

763
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm glad he's gone.

764
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,200
Wait, hold on.

765
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
Why are you glad Jack LaLanne's dead?

766
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,080
Because he scared me.

767
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,480
Because of his long life?

768
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:32,720
Yeah.

769
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,680
He intimidated me.

770
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,760
I did feel like he was, he was kind of, he was, I think, I think after 70, if you're

771
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,400
active, you're active in a real judgy way.

772
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,320
Like I think you're, you're judgy fit if you're past 70 and still fit.

773
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,320
To know that I, as a 27 year old male would not be able to outrun a 126 year old dude.

774
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,720
Sure.

775
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,320
It made me feel bad every day.

776
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,440
I woke up every day going, well, I'm not going to be as good as Jack LaLanne today.

777
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,560
When you see someone who is 151 goddamn years old, you're not supposed, you're not supposed

778
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,720
to see a muscly old.

779
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,240
If that's like seeing like a really, like seeing like a really tall cat.

780
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,880
Like it's just not, it's not a trait that that thing can have.

781
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,120
Right.

782
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,760
And there's that motherfucker who's always in the airplane magazines that, you know,

783
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,280
that one guy who's got an old man's head for the young man's body.

784
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:21,520
Yeah.

785
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,200
He said he did it with science.

786
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,160
That's that, that guy talk about nightmares.

787
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,640
He he is obviously the product of human beta cross breeding.

788
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,400
I'm going to be honest with you guys.

789
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,120
I don't know how Jack LaLanne died, but I assume it was like a Rasputin kind of thing,

790
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,360
right?

791
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,840
Yeah, he, they were stabbed 14 times and then wrapped in a carpet and thrown off a bridge.

792
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,760
That's the only way to bring him down.

793
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,600
I actually had to wake up in the middle of the night and put a steak in his heart.

794
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,280
It was really unfortunate.

795
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,320
His only weakness is being stabbed 14 times.

796
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,120
Someone had to blow off a dusty old tome to try that in for him.

797
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,520
Jack, you were trying to bring down a Jack LaLanne.

798
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,960
I believe I have one book here.

799
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,840
Pecure a true silver knife and then stab him.

800
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,520
Not 13, not 15.

801
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,360
The 15th shall reawaken him with more vitriol than ever.

802
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,520
Thou shalt not stab him a baker's dozen.

803
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,240
Upon the 16th Sabbath, he will arise again.

804
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,040
Try to sell you a juice machine branded with his name.

805
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,480
That's the secret, by the way, everybody.

806
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,680
Juice, juice, juice.

807
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,720
Can you just cut them off?

808
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
Cut those tops off and then stitch it, stitch it back together.

809
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,160
You don't got any organs in there, right?

810
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,920
Unless your kidneys get real lazy.

811
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,520
Just like, oh, I'll flop.

812
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,640
I'm not trying very hard.

813
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,560
I'm sleeping in a skin hammock.

814
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,640
That's what my kidneys sound like.

815
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,240
My kidneys are fucking old.

816
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,160
All kidneys are old.

817
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,280
So tired.

818
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,080
So tired.

819
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,040
You know, a new person can't be born until an old person dies and they take their kidneys.

820
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,360
We're using the same kidneys from Adam and Eve, guys.

821
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:07,520
Sure.

822
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,040
What about duct tape?

823
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,680
Duct tape it back.

824
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,440
Like give yourself a duct tape corset.

825
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,320
I like that.

826
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,520
Duct tape corset.

827
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,480
That was the band that the All American Rejects lead singer was in before he got-

828
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,520
They reformed without him.

829
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,560
Reformed without him.

830
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,560
It's duct tape corset.

831
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:31,920
I don't like that because then I'm imagining you taping up your rolls on the side and it

832
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,640
looks like it's going to look like your torso is smiling and it's going to be weird for everyone.

833
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,600
It's going to push up.

834
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,240
You can't squish a muffin top away because then you're just going to end up with like

835
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,080
a muffin chest piece.

836
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,600
That's what Christina Hendricks has been rocking that look.

837
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,120
I guess it's working out well for her.

838
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,680
Poor girl.

839
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,720
That poor, poor girl.

840
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,200
Yeah.

841
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,560
That's actually two muffin tops.

842
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,880
She's got a horribly deformed body.

843
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,120
Yeah.

844
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,400
She is really, really misshapen.

845
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,040
It's a real tragedy.

846
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,840
So sad.

847
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,120
Our national obsession with her has to end.

848
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,880
What are we teaching our children?

849
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,000
Tape up the muffin tops?

850
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,440
I saw a nine-year-old girl yesterday with a duct tape record.

851
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:11,920
I can't.

852
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,720
I actually thought I could, but it turned out that I can't.

853
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,960
So Chuck and Josh, we hope that that answers your question-ish.

854
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,920
Tape them up and get those Hendricks boobs.

855
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,960
They're going to love it.

856
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,160
Christina Hendricks look.

857
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,800
Sorry to the family of Jacqueline.

858
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,360
Sorry Jacqueline.

859
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,160
We didn't mean it.

860
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,040
We didn't mean it.

861
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,680
Yeah.

862
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,720
And if you want to listen to those guys, search iTunes for stuff you should know.

863
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,160
It is an informative podcast about a different topic every week.

864
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,640
And it'll make you an expert on things and make you interesting to talk to, unlike now,

865
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,880
where you just recite the bullshit that we say.

866
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,160
And that's all lies.

867
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,200
We make all that up.

868
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,760
Do you guys know what day it is?

869
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,840
Oh, shit.

870
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,560
It's our birthday.

871
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:54,880
We don't have to do it.

872
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,440
It's our birthday.

873
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,920
Stop it.

874
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,800
Happy birthday.

875
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,880
Um, I do have a, it's a, it's a day of the month though.

876
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,360
It's a month.

877
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,320
It's a special month.

878
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:10,560
Um, it is, I didn't pick it, but I'm going to say there's banana pudding lovers month.

879
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,760
And I don't think that's going to get anything better than that.

880
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,760
Uh, should you explain what you're doing?

881
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,160
Oh, every month we take a subject, a national month observance.

882
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,560
It's, there's gotta be a better way to say it.

883
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:26,800
Right?

884
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,240
Yeah.

885
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,680
Well, there's a better way to say it than stop doing it because it's our month's bit.

886
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,240
Every month Griffin makes me and Justin sad.

887
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,120
Sure.

888
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:41,920
Now, now we have another bit where Travis basically just screams nonsense for 10 minutes.

889
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,520
And I like it better than this bit.

890
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,320
But you like, you like his fucking Adam Sandler fucking riffs?

891
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

892
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,600
How dare you, sir?

893
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,360
How dare you?

894
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,480
How dare you?

895
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,680
Jack and Jill in theaters.

896
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Don't you fucking bring Jack and Jill into this.

897
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,520
Oh my God.

898
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,880
On Survivor this week.

899
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,720
I don't want to change this subject, but Survivor is actually a couple of weeks ago.

900
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,840
Their reward was an exclusive screen of Jack and Jill.

901
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,000
They, those other fuckers went on an island alone for 18 days.

902
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,400
Nothing.

903
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,280
No, no entertainment whatsoever.

904
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,600
They get to go to a theater and see Jack and Jill.

905
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,240
There was actually a Jack and Jill themed challenge.

906
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,000
And then the winner, the winner, and I use that like in the loosest sense of the word,

907
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,280
but like backwards sense of the word, got to go to a sort of straw theater and watch Jack and Jill.

908
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,440
Is it worth the challenge to vomit on a plate and see how many people you get to eat it?

909
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,640
Yeah, the game.

910
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:42,880
Yeah.

911
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,880
What a great metaphor.

912
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,280
Yeah.

913
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,920
Adam Sandler's been playing that game for years now.

914
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,200
Uh, and, and actually the year before was, was Gulliver's Travels.

915
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
Oh, Survivor.

916
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,520
Yeah.

917
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,400
Survivor.

918
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,760
That's just part of the-

919
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,760
It was, it was, I don't know if I would prefer to be the guy who fell asleep and fell into

920
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,280
a fire that one time.

921
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,800
He's got a better, he was watching Survivor this year and was like, well, it's way tougher

922
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,760
than it used to be.

923
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,120
They got to sit through Jack and Jill.

924
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,200
I, uh, I like to think that the people on that island think, man, we've only been here

925
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,200
for 18 days and already the civilized world has devolved into some sort of apocalyptic

926
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,680
movie scape where Adam Sandler plays every part in every movie.

927
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,280
All the actresses are dead.

928
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,480
All the actresses are dead.

929
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,920
All the actors are dead.

930
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,640
Save one.

931
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,880
Save the Sandman.

932
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,160
Save the Sander.

933
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,720
I wish you to, wish you to dreamland, take you away to an entertainment nightmare escape.

934
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,200
It's national impotency month.

935
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,320
Okay.

936
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,360
Oh, what a letdown.

937
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,400
Um, it is, oh man, it's not, not that much funny shit in this list.

938
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,360
You guys just want to do banana pudding lovers month and then pull it off like a bandaid.

939
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,680
Yeah.

940
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,760
Banana pudding lovers month would be great.

941
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:03,920
Yeah.

942
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,720
I like it.

943
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,040
I like to throw some pillow wafers in there.

944
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,360
Don't, of course, but of course.

945
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,000
How about, um, hey, get your dick out of there.

946
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,320
Yeah.

947
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,760
Banana pudding lovers month.

948
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,280
That's not where dicks go.

949
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,240
No, come on guys.

950
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,040
But I get it.

951
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,000
My brother, my brother and me.

952
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,600
Can we just work clean just once, please?

953
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,560
Yum, yum.

954
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,760
Looks delicious.

955
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,960
My brother, my brother and me.

956
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,720
Affordable and easy to make for the mom on the go.

957
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,400
Banana pudding lovers.

958
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,440
Nothing says I love you like a big bowl of banana pudding.

959
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,600
My brother, my brother and me.

960
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,320
Um, make this for your pet orangutan.

961
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,880
He'll love it.

962
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,560
He'll go ape.

963
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,720
He'll go ape for banana pudding.

964
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,320
Your pet orangutan will go ape for banana pudding.

965
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,520
My brother, my brother and me.

966
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,960
Only terrorists eat chocolate.

967
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,600
You don't like bananas.

968
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,120
You must be putting me on.

969
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,280
My brother, my brother and me.

970
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,000
Hello.

971
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,120
Hello Jello.

972
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,320
Banana pudding.

973
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,520
My brother, my brother and me.

974
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:01,840
It's good.

975
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,440
Time to do a jihad on rice pudding because you hate it so much.

976
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,080
Right?

977
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,640
That's good.

978
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,920
Like orangutans.

979
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,400
I guess bananas.

980
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,840
Like I'm really, I'm scraping grass.

981
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,640
I can see the appeal of banana pudding.

982
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,520
My brother, my brother and me.

983
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,720
That was a slip.

984
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,280
Um, uh, uh, hey, don't, don't split.

985
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,120
Stick around and have some welcome to my brother, my brother, me.

986
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:42,320
And if I show for your, your grandpa's grandpa, he's going to love these gags.

987
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,080
We're talking about Jacqueline.

988
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,840
We're doing some great pudding puns.

989
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,600
Next, next week.

990
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:53,920
Join us as Sid Caesar takes us on a journey to Laugh Town with his hilarious character.

991
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,640
Jui, Jui, Jui McMidget.

992
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,240
It's a Irish Jewish, uh, little person stereotype that, uh, I think you're really going to get

993
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,120
a kick out of that character.

994
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,280
He's been working on it, working at the cat skills, honing his character.

995
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,280
Make sure you and your g-pa turn in.

996
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,680
With special guys, Zero Mostel.

997
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,520
From Fiddler on the Roof.

998
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,280
It's going to be a great hour of entertainment.

999
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,640
Of course, we will have a mandatory prayer in the middle of it.

1000
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,320
So it's going to be a really great night.

1001
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,280
Come on out.

1002
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,240
What's the best brand of battery for my hearing device?

1003
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,080
What's up with the young people today?

1004
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,680
Uh, if you and your g-pa show up 30 minutes early, you can hit the buffet.

1005
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,040
Just $7.95.

1006
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,480
Got some real nice borscht on there.

1007
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,280
It's, uh, got some real nice potatoes.

1008
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,040
It's a great, it's a great time for everybody.

1009
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,440
So come on out.

1010
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,560
Make my brother, my brother, and me the last thing you listen to before you die of old age.

1011
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,400
We'll goof you to sleep.

1012
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,400
Goof you to sleep, g-pa.

1013
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,000
Here, we'll goof you up to heaven.

1014
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,720
May a choir of angels goof thee to thy rest.

1015
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,960
We are the Cracker Barrel podcast.

1016
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,160
Come on down.

1017
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,160
Yep, you're going to love it.

1018
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,760
We're the sweatpants podcast.

1019
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,360
Just slip us on and slip off.

1020
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,600
Slip off to dreamland.

1021
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,960
Slip off to dreamland.

1022
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,960
Pop in those buds and think about your life.

1023
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,680
Don't.

1024
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,480
Hey, g-pa.

1025
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,080
I don't want you to go out like Jack O'Lane with a bunch of gung-tofs stabbing you with

1026
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,720
a silver knife.

1027
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I want you to die with dignity and jokes about banana pudding.

1028
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,200
Tune in.

1029
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,600
Did we cover all of our bases?

1030
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,280
I feel like there's not a goddamn thing that I could have said.

1031
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,520
I mean, we did.

1032
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,600
We did make a bunch of jokes.

1033
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:37,840
Yeah.

1034
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,520
Orange, you glad I didn't say banana pudding?

1035
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,680
What are we fucking doing anymore?

1036
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,680
This isn't what-

1037
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,520
Let's end the show.

1038
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,720
Yeah, this is what we do now.

1039
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,000
We tell jokes.

1040
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's a joke for us to tell jokes.

1041
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,960
If we tell a joke, it's so ironic that we would actually tell a joke rather than talking

1042
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,120
about killing Jack O'Lane with a silver knife, that we're laughing at the fact that we actually

1043
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,280
try to tell a few good jokes.

1044
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,240
Justin, Justin.

1045
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,440
Some solid gag.

1046
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,000
Hey, that split thing I did, you remember?

1047
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,960
That was good stuff.

1048
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,360
A true silver knife.

1049
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,000
If you stab Jack O'Lane with a silver knife, he will only get stronger.

1050
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,320
And angrier and juicier.

1051
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,400
Thank you to Chuck and Josh for sending in a question.

1052
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,480
Thank you to you guys for listening.

1053
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,640
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first some super quick housekeeping stuff.

1054
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,480
You know he's gonna-

1055
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,560
Okay, I will prove the existence of ghosts this week.

1056
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,600
If Jack O'Lane does not haunt any of us, ghosts don't exist.

1057
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,800
We got a new shirt.

1058
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,440
It is out.

1059
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,400
It is a Peepum's Nasty Gum shirt.

1060
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,960
It is at maxfunstore.com.

1061
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,080
You can go there.

1062
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,320
It is our second t-shirt.

1063
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,120
It is a lovely brown color.

1064
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,920
It advertises that you have terrible taste in gum.

1065
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,280
Designed by Charlene Tadevsky, I think is what I'm gonna go with.

1066
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,040
That's on a nice American Apparel t-shirt in camel and brown for the ladies.

1067
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,000
It's dope.

1068
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,640
It is dope.

1069
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,320
And you can get over to Max Fun Store and pick that up for yourself.

1070
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,000
Why not get a few for the holidays?

1071
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,440
And you can save $5 when you buy three shirts.

1072
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,920
So yeah, get that.

1073
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,000
What else is going on, guys?

1074
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,480
Can we talk about another important monthly observance that's going on?

1075
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,120
Yeah.

1076
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,640
It's Movember, which Justin and I are participating in.

1077
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,560
Travis, the only person who can grow facial hair with any level of confidence,

1078
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,520
for some reason, is not present.

1079
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,720
I'm growing it right now.

1080
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,440
But yeah, Justin and I are both raising money in Movember

1081
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,360
to raise awareness for prostate cancer.

1082
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,120
And yeah, if you search on the Movember site for either one of us,

1083
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,200
you can find us and give us a donation.

1084
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,840
And it's for a really great cause.

1085
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,280
And I have never seen Justin with any facial hair,

1086
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,960
so I just can't wait to see what happens on the lower half of his face.

1087
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,920
But yeah, thanks to everybody who's already donated.

1088
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,320
Joshua Kost, Don Schultz, both gave pretty sizable donations to me.

1089
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,960
Very generous.

1090
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,920
Thank you, gentlemen.

1091
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,800
Thank you very much.

1092
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,000
Our boy, Davin.

1093
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,760
Davin Pavlis.

1094
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,480
Thank you.

1095
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,680
Thanks to everybody, seriously.

1096
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,000
And yeah, if you give a donation, then I get your email address.

1097
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,280
I will send you a personal email and name one mustache here after you.

1098
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,560
That's the current deal.

1099
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,080
And I'll send you good vibes.

1100
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,520
Justin will just vibe out.

1101
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,600
I'll just send those vibes straight out to you.

1102
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,480
Make sure, by the way, we mentioned Jordan and Jesse go.

1103
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,320
They're coming up on their 200th episode.

1104
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,960
Is that this week?

1105
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,560
It's next week.

1106
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:46,960
Next week.

1107
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,240
So make sure you tune into that.

1108
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,600
If you would like us to talk about you and you're not our boss,

1109
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,560
so you have to make us like Jesse, you can get on the Jumbotron.

1110
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,760
It's maximumfun.org.

1111
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,680
And we will do a personal message for you.

1112
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,560
We also have forums at maximumfun.org as long as you're over there.

1113
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,360
Go talk about the new episode, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1114
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,760
Oh, Griffin, the big, the big, the big news.

1115
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,080
Oh, yeah.

1116
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,960
Let's drop this on me.

1117
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,200
Travis, you want to do it?

1118
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,400
No.

1119
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Seems appropriate if Griffin does it.

1120
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,360
OK, Griffin, you do it.

1121
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,920
So we've been planning some live shows for a while.

1122
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
And the next one that we are trying to do,

1123
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,800
we're going to go ahead and announce it on the show through our hat over the fence.

1124
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,200
It's still in the planning phase, but I think it's going to come together.

1125
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,920
Pretty good chance.

1126
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,360
The weekend of December the 11th, right?

1127
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,520
December the 10th or 11th, probably the 11th is when that will go down.

1128
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,480
Yeah, it's a Sunday.

1129
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,400
We are going to attempt to do a live show in my current home city of Austin, Texas.

1130
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,960
So we will hopefully have more details for you next week.

1131
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:01,200
Start planning on not doing any shit that weekend so you can come out and see us.

1132
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,400
If you live in Austin or have lived in Austin and you have a good idea for a venue,

1133
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,680
if you would email us at mbmbam.com.

1134
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,440
A venue or a place nearby to get crazy afterwards.

1135
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,640
Yeah, mbmbam.com at maximumfun.org and drop us a line.

1136
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,200
We've got a few places in mind, but we haven't locked anything down.

1137
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,040
And if you think you have a winning solution, then please let us know.

1138
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,080
And yeah, we're going to get a combo spot would also be great

1139
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,000
if we can perform there and then hang there.

1140
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,160
Afterwards would also be awesome.

1141
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,960
So yeah, that's the second weekend of December and I'm going to try and get it together.

1142
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,920
Try to get Justin and Travis down here in the ATX.

1143
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,520
Yeah, so that is our first one coming up.

1144
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,360
That'll be actually our third live show.

1145
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,080
We're trying to get to every city in this great land, but it's a big undertaking.

1146
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:59,200
But we will have more live shows, some back at the East Coast, all over this great land.

1147
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,600
So stick with us.

1148
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,400
But if you're in Austin, clear your schedules because I promise that we will try.

1149
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,600
Or Houston or San Antan, San Antany.

1150
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,280
Now, San Antan, the S-A-X, is that the SACS?

1151
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,800
Yeah, or what's the big one?

1152
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,520
Dallas, yeah.

1153
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,960
Dallas, you're pretty cool too.

1154
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,520
Dax.

1155
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,640
So Dax Shepard, Saxomophone, what's Hax or?

1156
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,120
Hax.

1157
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,200
And AXS, AXS.

1158
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,280
And AXS Body Spray is our sponsor.

1159
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,280
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

1160
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:31,760
Don't worry about it.

1161
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,240
It's gibberish.

1162
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinners for using the theme song Into Departure off

1163
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,120
the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1164
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,120
They're just such a great band, and we are honored that we get to use that song because

1165
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,600
it's good.

1166
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,440
It gets me so hyphy every week.

1167
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,640
Yeah, gets you pumped.

1168
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,080
I'd like to thank everybody on Twitter.

1169
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,720
I just kind of threw out if anyone wanted to wish us happy birthday.

1170
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,600
And I was just swamped by people wishing us happy birthday.

1171
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,120
So I'm not going to read all of them, but thanks to Fart Store, Magic Whiskey, Krista

1172
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,600
Whalen, Anaphylaxis, Bursar, all of you guys.

1173
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,480
You're great.

1174
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,960
And everybody else, you guys are awesome.

1175
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,600
Thanks.

1176
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,760
And guys, happy birthday.

1177
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,480
Hey, thanks.

1178
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,000
And thanks to people tweeting about the show, like Cast Iron Brick, Nick Kink, Demiposer.

1179
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,240

We love you very much.

1184
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,320
Let's shut this shit down.

1185
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,920
Blow it up, Griffin.

1186
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,840
This Yahoo answer, this final one was sent in by Jason Hellman.

1187
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,480
Thank you, Jason.

1188
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:47,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Elacho who asks, can you train a cat to know when it's your

1189
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,400
birthday?

1190
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,840
I'm Justin McElroy.

1191
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,800
I'm Travis McElroy.

1192
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,920
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1193
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,360
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1194
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,080
Kiss your dad.

1195
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Swear on the lips.
