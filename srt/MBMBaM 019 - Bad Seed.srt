1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind on the first in line, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If we're on the distance, even the band is watching me.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So don't masturbate, or we'll see it. We see everything.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We've always been watching you, from the time you were born to today.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And we'll watch you for like a week after you die.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm just gonna go ahead and stay out of this one.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Travis is staying out. This is a song about my brother, my brother and me.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's syncopated so you know we worked a long time on it.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Justin, when are you going to auto tune that shit?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's all been auto tuned. I did that in post.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I say that knowing Griffin edits the show and probably didn't put it into auto tune.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is an advice show for the modern era.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My brother, my brother and me. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm not related to you.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He don't like labels.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't subscribe to labels or podcasts, but I do subscribe to Reader's Digest.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Label cubby holes in preschools, not people. That's what I say.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I actually couldn't exist without labels.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Triangular hole.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Whoa, this got deep.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I've got that memento disease.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, you got memento.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mementitis.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you mean that clean slate disease?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You remember that?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jerry Doody disease.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Holy shit, clean slate. Why did you remind me that existed?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sorry.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Dear my brother, my brother and me, what do you do when your brother reminds you that clean slate existed?

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You stop what you're doing, you rush out and you rent it from your local movie max.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Was it Dana Carvey?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I really can't remember.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was memento.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It basically is memento.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's basically memento before memento is memento.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hello, brothers, McElroy. I have one simple question.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What is my brother, my brother and me stance on night showering as morning showers?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I tend to have a terrible morning hair and I use a shower as a double whammy of cleanliness and manageable locks.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Where do you stand?

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am totally right there with you.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So this question is saying you take a shower at night and that counts as your morning shower when you wake up.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So you don't have to shower before you go to work or school or whatever.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's nothing – why would you give up on that most energizing part of your day?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like nothing gets me ready to say like, yes, let's do this like a morning shower.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If I have one of those at night, my body is like, what are we doing?

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is awesome.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's do something.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is going to be great.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's like, no, buddy, go to bed, you dumb bitch.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I tricked you again.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
First that's a trim and now this.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You dumb motherfucker.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You'll fall for anything.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I tend to shower – this sounds like a joke but in the summer like three times a day.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, I've never seen anything like that.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Once in the morning because I get that funky bed head too and I'll just like hop in and rinse and then go on about my day.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Travis gets a hairstyle that you'd pay hundreds if not thousands of dollars for in Hollywood.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, I have that amazing hair that people only dream about so there's that.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But when you dream about it, it looks terrible the next day so you got to have another shower in the morning.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then what do you just treat yourself to a midday?

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you doing with your day?

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're like, you don't be better than this standing underwater.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, and I take one when I get home from work because I work hard building stuff.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And then I take one before I go to bed so that I'm not all dirty when I get on my nice white sheets.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hey, what are you doing in those four hours?

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Between the second shower and third shower?

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Between second and third shower, Bilbo.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, that's me time.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Travis lives a lifestyle that a lot of us aren't, we just can't wrap our minds around.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's just say handmade jelly braces aren't going to hand make themselves, okay?

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where do you think all these lanyards come from?

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you only, if you can only have one though, night shower or morning shower.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's got to be morning shower.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think it's got to be morning shower.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If only because bed bugs are really big right now.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Everyone's got them.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The latest thing.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Everyone's got those bed bugs.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know who I heard had them?

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You got to use them in the morning.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You got to use a shower and eradicate them from your body.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't even go to Hollywood if you don't have a Twitter account with at least a thousand followers and bed bugs.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is just that style today.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's where we're at as a nation.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Have you ever seen a bed bug?

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've seen Joaquin Phoenix.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He's a bed bug.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He's a bed bug.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's a hyper evolved bed bug.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey guys.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey guys.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So when I got married, I discovered that my in-laws asked their children and children-in-law for Christmas wish lists.

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Every time I fill it out and mail it in, I feel like a kidnapper handing over a list of demands.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I mean, it's nice to get DVDs and board games I know I like, but the spontaneity is completely lost.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Am I right for feeling awkward or am I just being ungrateful?

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thanks, fellas.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You really know how to rock and roll.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Lehman, Gmail.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thanks, Lehman.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've been in this exact same situation.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That is how my in-law family rolls.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And what I've done for the past few years is that I've just asked for a bunch of different styles and sizes of my brother, my brother and me t-shirts.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And I feel like it's a gift that's not only fun to get, but also to give.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And it makes me feel better about it.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I feel like since we're on the subject, let's have a brief aside just for a moment.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You got your t-shirt.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I did.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You may be the first human.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I may be the first human to have my t-shirt.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Can you describe it?

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Describe the whole experience of it, really.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I opened it and it smelled like a t-shirt.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then I put it on.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How does it feel?

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It was a comical line of girls out my front door, just one after the other, just like, please, anything.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can I smell your chest?

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Can I smell your chest?

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
New from Max Body Spray t-shirts.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Would you describe it as soft or rough and confident?

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, it's soft.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's soft and it's got a nice little stretch to it.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, yeah?

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, so it's really comfortable.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
My wife got one, too, and since she got it, I had to change my full-time career to full-smashing,

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because I just got to smash so many fools who come up and they're like, hey, lady, nice taste in t-shirt.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Actually, this is true.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She worked to get her hair did, and when she got back, I said, did you tell her about your t-shirt?

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Did you explain it to her?

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Did you tell her about the show?

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's the point of you going out in public with it if you're not going to do that?

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But those are coming now.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They should be arriving this week.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And soon to follow are ask me about my t-shirt bumper stickers.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ask me about the t-shirt I'm wearing.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Unless it's those 29 days of the month that I'm not wearing my brother and me t-shirt.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have good news.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Tell me.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I'm saying that's what I'm saying when asked about the t-shirt.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So those are going right now.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can still totally get them.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We have all sizes and shapes and colors at mbnbam.com.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But so Lehman to answer your question, but Lehman.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Here's the thing.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're there in law, dude.

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They don't know you.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
They don't know what exactly.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You got to get people who do lists.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
From what I found are people who like to keep the balance of like how much they're spending on people.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So like you have to accept the fact that they're going to spend X amount of dollars on you anyway.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And it will make them happy to get you things that you will like.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So like you're you're you're meeting them halfway on this because think about when you're trying to buy a gift for somebody you don't know very well.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It is the worst.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're like, well, they like this.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Will this be too personal?

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're basically just saving them a lot of trouble.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I have friends and I have friends to this day that for like Christmas and birthdays, all they get is like a big stack of gift cards.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's like I would much rather give someone a list and actually get things in boxes and paper than just a big stack of gift cards.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Because that's like saying, hey, you do the shopping.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hey, go go nuts.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And really, what's what is more awkward, you turning in a list of demands of things that they will get you that, you know, you will like or them buying you like a build your own brick pizza oven kit because they saw you eating pizza one time.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then you have to like it and then build it in your backyard.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Put on the list. You've already given me the greatest gift, which is your daughter.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But if you insist on getting me something else and then just do that every year, you'll never feel bad about it.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And and always put on there just over and over again.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The Ewok playset. If you don't give me this, I'll hate you forever.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Thanks for the daughter and everything. But I would really like that.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But seriously, indoor playset, that would take her place as the greatest gift.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hi, my name is God.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That play several times and shit.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I have a net. I have a life conundrum, says Ben.

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going into high school and I like a girl a lot.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I know that homecoming is going to be coming up.

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So I want to ask her, this is an issue of not of her not liking me having good looks or me not having the balls to do it.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I just want to be creative when I ask her.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sadly, my creative juices haven't been flowing and I need an idea.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Got any?

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't do it at school.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I feel like because you run a high school such a tightrope of cultural acceptance that I think you run the risk of embarrassing her.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you do anything outlandish at school.

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's my stance.

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Maybe he only sees her at school.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Put a dead horse head in her locker.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
See, I like that.

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The trick is kids lockers today, they're so small.

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So it's really just going to have to be a pony head.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So put a pony head in there.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Which may be upsetting for her.

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, or OK, gain access to all the lockers around her and install all the parts of a pony into the locker so that when they're all open together, it's a pony that says, will you go to homecoming with me?

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But also it's dead.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But also it's dead.

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Like it's dead as fuck.

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Nobody's ever been dead in this way.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's like it's like quadricected in the several, several parts.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Octosected.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Have you ever thought about a large quartet?

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You considered a large quartet.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I say.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, I guess it's so hard.

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
High school was so long ago.

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I feel like that was one hundred and fifty thousand years ago for me.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know, I asked hijack a pep rally.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, wow.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I like this.

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Turn it on its ear from being about the success of the basketball team and instead turn into a romantic opportunity.

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Say it would be a slam dunk if I could get to third base with you after the homecoming dance.

218
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But first you have to go with me.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So let's get it started.

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And then play the Black Eyed Peas song.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's get it started.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then have a cheer routine.

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A one man cheer routine worked out to it.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This sounds good.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Make her a mix CD.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Make her a mix CD of all Black Eyed Peas.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've got a feeling homecoming is going to be a good night.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We're going to go to Applebee's.

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then we'll dance to rap music from three years ago.

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Request stroke and they don't play it.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Greatest dance night ever.

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's a lot of music in this episode.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's like a musical episode.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think it's closest we're ever going to get.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hey, I've got a Yahoo Answers question.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Please, do tell.

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It comes to us from Robert Allen Cullen, which is a bad start.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's not a good start, but keep going.

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What would I have to do to become a wizard?

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I would like to become either a vampire or a wizard and I haven't gotten anything too promising on becoming a vampire.

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So I would like some information, some steps to take to become a wizard.

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well Robert, I'm glad you asked.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I have some pamphlets here that I think you might be interested in.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Not about wizard, but I run an anti-Harry Potter school that teaches kids that their magic is shameful.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Have you thought about the magic of our Lord and Savior?

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Jesus Christ, he means.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Have you thought about that magic?

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think when a lot of people hear the word wizard, they think magic.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Or Star Wars episode one.

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There are a lot of elements of the wizard lifestyle that I think you can adopt without knowing how to cast magic.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Step one, beard.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Beard up day one.

253
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Beard?

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Naked day two.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Naked day two because you're a wizard.

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Save something.

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A long robe?

259
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, a long robe.

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You need a familiar?

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
How are your sleeves?

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
By the way, everybody in class, your little brother doesn't count as your familiar.

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Way to put the effort into it.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Not.

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Not at all.

266
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And don't spray paint your cat.

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It seems like a good idea at first.

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Just spend the extra money and get the black cat with all the extras.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's worth it for the features.

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like that tail you can crank to cast spells.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You need to capture some villagers and lock them in your basement.

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, you're going like Evil Wiz.

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, no, no.

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I mean, that's a natural.

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Have you not read Harry Potter?

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think you might have been reading maybe like an offshoot series.

277
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Did you check these out on Harry Potter.info slash fan stories?

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I actually, I read Helter Skelter.

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's my bad.

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's on me.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's on you.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So is the theory we're working on here that if you have all the trappings of wizardry and you do all the things that magic powers just come,

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
like you wake up one morning and your beard is just long enough and so you can do things?

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Have you ever seen The Santa Clause?

286
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Clause spelled C-L-A-U-S-E as in like a legal clause.

288
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Uh huh.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Whoa, this is already funny.

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's kind of.

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Slow down.

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I didn't make it past the title.

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
God, Tim Allen, you know, he knows exactly where my funny bone is.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Like surgical stride style.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And what I love is that really opens it up for sequels.

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Mm hmm.

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Mm hmm.

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
How old is too old to wear skinny jeans for fellows?

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Jared asks.

301
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, Jared, what age are you?

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Because that age.

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is like asking when, you know, when a fetus is a fetus, when is it a baby?

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Because the answer is at conception.

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Now, if you got a fetus wearing skinny jeans, we are down with this.

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's the coolest maybe ever.

307
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, but we've already come out in favor of babies wearing hipster jeans.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I feel like you skinny jeans.

309
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I say screw it, man.

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If that look works for you, just go for it.

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I was about to say 30, but like I'm almost 30 and I wear skinny jeans on the reg.

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's all about what signal you want to send out, Jared.

313
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
If you want to send out the signal that you're like, someone's not wearing those for comfort.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They're wearing those because they want to make an impression on people.

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And you're saying, hey, I'm putting the effort into it.

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's up?

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I want my fanny meat to look like some grade A material.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want it.

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And I want it out there on display.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm not ashamed to wear pants that lift and separate.

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I want to advertise as much as Scott Pilgrim has been advertised.

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I want it out there like SP.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey, hey, come get this butt.

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, did you see now?

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think you're crossing into a different signal that you might not want to be sending.

327
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hey, you want some butt?

328
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've got some for you.

329
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This butt is yours.

330
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Just kidding.

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's mine.

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I keep it in these skinny jeans.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You want a slice?

334
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This butt's for you.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you like some butt?

336
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who going to carve up this butt?

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Who's going to carve up this butt for once?

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Several of my friends still dream big, says Jeff from Gmail.

339
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And I have ideas for greater things.

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And have ideas for greater things.

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
One always has movie ideas.

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Another has ideas for opening a cafe.

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't think that's an idea.

344
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And that's not even a particularly clever one.

345
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But anyway, moving on.

346
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Me?

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't recall having a good idea in years.

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Years.

349
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What could I do to get them think meet sparks firing, says Jeff from Gmail.

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Jeff, the world can't be full of leaders.

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There's got to be someone who shows up on day one with a hammer and says, point me in

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the right direction of your dream.

353
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let me help you build it for an equitable share of the profits.

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Jeff, let me take that one step further.

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Every hero needs his arch nemesis.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So hang out with these friends and every time they have an idea, you shoot it down.

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You poke holes in every single thing they say.

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
They need a naysayer.

359
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right?

360
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So they can rub it in their face and be like, take that, Jeff.

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The thing is, one has movie ideas.

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The other one wants to open a cafe.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I guarantee you those are both terrible ideas, whatever they are.

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And I guarantee you they will never, ever do those things, Jeff.

365
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You need to come up with like, like good practical ideas that you will actually use in your daily

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
life, like small victories.

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Like I'm going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with waffles for bread.

368
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Like, awesome idea, Jeff.

369
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Go do that.

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

371
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And then you got to you got like you only need one good idea.

372
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Take Richie Napster.

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He came with the idea of like, fuck paying for music.

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Fuck it.

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And look where he is today.

376
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know where Richie Napster is today, but I mean, I'm sure he's got a lot of money.

377
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What about what about Google Jones?

378
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Google Jones is another great example.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Just invent searching for shit.

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That guy had one good idea.

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I want to find some things on the web.

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's just a it's like a big stack of papers before that, just like piled on somebody's desk.

383
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And Google Jones is like, I need to find one of these papers.

384
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And three people had a heart attack just hearing his idea.

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like, of course, of course, G.J.

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What did we think of this before?

387
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And they helped him build it.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
They helped him build a service, which actually is called Surcho.

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And someone was like, wait a minute.

390
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Your first name is Googs.

391
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Googs.

392
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Googs, use your name.

393
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's call it Jones.

394
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Build on their ideas.

395
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If one has a movie about two buddy cops and they're like both hard nosed and but they're both former presidents.

396
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Call it founding fighters.

397
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Like just come up with something something really dope that that that builds on their idea and just steal their idea.

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, I just steal it.

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's a great idea.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, it's not so much open up a movie cafe.

401
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's not so much stealing as much as it is like when you when you play Price is Right and you bet one dollar over what the person before you bet.

402
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So if they do a movie about two buddy cops, you do one about three buddy cops.

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That would be actually a really great movie.

404
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Or just the one cops in the back seat of the time going, can we get like a burger or something?

405
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm really hungry.

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Maybe when you're maybe when like they tell them your ideas, combine them and then shoot them down together.

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm going to make a movie about how your cafe is going to close.

408
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It will do very poorly in the box office.

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Just like another movie I know about yours.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Laura from Gmail had a had a story about her boyfriend arguing about condoms and whose job it is.

411
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And she basically asked, we've we've experienced the wide world of hookups and dating.

412
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Whose job is it to provide the condoms?

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Laura, that's awfully presumptive of you.

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Griffin has taken a pledge to be chased until he he dates someone.

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
TLW, ladies.

416
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
TLW, true love waits.

417
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, the guys.

418
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
See, I went a step further.

419
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
OK, I had a condom surgically attached to my penis.

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, God, God.

421
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I just sometimes I just try to make Griffin sad.

422
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I yucked in my coffee cup.

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
How does that?

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So you can use it once?

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, that's the problem.

426
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He just keeps using it.

427
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If it actually gets punctured, it's considered a biological weapon.

428
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What is in there?

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What did you do?

430
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You killed 30 people.

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why are you standing with your pants around your ankle and a gas mask on?

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What are you doing?

433
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm the new outbreak monkey.

434
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm patient zero.

435
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
My wiener is patient zero.

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Are you wearing a fanny pack underneath your pants?

437
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Are you wearing a fanny pack?

438
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, I wish.

439
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, Jesus.

440
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I wish I'd put the forethought into this.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
For a surgically attached condom.

442
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's why it was an outpatient surgery.

443
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Now, here's my question, Travis.

444
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Did Blue Shield cover that?

445
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Part of it.

446
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

447
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It took a lot of paperwork.

448
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, I would imagine.

449
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I had to convince him it wasn't elective.

450
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
He got jealous of NuvaRings.

451
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He wanted a similar masculine alternative.

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

453
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Just everyone should carry them.

454
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
They give them to middle schoolers.

455
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Just everyone provide them.

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm confused.

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Doesn't everyone just have a box of six condoms that they had so long that they don't remember where they came from?

458
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

459
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Doesn't everybody just have that?

460
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I keep mine in an Altoids tin that has the words Jimmy Hats crudely scrawled upon it in Sharpies.

461
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I got it in the fifth grade.

462
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
A very sexually active ten-year-old.

463
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's not true, Dad.

464
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Hey, Laura.

465
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Here's your answer.

466
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Whose job is it?

467
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Everyone's.

468
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Be safe, kids.

469
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Johnny B says, I thought you'd enjoy this tale.

470
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I was in Southwest PA a few weeks ago for my fiancee's family reunion.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And while en route to said reunion, I passed a sign for a road called Jessup Street.

472
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The completely mind-blowing thing was that some NBNB AM fan had put a hand-made sticker of the word Mega in front of Jessup.

473
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Had I been driving, I would have pulled over for a snapshot.

474
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And sadly, we took a different way home.

475
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Hope you guys are doing great.

476
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Johnny B.

477
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Johnny B.

478
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm not sure that's true.

479
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's totally true.

480
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I've always said our shit is poppin' in Southwest PA.

481
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah.

482
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Southwest PA is probably like the epicenter.

483
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I heard they're having an NBNB AM convention in Southwest PA.

484
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It's called NBNB, N-B-P-A-M.

485
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
There's a lot of weird letters in there.

486
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

487
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Unfortunately, we weren't invited.

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
No.

489
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because they know we would have said no.

490
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
We have too many enemies.

491
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And they want to avoid that embarrassment.

492
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Too many enemies in the Southwest PA area.

493
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
God knows that's true.

494
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's like what, Pittsburgh?

495
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Is it?

496
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think so.

497
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's gross.

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
If you're listening in Pittsburgh, I don't really think Pittsburgh is gross.

499
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
If you're not listening in Pittsburgh, I totally do.

500
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Fuck that, CD.

501
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah.

502
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And if you drive into Pittsburgh later, we don't think it's gross.

503
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't want you to think you're wrong about things.

504
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Because we're pretty much always right.

505
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
FormSpring.

506
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I've known my best friend for eight years, but we never seem to talk about our feelings.

507
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We're both guys, so I guess that's normal.

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But I don't think we've ever hugged.

509
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Not even once.

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh, man.

511
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
In tough times, we'd always use texts.

512
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What?

513
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What's the best way for us to open up?

514
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
FormSpring.

515
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm confused.

516
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You're having a rough day.

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And you're like, argh.

518
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And then you text him, even though he's sitting right next to you.

519
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Hey, Brad.

520
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm too embarrassed to say this with my mouth.

521
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But you hurt my feelings.

522
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Now, first of all, let's get past that we're guys, so it's normal.

523
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That ain't normal.

524
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Guys, open up.

525
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Don't give in to the stereotype.

526
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Love each other, man.

527
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
What are you worried about?

528
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think everyone's allowed to have one.

529
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Maybe not.

530
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Allowed isn't the right word.

531
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,840
Very organically, everyone develops one male friend that they can talk to about the lonely

532
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
times.

533
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Yeah.

534
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah.

535
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
When they come.

536
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
What are you worried about?

537
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
That is my question.

538
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,000
Like, if you're worried that people are going to think you're undercover gay, like, nothing

539
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,440
screams undercover gay more than, I won't touch another man.

540
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,800
That's like, wow.

541
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Self-hating.

542
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,080
Jeff, there's a great idea for a movie, by the way.

543
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
Yeah, Jeff.

544
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
You what?

545
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Undercover gay.

546
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,880
The sequel to Undercover Brother.

547
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,360
I haven't talked about my feelings in close to 12 years, so I'm probably not the best

548
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
person to feel this way.

549
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Just bottle it up.

550
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Bottle it up.

551
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,240
Okay, here's my answer.

552
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,880
Just at a really random time, just hug him.

553
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,760
Just grab him and hug him and whisper in his ear, don't let this be weird.

554
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,680
Perhaps at a ball game.

555
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Yeah.

556
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,960
I like that.

557
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,400
Or maybe you're sitting front row watching Chris Kattan in Undercover Gay, and you just

558
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,960
hug him and think, I love you.

559
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,240
Thanks for getting me out of the house, Brad.

560
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Come get this.

561
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Hug.

562
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,880
Come get what I made.

563
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Come in here.

564
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Come in here.

565
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,000
Hey, Brad, how do these skinny jeans look?

566
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Give me a hug.

567
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I got you this hug.

568
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Now carve this butt.

569
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Carve my butt, Brad.

570
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,040
Carve it.

571
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
If you didn't-

572
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Not in a gay way, though.

573
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
Not in a gay way.

574
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Just carve my butt like in a straight, just bros way.

575
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,800
If you didn't answer my question on the show, will you respond eventually, says FormSpring.

576
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,120
Oh, boy.

577
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,640
Hey, folks, you can still put your name on the FormSpring question, okay?

578
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,080
Here's my suggestion.

579
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
Send it again.

580
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Whoa.

581
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Yeah.

582
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,520
You're putting yourself up to a lot of work, isn't it?

583
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,680
I'm a man who lives in the now, Justin.

584
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
Yeah, lives today.

585
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,800
I don't worry about what happened yesterday or even three seconds ago.

586
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
What?

587
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,360
I have that memento disease.

588
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,400
I have mementitis.

589
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Yeah, if it's still pressing, if you really need help, send it again.

590
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,440
We'll see what we can do.

591
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,560
But otherwise, probably not.

592
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Probably not.

593
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
We get a lot every week.

594
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
We do.

595
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,800
I was thinking that we could- We read them all.

596
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
We do read them all.

597
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
We promise that.

598
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,360
But I was thinking that what we could do is find one blanket answer that we can apply

599
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,340
to just large swaths of questions that are similar.

600
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,600
Maybe not one blanket answer, but a handful of blanket answers to some of our most commonly

601
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
asked questions.

602
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Okay.

603
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,160
Well, I call through a lot of the questions, so you want me to give you guys the questions

604
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,840
and you give me the answer?

605
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,220
I don't even think we need the questions.

606
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,120
I think we can just say the answers and the people who ask the questions will know.

607
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
I've got one.

608
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,800
Just kiss her, dummy.

609
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,200
Yeah, just kiss her, dummy.

610
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Yeah.

611
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,360
Wow, that takes care of a lot of it, doesn't it?

612
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Just quit already.

613
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,480
Oh, that's a good one.

614
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,360
They're not really your friend.

615
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,360
That's a big one.

616
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Horse radish.

617
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Oh, yeah.

618
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,220
Just go to the doctor.

619
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,960
It's not supposed to look like that.

620
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,280
Those two are often conjoined.

621
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,480
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.

622
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
That covers everything, right?

623
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,360
Yeah, that's just about it.

624
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,120
I have one more, stop talking about masturbation, you freak.

625
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,120
You're freaking everybody out, weirdo.

626
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,280
We asked, we asked so nicely, don't be creepy anymore, and the next, the fucking next week

627
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,640
it was like, hey, I made a poop and masturbated it.

628
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Both rules.

629
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,360
Hey, I masturbated my poop.

630
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,040
Is that cool?

631
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,080
I made a poop and I masturbated on my poop and then I looked at it.

632
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Here's a picture.

633
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Deal with it, homes.

634
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,000
I seem to have a lot of trouble making and maintaining eye contact with other people

635
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,160
during conversations.

636
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Any advice?

637
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,560
Oh my God, I do the same thing.

638
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Yeah, me too.

639
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
I don't have advice.

640
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,320
No, here's what, I need your advice.

641
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,000
I've cultivated like this, I look off of their shoulders and try to look really thoughtful

642
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,720
and pensive so they're thinking, oh, he's having big ideas, but really I'm bored.

643
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
I make up for it though.

644
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,440
Hey Travis, hey Travis, that's somebody who's known you for your entire life.

645
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,880
We're onto you.

646
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,520
I make up, I make up for my lack of eye contact by keeping a constant physical contact with

647
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,840
everyone I ever talk to.

648
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,280
Either just have a hand on the cheek, just a hand on the cheek, just constantly brushing

649
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,240
hair away from their eyes and behind their ears or, or holding their hands or giving

650
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,560
them like a light massage.

651
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,360
Here's what you need to do, just unwavering eye contact, intense, burning.

652
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,120
You're testing yourself, remember?

653
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,220
And if they try to look away, you start screaming, don't look away, don't look away.

654
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,080
It's like a firm handshake staring somebody down and it's important that you establish

655
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,640
that dominance, I think.

656
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Yeah.

657
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,180
I need help learning how to cook, says Thomas from Gmail.

658
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,000
The only thing I know how to cook is the, that's what it sounds like when I say quotations.

659
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,840
It's microwavable foods and tasty sandwiches, but it's good.

660
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,160
I have mastered both of these cooking techniques, but I need to know how to cook actual meals.

661
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,900
I'm getting to the point where I'll move out and live on my own soon.

662
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,960
Are there any recipes or websites you can recommend to me?

663
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,400
Thank you for the help, says Thomas from Gmail.

664
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,440
Before we get into funny things, I have a real answer that started my cooking journey.

665
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,800
There's a series of books called A Man, A Can and a Plan, A Man, A Can and a Microwave

666
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,400
and A Man, A Can and a Grill.

667
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Find these books.

668
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,560
They're all like six ingredient recipes that take about 15 minutes.

669
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,280
They are delicious and they are impressive.

670
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
Go buy these books.

671
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,260
And they will give you diabetes.

672
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,000
And they will, they will give you the diabetes.

673
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,120
You know, it really is about, is about just trying it.

674
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,920
I mean, what you can do is watch, you watch Food Network and just pick something that

675
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,360
looks fairly easy and just, just try it.

676
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,040
And if, if you are a novice, Good Eats spells it out very plainly.

677
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
It's very scientific.

678
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah, Good Eats.

679
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,600
And Alton Brown writes some good books.

680
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,080
You can check those out.

681
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,920
Otherwise I will say pasta, pasta is easy to make.

682
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,240
So, so easy.

683
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,680
You make like noodles and you buy some sauce, comes pre-pro and then you, you dump the sauce

684
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
on the noodles.

685
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,020
Maybe some, some vegetables that you can steam in like a bag and a microwave.

686
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,400
See you're using the skills you already possess.

687
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,160
Also, you know who, you know what's great?

688
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,280
Search on YouTube for starving with Lewis.

689
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:31,320
That's a friend of mine who does, he does sort of like college cooking, but it's sort

690
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:39,560
of like that, like evolving from ramen and stuff to, to, to not ramen.

691
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,320
And he's got suicide girls in there sometimes.

692
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,920
So it's good stuff.

693
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
For the fellas.

694
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,840
If you want anything else, pick out an ingredient that you're interested in.

695
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,720
Like I bought this eggplant and then go online and search eggplant recipes.

696
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,120
But make sure whenever you, whenever you announce that ingredient, you do it like the guy from

697
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Iron Chef.

698
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,680
Especially if you're alone in your kitchen, that will make, that will make the learning

699
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,320
times horse or standing in the middle of the supermarket.

700
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,960
Just go down the road and take a bite out of it.

701
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:16,640
I want to hear Griffin's last question, it's always a doozy, but a few housekeeping things.

702
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,640
You can, if you want to ask a question, you can log on to nbmbam.com.

703
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,840
We have all the methods there.

704
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,080
We we're going to get a new site soon, hopefully we're working on that right now for you.

705
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,500
If you have any requests, you could of course email them to nbmbam at gmail.com.

706
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,760
There are still plenty of t-shirts if you'd like to purchase those.

707
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,440
The logo t-shirt we'll probably keep making some version of.

708
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,320
The Jeffrey t-shirt, not so much.

709
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Limited-ish.

710
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Limited-ish.

711
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,880
So, if you want one, get it.

712
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,920
Is there anything else?

713
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Thanks, thank you.

714
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,480
Oh my god, thank you so much.

715
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
We're nearing up on 200,000.

716
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,400
Last week was our biggest download day by like a thousand.

717
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I don't know what happened.

718
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
You guys are nuts.

719
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
But you guys killed it.

720
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,640
You guys knocked it out of the water.

721
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:22,160
And we really appreciate everybody dropping quotes and just promoting the show, helping

722
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,200
out.

723
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:30,720
Twitter user MyBeautifulLiar helped spread the word this week.

724
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,240
Tony Lemon, he's out there doing God's work, telling people about NB&B AM.

725
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
We appreciate it.

726
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Seriously, you guys have no idea.

727
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,000
I would like to thank my friend Alex Goodrich, sent me a question from WikiLinks, Wiki, excuse

728
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,280
me, WikiAnswers that I think is going to be a whole new venue that we can travel down.

729
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
So I wanted to say thank you for that.

730
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Oh boy.

731
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Can't wait for that.

732
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Uh oh.

733
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Uh oh.

734
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,400
And if you get a second, if you wouldn't mind subscribing on iTunes if you haven't already

735
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,400
done that and leaving a rating or a review on iTunes, because when you do that, it helps

736
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,360
us move up the iTunes rankings, which helps even more people find our show.

737
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Just if you get a second.

738
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,440
I know you're busy, but.

739
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,000
And tell everybody to download it on Monday.

740
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,040
And when we do that, we go up.

741
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,760
That's good.

742
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,960
Because that's the only way we're going to get huge.

743
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,640
And start contacting your local NPR station and asking them why they don't carry our

744
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,360
show up on that shit.

745
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Yeah.

746
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,080
And ask your local county commission why they don't have an official My Brother My Brother

747
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,960
Me day while you're at it.

748
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
Just think about it.

749
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Griffin.

750
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Gracious.

751
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,520
This, uh, this Yahoo answers question.

752
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:49,560
It was sent in by fan of the show Declan, which is just really, really cool.

753
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Oh, oh wait.

754
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,400
Before you read it, I got a letter from Tristan.

755
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,400
He's doing great, but it sounds terrible what he's doing.

756
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,600
It sounds really hard, but I guess boot camp really tough boot camp really tough, but Tristan's

757
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,920
doing well for people.

758
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,400
You can write him.

759
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
I think his address is in the Facebook group anyway.

760
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
All right.

761
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Good.

762
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Sorry.

763
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Thank you, Tristan.

764
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Thank you, Tristan, for your service.

765
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Freedom.

766
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Thank you.

767
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,960
And thank you, Declan, for your service of sending in this question.

768
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,160
This one is from Yahoo answers user Chris.

769
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:37,520
Who asks, how do I get help with the legalization of zoo file marriage?

770
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
I'm Travis McElroy.

771
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

772
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,720
And this has been my brother, my brother and me kiss your dad, where on the lips you will

773
00:37:46,720 --> 00:38:04,000
never know me.

774
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:24,880
Hey, everybody, sorry we forgot to mention it during the show, but Jay Phonic has a new

775
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:32,960
jam, untitled, I think, but it's it's so fresh and and we have to put it in the show.

776
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,200
So as a reward for sticking around a little post credits bonus.

777
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
I got a question.

778
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
How do you feel about man sized jaws?

779
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
I'm the kind of boy that you don't have to push it very hard.

780
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Just pull out your telephone and put away your signal flags and I'll be there.

781
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
Taste with my little bag.

782
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Baby girl, you wanna get down with my mega Jess up.

783
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Turn around, get on your knees and baby pull that dress up.

784
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm like Tristan, sweeping through for mankind.

785
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
I love this lesbian.

786
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I'll kill them and shut down in no time.

787
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
My rhymes are tight cause I'm infused with soul power.

788
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,960
I'm like Jerry Matthews, man, playing all of them on the watchtower.

789
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
And when I rock, I'm like, you know, I'm anything but simple.

790
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
And girl, get your hands up on my wallet.

791
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
If you don't like it, don't be shy.

792
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

793
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Baby girl, you wanna get down with my mega Jess up.

794
00:39:41,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Turn around, get on your knees and baby pull that dress up.
