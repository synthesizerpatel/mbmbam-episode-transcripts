1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,440
We're now gonna be around, if you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,760
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds are calling. Could it really be? Could it be a week

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,680
has passed already? You've lived, laughed, loved, learned, loomed for seven days, and now you are

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,040
back for all our loving embrace. We did a bit of eating, did a bit of praying, and did some loving.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,120
Yeah. Now a week has passed, the Earth has spun on its axis seven times. You have a new set of

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,880
problems. New problems. And a new set of skin cells. New skin cells. You shed the old ones,

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,520
now it's time to shed the chains, time to shed the yoke of your burdens, and put that shit right on

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,840
us, Annie. It's funny because your skin cells today have never heard of my brother, my brother,

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,520
me. You're a whole new person. Every time you listen to In My Boom Bam, it's your skin's first

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,880
time. Yeah, your skin, your new skin, may not like it. If so, are bad. Yeah, it's like the,

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,720
how the new Doctor Who doesn't like black people. Exactly. Yeah, have you not seen it? It's a really

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,640
super racist. It got real weird. It's a weird direction they're taking. He actually just goes

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,920
back in time to stop like equal rights and everything. It's really weird. It's pretty

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,680
inappropriate actually. Yeah, but God, compelling. It's so good. The writing's so good. The writing,

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,640
you can't. I like his albino companion. Yeah. He's the widest bird on the board. Crikey.

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,280
Crikey? That's what they say, right, Doctor Who? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what they say.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,440
And shag. So let's help some people. This is, of course, My Brother, My Brother and Me. It's an

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,960
advice show for the modern era and now wisdom. Ian from Gmail writes, he says, my brother wants

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,880
to name his first born child Anakin. Stop. No, no, you can't stop because Ian feels compelled to tell

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,640
us after the Star Wars character. Thank you, Ian. Thank you so much. Oh, not Anakin Jones,

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,960
the political leader. It may surprise you to learn that I'm the type of person who's never

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,040
seen a Star Wars movie before. Is that the one about the missile defense system in the 1970s?

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,280
Yeah, correct. Is it a documentary? While I'm mildly amused by this, I fear it could wind up

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,200
in the same vein as having the middle name Danger. What should I do to convince him otherwise? Or

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,800
should he learn from his own mistakes? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, he's not he's not the one who has to. It's

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,560
your brother. Well, live and learn. I regret your brother will never look back 18 years from now

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,080
and be like, man, that was a bad move. Really? Should I never name that kid Anakin? I regret

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,960
that. He's not going to know that my kids been beaten to death. Yeah, he's not going to be the

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,960
one that hangs himself in his closet when he's 10 years old. Yeah, that that's not a good name.

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,880
You could maybe use this as an opportunity to turn him on to my brother. My brother and me

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,320
hit podcast and we could just sort of tell him like, don't do that. Maybe Luke go with Luke.

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a fine normal person name. Yeah. Jar Jar Binks. The problem with Anakin and Jar Jar Binks

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,480
is that you are saying there is no room for equivocation. Like it is named after the character

38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,520
in Star Wars. It's not maybe I had a friend a couple of years ago and she said, my first daughter,

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm going to name Hermione. It's like, no, you don't at all want to do that. You never

40
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,280
want to name your kid anything that's that recognizably nerdy. Like, this is my son, Kal-El.

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,040
Sorry, Nicholas Cage. But you just want to keep that to yourself. Have that be a personal thing

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,120
in your heart that you don't saddle on your poor unborn fetus. Maybe Anakin could be like a nickname

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,680
and and now and you can call that to yourself. No, still not that maybe a middle name.

44
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,280
Why don't you name your son Lightsaber? How about Podracer? This is my son X-Wing.

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
Hi, have you met my boy Wizard? He's wizard.

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Oh my God, you guys, I cannot believe we didn't talk about this already.

47
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:59,120
Why don't you name your son David Hasselhoff? Whoa, there it is. We got the official seal

48
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,680
of approval from Mr. David Hasselhoff on Twitter. I think I want to go ahead and say we're his

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:13,760
official source for life advice, but it's really recent. We haven't been guiding every step he's

50
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,640
made. We're working hard now. There are probably a few bad decisions that we could have steered

51
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,520
him away from, like the whole the whole drunken eating a burger on the floor with his shirt on.

52
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,840
I do that. I do that. I ain't judging him. Yeah, but you don't do that on video on the

53
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,360
internet. Have you ever tried to convince a drunk person to not eat a hamburger?

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
I don't care how good our show is. It's not gonna happen. Hey, don't eat that.

55
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
It's like convincing Doctor Who not to hate black people. Exactly.

56
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,280
But all joking aside, I know he's a fan of the show. I mean, why else? Why else would he be

57
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,760
following us? I know he's a fan of the show. And so, David, just thank you for God damn it. Thank

58
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,680
you for everything. Thank you for your performances on the television programs that you've been on.

59
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,080
Thank you for Knight Rider. Thank you for bringing down the Berlin Wall single handedly. That's

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,720
probably the most important contribution that you've done. I was talking to some friends and

61
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,760
the first thing I did when I found out was contact everyone I've ever known in my life and say,

62
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,880
hey, look at this thing I've done. But I finally put it in context of why it was so amazing. And

63
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,840
I said, if I had a time machine and I could go back in time five years and tell five years

64
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,480
younger Travis that in five years he was going to do something that David Hasselhoff not only listened

65
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,360
to, but enjoyed, there is no way I would ever believe that. It's just the greatest thing that's

66
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
ever happened to me. And I've done some pretty awesome things in my life. Just to reiterate,

67
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,400
he definitely, definitely listens. Definitely 100% chance that he listens.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,920
The forecast is 100% chance of my brother, my brother, me precipitation in David Hasselhoff's

69
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
ear holes. Definitely, definitely no room for equivocation there. So thanks, Hoff.

70
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,560
What was that show where he played a car, where he transformed into a car?

71
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
That would be-

72
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,240
Fight Rider.

73
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
Knight Rider.

74
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Knight Rider.

75
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,280
Knight Rider?

76
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,760
Only he was the driver of the car. It was Mr. Feeny that was the one that transformed into the

77
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,160
car.

78
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,560
Mr. Feeny was like a friend of his and he transformed into a car when things got

79
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
hot. When he was eating hot food.

80
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,680
Mr. Feeny was a friend of his and then was killed by a car and his soul inhabited the car.

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,200
Got eaten by the car.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,840
Yeah, that was that. It's a great show. Check it out.

83
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,200
No, you're thinking of the movie Click.

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
The Hoff is a tremendous performance in that.

85
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:36,960
Yeah.

86
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,320
In the future.

87
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,360
So Lucas writes us, again, Hoff, thank you because you're definitely listening.

88
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
So I just started college and my roommates are friends of mine from high school.

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,480
My problem is I realized I'm almost nothing like them.

90
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,680
I'm even kind of wondering how I became friends with them in the first place.

91
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,920
They think things I like are stupid.

92
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,200
They don't understand my positions and opinions on things and often call things I like gay.

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,240
They often play it off by saying they're just messing around, but it's so often that I'm

94
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
really getting sick of it.

95
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
What do I do? Lucas, they sound terrible, dude.

96
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
They sound like the worst.

97
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
This is an object lesson in the difference between high school friends and college friends.

98
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,200
Now that you have grown up a little bit and realized that you don't have anything in common

99
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,000
with these people, that's a common problem in that transition.

100
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
It's time to get out of that friendship.

101
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,400
Yeah, we can we I mean, maybe this stuff, Lucas slice is just gay.

102
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,120
Maybe dude reads like comic books and gay shit like that.

103
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,160
Like, yeah.

104
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,640
Maybe you do it a bunch of gay shit, Lucas.

105
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,320
You read anime.

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
You read anime, Lucas.

107
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,960
Maybe like just put put away your childish things.

108
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
Go hit up the gym.

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
Just go hit up the gym with your boys.

110
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,160
Like maybe maybe you're the one with the problem, not them.

111
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,720
Um, maybe you should stop hanging full size posters of yourself having sex with men.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
Well, this is art.

114
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
And in other people's room.

115
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,880
This is an intervention.

116
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,240
Put down the Twilight books.

117
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,600
Get out there.

118
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,320
Meet some ladies.

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Now the guy, Lucas, these guys sound like a nightmare.

120
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,680
Yeah, you will find other people that you like.

121
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,920
And even if you like, even if you have to walk the world alone, like that guy in

122
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Kung Fu, like you don't have to deal with people calling things you like gay.

123
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
Nobody has the right to do that.

124
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,360
Now, the other side of that coin, though, is if they're your roommates, you've probably

125
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
signed a lease or have a dorm with them.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
So what you want to do is avoid them as much as possible.

127
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,160
Like, no joke.

128
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Just because they're your roommates, you don't have to hang out with them.

129
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,400
Find some new friends and just try to see them as little as possible.

130
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
You're in college, right?

131
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Dude, there's no sense in you getting bullied anymore.

132
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,600
It's not happening.

133
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,760
You, right, go hang out with other people, sleep in your room, just muscle through it.

134
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,000
But don't deal with these pricks.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,560
They sound like they suck.

136
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,720
The only reason that you became friends with them in the first place is because high school

137
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,440
is like prison.

138
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,280
If you don't get into a group, you'll get stabbed on the playground or whatever.

139
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah.

140
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,560
The next time they said they're just playing it off, just tell them fuck off.

141
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,280
You know what I mean?

142
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,400
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,840
You don't need their explanations.

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
Just tell them to get the fuck out.

145
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,400
You know what?

146
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Go back to those prison rules.

147
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Shiv one.

148
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Yeah.

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
Yeah, see who's gay now.

150
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,960
You know what?

151
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,160
Shiv him and then have sex with the Shiv wood and say, yeah, you're right.

152
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,720
This is gay.

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,240
This is pretty gay what I'm doing to you right now.

154
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
You're pretty fucking gay.

155
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,640
And you're also dead.

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,280
And you're dead.

157
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,800
How's your dead corpse?

158
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm in jail now.

159
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
And ironically, I'm in prison for that.

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
Or I'm making the best friends of my entire life.

161
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm making the best friends for having such a good time.

162
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,480
Me and tiny love are going to fucking kill you.

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,200
Hey, hey.

164
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
Tiny love and I are getting out.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
I have a Yahoo answer question.

166
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,760
It was sent in by Dilbob.

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Thank you, Dilbob.

168
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
It's from Yahoo answers user Desmond Hume.

169
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
Oh, how nice.

170
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,520
So as you can imagine, a Yahoo answer question named after the philosopher and lost character

171
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,240
Desmond Hume is going to be very, very well thought out.

172
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
And why are my ears never dirty?

173
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm 17 and my ears are never dirty.

174
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,920
I never have to clean them.

175
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,880
I try.

176
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
Nothing comes out.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,500
Why?

178
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,400
Worst superpower ever.

179
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
That was actually the first answer is you have a supernatural power where your ears never get

180
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,000
dirty.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
Rare, but extravagant.

182
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,440
Lucky.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,880
I like that he clarifies that he's 17.

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,360
Yeah.

185
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
Well, I mean, that's part of puberty, right?

186
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Your ears really don't start producing that man wax until, you know, 2021.

187
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,300
Yeah.

188
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,320
Market a product called man wax.

189
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,640
Are you telling me that in the year 2021, my ears are going to start producing man wax?

190
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,140
Yeah.

191
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,360
Everybody.

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,520
That's when we're going to have the dyslexic apocalypse and just the wax is just going

193
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
to be flowing.

194
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,220
Yeah.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,680
At the same time, though, I know what he's talking about.

196
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,200
Like there are those days where you just get a Q-tip up in there and you try and, you know,

197
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,840
get some relief and then nothing happens.

198
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,640
And that's a heartbreaking experience.

199
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,120
I picture him like standing at the bathroom sink, just gripping the counter and staring

200
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,360
at himself in the mirror and saying, today's the day and slowly bringing a Q-tip up to

201
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,560
his ear and then nothing.

202
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,520
Like maybe that's a thing.

203
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,680
Like maybe that's like pubes used to be for young dudes and I guess periods used to be

204
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,560
for young ladies.

205
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,280
Like all my friends have got their wax already.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,720
Yeah.

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,080
When will I get the wax?

208
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,600
When will I get the wax?

209
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Oh, youngling, the waxing happens when you're most ready.

210
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,520
We do not choose the time of all waxing.

211
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,040
I can't show my face at school anymore until I get some wax.

212
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
Everyone knows how clean my ears are.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
The guys say, the guys say there's Jimmy clean ears.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,960
When we're in the locker room, they're all poking fun in my ears.

215
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,720
They're all in homeroom just picking away at their sweet lax ears.

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm just sitting there looking like a jackass.

217
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160
Like a chump.

218
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, I can't get any wax.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,640
I got all mine out already this morning.

220
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,600
I save them in a jar.

221
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,400
I'll show you someday.

222
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,120
I'll bring it in.

223
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,680
I promise.

224
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,960
Dear mama, dear mama, when will I get the wax?

225
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
Soon, my baby.

226
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,920
Soon.

227
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
You know, you should never use Q-tips.

228
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Don't give me that shit.

229
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
You're poking your brain.

230
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,760
I'll use anything that has a long line.

231
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,280
You should rinse your ear.

232
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,000
You should rinse your ears every day with warm water.

233
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,760
Is it troubling that my left ear when I use the Q-tip, it immediately makes me cough.

234
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,440
That's a problem.

235
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Yeah, that's a definite problem.

236
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,120
I think you've got an impaction of some sort.

237
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,360
Great.

238
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,120
I've just started this wonderful relationship with an amazing girl I met through Dungeons

239
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,320
and Dragons tabletop.

240
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't ever let her go.

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,280
The problem is I've never been in a serious relationship before.

242
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,040
I don't know when or how to display the appropriate signs of affection.

243
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,840
Hugging, kissing, holding hands, please help.

244
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,800
Et cetera.

245
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,440
Et cetera.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
Please help as soon as possible.

247
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,720
Dating and dragons, Gmail.

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay, first off, yes.

249
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,240
Secondly, it sounds like you got the basics down.

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
It goes hug, kiss, hold a hand.

251
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
Hug, hug me.

252
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Et cetera.

253
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,240
All right, let's be delicate here.

254
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
Okay.

255
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,920
Because this sounds like for a serious relationship, it sounds like you need some advice.

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,280
All right, let's get serious.

257
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,840
Here's what's tricky about this dating and dragons is it differs for every relationship.

258
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
Or sometimes you've got to have that slow crawl to the top where you start with holding

259
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:05,680
hands and then awkward hug and then a kiss and then a little bit of hanky panky, which

260
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,600
is the scientific term for it, and then full on hanky panky.

261
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Some relationships, some relationships you just got to jump right into the hanky panky

262
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,280
and then work your way backwards from there.

263
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,240
Like relationships with prostitutes, like pretty woman, did you see?

264
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah, hand holding is a good sort of all purpose thing, but it says to the world like, hey,

265
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,680
hey, we are dating and this is my property.

266
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:44,000
You should also announce loudly several intervals, my property eyes off and in all seriousness,

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,880
don't display affection at the game.

268
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,680
Your friends will kill your girlfriend off and then you'll have this awkward situation

269
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
where, you know, do you leave the game?

270
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,400
Here's what you're going to want to do when you're sitting on the couch and it's a romantic

271
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,440
time, a loving time, if you will, you're going to make eye contact and then you're

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
going to roll a perception check.

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,400
Travis, I know I do what I can.

274
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,520
It's the little things.

275
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,960
It's it's, you know, affection doesn't have to be in the in the physical ways that

276
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,680
everybody thinks it's whatever feels right for you.

277
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,920
It's it's mainly about showing that you're considerate.

278
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,560
So, you know, if you know she's had a hard day, you make dinner.

279
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,040
If she forgot to get her retainer, you go get it for her.

280
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,440
If she needs help hanging up her cloak, that's another thing you could do.

281
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,920
Maybe polishing her bo staff.

282
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,560
You guys are making jokes, but I think that there's an angle to this question we haven't

283
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,400
considered yet, which is girls that play Dungeons and Dragons are fucking freaks, yo.

284
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,160
Freak? Crazy, crazy, yo.

285
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,480
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed.

286
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
She may ask, what?

287
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,060
What?

288
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,680
Lady in the caverns, but a freak in the bed roll.

289
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm saying I'm saying she's probably so shy, but see in her secret heart of hearts.

290
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,280
She ain't wearing anything underneath that cloak.

291
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
She, she is ready.

292
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,080
You need to storm her castle.

293
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,880
A Chastity Belt's got a rip top on it, you know what's up.

294
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,920
Breakaway Chastity Belt, more like.

295
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,920
All right, let's get five more Dungeons and Dragons theme sexual innuendos in.

296
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm actually cached.

297
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,600
Are you tapped out?

298
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
I'm all out.

299
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,520
That was it, yeah.

300
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
Dear brothers, what is the best way to pick up what?

301
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
Wait, hold on before we move on.

302
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
Did, do we fully answer dating and dragons question?

303
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
It's about what you feel comfortable with.

304
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,600
And here's the thing, as far as moving to new levels of signs of affection.

305
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
You gotta have enough experience first.

306
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,160
If you wait to be a hundred percent sure that it's time, you will always be waiting.

307
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,400
Sometimes you just got to sack up and, you know, move forward and initiative.

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
She's a girl that plays Dungeons and Dragons.

309
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,120
She's, she's ready.

310
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
Yeah, she's DTP.

311
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,440
She's down to party.

312
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,920
Dear brothers, what is the best way to pick up ladies at a library?

313
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm a college student as opposed to a homeless man.

314
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,640
I just, I take my showers at the library bathroom sink.

315
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,800
And I've been thinking about homeless dude.

316
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,600
And I think you have a couple of options.

317
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,200
Um, you could follow her around, follow a lady around, uh, and as she picks up books,

318
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
just go, yeah, I read that one.

319
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,560
That one's great.

320
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,680
He dies in the end.

321
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
I mean, you don't even have to have read the books.

322
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,520
I mean, you probably won't have read these books.

323
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,760
So don't, don't follow up with, with any questions she might ask about the book.

324
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,840
Just, you know, say every single, I mean, every single book that she picks up, tell

325
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
her that you've read it.

326
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,320
Um, also books are heavy, which is something you have to keep in mind, which offers up

327
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,120
a couple of options.

328
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,840
One, you just carry around a bunch of really heavy books and it makes you look so, so strong

329
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,400
and smart.

330
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
Or you could offer to carry her books for her.

331
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:34,400
What I, what my jam used to be, my, my, my old game was, uh, I'd go to the library and,

332
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:43,920
uh, I'd look in the section of the library where, where all the books are about home

333
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,360
remedies for penis reduction.

334
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,640
And then just, just stand there with your hands on your hips and just keep saying nothing.

335
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,240
There's nothing that works.

336
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,320
What's the Dewey Decimal Code for that section?

337
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,040
Do you remember that?

338
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,440
B-I-G.

339
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,600
Hey, good.

340
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
I don't know the Dewey Decimal System.

341
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,840
Who knows the fucking Dewey Decimal System?

342
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,040
Big penis time.

343
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,680
I don't know.

344
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,040
What is the Dewey Decimal System?

345
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,680
How does that work?

346
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,560
In case you're thinking of sending in a question about the Dewey Decimal System and asking

347
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,720
our advice, we're not going to be able to help you out on that.

348
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
This is not the place to come.

349
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,440
I've been-

350
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
If you want Library of Congress, I got that.

351
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,960
Yeah, he's got that on lockdown, on LOC down.

352
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,120
I've been considering learning to play the guitar.

353
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,200
My stepdad has a guitar and would be able to teach me, but I'm not sure if I'd be willing

354
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
to stick with the lessons and practice.

355
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,400
Is it worth it how to learn to play the guitar for casual playing?

356
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,320
Joey from Gmail.

357
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
Joe, yes.

358
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
Absolutely.

359
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
Absolutely.

360
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,240
Get on that now and get ready for the, let's say, wave of female attention.

361
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
The deluge of trim.

362
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,920
No, sir, no.

363
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,720
We talked about it.

364
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,840
No dice.

365
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,560
No.

366
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,880
Up to your neck in trim.

367
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,560
No, we talked about this at the meeting.

368
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,240
We covered this.

369
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah, we went over this.

370
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah, playing guitar is great.

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,920
I think probably Griffin and I could both be described as hobbyist guitar players.

372
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,120
It's nice to have something that you just do for you and you're not-

373
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,160
You're not, you know, trying to make a living at.

374
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,640
It's just a great way to impress your grandmother.

375
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,760
You think it's a hobby for me?

376
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,520
Oh, is it your life?

377
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,920
I mean, I would say I'm in the business of strumming.

378
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Yeah.

379
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
Strumming for trim.

380
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,040
No.

381
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,120
No, no, no.

382
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
I think it's a great idea.

383
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
I don't think the guitar is as hard to play as some people make it out to be.

384
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
It's nice.

385
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,560
I mean, if you play other instruments, especially, it's pretty easy to play.

386
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
It's particularly easy to learn.

387
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
I went from piano to guitar and I mean, all the basics, you know, chords and stuff.

388
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,160
That all transfers over.

389
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,600
The good thing about the guitar is you can really be to a point where you can play a song

390
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
in your first day.

391
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
And that's really rewarding.

392
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,920
Like once you're there to already have that sort of instant gratification and, you know,

393
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,480
from there, you can, it's not tough to stick with it because it is.

394
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
I mean, I enjoy it a lot.

395
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,760
And again, as Griffin, I'm sure we'll point out a couple more times, is great for wooing women,

396
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,880
ladies or dudes, if that's a thing.

397
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,360
As the non guitar playing McElroy, my only advice in this situation is when you do start

398
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,920
to learn and you do learn to play the guitar, choose your moments to play it carefully.

399
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,040
Here's a great moment too.

400
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,920
Sit on the quad.

401
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,720
Yeah.

402
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,320
A great moment is never don't be that douchebag who like goes to a party and sees a guitar

403
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,520
and is like, oh, I got this.

404
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,200
Joey, just ask yourself, do you want to end up like Travis?

405
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,440
Because if not, pick it up.

406
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,520
Because that's the only thing that separates us from him.

407
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,240
But look out.

408
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,720
That is true.

409
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,800
Can I also recommend maybe considering other instruments as well?

410
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,840
The piano is great.

411
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,120
The sousaphone.

412
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,440
The piano is great, but it's hard to get that Triem because like you can only play it when

413
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
there is a piano nearby.

414
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,600
A guitar is like a portable.

415
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,120
It's like a Triem gun.

416
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,240
A guitar is basically a portable piano is what we're saying.

417
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
Or a keytar.

418
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,480
A keytar.

419
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
Yeah.

420
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,240
No, what?

421
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,960
No.

422
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,640
No, that would be a terrible choice.

423
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,840
I'm trying to bring it back.

424
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,960
Why isn't anyone getting on board with the keytar revolution?

425
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
The important thing about the guitar and Griffin did touch on it.

426
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
We just can't hammer him enough.

427
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,080
The proper time to play your guitar publicly is never.

428
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,840
Never play it.

429
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,560
You play it at home to get good and then once a month you rack up the courage to go play

430
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
an open mic night.

431
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,240
And that's when you get the attention because that's an appropriate acceptable venue for

432
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,720
you to do that.

433
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
They expect you to do that.

434
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
When they say, where's your guitar?

435
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,200
You have to look at them confused and say, oh, I was under the impression that I should

436
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
never play my guitar publicly.

437
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,600
Unless you're really, really good.

438
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,040
Or physically attractive.

439
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,840
No, not even then.

440
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,560
Sounds good.

441
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,600
Yeah.

442
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
Nobody wants to hear it at the party.

443
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
Trust me.

444
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,280
Unless everybody's drinking and there's a campfire, maybe.

445
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,760
And even then it's going to be like, there'll be three guys who kind of know how to play

446
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,160
and you'll see them like get the jitters with their hands.

447
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,320
Like they just want to get their hands on it and just drop sweet home.

448
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,640
They just want to drop sweet home so hard.

449
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,480
And the formula that you should always keep in mind is for every one person that appreciates

450
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,000
you playing, there are 10 people that wish you were dead.

451
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,160
Yeah.

452
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,560
Is that a trade off you're willing to make?

453
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,160
It depends on who the one person is.

454
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,920
Another important thing that you have to keep in mind when you start playing guitar is what

455
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,200
songs you're going to choose to learn first that are going to be like your go to songs.

456
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,640
Because Joey, you are going to be tempted to just get on that Damien Rice train and

457
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,080
ride it to Trium Town.

458
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,600
But you can't do it.

459
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
You can't do it, Joey.

460
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,600
You should do.

461
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
You've got to do it a couple of times a month, but no more.

462
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,680
How would you avoid being in a wedding?

463
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,520
A friend of ours is about to propose to his awful girlfriend.

464
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,360
No one likes her.

465
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,800
I suspect he doesn't.

466
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,920
And she is rude and a supreme girly girl.

467
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,320
The women in our group of friends are worried this girl is going to ask us to be her bridesmaids.

468
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,560
We're sure our husband's boyfriends will be groomsmen, and we suspect she doesn't have

469
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,440
other friends.

470
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,080
This means dress shopping, wearing the dress she picks out, and a nightmare bachelorette

471
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,560
party.

472
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,440
So how would you avoid it?

473
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,080
Thanks.

474
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Signed, I'm so not your friend.

475
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,920
Gmail.

476
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
OK, all right.

477
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,440
This is going to be hard for you.

478
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm so not your friend.

479
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:04,240
And but sometimes when things are really important to us, we got we have to make sacrifices.

480
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,880
And so you're going to have to sacrifice your friendship with this guy and not go to

481
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,680
his wedding.

482
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,560
Yeah, you've got to come up with something better than the wedding that enlist in the

483
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,120
army and enlist in the army, anything.

484
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
But because here's the thing, like.

485
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,800
He's basically dead now.

486
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,920
Like, he's dead now.

487
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,480
You don't have him as a friend anymore because he married like the worst person and you don't

488
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,600
want to spend time with her.

489
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,560
So he's he's not around anymore.

490
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,680
He's gone.

491
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,040
Get used to saying, hey, do you guys remember James?

492
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
Whatever happened to James?

493
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,680
What do you mean?

494
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,400
I was at his wedding.

495
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,280
Oh, I was not.

496
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,160
I was not there.

497
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,200
Was it a lovely time?

498
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,840
No, it was awful because his girlfriend is a terrible person.

499
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,560
Oh, great.

500
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm glad I didn't go.

501
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,800
I'm sorry he died.

502
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,520
What do you mean?

503
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,240
I don't understand.

504
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,000
Counterpoint.

505
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,360
Uh oh.

506
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,880
Let's go to the fucking wedding.

507
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,840
Go to the wedding.

508
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
It's like one day out of your life.

509
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,240
No, but it's not.

510
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,040
No, it's not.

511
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,800
It's not he has to participate.

512
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,680
She has to participate.

513
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,560
She has to participate.

514
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,760
OK, but how do you avoid being in a wedding, not going to a wedding?

515
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
Everybody can go to a wedding being in the wedding.

516
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,280
Maybe.

517
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
No, you should be in the wedding and then sabotage the fuck out of it.

518
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,200
Sabotage.

519
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,440
What?

520
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,200
Yes, I love it.

521
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,600
Yes, we're going to tear this wedding apart.

522
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,040
You guys are writing a Jennifer Lopez movie and you don't even realize it.

523
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,720
Yes, I do.

524
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,120
You can't.

525
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,200
I've been working on it for two years.

526
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,680
You can't be faking that every time.

527
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,840
They're like, hey, we're going dress shopping.

528
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,560
Oh, I can't.

529
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,080
Someone died.

530
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,800
I have to go.

531
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,840
I have to go see their body or hey.

532
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Don't fake it.

533
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,040
Go on.

534
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,520
Bachelorette party tonight.

535
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,400
I can't that someone else is dead now.

536
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,880
No, well, you know, you once you have the one excuse for not going to the wedding,

537
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm pretty sure they won't keep asking you to go dress shopping.

538
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,560
And so I expect someone to be dead on your wedding day.

539
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
That's I'm allergic to love.

540
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
I think you make me too happy to be in your wedding.

541
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,760
I can't do it.

542
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
I think you should be supportive of your friend.

543
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,360
And I think that maybe you should get to know this this girlfriend slash future wife.

544
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
What if she was like, what if she's had a hard life and that's why she's so hard,

545
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,160
a hard exterior inside.

546
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,480
She's like a tootsie roll pop right inside.

547
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
She's just breaking that shell, break through the candy shell.

548
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,320
Yeah, I mean, realistically, you should just suck it up.

549
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
It's not it'll suck.

550
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,760
But, you know, sometimes as you get older, I think bad experiences are just as valuable

551
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,160
as good experiences, as long as they stick with you.

552
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,520
Because, you know, realistically, it might suck that day, but the next day it'll be funny

553
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,560
and you'll be glad that you still preserve that friendship.

554
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,280
And this relationship will probably self-destruct.

555
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,480
So, you know, say that to her on the wedding day.

556
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, don't do that.

557
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,920
Yahoo Answers, every Yahoo answer.

558
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,800
Can I drop it?

559
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,440
I was about to ask you personally to drop that.

560
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,200
Chris Depew sent this one in.

561
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
Thank you, Chris Depew.

562
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,840
It's from Yahoo Answers user Prashant Kapra.

563
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,960
Wait, hold on.

564
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,040
My whole day is about this person's name now.

565
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,880
Could you please read it one more time?

566
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,800
Prashant Kapra.

567
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Kapra.

568
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,320
Please spell the first name.

569
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,280
P-R-A-S-H-A-N-T K-H-A-P-R-E.

570
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
Prashant, I love it.

571
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
That's incredible.

572
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,520
Any future question we get about baby names?

573
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
Prashant Kapra.

574
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,560
Prashant, or I would also accept Ka-Fredrick.

575
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,040
Okay, if you do name your baby this, make sure they don't get on the internet and ask questions

576
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,640
like, how many months dose baby girl and baby boy takes for delivery?

577
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,360
Generally, on an average, how many months or weeks dose baby boy takes for delivery

578
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,520
and how many dose baby girl takes?

579
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,000
And dose it differ country continent wise?

580
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,680
Whoa, Prashant.

581
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Are those additional details?

582
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,600
Are those months, weeks counted from first day of last menses or from the ovulation?

583
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,360
This person is wildly vacillating between being a scientist and being a stupid person.

584
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,040
Right?

585
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,120
It's like she's cobbled together knowledge from pamphlets she's read.

586
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,160
Yeah, she's just saying things that she's heard like a child.

587
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,960
She's like a child.

588
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,760
Or he, I don't know, Prashant?

589
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,320
Prashant is...

590
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,440
I can't get too mad at Prashant though.

591
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,280
I think it's a lady.

592
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,680
I don't know.

593
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,480
To answer your question, Prashant, what happens is, so there's a gestation period and then

594
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,880
the fetus crawls into the mother's pouch and finishes its development and then is born

595
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
with a full knowledge of the world.

596
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,880
But that's not what this question is asking.

597
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,760
Let's break out the flow chart and figure this out.

598
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,240
In America, in North America, the continent of North America, it takes a baby boy 40 weeks

599
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,680
to develop, right?

600
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,080
A baby girl takes around 36, 37 weeks because women develop faster than men.

601
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,720
That's science.

602
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,680
In south of the equator, we'll say South America, it's a little bit faster.

603
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,680
It's about 25 weeks for boys and about 20 weeks for girls.

604
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,760
Antarctica...

605
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,280
That's because of all the coke.

606
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,600
Yeah, Antarctica, it's like, fuck, like a few days.

607
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,040
Oh, really?

608
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,680
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,000
For boys, girls is pretty much instantaneous.

610
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm not going to lie, it's rough on the women's bodies down there in Antarctica.

611
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
And also on the men's psyche.

612
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,500
Whoa.

613
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,680
Oh, no.

614
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,120
And baby.

615
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,240
You want to do another Yahoo Answer question?

616
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,040
I feel like we didn't get that much traction on the last one.

617
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,680
Yeah, do it.

618
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,640
This Yahoo Answers question was sent in by Chris DePew.

619
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,240
It's...

620
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,680
Wow, he's crushing it.

621
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,600
It's from xxerikaxxcute.

622
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,040
Okay, so it's a man, a 50-year-old man.

623
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,880
Who asks, how to be sexy when you're in eighth grade.

624
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,360
Whoa.

625
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,560
I want to be sexy and I need a man, anyone.

626
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,060
Anyone.

627
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,880
I think a more appropriate question is, how can I not be sexy when I'm in eighth grade, right?

628
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,960
How can I stop finding eighth graders sexy?

629
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,120
I am so bothered right now.

630
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,040
Oh, Jesus.

631
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:50,240
Just get into Mommy's Cosmos, the magazine, not the beverage, although either one, right?

632
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,160
Yeah, what's up? And just dress like any girl that you see in the book.

633
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,920
Yeah, any girl.

634
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,420
God.

635
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,440
And when you show more skin, that makes men happier.

636
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,400
It makes them think you're nice, I guess.

637
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,360
And make sure to tell everyone that you will accept anyone.

638
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,560
Any man.

639
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,520
Anyone.

640
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,240
On the internet.

641
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,640
Just make sure on the internet you say you will accept any man and you need a man in your eighth

642
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:14,960
grade.

643
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,720
There's nothing men love more than the sweet smell of desperation.

644
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
Preteen desperation.

645
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Someone who's-

646
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm afraid of dying alone.

647
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,280
Beaten down by life before they've had a chance to live.

648
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,000
That's what I like.

649
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,380
Yum.

650
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,960
I mean, I understand like it gets hard sometimes.

651
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
I mean, the Wiggles got canceled.

652
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
I mean, what are you supposed to do now?

653
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,960
What are you supposed to watch?

654
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,560
Justin Bieber's dating that one, that one, that bitch.

655
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,400
I'm not looking for Mr.

656
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,720
White.

657
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm looking for Captain Feathersword.

658
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,280
Literally that actor, if he could holler at me.

659
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm afraid like Chris Hansen's gonna kick in my door pretty soon.

660
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,880
Yeah, at any moment.

661
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,360
I got a question from Mary via Gmail.

662
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,480
She says, I'm a student at Dartmouth College.

663
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,040
Our official mascot is the big green.

664
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,680
With your bountiful wit and charm, might you be able to devise a mascot that is at least

665
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,720
slightly more domineering than a color swatch?

666
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
Mary, I've been thinking about this a lot.

667
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:34,320
And what I would like to suggest is that you get a mascot who is named after a notable

668
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,240
graduate of Dartmouth.

669
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,160
That sounds logical enough, right?

670
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
Let me suggest this.

671
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,680
What about the fightin' Rachel Dratches?

672
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,560
Okay, so just to clear this up, you did some pre-pro for this question, correct?

673
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,760
A little touch of pre-pro.

674
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,440
Might I suggest the fightin' Allison Fennellys, best known for her work as Ellen on Pete and

675
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,160
Pete.

676
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,880
Please tell me that's the full mascot name.

677
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,560
That is the full mascot.

678
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:18,480
And people be like, all right, let's go fightin' Allison Fennellys, best known for her work

679
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,960
as Ellen on Pete and Pete.

680
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,800
See, I like to think of what the costume for the mascot's gonna be, and I really like the

681
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,840
fightin' racists.

682
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,080
The fightin' racists?

683
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,240
Yeah.

684
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,120
Oh, they look, they dress like Doctor Who?

685
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,360
Yeah.

686
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,000
They show up in a TARDIS and then just come out and hate black people.

687
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,600
What struck me when I read this question, the idea that landed in my mind instantly,

688
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,840
how about the Dartmouth fancy lads?

689
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,160
Oh, just like little gentlemen?

690
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,800
Just like a little foppish gentleman with like a sailor's scarf and a beret and very

691
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,360
short shorts with knee-high stockings.

692
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,040
And maybe a little bit of makeup.

693
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Maybe just a little makeup on his face.

694
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,920
I love it.

695
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,880
What about the fightin' Chandra Rimes as screenwriter, director, and producer for Grey's

696
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,680
Anatomy?

697
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,600
Yeah, Chandra, that's a good one too.

698
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,480
Chandra Rimes.

699
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,000
Her costume could just be a woman having sex with television and destroying it.

700
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,200
Just fucking it up for everybody.

701
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,160
Oh, shit.

702
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,880
Oh, God.

703
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,120
What about the battling Aisha Tylers?

704
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,480
See, now I've got a Wikipedia Dartmouth College so I can get in on all the fun that you're

705
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,200
having right now.

706
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,920
I've used them up.

707
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm sorry, it's cached.

708
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,360
Oh, no.

709
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,160
I don't know where she went to college, but the fightin' Angela Lansbury's, I think

710
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,320
it's just really intimidating and at the same time just a beautiful symbol.

711
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
I have to imagine that she went to college somewhere European.

712
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,960
Yeah, something like University or something.

713
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,920
Something fancy.

714
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,720
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

715
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,240
But before we move on to that, I did want to tell you that you've been listening to

716
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,560
My Brother.

717
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,360
My Brother and Me, it's an advice show for the modern era.

718
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,040
If you want to ask us a question, you can do so on mbnbam.com.

719
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,880
All the different methods are there.

720
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,320
You can also buy our app, the My Brother.

721
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
My Brother and Me app experience.

722
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,920
Get it on iTunes and methods to ask us questions are there.

723
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,120
If you want to buy clothing for My Brother, My Brother and Me, there are some very few

724
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
t-shirts still in the store.

725
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,680
We are going to be restocking very soon.

726
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,160
The mediums on the logo shirt are sold out.

727
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,280
The larges on the logo shirt are sold out.

728
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
I mean, there are times or it's tight times over there.

729
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
So if you want something, go over there and get it.

730
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,600
The Hey Jeffrey shirt, we probably won't be doing another version of the logo shirt.

731
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,680
We will probably do it in a different color.

732
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,880
So if you got any requests, we've got a Facebook thread up that you can go weigh in on.

733
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
And you should join the My Brother, My Brother and Me appreciation group too.

734
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,280
Because it's a group of really nice people.

735
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,960
What else am I forgetting?

736
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,840
Thanks again to the Hoff.

737
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,440
Thank you so much Hoff.

738
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,800
Thanks Hoff.

739
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,400
Thanks to everybody who's been holding parties.

740
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,640
Yes, yes.

741
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,840
We didn't, I don't think I got an invite to the latest MondLock.

742
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,000
But I'm sure that the MondLock party is still rolling, as is the Nugent.

743
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,760
My favorite stories we've gotten are the people who have accidental listening parties.

744
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
Just because I like the image of the moment of like looking around and going, wait,

745
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,440
I have like 10 people here listening.

746
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
This is a party.

747
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
Oh my goodness.

748
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:04,800
The, yeah, we have an alpha and, no, we have a prime and a beta listening fan club.

749
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,120
So if you want to be Trace, if you want to be the triple,

750
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,200
get in touch with us and let us know who's going to be at the party.

751
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,200
We will record something for you, a personal greeting for your party.

752
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,880
The only thing you have to do is take some pictures.

753
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,280
We had a newcomer from, in the form of Michael Sinodis that had a listening party last week.

754
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
I don't know if this is going to be a perpetual thing though.

755
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,960
He's got to prove himself if he wants that, if he wants that Delta status.

756
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,160
Yeah.

757
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,280
Or no, he would be triple.

758
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,640
I mean, he got in there.

759
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:38,880
Yeah.

760
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:39,840
Yeah.

761
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,280
So thank you again, as always, like we can't thank you enough.

762
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,960
Thank you for rating the show on iTunes and reviewing the show on iTunes.

763
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,480
And telling your friends about it and everything.

764
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,240
It means a lot to us.

765
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,960
I want to thank, let's see, let's do some shout outs.

766
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,400
Modest Madison, always turning out the recommendations.

767
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,920
Thank you.

768
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,960
Thank you, Stackmasters.

769
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:10,960
Yeah.

770
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,960
And oh, thank you, J.D. Short, who reminded me last night that we had to do the show.

771
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,200
I was in a drunken fugue state after watching the Red Sluice Playoffs.

772
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
And I had forgotten completely to get the question list together.

773
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,320
And he reminded me to record the show.

774
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,440
So thank you.

775
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,800
Thank you, J.D. Short.

776
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,400
Also, our buddy Brentle Floss spied somebody at New York Comic Con walking around with

777
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,760
an NBNB AM shirt.

778
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,320
Oh, really?

779
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,200
Yes.

780
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,400
That's awesome.

781
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Yeah.

782
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,360
And there's a guy right behind him in a surgical mask.

783
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,440
It's a pretty great picture.

784
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,520
If that was you, holler.

785
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,680
Let us know.

786
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,280
We'll be your friend forever.

787
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,920
Okay.

788
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,040
Griffin, give us the final question.

789
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,960
That question we'll ponder and think on for the remainder of the week.

790
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,000
Okay.

791
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:09,280
This question was sent in by this week's Platinum Question Submitter, Submissioner, Submariner.

792
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,080
Chris DePew.

793
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,760
Wow, hat trick.

794
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,520
Hat trick from the CDP.

795
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,280
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Sarebear, who asks,

796
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,840
my goldfish are very quiet?

797
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,880
Justin McElroy.

798
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

799
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

800
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
He's been my brother and my brother.

801
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,520
May he kiss your dad square on the lips.

802
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,320
Pack up your bags, get out of town.

803
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,000
You had a good run, but it's all over now.

804
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,760
Toss all of it in, pack up by tonight.

805
00:41:51,760 --> 00:42:06,960
Toss all of your woes in that black Samsonite.
