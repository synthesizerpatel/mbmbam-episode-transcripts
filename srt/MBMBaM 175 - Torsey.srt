1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:53,360
Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday to us. Happy birthday, my brother, my brother, and me.

6
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,720
Happy birthday to us. It's the birthday episode. November 8th was the day we're recording on

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,240
November 10th, but I guess it's all of our birthdays on November 8th. Today we are all

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
birthdays. Gotta do this every year. Not just every year since you've been doing the podcast,

9
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,240
but like every year since I was fucking born, and I'm sorry. I don't know if you guys know how

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,520
fucking baby gestation works, but that shit was out of my control. Forgive me if I've mentioned

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,480
this before, but Gervin, have you looked into legally changing your birthday? You know, it's

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,480
funny you bring that up because Jay-Z I think just did that. Jay-Z just did a tweet last week

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,800
where he was like, yeah, my birthday's on Tuesday, but guess what? I'm having my party on Monday,

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,000
so now my birthday's on Monday. And I think if Jay-Z is allowed to do that, I don't understand

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,320
why I can't. Oh, my birthday cake's ready. Excuse me. Well, Travis is making a birthday cake for

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
himself, and he's just gonna leave the podcast. Nothing sad about that. That's just a normal,

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
regular thing folks do. That's just a normal thing that people do. Just folks. Gervin,

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,520
your birthday is April 17th. Right, that's what I'm saying. It's not like November 8th rolled

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,800
around. They're like, Gervin, time to come out. I was like, nah, I'm gonna lamp in here for like

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,880
six more months. I got a pretty good situation up in here. I just set up my broadband internet

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,160
access, so I'm gonna chill in the womb. I want to come out registered with social services.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,160
I want to come out with some knuckle hair. 87's gonna be a way, way, way better year than 86,

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,960
so I'm just gonna chill in here. If you want to go ahead and get the paperwork going,

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,320
and then I can just like slide out into that shit, that would be actually pretty dope for me.

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,400
No, it is not Gervin's birthday, but it is my birthday. I turned 33. It's Jesus' year, everybody.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,520
This is the year I do miracles. And it's my birthday. I turned 30, so this is the beginning

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,120
of my teaching. I have 30 to 33. Yeah, your teaching begins now. I gotta get up on that old

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,960
rug cross. Important question, Travis, and I think I've posted this to you before,

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,880
but is it dirty or flirty? You know, it's gonna have to be dirty 30, in which I forego all hygiene.

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,800
Okay. Trav, do you feel, I don't know if you've postulated on this at all, but that's not the

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,920
right word. Meditated on this. Ruminated. Postulized. Ruminated. Postulized. Meticulated.

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:27,760
Do you feel weirdly younger at 30 than you did at 29? I do, and here's why.

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:37,280
I have now gone from being the oldest 20-year-old in the group to being the youngest 30-year-old

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
in the group. You know what I mean? So it's like I've entered a new chamber,

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,800
and now I'm at the beginning of a different line. I guess externally that makes sense,

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,880
but internally all your sperm is dying. Well, that's because of my hot pants.

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm sorry, your what? My hot pants. I wear heated pants.

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,360
He's not giving those up for 30. Are they prescription?

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, I got cold bottom, and so I have to wear electric pants.

40
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
Isn't that sort of like you're not gonna build an immunity to heat if you just keep-

41
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,960
Griffin, I'm 30 at this point. My body's not gonna start producing its own butt heat at this point.

42
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
I guess you've got a good point. This is My Brother, My Brother, Me.

43
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,040
It's an advice show for the modern era. Let's get into the advice.

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Did we introduce ourselves by the way? I'm Justin McElroy. It's my birthday.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm Travis McElroy. It's my birthday. Griffin McElroy, it's not my birthday,

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
but you know what? I was born on Good Friday,

47
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,640
and I think that that is probably why I just decided to delay it.

48
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,240
Did you know that year, Good Friday, in 1987, they actually call it Great Friday?

49
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,360
Exactly. I was born. It's a little birthday joke I like to tell when it's not my birthday,

50
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
just to keep my spirits up. A couple of weeks ago,

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,640
I found a note inside my locker at school. It said, this is roughly translated from Norwegian,

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
been thinking about you a lot lately. Phone number. Call me. Heart shape.

53
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,440
Well, I thought someone put this in the wrong locker or something, so I ignored it.

54
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,920
How's your world view? That's your self-esteem, doc.

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
Pretty good, huh? Not good.

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,280
Today, on the 7th of November, I found another note in my locker,

57
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,680
which said almost exactly the same thing. My problem is that I'm quite paranoid over

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
stuff like this. I do not know how to respond. Please help, brothers.

59
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,080
That's from paranoid in Norway. I totally get it.

60
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,760
Absolutely right not to respond and be completely paranoid about the situation.

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
You're right. Most spies are Norwegian,

62
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
so if it's a spy thing you're worried about, then 100% right.

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,000
I think you have one of two things to be paranoid about, and one more so than the other.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,160
One is that you have a young child vampirist who is trying to court and befriend you and

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
ultimately use you for all of your days for her sinister purposes.

66
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,320
And two is that it's some bullies and they're trying to entrap you into looking stupid.

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,040
But I'm assuming this is in Norway, though,

68
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,880
and so I think the vampire ass is probably a bit more likely.

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,680
Dark for a super long time over there.

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, it's also possible that it's just like a really weird person.

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
Yeah, but that seems unfunny.

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
What if I think it might be a griff? It smells like a griff to me.

73
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
This has like-

74
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
You think like long con?

75
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,280
I'm thinking full griff. It feels like the beginning of a griff.

76
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,360
If they were like, I love it when you bring that briefcase full of money that you always

77
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,280
carry with you. I hope you'll do that tomorrow.

78
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,200
That's why it's a long con. You start really early and say, hey, seventh grader,

79
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,440
I really like it when you leave a nickel every day underneath this rock, right?

80
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,640
Because then you've got them for like 65 years.

81
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,720
That is a long con.

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,600
A lot of nickels.

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Maybe this is the next evolution of the I'm a Nigerian prince and I need $10,000 to secure

84
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
the six million and I'll totally send you like 5.5 of that.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Maybe they're decreasing their scope and scale a little bit.

86
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,440
They're scaling and scoping it down just a bit and then they're going after our youths.

87
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,360
And they're also lowering their expectation of the reward.

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,040
And it's like instead of like $10,000, you know, blah, blah, blah, they just say,

89
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,720
I really like the new Kings of Leon CD.

90
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
And then they get a Kings of Leon CD?

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
They get a bunch of Kings of Leon CDs.

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,080
I don't think most people want one of those.

93
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,640
I think most people want a lot. They're a very talented band.

94
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't enjoy their new stuff as much as youth and young manhood, but it's pretty okay.

95
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,840
I feel like if someone's not going to leave a name or any sort of identifying features

96
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,880
to this, I feel-

97
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,320
They're trying to fuck you.

98
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,160
They're trying to fuck you and not in like-

99
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
With a capital F?

100
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
The sex way.

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
Yeah, this is bad news.

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,760
I'd just throw it away, ignore it.

103
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,240
Is it?

104
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,320
Okay, wait, let me throw this out though.

105
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,200
Counterpoint.

106
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
Devil's advocate.

107
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
Vampiros' advocate.

108
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,080
Yeah.

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,480
It sounds like Question Asker is a very shy, like low self-esteem person.

110
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,240
So what if the person who's leaving this note is just another shy, low self-esteem person?

111
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,160
I mean, I guess-

112
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
It's so unactionable.

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,560
It doesn't seem worth putting your cycles in it, unless you're willing.

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,920
What if you're willing to do a sting?

115
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,720
What if you're willing to-

116
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Leave the police.

117
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Park your car outside your locker-

118
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
And then do a solo career.

119
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,600
In a discreet, no, not a Gordon Sumner.

120
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,800
A sting where you park your car outside your locker in a discreet place,

121
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,400
and keep the headlights off and stuff, and just have a bunch of-

122
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,000
I think they usually have a bunch of fast food wrappers in there and binoculars,

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
and you just wait until-

124
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,000
Martin Sheen falls from the roof of the building that you're parked outside next to,

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
and splatters all over the ground like in Departed.

126
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
That is actually how 90% of sting operations end.

127
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,040
It's also important that there's another pair of people that come and relieve you

128
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,960
after I think it's like 10 or 12 hours,

129
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,760
and you guys share some clips about how nothing happened,

130
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,520
and then moments after they start their shift, something goes down.

131
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Martin Sheen falls from the roof.

132
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
That's why he put Martin Sheen pushed-

133
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,400
It's such a bad gig that Martin Sheen ended up with falling out of windows, predominantly.

134
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,040
I mean, at least-

135
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,280
How was your shift?

136
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,240
Oh, it's just fucking raining Martins and Sheens out here.

137
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,280
But not Martin Sheen.

138
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,040
There's been lots of Martin Smiths and lots of Steven Sheens.

139
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
That's why Emilio Estevez changed his name,

140
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
because he didn't want into the family business of falling out of windows.

141
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm not going to do it.

142
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,720
I'm too busy.

143
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
So one day this whole racket's going to be yours.

144
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,640
You know, and Charlie Sheen's gotten really good at falling from high places.

145
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,440
What's up?

146
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
Oh, that was terrible, Travis.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,640
You know what?

148
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm actually going to switch my recommendation.

149
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Go ahead and give this number a call, because you miss it.

150
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take,

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,480
even if those shots will get you killed in an alley.

152
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
You guys want Yahoo?

153
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
This Yahoo was sent in by Ben Noteboom.

154
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,920
Thanks, Ben.

155
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Eric, who asks,

156
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
How do I go about destroying a cursed item?

157
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
My sister is an atheist, and she has a Wiccan friend.

158
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
Her friend gave my sister a stone that she apparently hexed,

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
so that my sister would have better focus.

160
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,200
That's not a hex.

161
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,840
That's a blessing.

162
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
Go on.

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Anyways, I want to destroy the stone because it was hexed using evil spirits,

164
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,480
but I do not want to release anything into my life or my family's lives.

165
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
How would I go about doing that?

166
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,320
This is just coming from such a place of ignorance.

167
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,280
Is it?

168
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,200
Because it's clearly not evil spirits, because it's a blessing.

169
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,760
You know, you see it every day where people are like,

170
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I've been given a totem to protect me.

171
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,920
And everyone's like, oh, black magic.

172
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm like, no, that's pretty white magic.

173
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,520
That's like as white as you get, you guys.

174
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,000
Right, but I mean, there's still a spirit occupying.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
There's a spirit that's just like, hey, Martha, listen,

176
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
you've been on Facebook long enough.

177
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
You need to do your homework.

178
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,400
This Latin's not going to worm its way into your brain without some effort.

179
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,680
You got to work for it.

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Well, so then you say, I'm afraid of destroying the item

181
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,280
and releasing the nerdy spirit out into the world.

182
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,960
What if you, I mean, destroying it seems fine.

183
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,200
I think if it was up to me, I would probably destroy it.

184
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
But like, make sure it was in a ring of salt.

185
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
That seems to be a popular.

186
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
Right, but then what is, you just have this fucking salt ring

187
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
that you can't, you can't like.

188
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,480
No, you do it at a friend's house.

189
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
All right, but then they have this salt prison.

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
And as soon as like, I don't know if the cat gets in it,

191
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,360
that buy cat, like that cat's done.

192
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,320
I think you should ignore the curse part of it.

193
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,840
And instead start asking the question, how do I destroy a stone?

194
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,600
Cause I don't know the answer to that.

195
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,400
I think if you, if you have any cursed items, stone or otherwise,

196
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,760
I think you can just drop it off at the little exchange box

197
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
that they have at Best Buy, you know, in the front

198
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
where like you're supposed to put your printer cartridges

199
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,400
and like cell phone batteries.

200
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,160
I think they actually do have a slot for cursed items.

201
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
But don't put it in there if they're out of the little baggies.

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh yeah, that's just common courtesy.

203
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,880
I think the Geek Squad will be able to take care of that for you.

204
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
And maybe they can install Windows on your,

205
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,720
on your Windows PC for like $800.

206
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,760
That does explain why the last time I was at Best Buy,

207
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,000
I saw someone on the Geek Squad biting the head off a chicken

208
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
and dumping its blood into a ring of stones.

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,240
Oh no, that's to fix a virus on a Mac.

210
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,480
And then charging $800 to put Windows on your PC.

211
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,400
To literally put a disk in a disk drive

212
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,960
and then press the go button on Windows.

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,360
There's a big button that says, go for Windows?

214
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,160
Yes or no?

215
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,520
And if you click no, it's like, are you sure?

216
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Cause like you bought the Windows already

217
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,560
and this is a Windows computer.

218
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
We can just do this for you cause it's like a CD.

219
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,640
$800 service.

220
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,840
Thanks Geek Squad.

221
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
Couldn't have done it without you.

222
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
Don't know what I'd do without you in my life.

223
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,920
Which one of you is a secret agent?

224
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,520
You have to tell me legally.

225
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
Which one of you has the intersect in your head?

226
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,920
You have to tell me.

227
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
You have to tell me by law or else it's entrapment.

228
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
Why can't your sisters pound on some ginkgo?

229
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,520
Yeah, that could work.

230
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,600
I don't think ginkgo biloba's got like evil spirits in it, natively.

231
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
I bet you, I mean the damage is done.

232
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
They have the cursed item now.

233
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,480
Am I crazy to say that like if his sister's an atheist,

234
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,960
doesn't that mean she doesn't believe in like curses

235
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,840
and blessings and hexes and spirits and shit?

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
Yeah.

237
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,520
I mean like by definition as an atheist.

238
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,120
You don't have to believe in ghosts to have sex with one.

239
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,760
You know what I mean?

240
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,680
I mean, that's true.

241
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
You don't have to believe in a ghost

242
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
in order to have it be having sex with you.

243
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
Yeah, I don't believe in guns, but I still don't want one in my house.

244
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,840
You don't agree with guns.

245
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,000
You believe that guns exist.

246
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
Okay, you're getting into the semantics here.

247
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,040
You may not believe in guns,

248
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,520
but you can still definitely be shot to death by one is what I'm saying.

249
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
That's what I'm saying.

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
I think we're all on the same page.

251
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
I don't know why we're arguing.

252
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, you're right Griffin.

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,640
This is silly.

254
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,720
Let's move on to another question.

255
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
I've recently been meeting a lot of new people

256
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,400
and you guys ever forget you have a coffee

257
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,640
and then it just like, oh, I feel tired.

258
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,760
And then you remember that you made a coffee before the show.

259
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,880
Yeah, what's even worse is when you've just gotten in your car

260
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,560
and driven like two blocks away from your house

261
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,400
and going, shit, I poured a cup of coffee.

262
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,680
I made that coffee.

263
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,600
I hate it when you forget that you're in the middle of reading a question

264
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,160
on a widely syndicated comedy podcast

265
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
and instead just talk about something else.

266
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,520
You ever notice?

267
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,320
By the way, I'm 33, Griffin.

268
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
This is the beginning.

269
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
From here, it's all downhill.

270
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,920
It's all like, you know what I like, vanilla tootsie rolls.

271
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,120
That's the phase of this show we're going into.

272
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I watched CBS Sunday Morning this morning,

273
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,240
which I really shouldn't do

274
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
because more often than not, it makes me angry.

275
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,080
They had an opinion section that was delivered

276
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,880
by contributing editor Paula Poundstone

277
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,200
and it made me want to eat a sword.

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,440
It made me want to stab a sword down through my stomach.

279
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Is Paula Poundstone the new Andy Rooney?

280
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,040
Is that the thing?

281
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,200
I think that she experienced the quickening upon his death

282
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,240
and got on there like, I think Obamacare is going to work

283
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,200
because once YouTube didn't work and I got it to work,

284
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,400
Poundstone out!

285
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
It was like, that was three minutes of my life, Paula Poundstone.

286
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm never getting that back.

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
I do love your bow tie though.

288
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,000
Man to that.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
Anyway, I've been recently meeting a lot of new people

290
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,200
and in an attempt to make conversation,

291
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,280
they've been asking me, what's your story?

292
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,480
I have a hard time talking about myself sometimes.

293
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,640
So how am I supposed to respond to that question?

294
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,040
Do they really want a summary of my life up until this point?

295
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,960
What do I say when someone asks me that?

296
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,880
That's from Flustered in Philly.

297
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
What's your story?

298
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,600
The Hobbit, what's yours?

299
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,640
That seems weirdly, doesn't that seem weirdly antagonistic?

300
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,120
It's like something like a hard-boiled cop asks someone

301
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,640
in a movie like, what's your story?

302
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
What'd you show I toots?

303
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,080
Start singing Canary.

304
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,440
Start singing Canary.

305
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
Come clean, Maroney.

306
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,360
Do you think that that question is giving rise

307
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,880
in this generation?

308
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,480
Because traditionally what you would ask is,

309
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,880
what do you do for a living?

310
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,400
And that question has become this thorny bramble bush

311
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,840
to navigate with today's youths.

312
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,440
Because most youths, and by youths, I mean people my age,

313
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,200
we don't know what the fuck we're doing.

314
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
You know what I mean?

315
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,040
None of us know.

316
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
I feel like what's your story falls somewhere

317
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,040
between the weird question of either what's your deal,

318
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
which I feel is super antagonistic,

319
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,040
and you are, which is really aloof and elitist.

320
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,000
So what's your story is kind of right between those two,

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,240
and it makes you seem both kind of a dick

322
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
and kind of a douche at the same time.

323
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,320
But more importantly, dick douche, you can, it's-

324
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,080
Hi, dick douche, what's your story?

325
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,760
More importantly, though, if someone asks you,

326
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,720
and by you I mean the youths of my generation,

327
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,040
generation, what are we now, like delta?

328
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,880
If they ask you, they ask a delta,

329
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
like what's your story?

330
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
And you can say, I've been thinking about getting

331
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
into artisanal beekeeping.

332
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
You can't use that answer when somebody asks you

333
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
what you do for a living, because you don't do it yet.

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,560
You know what I mean?

335
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,720
I actually, I hate the what do you do for a living question,

336
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,720
because here's what I do.

337
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,400
I write about video games on the internet,

338
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
and I do a comedy podcast.

339
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,840
I do two comedy podcasts.

340
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,040
There is a very high probability that I am going to have

341
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,600
to explain as part of my job description

342
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,920
some core concepts to the person I'm talking to,

343
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,520
specifically their ages above 50.

344
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,320
Or even more insulting, you have to find a way to intimate

345
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
that yes, you earn a living wage doing this thing.

346
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
It's not some joke job, you know what I mean?

347
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,040
Sydney's grandfather until, I mean,

348
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,080
probably until we launched Polygon in the beginning of 2012,

349
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
still asked me when I was gonna get a job.

350
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,680
I mean, I fully, fully was employed

351
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
at several different locales at that point,

352
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,240
and still was curious when I was gonna get

353
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,360
into the working world.

354
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
But don't you think that that is like becoming,

355
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
especially for people our age and younger,

356
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,680
becoming like more of the norm and less of the exception?

357
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,880
Where it's like, oh, what do you do?

358
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
Like, oh, I work for an independent brewery.

359
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,280
So many, first of all, that's an awesome, awesome job,

360
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,240
a venerable craft.

361
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,640
Everybody, our whole world of Generation Delta

362
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,320
would be fixed in a second if everyone would get

363
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,240
on that micro tip, where he's like,

364
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,560
everybody needs to go learn some fucking skills.

365
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,840
And I listened to him.

366
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,520
I hear him on the Bill O'Reilly talk show, radio program.

367
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
And he's like, everybody needs to go out there

368
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,320
and learn how to plumb.

369
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
Because if you knew how to plumb,

370
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,480
you'd be fucking set for life.

371
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,560
And if we did that-

372
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,080
The motherfucker went before Congress.

373
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,160
Went before Congress, like, and he's like,

374
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
you motherfuckers learned to plumb.

375
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,080
Learned to plumb, you dumb shits.

376
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Name any problem in politics, American politics right now,

377
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
that wouldn't be fixed if everybody knew a trade craft

378
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,160
that they could profit off of.

379
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
Like, everybody needs health insurance.

380
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
Like, if you knew how to plumb,

381
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
you'd be fucking making bank.

382
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
And you could just like pay

383
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
for whatever elective procedures you want or need.

384
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
And people ask you, what's your deal, plumber?

385
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,000
Booyah!

386
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,720
You know what I mean?

387
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,240
Like, it would be so easy.

388
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
I have an actual real world skill.

389
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,520
I can do a thing.

390
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,080
Oh, what's your deal?

391
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,800
I can do one thing.

392
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Hey, man.

393
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
That's the best thing about my stupid job

394
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,040
is that I get to say I'm a carpenter.

395
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm a carpenter.

396
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
And if I don't feel like saying theatrical carpenter-

397
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
Hey, I'm in a hurry.

398
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
Summarize yourself in a phrase if you can.

399
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,840
Oh, me?

400
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm electrician.

401
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,480
Get out of here.

402
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm done.

403
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm done already with you.

404
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm gonna bookmark you in my head, Chad, electrician.

405
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,880
Oh, that's Chad the electrician.

406
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,960
I need some work done and I have lots of money

407
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,560
and I need electric work done.

408
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,240
I'm gonna continue supporting him.

409
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,200
Now, here's the thing.

410
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,760
The other side of that, though,

411
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,560
is that when they go, okay, Travis, carpenter,

412
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
then later when they're like,

413
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
I have this table that needs fixed.

414
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
Oh, Travis is a carpenter.

415
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,240
The nice thing about telling someone

416
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,920
that you're a small batch barrel maker,

417
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,280
no one's ever gonna call you to come fix their barrels.

418
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
Yeah, I guess if you don't want money,

419
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
what are you talking about?

420
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,040
No, but I don't like freelance carpent.

421
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
I don't think carpent is the-

422
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,920
But I'm a carpenter.

423
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm really more of an edutainer.

424
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,440
That's what I'm gonna start telling people.

425
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,200
Me, I'm an edutainment.

426
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
I like to cross the bridge between education

427
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,560
and entertainment as an edutainer.

428
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,440
That's what I do.

429
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,120
I feel like Jindel is entire, everybody I know.

430
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,440
Hi, Jindel, what's your story?

431
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,720
Everyone, every dick douche Jindel

432
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,760
is somehow in the business of online publishing.

433
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
Everybody in our fucking world,

434
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,480
except for the guy who comes and fixes my pipes

435
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,240
when they break, is in the business of online publishing.

436
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
And at a party when someone says,

437
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
what aspect of online publishing are you involved in?

438
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,000
You can't be like,

439
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
oh, I lead a creative consulting marketing.

440
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
So do you think when they're asking what's your story,

441
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,200
they're literally asking what story did you online publish?

442
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,760
Yes.

443
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
Oh, I did 10 best pictures of cats in mason jars.

444
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,960
Oh, I remember that.

445
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,920
Great work.

446
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,320
Hey, this guy did the cats in mason jars post.

447
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,800
That was great.

448
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,680
Oh, I love that.

449
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,160
You remember him?

450
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,240
He's got the really small, really, really sick cat

451
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
that's like super famous.

452
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,800
Is he around?

453
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,840
No bones.

454
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,640
No bone cat.

455
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
Oh, I remember no bones.

456
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,120
He's great.

457
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,600
I feel like the less you can tell someone the better.

458
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
Like, I think you should try to keep it close.

459
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,280
What's your story?

460
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Classified.

461
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,160
No, I mean, give him something.

462
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,360
Say, I grew up in the hills.

463
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
Now I'm in the city just trying to make my way.

464
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,040
I dabble.

465
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,840
I dabble.

466
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
I grew up in the marshes and then I lived in the mountains

467
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,440
for a while and then the swamps and I'm just-

468
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,880
Spent a little time in the glen.

469
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm just naming Magic the Gathering energy card types now.

470
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,600
That's what I do for a living.

471
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,280
I collect magic cards for a living.

472
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,200
There probably is somebody making a living doing that

473
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
and they have to explain that shit at parties.

474
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,880
Dude, give it up.

475
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,160
Give it up and learn how to like clean gutters or something.

476
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,880
This is what I'm saying.

477
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,800
I think we need an encyclopedia of non-offensive job titles

478
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,720
that are all like euphemism for what you do.

479
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
It's like, what do you do?

480
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,320
I've got a huge assortment of magic cards that I sell for a living.

481
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,040
What do you do?

482
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,320
I'm a trades collector.

483
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
You know, something that like doesn't make any sense

484
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,720
but when you say it, everybody goes, oh, okay.

485
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
And it's like, what do you do?

486
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,920
Oh, I make tiny models of World of Warcraft battlegrounds.

487
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,960
What do you do?

488
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm a carpenter, right?

489
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,560
And then somebody, if they care to, can go look in the encyclopedia,

490
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,400
flip the card and go, well, they make models of World of Warcraft.

491
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
I don't think it says that in the encyclopedia though.

492
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
That was a crazy thing you just said.

493
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,240
That is maybe the most nonsensical thing you've ever said on this entire program.

494
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,560
It'll be a very Orwellian lifestyle

495
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,560
in which everybody is just assigned a bullshit term for the real ass job.

496
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:58,000
You're saying that we should boil our jobs down to the actual base mechanic.

497
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,240
Like I should tell people I'm a typist and talker.

498
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
At a party though and somebody says, what do you do?

499
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
And you say online publishing, their response is gonna be,

500
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,600
don't be an asshole.

501
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,680
Like we're all in online publishing.

502
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,720
Of course you are.

503
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Of course you're in online publishing.

504
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,480
Who isn't?

505
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,160
Asshole.

506
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,440
I think that we have developed this reverse aristocracy

507
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
where look around your office right now and then try,

508
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,960
like look at anything and try and imagine with your brain

509
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,240
how that thing got made.

510
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
You can't, you fucking idiot.

511
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,800
You can't.

512
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,200
Someone else made it and they're laughing at you.

513
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,680
They're laughing at you because they don't know how to do shit

514
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
and they can introduce themselves really easily at parties.

515
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,560
I make lamps.

516
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,440
I'm a lampman.

517
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,200
My entire understanding of the built world is drawn from 99% invisible.

518
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,040
So what that means is that when I see an everyday object,

519
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,200
I still have no idea how it was made,

520
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,560
but I assume the person that created it was a beautiful soul

521
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,960
that could teach me about something about life.

522
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
Because that seems to be the way of things.

523
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,840
We have ugly, stupid, live journal souls.

524
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,240
And can I just throw this out?

525
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,640
We do not appreciate those beautiful souls enough.

526
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,680
Financially, I mean.

527
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,760
Monetarily, not enough appreciation.

528
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,040
They're doing fine though.

529
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,480
That's what Mike Rose is saying.

530
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,560
People can't make a living because there's three paid online publishing jobs

531
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,680
and there's approximately 5.5 billion people scrambling for them right now.

532
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
But you know what's up?

533
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,040
My toilet's been clogged for like two years because nobody knows

534
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,640
how to fucking deal with it anymore.

535
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
Your toilet's been clogged for two years?

536
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
That's what I'm saying.

537
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,360
It's rough and tumble down here in Austin.

538
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,800
Austin is the home of online publishing.

539
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,680
Everybody in Austin.

540
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,040
We don't have a government because people don't know how to govern.

541
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
They know how to write blogs about government.

542
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,440
Got a lot of HuffPo free contributors down here.

543
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,800
We don't have anybody with any public speaking skills.

544
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,440
It's a fucking mess.

545
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,800
We don't have cops.

546
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,960
We don't have cops that can enforce the laws that nobody's writing.

547
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,800
You just have people that post like top 10, 15 worst crimes.

548
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,040
Right.

549
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,240
They'll go to Boston and a cop will beat the shit out of them

550
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,040
and they'll record it and they'll put it up like, isn't this terrible?

551
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah, it's terrible.

552
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
I wish we had any cops in Austin.

553
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,400
My house hasn't been burgled because nobody learned how to pick a fucking lock.

554
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Because nobody fucking knows how tumblers work.

555
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,920
They know how tumbler works.

556
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,360
Tumbler works but they don't know how tumblers work.

557
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,720
It's a fucking joke.

558
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
I'm quitting the podcast.

559
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm quitting online publishing and I'm going to learn.

560
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm going to go like fucking tan leather or something like that.

561
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm going to fucking figure it out.

562
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,280
Can I just say how much I would watch that?

563
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,240
Not like as a show but just day to day.

564
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,200
Are you fucking saying?

565
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,080
I would just sit and watch you try to learn to tan leather.

566
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,120
You are, you're a part of the fucking problem Travis

567
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,520
because if I start tanning leather and then like someone starts doing a blog about it,

568
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
you're going to read the blog and you're not going to buy my leather goods

569
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,080
and then I'm going to die.

570
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,320
Griffin, I can build a goddamn chair from scratch.

571
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,920
I'll race you.

572
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,680
I'll make a chair entirely out of leather and you make a chair entirely out of wood

573
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,040
and we'll see which one sells on Etsy first.

574
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
And then I'll write a blog about it.

575
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,440
And then I'll write a blog about it.

576
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
It'll be like Julia and Julia.

577
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,480
Was that movie called Julia Julia?

578
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
Julie and Julia I believe.

579
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,640
I think it was called Julie versus Julia.

580
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,040
Battle Royale.

581
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,160
Another question you think?

582
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,280
Yes, I need to stop getting so worked up during this podcast.

583
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,640
I got a lot.

584
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,920
I got a lot of loss prevention professionals emailing us.

585
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,880
Listen, I'm not saying I wasn't.

586
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,160
I should clear this up.

587
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,760
I wasn't saying that everyone should shoplift all the time.

588
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,040
I was only saying I don't understand why everyone doesn't shoplift all the time.

589
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,840
That's a skill.

590
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
It is a victimless, crimeless crime.

591
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,560
Specifically, if you don't get caught.

592
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,200
If you don't get caught or even if you do, they can't do anything.

593
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,120
Someone was saying that there's a, what is it?

594
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,760
Shopkeepers privilege, which says that you are allowed to detain somebody

595
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
who you think has shoplifted.

596
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,040
And I say, good luck, sirs.

597
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,960
Somebody sent us an email though that was great

598
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,200
because it also reflected something that happened to me

599
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,520
when I worked at Best Buy and this dude worked at Best Buy.

600
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,280
And he said that they caught this kid shoplifting

601
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,080
and told him to wait for the cops and he did.

602
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,120
And he sat there for 30 minutes till the cops came

603
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,040
and they were like, yeah, the CDs are in his bag.

604
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,800
Cops break open his bag and inside his bag is a bag of cocaine,

605
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,880
a bag of marijuana, a loaded gun.

606
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Oh my God.

607
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,360
And the CDs.

608
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,920
And the kid just fucking sat there and waited for a half an hour.

609
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,360
The kid's like, listen, if you're gonna arrest me for the shoplifting,

610
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,720
you can't arrest me for the drugs.

611
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,760
That's Double Jeopardy.

612
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,560
I know my rights.

613
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
I watched 15 minutes of Double Jeopardy on Starz.

614
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,920
I think I know the law.

615
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,680
I know my rights.

616
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,720
That was from James.

617
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,360
Thank you, James.

618
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,720
Thanks, James.

619
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
That happened to me once where a kid came in

620
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,080
and used a stolen credit card

621
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,440
and then he tried to return those items for money.

622
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,240
And that's when we got him

623
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,160
because the cops came after he used the credit card.

624
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,520
And so-

625
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,320
Wait, that's a crime?

626
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,480
Yeah, so he came in, bought the things,

627
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,360
the cops came in and were like,

628
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,960
hey, did somebody use a credit card to buy such and such and such?

629
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,400
I was like, oh yeah, he did

630
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
because he showed them to me on his way out.

631
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,640
And then the kid walked back in like five minutes later,

632
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
was like, you know, I don't need these.

633
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,440
Can I return them for cash?

634
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
And the cops and I are just like standing there and looking at him.

635
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
So the cops just grab him.

636
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,320
And then they're like, can we check your car?

637
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,680
And the kid's like, oh yeah, sure.

638
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,920
And his car's just full of stolen stuff.

639
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,000
I don't want to have to steal things.

640
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:49,360
And as such, I need some money for that.

641
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,560
Our friend Warby Parker is revolutionizing the world of iCare.

642
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,920
It's true.

643
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,200
Don't laugh.

644
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,040
I'm starting to think that Warby Parker is like Hulu Plus

645
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
in that like everybody already has it.

646
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,280
So it's like, it's like,

647
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,000
because I see everybody on Facebook like just got my Warby Parker's in.

648
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And I know those people don't listen to our show.

649
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
I'm saying they're already worldwide.

650
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,160
And I don't know.

651
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,440
I think we're kind of a drop in the bucket here, but let's do our best.

652
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Glasses shouldn't cost as much as an iPhone, guys.

653
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,400
I've been saying this forever.

654
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,520
Warby Parker from Warby Parker, our friend,

655
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
he'll sell you prescription glasses starting at $95.

656
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,800
That's including the lenses, including the lenses.

657
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,920
They got an anti-reflective coating and an anti-glare coating.

658
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,880
No cost to you.

659
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,920
Don't even worry about it.

660
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,160
That way if people glare at you, you can't see it.

661
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,960
You can't see it.

662
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,000
You can't glare back.

663
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Buying glasses online is easy and risk-free.

664
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,240
Warby Parker, they got, okay.

665
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,960
So here's the best part.

666
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
They got a try on program.

667
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
What they do is they, you pick five pairs.

668
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,960
They ship them to you.

669
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
You try them all on at the same time.

670
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
And not the same.

671
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,960
You always say that and it makes it sound like you're like

672
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,680
inventing some sort of Dr. Seuss, like mega spectacles with 10 lenses.

673
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
You pull them all at the same time.

674
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,400
Then you can see through walls.

675
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,200
What's up?

676
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,400
Money well spent.

677
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,480
And then you send back the one that you don't want.

678
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,000
Keep the one that works for you.

679
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,680
And you get to keep them for five days.

680
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,400
You can show everybody.

681
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,520
Have a big party.

682
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,640
Have the worst party ever.

683
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,400
Make people look at your glasses.

684
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,200
Shortest party ever.

685
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
This one, this one, this one, this one, or this one.

686
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,440
This one?

687
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,680
Cool.

688
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,160
Bye guys.

689
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,840
Thanks for coming.

690
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,720
For every pair of glasses they sell, they distribute some to some people in need.

691
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,720
So that's $95 prescription polarized sunglasses from $150.

692
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
And so here's the deal.

693
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,800
You visit warbyparker.com slash my brother.

694
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,360
Choose your five home try on frames.

695
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,920
When you're ready, you enter the promo code my brother at your final checkout.

696
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,600
You order your prescription glasses, sunglasses, or reading glasses at warbyparker.com slash

697
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,120
my brother.

698
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,720
And when you use the promo code, it usually takes about 10 business days to get to you.

699
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,000
With the promo code, you're going to get them in three business days.

700
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,720
No big deal.

701
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
It's just great.

702
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,440
Oh, I'm hungry.

703
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,200
Oh, I'm so hungry.

704
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
I've never been this hungry before.

705
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
Man, that really took a turn.

706
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,240
Justin, do you want some salty?

707
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,480
Do you want some salty, crusty, sugar, sugar flogs?

708
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,520
Shove that junk in your urethra.

709
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,040
I'm not interested in it.

710
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Ho ho's, no no's.

711
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,120
Twinkies, forget about it.

712
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,400
You want a big bowl of junkums?

713
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,080
Junkums?

714
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,880
Keepums.

715
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,680
That's what I say.

716
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
No, these are baked junkums.

717
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,360
No, that's junk.

718
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,400
What I need is-

719
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,280
With holestra.

720
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,960
A nature box.

721
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,800
I'm excited that Nature Box is a sponsor because I was actually into the Nature Box game

722
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,640
before they sponsored us and I was so excited to have them.

723
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,000
Here's what you do.

724
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,880
Let me give you the pitch.

725
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,360
You go to naturebox.com and you fill a box up with healthy snacks.

726
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,320
This is like really good stuff.

727
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,160
They got french toast, granola, salted caramel pretzel pops.

728
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,720
Those shits are out of control.

729
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,320
I just had like this mango puffed rice kind of bites.

730
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,840
Oh my god, they're insane.

731
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,400
Delicious.

732
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,240
And you can get them all in one box.

733
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,760
You get a new shipment every month.

734
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,120
If you want to choose your stuff, cool.

735
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,880
If not, they'll choose it for you.

736
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,560
And the shipping is free.

737
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
Fantastic.

738
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,000
And what's better is for being a listener of ours, okay?

739
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,360
You're going to be able to get your first box half off.

740
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,800
Oh, half off?

741
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
Are you kidding me?

742
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,800
Does that mean they only include half the food that you ordered?

743
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,160
No, it just means the box is cut in half and stuff falls out one end.

744
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,600
Yeah, that sounds shitty.

745
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Why would we give this shitty promo to people?

746
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,640
This is a money thing.

747
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,320
Yeah, so you go to naturebox.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

748
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,600
That's promo code MYBROTHER and naturebox.com.

749
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
You're gonna get that first box half off.

750
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,520
It's really delicious stuff.

751
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,720
And they have a huge selection.

752
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,160
It's like, you know, they got salty stuff.

753
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,360
They got sweet stuff.

754
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,040
There's stuff that like individually wrapped bars.

755
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,240
And all of it comes in like resealable packages.

756
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
So like you can take it with you and like-

757
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,600
Are you into umami flavors?

758
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,280
They have that.

759
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,640
I got a message for Steven Yee.

760
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,840
Watch your fucking back.

761
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,120
Love, Naturebox.

762
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,800
No, Travis.

763
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,280
What's my message?

764
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,360
You're gonna open one of those nature boxes and it's gonna be full of anthrax bombs and vampire bats.

765
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,440
This message is for Steven Yee.

766
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,920
It's from the Archery Guild of Calamitous Intent.

767
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,880
Uh, what better gift can we get the man who has everything

768
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,280
than a personal message from your three favorite brothers?

769
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,160
A crossbow?

770
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,640
Perhaps.

771
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,520
A falcon?

772
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,160
Possibly.

773
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,840
But we figured this would be a fitting gift

774
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,360
after your impromptu live reading of the sexy Garfield fan fiction

775
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,600
at Mel and Rob's birthday dinner last year.

776
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,880
Happy birthday, Steve.

777
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,240
May your day be full of bacon.

778
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,000
Sounds to me like Steve ruined Rob and Mel's birthday

779
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
and this is the punishment instead of a crossbow.

780
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,880
I do not remember signing off on letting someone else read our shit out loud.

781
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,320
Hmm. I do not remember licensing out that materials.

782
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,040
You read it at Mel Brooks and Rob Dierdrich's birthday.

783
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,680
Their combined party.

784
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,120
Steve-o, uh, happy birthday and watch your fucking back.

785
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,520
Griffin, we got another message?

786
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
Yeah, uh, this one is for Bryn Boatman.

787
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
It's from Evan Smale, who says,

788
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,320
To my best friend.

789
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,120
You done it.

790
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,360
Happy 20th haunted birthday.

791
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,680
Try not to get too spooked on your big day.

792
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,400
Now something tells me this one was supposed to be Halloween themed

793
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,600
and that we have slipped up, um, just a little bit.

794
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Let me try to alter it a little bit.

795
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,160
To my best friend.

796
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,200
You done done it.

797
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,160
Happy 20th, um, pilgrim birthday.

798
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,880
Try not to get too turquied on your big day.

799
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,120
Maze, cornucopia.

800
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,360
Happy 20th birthday birthday.

801
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,280
Try not to get too born on your big day

802
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,880
because then it's celebrating our birthdays.

803
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,520
I like that.

804
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
I'm Jesse Thorne.

805
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,920
Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture

806
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,120
that will do nothing less than change your life.

807
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,800
You know, I'd never heard anything like it before.

808
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,560
It'd be like seeing a new color,

809
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,360
which I guess is music's like biggest asset

810
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
is that you can hear new sounds.

811
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,000
I'll probably never see a new color.

812
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,280
I'll probably never experience like a new crazy taste,

813
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,280
but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

814
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,480
Culture picks, comedy, and in-depth interviews.

815
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,840
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture.

816
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,120
Just the good stuff in popular culture every week on Bullseye.

Subscribe to iTunes or find it online at MaximumFun.org.

818
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
Farm wisdom.

819
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Waw, waw, waw, waw.

820
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,120
Fah, ah, arm wisdom.

821
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,520
Get a dubstep in your two-step farm wisdom.

822
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,640
Oh shit.

823
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,720
Get right out of town.

824
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,280
I'd say that's one of the better ones you've done recently,

825
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,400
but recently your game's been super shitty

826
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,840
on the farm wisdom introduction.

827
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,160
Give me some farm wisdom.

828
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,280
Can I read this one?

829
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,240
Yes, please.

830
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,720
Male pigs that are going to be raised to be hogs,

831
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,040
a pig over 120 pounds, didn't know that,

832
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,760
so already learning shit from farm wisdom.

833
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
Male pigs that are going to be raised to be hogs,

834
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,800
a pig over 120 pounds, and eaten for meat

835
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
must be castrated.

836
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,000
If they aren't, the testosterone makes the meat taste disgusting.

837
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,840
It's called boar taint.

838
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,520
If you've ever eaten a wild hog

839
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
that tastes really gamey and shitty,

840
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
it's been tainted.

841
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
That's the craziest farm wisdom.

842
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,400
I, like, that changes my whole perspective on pigs.

843
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,920
It makes me feel bad for eating them,

844
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
I guess, kind of a bit.

845
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,560
Not very much because, like,

846
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,840
they're still goddamn delicious,

847
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,240
but, like, to think that they have to live

848
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,640
in terrible conditions and get they dicks cut off.

849
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,920
It's not a good life they lead.

850
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,520
Not a good life, not an especially-

851
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,440
It's not their dicks, it's just their balls.

852
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
They don't cut off their dick and balls.

853
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,840
I guess that's a good point.

854
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,720
I didn't think about that.

855
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
Maybe we should cut that one out

856
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,440
because it really is bringing me down.

857
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,840
You guys want a yahoo?

858
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,520
Absolutely.

859
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,080
Oh, God.

860
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,400
This one's going to be really tough to get through

861
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
because it's sort of like,

862
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
could God make an object that he couldn't move?

863
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,080
Sort of thing.

864
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,440
Like, one of those quandaries

865
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
that wraps in around it on itself

866
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,040
like an MC Escher painting.

Sent in by Spencer Lee Curtis.

868
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,400
Thanks, Spencer.

869
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,640
It's by yahoo answers user Melissa who asks,

870
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,600
My horse hates other horses.

871
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,040
My horse is gentle and sweet,

872
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,280
but his personality changes toward other horses.

873
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
I feel absolutely awful when my horse

874
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,320
tries to bite and scowl at horses walking by.

875
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,640
He's kicked two horses at the barn I board at

876
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,240
and people are starting to refer to him

877
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,520
as the crazy one.

878
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,720
I don't feel like there's much I can do to make him stop

879
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,040
other than negative reinforcement when it happens.

880
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,480
He's generally polite,

881
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,840
but turns into an ugly monster when faced with other horse.

882
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,720
Any ideas?

883
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,080
Thank you for reading.

884
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,480
You're welcome.

885
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,800
Is it possible that your horse is actually a bear?

886
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:55,840
And you're an idiot.

887
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,800
Oh, good question.

888
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,280
Is it possible this horse is a bear and you're an idiot?

889
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,000
Better question.

890
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,960
Is it possible that your horse thinks it's a bear?

891
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,560
Does not realize it's a horse.

892
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,480
Here's the only thing though.

893
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,760
I do not think kicking is a bear's game.

894
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,400
You know what I mean?

895
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,360
Oh, no.

896
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,200
It's important to note the horse thinks it's a bear,

897
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,360
but it's never been around other bears

898
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,440
or it knows nothing about bears.

899
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,680
Then why would it does what it thinks bears would do

900
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,640
in a given situation?

901
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,800
It heard the word bear once and it's like,

902
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,480
that sounds like something I could get into.

903
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
Well, because the owner kept riding at bear back

904
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
and it was like, oh, I get it.

905
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,840
So I've got a bear back.

906
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,720
This is a horse that has chosen to live its life whenever

907
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
possible as a bear.

908
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,560
It's a fuzzy and I think we should respect it.

909
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:41,920
Hold on.

910
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,840
You're saying you just dropped a lot of concepts on me.

911
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
Baby, that horse is born that way.

912
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,280
I need you to walk backwards.

913
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,520
That horse is born that way and I respect it.

914
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,320
You're saying that, okay,

915
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,920
you're saying that within the animal kingdom.

916
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,960
Okay.

917
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,040
You're saying that within the animal kingdom.

918
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,160
Take as slow as you need to.

919
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,360
I'll walk you through it.

920
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,840
This is, let's start just with the basic facts.

921
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,000
I guess this is a horse we're talking about.

922
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,720
Yeah, right.

923
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,120
The horse sees other genuses of animals in the animal kingdom

924
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,880
and it goes up to one of those genuses and makes a wish

925
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,160
and says, make me a bear.

926
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,760
I wish I was a bear because it's just seems like a pretty

927
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,400
cool lifestyle.

928
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,920
Like we've covered being,

929
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,160
being into the furry community is not all about sex.

930
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,280
Right.

931
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
So you're saying this horse,

932
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm saying this horse wants to be a bear.

933
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,360
So it acts like it thinks a bear would.

934
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,600
It's important to know it's never come in contact with a bear.

935
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,040
So this is all conjecture on this horse.

936
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,640
Does it wear a surprisingly expensive bear suit?

937
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,000
Like a, like a Tanooki suit.

938
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,920
Yeah, it doesn't have money.

939
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Griffin, don't be stupid.

940
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,600
Don't be an idiot.

941
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Horses can't get checks.

942
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,480
What are you silly?

943
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,800
They can't.

944
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,840
That's an important part.

945
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,480
I can't.

946
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,920
Can I say that I'm a furry and then like show up to a furry con

947
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,120
wearing like a t-shirt and jeans?

948
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,320
Yes.

949
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,320
Furries are not about your bank account.

950
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,880
That's like, if you were, if you were a king,

951
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,360
you're still a king even if you're not wearing your crown

952
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,000
and your cape.

953
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
It's not about the accessories.

954
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,960
It's about what you have inside.

955
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,760
Thank you, Travis.

956
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,080
Yes.

957
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,360
Exactly what Travis said.

958
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,680
Okay.

959
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,720
So can, if this horse wanted to be a dolphin,

960
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,720
would he be a,

961
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,160
That would be a squeaky.

962
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,480
Okay.

963
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,120
Is there one for every different animal?

964
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,640
Or are we just talking about the texture?

965
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,800
There's only one way to find out.

966
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,840
Just keep asking.

967
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,680
If, if it wanted to be a scorpion.

968
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,120
That's a stingy.

969
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,520
Stingy.

970
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,920
If it wanted to,

971
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,520
no, this is bullshit because I,

972
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,360
if I wanted to be a horse,

973
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,800
then I would still,

974
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,040
I think I would still be classified as a furry.

975
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,320
No, you would be everyone.

976
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,480
Beautiful sons of bitches.

977
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,960
I think maybe that's it.

978
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,160
Maybe the horse just realized

979
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,360
that it will never be classified as the majestic one

980
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,560
or the pretty one

981
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,520
or the graceful one.

982
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,720
You're saying he's found,

983
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,760
he's found his niche.

984
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,560
Yeah.

985
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:02,960
He was like,

986
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
he's looking around and going,

987
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,360
look at all of us.

988
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,880
We are all the majestic ones.

989
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,840
We are all the pretty ones.

990
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm going to be the fucking crazy one.

991
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,200
But that's the thing.

992
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,400
If I've learned anything

993
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,600
from any horse-based entertainment medium,

994
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,360
it is that you,

995
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,600
that is the horse that you want to tame.

996
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,840
And then it turns out to be the fucking dopest,

997
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,360
the best, fastest, best, best racinist.

998
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,280
Well, I think the difference is,

999
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,920
is usually you look for like the stubborn one,

1000
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,880
the difficult way.

1001
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,200
You don't look for like the balls crazy one.

1002
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,640
You don't want,

1003
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,440
you don't look for the one

1004
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,960
that's going to try to eat your toes

1005
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,840
when you're not looking.

1006
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,640
That's not what Black Beauty was about.

1007
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,520
Now Black Beauty,

1008
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,040
I know that you just ate my baby,

1009
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,000
but God damn it,

1010
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,640
I'm going to ride you.

1011
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm going to break that animal spirit.

1012
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,680
Horses can,

1013
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,040
this is an unpopular opinion,

1014
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,040
but horses can look kind of crazy.

1015
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,680
When they like,

1016
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,200
when they like open their lips up

1017
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,560
and show you those huge chompers

1018
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,840
and their eyes open wide,

1019
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,760
that is a scary, scary sight.

1020
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,520
And I saw in the Pecos Bill cartoon,

1021
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,160
they do this thing,

1022
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,600
like when they jump up in the air.

1023
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,800
You just said four words

1024
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,760
that didn't sound like words.

1025
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,640
What were they?

1026
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,080
The Pecos Bill cartoon.

1027
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,580
Okay.

1028
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,560
The horse jumps and they are like

1029
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,360
all four of its feet

1030
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,480
leave the ground at the same time.

1031
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,080
And it kind of like curves its back.

1032
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,200
And it looks like a fucking crazy ass like horse show.

1033
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,160
That's a cartoon, Travis.

1034
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,240
No, but like they do it in real life too.

1035
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
What if, what if the horse,

1036
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
that weird horse face curve was describing,

1037
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,600
what if that's their natural state?

1038
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
Like, and they just gussy it up

1039
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,120
for when humans are around.

1040
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,160
Well, that's the time they're working

1041
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,280
really hard to keep it together.

1042
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,120
I can't let my lips do that weird thing.

1043
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,720
It makes me look like

1044
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,120
the horse embodiment

1045
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,280
of a Robin Williams impersonation.

1046
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,760
That is what they look like though.

1047
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,760
This is the, this,

1048
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,800
we're joking about this

1049
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,920
because we don't want to answer

1050
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,840
the fucking like hard, hard question.

1051
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,560
We love horses so goddamn much.

1052
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,000
I think about them all day,

1053
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,440
especially in the shower.

1054
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,720
I got to ride one on my honeymoon

1055
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,840
and it was fucking glorious.

1056
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,800
That's what I'm saying, Travis.

1057
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
Was it familiar with you from your work?

1058
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,600
It was, it was like,

1059
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,800
oh, you're the horse advocate,

1060
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,520
Travis McElroy.

1061
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,440
We've read so much about in our horse case.

1062
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,120
I'll make sure not to destroy your balls

1063
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,720
and dick with my crazy spine.

1064
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,080
I've only ridden a horse once

1065
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,440
and it destroyed both my balls

1066
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
and my dick with its crazy, crazy spine.

1067
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,600
It was like, it was like riding

1068
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,280
that one Spinosaur.

1069
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,240
I think that was a dinosaur

1070
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,600
with the like crazy spine fin.

1071
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,240
Terrible, terrible for my situation.

1072
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,480
What were we talking about?

1073
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,360
If I've told you once,

1074
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,240
I told you a thousand times

1075
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,600
that was a motorcycle

1076
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,520
and you could say it was a dinosaur

1077
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,480
as many times as you want.

1078
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,080
This horse is actively hurting

1079
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,320
other beautiful, perfect horses.

1080
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,600
What do we, what do we do about that?

1081
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,360
Can you just sequester it?

1082
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:43,840
What do you mean?

1083
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean, just like make it

1084
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,760
never see other horses again.

1085
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,600
A life without looking at horses,

1086
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,040
you might as well send it to hell.

1087
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,120
Oh, let me throw this out.

1088
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,320
Equus, blind it.

1089
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
That's a terrible, you understand?

1090
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,640
Well, no, then it can totally

1091
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,480
be around other horses, but don't worry.

1092
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,440
Oh, it would smell.

1093
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,120
Oh, I smell a fucking, I love-

1094
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,000
Cut its nose off.

1095
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,280
I blind it, cut its nose off,

1096
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,160
pull its teeth out.

1097
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,800
Oh God.

1098
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,080
What are you talking about?

1099
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,320
What?

1100
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,960
But then it's still gonna ride it majestically.

1101
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
You think any horse is gonna look anything

1102
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
but disheveled and resentful

1103
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
after that, this procedure

1104
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,360
that you're doing majestically.

1105
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,080
Sweet mask.

1106
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,440
It's gonna hear the horses.

1107
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,040
Gotta cut those ears right off there.

1108
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,840
Cut the ears off.

1109
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,520
It's still gonna wanna kick things,

1110
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,720
so those hooves gotta go.

1111
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,880
Come on, Torcy.

1112
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,080
Torcy, the torso horse,

1113
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,600
touch him and your wishes come true.

1114
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,080
I don't wanna touch,

1115
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,280
daddy, I don't wanna touch him.

1116
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,640
Don't make me touch him.

1117
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,520
Come on.

1118
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,320
Touch the goddamn horse.

1119
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,600
Packers got a hard game coming up.

1120
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,240
I need to win.

1121
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,560
Man, touch him, touch Torcy.

1122
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,720
Your mom's not gonna come back

1123
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,480
unless you touch Torcy for daddy, come on.

1124
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,760
Go ahead, child.

1125
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,480
How are you speaking to me?

1126
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,520
Your mouth is gone.

1127
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,400
I'm speaking to you through the Equestriaverse.

1128
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,480
Touch me, child.

1129
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,560
It's the only way your mother's coming back to daddy.

1130
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,160
No, I think Travis should be forced

1131
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,680
to leave its ears on

1132
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,600
because I want it to hear the things

1133
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,800
that people say about it.

1134
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,200
And that's to the pain.

1135
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,400
When the children walk by and whisper,

1136
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,000
dear God, what is that thing?

1137
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,480
What is that?

1138
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,960
I want their heads to be forever

1139
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,920
in its perfect ears.

1140
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,000
Poor Torcy.

1141
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,320
It could probably still survive, right?

1142
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,240
If you wanna see this fan art of Torcy,

1143
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,520
just draw a bean, draw a hairy bean.

1144
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,600
It still has most of its head.

1145
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,280
It's still gonna need a brain up in there.

1146
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,440
Draw a bean with a brain dangling off of it.

1147
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,160
Don't get me wrong.

1148
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,000
Horse's hearts are the biggest,

1149
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,080
most perfect, and wonderful hearts

1150
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,240
capable of more love

1151
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,320
than every human in the world combined,

1152
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,400
but it still needs some think meat in there

1153
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,600
to process.

1154
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,080
Can we store the brain inside Torcy's torso

1155
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,600
behind glass like Krang?

1156
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,080
Um, yes.

1157
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,760
Man, wouldn't that be great

1158
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,000
if they made Seabiscuit too with Torcy

1159
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,040
and he still somehow,

1160
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,880
I guess he just like rolled really fast

1161
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,880
and he won the big race.

1162
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,800
Just gotta give him something to chase,

1163
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,520
but he can't smell see or hear.

1164
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,960
Move, live, think.

1165
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,800
Bang a gong in front of him

1166
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,200
and hope that the vibrations steer him the right way.

1167
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
He would make a great bobsled though.

1168
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,640
That's for goddamn sure.

1169
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,400
My office had a Halloween party

1170
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,560
which resulted in a large bucket of candy

1171
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,040
being left over and set out in a common area.

1172
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,640
The next morning, all of the candy

1173
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,480
except for the Milky Ways were gone.

1174
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,240
A coworker claims to be the sole witness

1175
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,480
but doesn't want it to get out

1176
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,320
because that would create workplace tension

1177
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,920
between adults over candy.

1178
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,920
Should I press my coworker to snitch?

1179
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,440
This was probably $20 to $30 in good candy

1180
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,520
and this is not the first time it happened.

1181
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,880
That's from Snitch Witch.

1182
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
Oh man, how many times has that happened?

1183
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,120
The perfect crime.

1184
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,520
I know.

1185
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,560
Let me just throw this out.

1186
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,400
Who takes all the candy except Milky Ways?

1187
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
I know, Milky Ways basically the best candy bar,

1188
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,480
so whoever, I mean, I guess leaving that behind

1189
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,840
is such a huge clue

1190
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,680
because it's like who in the office

1191
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,640
doesn't like Milky Ways?

1192
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,880
Robert, Robert, god damn it.

1193
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,200
I knew it was you, Robbie.

1194
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,120
You fucked us for the last time, Robbie.

1195
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,720
Is that $20 to $30 pre-Halloween or post-Halloween?

1196
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,880
Because that goes way down.

1197
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,440
That's like down to like $10, $15 at Walgreens.

1198
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,360
Are you providing us with the price of the candy

1199
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,280
because you're thinking that they're gonna fence it?

1200
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,080
Because if that's the case,

1201
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,760
why wouldn't they just take the Milky Ways?

1202
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,920
No, there needs to be some reparations made.

1203
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,520
They need to provide everybody in the office.

1204
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,720
They employ 60 people,

1205
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,440
so they need to pay, I don't know, 30 to 50 cents per person.

1206
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,280
How much do you have to fucking love Butterfingers

1207
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,600
and Snickers and Twix that it is worth $20 to you?

1208
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,560
The possibility that one of your co-workers

1209
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,120
will have a visual of you like with a duffel bag

1210
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,360
just raking candy into it except for,

1211
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,040
oops, no, a Milky Way got in there.

1212
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,400
I gotta filter that back out.

1213
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,680
I would actually pay $20 to see an adult person doing that.

1214
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,720
I think it would be worth it.

1215
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,360
I think what you're missing out on is

1216
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,680
that it's the principle of the thing

1217
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,360
and not the monetary value.

1218
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,840
Because if it were me, if it were my workplace,

1219
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,160
A, I would be the one who had stolen the candy.

1220
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,120
But B, the problem is is at that point,

1221
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,200
it's like that was all of our candy

1222
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,160
and Steve yummied it down.

1223
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,880
Yeah, but you're 30 now, Travis,

1224
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,640
and I have a hard truth for you to accept in this

1225
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
that you can't eat candy anymore.

1226
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,920
Justin will tell you all about it.

1227
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,720
Once you hit 30, you can't eat candy anymore.

1228
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,000
Because it gums up the works?

1229
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,640
It gums up the works so, so bad.

1230
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,480
Well, I know you can't do Starbursts,

1231
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,040
but I figure a York Peppermint Patty isn't gonna mess it up.

1232
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,240
I'm 33 now, and I am to a point where,

1233
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,240
and this has just started to happen,

1234
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,120
but I start to feel weird about eating candy.

1235
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,440
Yeah.

1236
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,240
It seems like, I don't know, I've got some candy here

1237
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,440
and it seems like it's for kids now, I guess.

1238
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,840
Good news is, Travis, you mentioned Starbursts,

1239
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,680
you can't eat Starbursts anymore,

1240
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,200
but can I suggest this substitute of Metamucil Fiber Chews?

1241
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,360
Just as good, and they keep your pipes full.

1242
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,720
What are you into, Skittles?

1243
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,480
Skittles aren't gonna do you anymore,

1244
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,560
but how about these Centrum Daily Vitamins?

1245
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,920
They're like Skittles that you have to eat

1246
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,720
or else you'll die because you're 30 years old now,

1247
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
and your body just won't fix itself anymore

1248
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,240
the way it used to.

1249
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,160
You gotta keep filling it with nutrients and supplements.

1250
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,080
I'm sad now.

1251
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,640
Well, that's-

1252
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,840
I wish I hadn't gotten old.

1253
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,040
I know.

1254
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,480
There's nothing you can do about it.

1255
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,440
Well, not now.

1256
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,800
You have no idea what it's like being the youngest brother.

1257
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,240
It's like I have two portraits of myself

1258
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,280
that a wizard painted and they're both,

1259
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,000
I can watch them both getting older in front of me

1260
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,440
and it's like, oh, I'm gonna be that,

1261
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,960
and then I'm gonna be that!

1262
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,280
It's really fucking terrifying.

1263
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,560
Why does one of your portraits have a beard?

1264
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,680
Because I have high hopes one of these days

1265
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,440
it's gonna happen for me.

1266
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,120
I'm gonna start producing.

1267
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,120
Griff, do you have a Yahoo for us?

1268
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,840
Sure.

1269
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,080
This Yahoo was sent in by Steven Emrick.

1270
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,720
Thanks, Steven.

1271
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Diddy who asks,

1272
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,400
best Subway meat sandwich?

1273
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
I've been wanting to try something new.

1274
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,520
I love cold cuts and cheeses.

1275
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
Not a fan of turkey or chicken subs.

1276
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,560
What combination of meats and cheeses could I get?

1277
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,680
That would be good.

1278
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,960
And on what type of bread?

1279
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,520
Have you tried the pâté with quail eggs?

1280
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,360
Order that, see what kind of reaction you get.

1281
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,280
Is there a way to,

1282
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,920
you know how like there's all those online publishing

1283
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,760
things going around of like how to hack Chipotle

1284
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,600
and like really, really sad ways of getting like

1285
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,880
getting like some extra guac, you know what I mean?

1286
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,200
Like ask for a medium sized tub of guac

1287
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,880
and then have them put it in a large container

1288
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,760
and you'll get 1.5 extra ounces of guac.

1289
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,640
I was like, wow, man.

1290
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,200
That's a lot of steps to go through

1291
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,320
for just a little bit extra guac.

1292
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,360
Is there a way to hack Subway to get bigger, better,

1293
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,960
beefier, more robusto sandwiches?

1294
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
Get the cookies on the sandwich.

1295
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,720
You're saying when they ask what toppings do you want?

1296
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,760
Yeah, what topping?

1297
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,840
You say, I want a large soda on there.

1298
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,960
Yeah, can I get a second?

1299
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,840
Crunch up some of the Lay's potato chips onto the sandwich.

1300
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,600
Can I get a second sandwich inside that sandwich, please?

1301
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,840
And then you can keep doing that forever

1302
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,680
until the universe is all sandwiches.

1303
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,640
Do you guys, what do you guys get at Subway?

1304
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,920
What's your Subway jam?

1305
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,520
I haven't been to a Subway in so long

1306
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,800
because do you know why?

1307
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,880
Because those places fucking stink.

1308
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,560
They stink so bad.

1309
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,320
There's a combination gas station and Subway by my house.

1310
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,960
Oh my God.

1311
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,920
Every time I walk into the gas station, it smells like sick.

1312
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,360
It smells like someone's vomit.

1313
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,440
Yeah, being Subway adjacent is terrible.

1314
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,280
I used to work at the country's best yogurt

1315
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,440
and it really just, it wasn't a brand name for us.

1316
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,720
It fucking meant something.

1317
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,720
But that country's best yogurt was right next door to a Subway

1318
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,960
and we would get a little bit of stink through the vents

1319
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,040
and then you would go in on your lunch break

1320
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,840
because there was nothing else to eat in a 3.5 mile radius.

1321
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,400
So you would go into the Subway and I would get my,

1322
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,240
you know, whatever sandwich I could get for $2.50

1323
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,760
because I was broke like a bad joke.

1324
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,960
And then you would come back and be like,

1325
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,640
oh, you went to Subway, I can tell

1326
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,040
because you carried it with you, the smell of it.

1327
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,400
It gets in your fucking clothes.

1328
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,040
You got a pig pin-esque cloud of Subway stink around you.

1329
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,520
It's like every Subway comes with its own like methane leak.

1330
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,760
Like that's part of the, in order to franchise it out,

1331
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,600
it's like, let's see, you got a sandwich station,

1332
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,600
you got a hood to prevent people from like sweating

1333
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,080
and bleeding and snotting into the meats, that's great.

1334
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,920
And let's just go ahead and break this pipe.

1335
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,960
All right, you're good to go.

1336
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
Have fun and sell lots of Sammies.

1337
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,480
See you in a year to make sure that leak's still going

1338
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,680
because man, it's important.

1339
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,040
That was actually one of my favorite things

1340
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,320
about the brief stint at Jimmy John's I worked where-

1341
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,280
Doesn't have a stink.

1342
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,400
Doesn't have a stink at Jimmy John's.

1343
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,200
Doesn't have a stink.

1344
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,600
Also doesn't like customize sandwiches.

1345
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,080
All they'll do is not put things on it.

1346
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,560
You know what I mean?

1347
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,960
So people come in like, could I get the number 12?

1348
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,160
But could I get that with, nope.

1349
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,440
It's really stinky.

1350
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,280
No, I just want to add extra, nope.

1351
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,040
I remember you could get an extra slice of like mozzarella

1352
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
on your sandwich and it was a dollar.

1353
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,160
Hey, guess what?

1354
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,440
Fuck you, Jimmy John's.

1355
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,360
I can go buy a whole package of it at Kroger's for a dollar.

1356
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,400
And then I can have like a full blown cheese explosion

1357
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,440
on my sandwich.

1358
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,280
I loved that for a while and he might still do it.

1359
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,120
Jimmy John's whole thing was like, we're just sandwiches.

1360
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,640
We don't toast them.

1361
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,160
We don't do soup.

1362
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,200
We don't do specialty, just sandwiches.

1363
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,720
It's like, so your whole sales pitch is we don't do extra things.

1364
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,120
We don't.

1365
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,360
We just do the one thing and we do it okay.

1366
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:09,920
That'll be $14.

1367
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,560
We do not go above and beyond by any means.

1368
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,120
These are artisanal sandwiches prepared by expert chefs

1369
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,360
who've been apprenticing since they were 13.

1370
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,640
And also they're 16 now and they're so good at sandwiches.

1371
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,080
That'll be $14.59.

1372
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,600
The problem I have with ordering at Subway

1373
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,480
and trying to get a perfect sandwich is that,

1374
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,720
and this should help this question asker.

1375
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,080
So I'm happy to pitch in here.

1376
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,520
I can't, I always feel awkward about ordering a topping

1377
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,320
and then I get pretty specific.

1378
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,960
Like when I'm watching them put the topping on,

1379
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,680
I feel like it's really, I feel like this urge to control

1380
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,640
the amount of that topping that I'm getting.

1381
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,080
Like if I ask for green peppers, I don't want 50.

1382
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,640
And their inclination is usually to put 50 on there.

1383
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,280
Thank you.

1384
00:55:59,280 --> 00:55:59,920
You're an artist.

1385
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,720
That's very generous.

1386
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,520
Or mustard, they spread, they fucking,

1387
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,840
they ejaculate that mustard onto your sandwich

1388
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,920
with the carelessness of like a lunatic

1389
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,360
watering their front yard.

1390
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,560
Like it's a nightmare to watch.

1391
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,000
That's why no matter what I get,

1392
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,520
no matter what I get at Subway,

1393
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,720
I always say, and I'd like that with this and this and this,

1394
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,160
and I'd like to make it myself.

1395
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,040
Can I get back, can I get back there?

1396
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,160
And let me just, I know exactly how much lettuce I want.

1397
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,520
Please do not touch it with your stupid service person hands.

1398
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,760
I know shit at the Sub.

1399
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,800
I don't want to put this particular Subway chain on blast.

1400
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
Although if the quality control hasn't picked up

1401
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,560
since the time I worked at the country's best yogurt,

1402
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,120
they've definitely either closed or been closed

1403
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,640
by some sort of government agency.

1404
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,600
Somebody was cutting bread, cut clean into their finger

1405
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,520
and then kept trying to do the sandwich.

1406
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,960
Hey lady, you're not a fucking master chef.

1407
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Like you're not under a tight time constraint.

1408
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,440
Someone else can go ahead and take the reins from you.

1409
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,760
On this particular sandwich.

1410
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,160
Let me get that with the oil and vinegar

1411
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,840
and salt and pepper, a little bit of lettuce

1412
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,760
and like a half pint of your blood.

1413
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,240
You're not on fucking chopped.

1414
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,520
Like it's okay if this sandwich takes a while to make

1415
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,040
and if someone else does it.

1416
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,960
I can happily confirm that Subway is still open

1417
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,600
by the way Griffin, so don't even worry about it.

1418
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,920
Great, well I'm not gonna, I'm sure there's a lot of Subways

1419
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,960
adjacent to the country's best yogurts in the country.

1420
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,800
Not so many anymore I don't think.

1421
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,520
Like this one was on 8th Street in Huntington, West Virginia.

1422
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,080
Have fun guys.

1423
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,520
This week's episode is brought to you by Subway.

1424
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,000
Subway.

1425
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Specifically the one Subway on 8th Street

1426
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,920
in Huntington, West Virginia.

1427
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,520
This is narrow casting at its best.

1428
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,120
This has actually just been my brother, my brother and me.

1429
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,160
It's like a, it's a podcast for advice and jokes

1430
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,320
and love and laughter and-

1431
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,200
Is that the whole ep?

1432
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,240
Where does the time go?

1433
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,960
I know, right?

1434
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,480
It flies by when we're having it.

1435
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,240
It feels like it's been about an hour and three minutes

1436
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,880
for me actually.

1437
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,200
It's about time for me to start sweeping up.

1438
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:00,880
Saddle.

1439
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
Plensing us back into the old trunks.

1440
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,880
We need sad ending music like Dumbo's Circus had.

1441
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,800
Get back in the wagon, we're saying goodbye, we've got to fly.

1442
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,240
Thank you so much for reminding me of that show.

1443
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,280
I'm gonna get off right now and watch it on Hulu Plus.

1444
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,560
What about if it's like, show me that smile.

1445
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,440
It's like the growing pains theme, but like a funeral dirge,

1446
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,200
which is how the, I think that's how the show ended.

1447
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,040
Remember, everybody go to naturebox.com,

1448
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,800
use the coupon code MYBROTHER,

1449
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,400
and you're gonna save 50% off.

1450
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,160
How is that, how is that typed?

1451
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,040
Can you provide the exact typing of-

1452
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,960
Okay, in our notes, it has a space.

1453
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,800
So try it with a space first, if that doesn't work.

1454
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,880
Capital M, capital B, with a space.

1455
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,520
With a space.

1456
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,440
Try that first, if that doesn't work, just try it all together.

1457
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,520
But, Nature Box, go get you some.

1458
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,080
And let us know if you can eat any good snacks.

1459
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
I can personally recommend the banana bread granola,

1460
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:56,880
that's really good.

1461
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,480
Cindy likes the Santa Fe corn sticks.

1462
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,840
If you get chili lime pistachios,

1463
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,200
if you could send some of those my way,

1464
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,560
because we did get a sample box,

1465
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,360
and Rachel did eat all of them before I had a chance to taste any.

1466
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,480
Here's the good news, all the Nature Box snacks

1467
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,320
are really healthy and made from good stuff

1468
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,360
and no weird ingredients, no mystery ingredients.

1469
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,640
So she can eat as many as she wants,

1470
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,000
she's not gonna grow a horn or anything.

1471
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,880
No, I know, but I wanted-

1472
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,720
Apparently, as many as she wants is all of them.

1473
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,520
This is all of them.

1474
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,880
What's my favorite flavor combo?

1475
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,680
Mm, chili and lime.

1476
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,560
What's my favorite nut?

1477
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,360
Mm, pistachio.

1478
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,280
Yeah, I think I would have liked some of those.

1479
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,320
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show,

1480
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,680
helping us spread the word.

1481
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,240
We know we had some issues last week with the download.

1482
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,320
Totally, for once, not our fault.

1483
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,680
It was the fault of our friends at Libsyn.

1484
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,040
Should be working now.

1485
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,240
Listen, they provide a great service.

1486
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,440
It's so rare that things go sideways,

1487
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,960
but I re-uploaded it a third time,

1488
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,600
so if you missed it last week, it should be working now, I hope.

1489
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,560
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1490
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,480
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1491
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,080
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1492
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,280
Are they touring right now?

1493
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,960
Because I just read a concert review of theirs from-

1494
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,160
They're definitely playing some shows.

1495
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,920
I don't know if it's a full-blown tour, but yeah.

1496
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,600
Man, goddammit, I would kill to see that.

1497
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,640
I know, I know.

1498
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,400
So if you're The Long Winters and you're listening,

1499
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,760
come on by our house and do a show.

1500
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,600
No, The Long Winters with a T.

1501
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,640
What did Justin say?

1502
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,160
I swear he said The Long Winters,

1503
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,360
which just sounds like a group of people

1504
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,280
that tell really long, boring stories.

1505
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,080
No, they have a name for that.

1506
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,440
It's called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

1507
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,840
That's our show, folks.

1508
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,720
Thank you so much for listening.

1509
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,400
Griffith, do you have one last question to take us out on?

1510
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,720
I'm so upset about these pistachios.

1511
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,360
The bag wasn't opened, and she was like,

1512
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,120
I thought it was because you didn't want them,

1513
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,880
and it was actually the opposite.

1514
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,080
I was so excited to eat them.

1515
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,240
I was like saving it for a weekend treat.

1516
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,800
Because this final Yahoo was sent in by Andrew Garcia.

1517
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,360
Thanks, Andrew.

1518
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Richard, who asks,

1519
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,200
what determines a moose's coloration?

1520
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,640
I'm Justin McElroy.

1521
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,680
I'm Travis McElroy.

1522
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,480
I'm Griffith McElroy.

1523
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,400
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1524
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,080
Make it back in the wagon.

1525
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,440
We're saying goodbye.

1526
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:13,840
Kiss your dad's square on the way.

1527
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,440
Maximumfun.org.

1528
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,480
Comedy and culture.

1529
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,600
Artist-owned.

1530
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,640
Listener-supported.

1531
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,160
Justin, what are you doing?

1532
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,720
Strapping a chicken in my arm.

1533
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,320
Heard there's some plague out west,

1534
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,040
so I just wanted to kind of get out ahead of it.

1535
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,360
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history

1536
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,320
podcast, Sawbones, where we talk about everything

1537
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
from trepanation to bloodletting,

1538
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,400
you would know that that is a ridiculous idea,

1539
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,520
and it will never work.

1540
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:48,880
Sawbones.

1541
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,400
I haven't caught it.

1542
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:50,960
Sawbones?

1543
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,080
Yes.

1544
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,720
It's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network,

1545
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,400
and we're going to be talking about it.

1546
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,880
It's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network,

1547
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,720
and we record it together.

1548
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,840
Do you need a doctor or something?

1549
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:26,880
Yes.
