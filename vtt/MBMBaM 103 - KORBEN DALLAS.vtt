00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:51.760
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, the official comedy advice cast

00:51.760 --> 01:00.880
of the Avengers in theaters near you May 4th 3D and not. Actually, we legally have to retitle

01:00.880 --> 01:07.440
the show My Brother, My Brother, Iron Man and Me and Thor and Loki and Hulk is there,

01:07.440 --> 01:13.680
he's up in the mix. Hulk and She-Hulk. Is She-Hulk in the show? I assume She-Hulk is in it.

01:13.680 --> 01:19.520
No spoilers. And Vision. Vision's there. Guys, who's your favorite Avenger in the movie The

01:19.520 --> 01:26.800
Avengers? Which scene or Avenger is your favorite? Jarvis. Okay, Jarvis. You mean Iron Man's

01:26.800 --> 01:35.760
electronic butler? Yeah. I'm a big Paul Bettany fan. James Bond? Okay. Griffin, do you know anything

01:35.760 --> 01:44.560
about the Avengers? I like Wolfman. Who's the guy who's always fighting Dracula? Jolly Green Giant.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.440
Is he a comic book? The guy who's fighting Dracula? Yeah. The guy who fights Dracula?

01:49.440 --> 01:57.760
The Mummy? Yeah. My favorite Avenger has to be Iron Man. X-Men. My favorite Avenger is the X-Men

01:58.320 --> 02:03.920
because this is the official show. I do wish they had sent us a screener of some sort,

02:03.920 --> 02:13.520
maybe to do a little pre-pro beforehand because the only Avenger I know is Ra, the sun god. Yep.

02:13.520 --> 02:19.840
And he is an Avenger. Are there any others in the group, on the team? I think for a while,

02:19.840 --> 02:31.920
the guy from the Fantastic Four was one. Lou Reed Richards. What about Mega Man? I think Mega Man

02:31.920 --> 02:38.400
with Kid Icarus. Are any of these things? And Simon Belmont. Our dad is listening. Our dad,

02:38.400 --> 02:43.440
former comic book writer and comic book collector Clint McElroy is listening to this and tearing

02:43.440 --> 02:50.080
his fucking hair out right now in grief. He's snapping his iPhone across his knee,

02:50.960 --> 02:58.560
throwing it through a window like Bruce Banner's alter identity. The thing. The thing. The hide,

02:58.560 --> 03:05.280
Mr. Hide. The hulking mask. The hulking mask of strength. The big guy. The big guy.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.040
When we're not watching the Avengers. Which is apparently all the time.

03:11.040 --> 03:18.240
May 4th, theater near you, 3D official comedy podcast, co-branding, brand partnership,

03:18.240 --> 03:22.400
brand synergy. When I watched the Avengers. How much of that one billion dollar opening

03:22.400 --> 03:30.000
weekend did we get? What we got was a free 12 pack of Diet Dr. Pepper with the Avengers logo

03:30.000 --> 03:34.560
on every single can. Sorry. It's gonna be collectible someday. Are we talking about

03:34.560 --> 03:42.400
DDP or are we talking DCDP? No, this is straight up DDP. No cherries up in this bitch. Just throw

03:42.400 --> 03:49.040
it away. Get some grenadine or throw it away. Grenadine. Unless you got like sugar free grenadine,

03:49.040 --> 03:54.560
you're going to defeat the purpose. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, Iron Man. I'm

03:54.560 --> 04:01.520
your middle brother, Travis McElroy, Wonder Man. I am Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother,

04:01.520 --> 04:11.440
Young Brother Man. My 25 year old friend. Octopus Man. Octopus Man. Bubble Man. Bubble Man. Leaf Man.

04:11.440 --> 04:17.360
Well, back in the Mega Man. Okay, Leaf Garrett, the Avenger. My 25 year old friend won't grow up.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.280
I've tried to impart wisdom and encourage her to pack her bags and move, but she won't do that

04:21.280 --> 04:26.560
without her parents approval either. Help me, brothers. Can I help her stand on her own two

04:26.560 --> 04:32.560
feet? That's from Conflicted Comrade. Additional details on this one. She goes on to explain

04:32.560 --> 04:37.520
things like when her friend was looking to buy a new car, they had everything worked out,

04:37.520 --> 04:41.520
but her parents did not like the car, so she did not buy it and continues to drive their old

04:41.520 --> 04:46.400
minivan and things along that line. So she basically runs all of her life decisions by

04:46.400 --> 04:54.720
her parents. And then she still and she also like still has curfew. Oh, no. Whoa. Yeah. And has to

04:54.720 --> 05:00.400
like check in every half hour. She lives with her folks from what I could tell from the email. Yes,

05:01.040 --> 05:03.920
I get that would be weird if you had a curfew and you didn't live with your parents.

05:03.920 --> 05:10.640
Like, are you in your apartment? It's 11 o'clock. I'll flick my lights on and off so you can see.

05:11.840 --> 05:19.760
I think that anybody who has given over the locus of control to their parents like that,

05:19.760 --> 05:25.760
like, well, whatever they say is the way it goes. That's going to be real hard to shake unless

05:25.760 --> 05:31.840
you're willing to take those reins. Yeah. You've got to be the one running your friend's life.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.360
You've got to become your friend's life coach. You've got to help. Yeah, you've got to life

05:35.360 --> 05:40.160
coach him. You've got to you've got to be there. Joel Austin can just walk them through some of

05:40.160 --> 05:45.440
the big choices. Can I just say, like, I don't know that this is helpful, but I never saw this

05:45.440 --> 05:51.920
before. Fair enough. I kind of see the appeal of it. Not necessarily the parents, but having some

05:51.920 --> 05:59.360
kind of like safety net outside of my head conscience that just was with me that I could go,

05:59.360 --> 06:04.080
man, I kind of want to buy, you know, this new thing. What do you think? No. Okay. You know,

06:04.080 --> 06:11.280
it takes all the onus of responsibility off of you. I scoffed at the idea of a bedtime,

06:11.280 --> 06:17.200
but that wouldn't be the worst thing. Like, if I don't go to bed by 1030, I am totally useless

06:17.200 --> 06:22.320
the next day. So some sort of authority figure. What's up? Were you giggling at the fact that

06:22.320 --> 06:29.360
I need to go to bed by 1030? Yeah, I guess. I went to bed at 1130 last night and I needed

06:29.360 --> 06:37.120
to have a five hour energy drink at one PM today. Griffin doesn't get his full 12 hours.

06:37.120 --> 06:43.760
He just don't even bother. Griffin, I went to bed at 430 last night and then I woke up at 930

06:43.760 --> 06:50.160
and I'm going to be very funny for the next hour. Why were you out until you're fucking 38 years

06:50.160 --> 06:55.600
old? You're old as shit. What were you doing? Well, I don't know. Sometimes I just like to

06:56.640 --> 07:01.920
party. Justin, since I've moved away from Huntington, from time to time, whenever you

07:01.920 --> 07:06.320
text me at like, you know, two o'clock in the morning and you're clearly drunk on the town,

07:06.320 --> 07:11.840
sometimes I just like to picture you, you know, in a werewolf movies when the guy wakes up in

07:11.840 --> 07:16.320
the woods and he's like covered in mud and he's naked and real confused. That's how I always

07:16.320 --> 07:21.120
imagine you the next morning. It's pretty much like that except I have a candy pacifier around

07:21.120 --> 07:29.680
my neck. Pants hung low around your knees. You're asleep outside of Stumbler's too, still stumbling.

07:29.680 --> 07:37.840
Hey, everybody, that's a real bar in Huntington. Come on out. Catch the fever. Catch the fever.

07:37.840 --> 07:46.000
Stumbler's too, still stumbling. If you had a grown folk telling you not to do these things,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.800
don't you think your life would be a little bit better? Yeah, because I miss being able to get

07:50.800 --> 07:56.240
mad at somebody who makes me do things still. That you want to do secretly. Yeah, right.

07:56.240 --> 08:02.400
Oh, I can't come out. Guys, I'd love to come out and just really see the new band, but man,

08:02.400 --> 08:10.000
the rents. Oh no, I gotta call my daddy. Oh, he said no, guys. Oh man, hold on, it's my dad mate.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.880
Oh, that's what I call my dad because he's, yeah, we split the rent. He covers a lot of it.

08:16.880 --> 08:29.040
God, this is why there gets a certain point of messed up where if the parents aren't going to

08:29.040 --> 08:33.360
let go of it and the parents aren't going to push this person out, I'm not sure-

08:33.920 --> 08:41.280
It'll ever happen? No, I don't think it's that person. To conflicted comrade, I don't think you

08:41.280 --> 08:48.880
want to be the thing that does this. No, you can't. Not unless the parents have to be a willing

08:48.880 --> 08:54.800
participant in it, especially if the friend is unwilling to. You can't wrench them out. I mean,

08:54.800 --> 08:59.360
you're talking about creating an entirely separate support system that this person

08:59.360 --> 09:06.720
may not even want. That's too big for you. It's too much heat. You don't want that heat.

09:06.720 --> 09:12.960
You can't handle that heat. Also, if your friend's not pushing back against her parents,

09:12.960 --> 09:18.960
maybe she's not upset about the situation. You're looking at this and it's weird to you, but-

09:19.760 --> 09:26.080
Right. We do all know these people. You know people who are 60 years old and still,

09:26.880 --> 09:34.400
maybe not 60, but 40, 50, doting on their parents and completely unable to do anything without

09:34.400 --> 09:38.000
the input of their parents. That's how these people get that way. I know it's your friend.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.040
It's sad to think about, but believe me when I say this is why parenting is the biggest thing

09:43.040 --> 09:46.400
because you can totally do that to somebody and there's very little that can be done.

09:47.680 --> 09:54.960
Gotta have some kids. Yeah, and then boot them right out at 18. Go to college. Enjoy the world.

09:54.960 --> 10:00.560
Experience things. Call me once a week. Not too much. Not too much. I'll turn your room into a

10:00.560 --> 10:04.720
playroom. Turn your room into a playroom. Maybe there's a window where you gotta get out because

10:05.440 --> 10:12.000
to me there was, this is gonna sound terrible, there was no day in my life that I can remember

10:12.000 --> 10:17.840
being as exciting as being 19 and moving into my first apartment, living by myself. That's such a

10:17.840 --> 10:24.960
fucking insane sea change. Everything in your life changes at that point. I think that that

10:24.960 --> 10:31.120
kind of change is exciting when you're a fresh face 19 year old, but when maybe even like 25

10:31.120 --> 10:36.480
it's absolutely terrifying. It's not too late, but it's terrifying. It is scary and it's a little

10:36.480 --> 10:44.080
embarrassing I would imagine to be like, how do you get electricity? How do you get water? How do

10:44.080 --> 10:51.280
any of those things? When I was 19 I was just calling the mayor. Hey dog, I don't know how

10:51.280 --> 10:56.080
to get these things. Can you please help me? Can you bring me some water please? I'm so thirsty.

10:56.080 --> 11:03.280
I'm a citizen. Please come help me, but at 25 it's gonna be a tough hole to dig out of.

11:03.280 --> 11:07.520
I don't know and I don't think that unless your friend is frustrated with their situation

11:07.520 --> 11:13.440
you can't help her out of it, but also make her frustrated with it. Well the thing is it's like

11:13.440 --> 11:18.000
any responsibility. You could look at someone over and over again and say you need to be more

11:18.000 --> 11:22.160
responsible, but until they make that decision for themselves it's not going to sink in. It's

11:22.160 --> 11:27.280
not really something you can explain to somebody and make them want to do. They have to come to

11:27.280 --> 11:33.360
the realization themselves. If you're whole hog about this and you are serious about it to the

11:33.360 --> 11:37.680
point where you want to get like wicked deep involved, you really have only one option.

11:38.480 --> 11:43.840
Just talk to her parents. Don't do that. You're right. You're totally right. Justin, you're

11:43.840 --> 11:48.720
totally right that that's the only right to her mom mom and dad dad and say listen listen you two

11:48.720 --> 11:54.160
this is a line in the sand and i'm drawing it and you stay away from vicki please you're right but

11:54.160 --> 11:59.600
please don't do that she's my vicki if you do my vicki know that that happened in the world

11:59.600 --> 12:05.600
she's not your vicki anymore she's my vicki stay away because she is good and she's pure and if

12:05.600 --> 12:10.240

13:04.320 --> 13:12.240
so will that help or no that see this well it's like an onion this question this um now this only

13:12.240 --> 13:16.320
works if you do a fashion show so you come in your karate outfit and then you come in your

13:16.320 --> 13:23.520
horse riding out this is a hard hat i do construction things and also i'm a milkman

13:23.520 --> 13:31.200
apparently someone give me a hammer boy was i ever lucky to get judge sammo hung he's been very he's

13:31.200 --> 13:39.120
very lenient about my gi um in court he he sammo hung was one of the karate guys on karate guy you

13:39.120 --> 13:45.520
say go on one of the karate guys on walker texas ranger i could have gone for chuck norris but i

13:45.520 --> 13:51.760
feel like his his uh i i think you don't want chuck norris chuck norris is a hanging judge

13:51.760 --> 13:58.640
everyone knows that is is there anything this gentleman can wear other than a suit

13:58.640 --> 14:04.480
that t-shirt says i heart judges okay but that's that's gonna probably not gonna do it because i

14:04.480 --> 14:08.400
think i don't think you can wear any shirt that says i heart anything on it and then i heart

14:08.400 --> 14:13.680
judges a lot people don't what about a sarcastic maybe a judge reinhold mask and you just go to

14:13.680 --> 14:21.200
the guy and say hey hey listen just a judge are we cool am i good i've got this judge reinhold

14:21.200 --> 14:27.600
mask and a karate gi are we gonna waive these charges or what can we can we work that into our

14:27.600 --> 14:35.280
like catchphrase vernacular the am i good anytime you say something terrible or faux pas just real

14:35.280 --> 14:43.920
quick oh shit am i good am i good hey i came to court in a karate gi am i good so i'm just gonna

14:43.920 --> 14:50.000
go i assume the charges have been dropped uh-huh am i good i just i just chopped your gavel in

14:50.000 --> 15:01.200
half am i good what's that smell it's not weed i promise to what extent does the color of belt

15:01.200 --> 15:08.000
that this person has all the difference in the world okay it for for i mean either way you chop

15:08.000 --> 15:14.880
it if he's got a white belt he's not going to a intimidate the judge or be impressive with the

15:14.880 --> 15:20.320
with the amount of time that he has spent in karate chopping class you can get the white belt

15:20.320 --> 15:26.960
blue belt brown belt yellow belt all within like a week and a half if you pay and if you slip a few

15:26.960 --> 15:33.200
you know extra hundos to your uh to your sensei to your senpai um from what from what i've seen

15:34.240 --> 15:40.560
there if you were to graph my uh respect for people in the martial arts it's a pretty steady

15:40.560 --> 15:46.800
curve up until you hit black belt and then it it branches pretty radically in two different

15:46.800 --> 15:54.960
directions where on the one hand i am for some of those people i am like wow really odd by the

15:54.960 --> 16:02.240
dedication to your craft and then the other people it's like just put on just get a job

16:02.800 --> 16:08.320
just put on a suit and learn how to play lacrosse and please get your life together it distracts

16:08.320 --> 16:11.840
me it's one of those things that in my life if someone were to say to me oh yeah i have a black

16:11.840 --> 16:19.360
belt the next two words out of my mouth are prove it yeah i don't i don't know what that entails i

16:19.360 --> 16:23.520
don't know if that's like chop through this wall or fight me or what it is but there's something

16:23.520 --> 16:28.560
about someone making that statement where i'm like oh yeah prove it but i think a black belt

16:28.560 --> 16:36.160
drop that horse in half a black belt is really a only a value add to a person when nobody knows

16:36.160 --> 16:42.240
that they have it right like if i got a black belt i wouldn't tell fucking i would go take my classes

16:42.240 --> 16:50.160
in another state so so that people what classes oh karate karate classes um and then when i came

16:50.160 --> 16:55.520
back and like if shit came down and i like did a chop and a kick and a man died then people were

16:55.520 --> 17:00.160
like what i'd be like oh don't worry about it i would never ever admit the fact that i have a

17:00.160 --> 17:04.320
jacket to the side and show them just a little like glimpse of black belt because if i ever

17:04.320 --> 17:08.160
said the word out loud to somebody oh i have a black belt they're gonna make all kinds of wild

17:08.160 --> 17:13.600
assumptions about me right which are probably all going to be they're gonna be very true uh but i

17:13.600 --> 17:18.400
would rather not be be subject to that do you think that when you get the black belt itself

17:18.400 --> 17:30.320
you it's reversible in case you want to wear brown shoes idiot so this is what this is your outfit

17:30.320 --> 17:35.680
okay you come into court you're wearing brown black dress shoes a black belt and you have

17:35.680 --> 17:43.440
a tie and you go to the judge and you say am i good as you can see i'm in my formal ghee

17:44.000 --> 17:51.600
am i good now this is my dress key am i good i have a funeral to go to i'm gonna karate

17:51.600 --> 17:58.880
chop the coffin in half i can't believe you'd hold a karate master here you don't know that

17:58.880 --> 18:05.280
the lightning you're bottling up here you can't put me in a cell i will not be responsible for

18:05.280 --> 18:10.080
the damage i do if you lock me in a cell with another person i whittle their bones down and

18:10.080 --> 18:14.720
make a key like i can't i can't be responsible i don't know that karate is the kind of thing

18:14.720 --> 18:21.520
that you can do if you're high on that sweet sweet dojo if you're if you're rocking dojo

18:21.520 --> 18:27.200
in the dojo like you're i don't think that your skills are going to be like as as as high as you

18:27.200 --> 18:38.960
want them to be no like three three puns intended uh yes yes and no to the outside observer you

18:38.960 --> 18:44.160
will be very bad at karate yeah to your own perception oh my god you'll be on a fucking

18:44.160 --> 18:50.960
kung fu other playing kill bill style fucking body parallel flat to the ground doing a you against

18:50.960 --> 18:57.280
the crazy 88s just losing your mind chopping off limbs mortal combat fly through the air bicycle

18:57.280 --> 19:03.040
kick like you're just laying on the ground and rolling rolling about you're listening to 311

19:03.040 --> 19:08.640
and you're eating starburst i just i just had a point wait hold on i just realized something

19:08.640 --> 19:12.400
thinking about this question that has blown my mind so hard that i have to ask it what's that

19:12.400 --> 19:20.080
okay is it possible that this person asking this question owns a karate outfit but does not in fact

19:20.080 --> 19:27.680
do karate oh i thought that was implied okay great um but that's a that's a oh god what a

19:27.680 --> 19:33.120
risky maneuver because if you go to court you're gonna be high and the judge is like obviously the

19:33.120 --> 19:41.120
judge and you're wearing your kimpogi and he's like pardon like i don't worry about it i do karate

19:41.120 --> 19:45.920
i don't just sit around and chill with my boys and listen to 311 then the judge is going to be

19:45.920 --> 19:52.080
like okay well to prove that chop all these boards and kick this man and then what are

19:52.080 --> 19:56.400
you gonna do you're gonna hurt your hand you're gonna hurt your hand you're gonna embarrass

19:56.400 --> 20:01.120
yourself in front of the man and there's a bigger risk what's that there's a bigger risk that this

20:01.120 --> 20:05.680
judge is secretly a vampire hunter he'll see your skills and say we've been looking for someone like

20:05.680 --> 20:11.360

20:11.360 --> 20:16.160
office under my office that opens into a large cavernous office where there's a network of agents

20:16.880 --> 20:22.640

25:00.400 --> 25:04.400
unplug that computer and set it on fire because the authorities are on their way to your residence

25:04.400 --> 25:11.520

25:11.520 --> 25:20.880
that's 15 for one 25 for a couple how would i hear your tickets oh god thank you for coming to

25:20.880 --> 25:32.720
prom you don't you don't want to go to prom is there any way is okay i mean if you fully lean

25:32.720 --> 25:40.400
into it and go like powder blue ruffled tuxedo and talk about how much better prom was in your day

25:42.080 --> 25:48.160
if you absolutely have to put your dick in that shark's mouth like what's the best way to do it

25:48.160 --> 25:54.080
the only way you can do it and i've seen you've seen this maneuver in so many films and you do

25:54.080 --> 25:59.840
have to pull it off you have to become the star of the prom oh my god like you gotta do life it

25:59.840 --> 26:04.960
up you've got a teen wolf right you've got to become the life of the prom if anybody there

26:04.960 --> 26:14.800
expects that you this tall bearded grandpa is there and trying to like keep it discreet oh it's

26:14.800 --> 26:21.120
it's the assumptions fly your flag yeah because here's the thing here's the main point numerically

26:21.120 --> 26:28.960
18 and 20 not that different realistically worlds apart well well i mean i'm just saying like you

26:28.960 --> 26:33.840
could look at it on paper and say like what's so weird it's only been two years yeah since he's

26:33.840 --> 26:39.440
been out of high school but there's a there's a door there you can't go back through sure um and

26:39.440 --> 26:43.760
that's not to say that you're you're like something's weird about your relationship

26:43.760 --> 26:47.440
oh no no no no because when you date a college person when you're in high school

26:47.440 --> 26:53.040
then you you you like bought you gain those levels right is that how that works yeah you

26:53.040 --> 26:58.880
gain experience yeah i just i don't understand why you would want to go into relationship debt

26:59.440 --> 27:03.440
trying to convince this girl to go to a school dance she doesn't want to go this woman

27:03.440 --> 27:11.200
not relationship debt and like real debt you cost a lot of money what if she orders the

27:11.200 --> 27:15.040
fucking samurai play the hibachi that's 35 you're not gonna get back

27:16.640 --> 27:19.840
right down to her gullet she'll of course she'll only eat the scallops

27:19.840 --> 27:24.480
i say she's too full yeah what if what do you do with the box you leave it in the limo

27:25.280 --> 27:29.840
what what do they do if the hibachi master throws a temporary shrimp at her she doesn't catch it

27:31.040 --> 27:38.640
what's oh no oh god oh god my my face skin take me to the hospital i'm in high school i don't have

they briefly teamed up together oh right oh no i thought that was in the the 58

28:55.840 --> 29:01.440
59 series how many was it actually it was it was in the amalgam and tempura face combined with

29:01.440 --> 29:07.040
super boy i remember that you often discuss why a customer should not ask out an employee

29:07.040 --> 29:13.600
but you never talk about the reverse can an employee of a restaurant ask out a customer

29:13.600 --> 29:19.120
if so how does one do this properly that's from wondering in white oh you've come to the right

29:19.120 --> 29:26.640
place do they yeah don't do it i don't i don't say that to anybody no well i one of us has done

29:26.640 --> 29:35.600
this before yes in fact they have do tell oh god i did it how'd it go i'm not proud not well worked

29:35.600 --> 29:42.240
out pretty well huh yeah not well at all i want to hear every every solitary detail and i will

29:42.240 --> 29:48.720
know if you're withholding so i was working on a coffee shop and i was waiting on this woman it was

29:48.720 --> 29:52.800
a coffee shop slash bar i was waiting on this woman she was with a group of people i thought

29:52.800 --> 29:56.640
she was really cute but i was too nervous because she was with a group of people so like after i

29:56.640 --> 30:05.280
gave her a check oh god then oh god the next part please okay i got her name off the receipt oh no

30:05.280 --> 30:14.480
no facebook break wait no wait travis i know you got her name off the receipt and then you

30:14.480 --> 30:20.480
message her on facebook yes yes long story short i mean she said yes to a date so we did go out on

30:20.480 --> 30:26.720
a date so hold on when i said travis we should do an advice show how was your response on oh no i

30:26.720 --> 30:32.400
could never do that oh no i made the worst decision ever oh no i i couldn't do that again

30:32.400 --> 30:37.920
oh no i i couldn't do that and keep and have a straight face i'm sorry it's like when you get

30:37.920 --> 30:43.840
caught drunk driving and so you can never be president you it's like that travis when travis

30:44.640 --> 30:49.920
did she can learn from my failure did she give you any indication in the restaurant she was

30:49.920 --> 30:56.880
also craving your wave in a yes okay yes so it's not like it wasn't technically stalking

30:57.680 --> 31:02.000
no there was mutual flirting to the point like where she came over and was talking to me

31:02.000 --> 31:05.840
like left her group of friends and stuff i was talking to me i just was too nervous to do it and

31:05.840 --> 31:12.080
she was like man i sure wish you'd just crib my identity could you take that for me thanks

31:12.960 --> 31:16.160
did she give you any hint that she wanted to be clumbed that hard

31:17.600 --> 31:21.840
but here's the thing though you can't knock it because she agreed to go on a date with me oh i

31:21.840 --> 31:28.560
can i can i've been your brother for 28 years i can knock it don't do it it's one of the sketchiest

31:28.560 --> 31:32.480
things i've ever done but i gotta say but it worked out like if it hadn't worked out

31:33.600 --> 31:39.040
yeah i mean it would be a lot harder to criticize three of us like together if you add all of our

31:39.040 --> 31:49.120
game up you'd get like seven and but the scale goes up to like a billion so um and i i'm pretty

31:49.120 --> 31:54.240
sure you're bringing six of those points so right um i got i mean that's good game that's pretty

31:54.240 --> 32:01.920
good game that's not bad well it's it's borderline illegal game but it's not what i did no it's not

32:01.920 --> 32:08.400
the worst uh and then i did buy a bunch of stuff with her credit okay but that was after it didn't

32:08.400 --> 32:14.480
work out um we only went on one day she turned out not to be very interesting okay yeah oh man

32:15.360 --> 32:18.880
yeah i'm i don't know what's more concerning to me the people who are just going to

32:19.440 --> 32:23.120
realize what a ruse it's been they've been taking advice from travis for these years

32:23.120 --> 32:29.360
or the people who are sitting at home saying oh good one i like that thanks thanks t-dog

32:30.640 --> 32:35.680
listen you know my methods no you know i'm not gonna defend myself it's one of the sketchiest

32:35.680 --> 32:41.360
things i've ever done at the time i thought it was kind of oh god in a lonely way romantic it's not

32:41.360 --> 32:47.440
it's not if if you can't ask the person out there and there don't do it the biggest problem with

32:47.440 --> 32:59.040
romance is that it's often in every way except like the line between that and creepsneak is like

32:59.920 --> 33:06.400
so thin right if there's a guy outside your window and a trench coat and he's holding something up

33:06.400 --> 33:12.400
there are literally one thing that is a boombox it could be and then a million other things that

33:12.400 --> 33:17.760
it could be that's how thin that line is yeah you can have one thing in your hand that's romantic

33:17.760 --> 33:21.600
or you can have a million things where if you're standing outside someone's window

33:21.600 --> 33:25.760
in a trench coat holding something aloft it's the worst it's the pit it's also like it's a

33:25.760 --> 33:29.280
really dangerous game it's i mean it's it's thinner than that isn't it like if you're

33:29.280 --> 33:34.720
holding up a boombox there's really one song that you can be playing on that jukebox and if you have

33:34.720 --> 33:41.200
like cnc music factory gonna make you sweat busting outside of somebody's window where

33:41.200 --> 33:45.600
they're sitting next to the window like working on the macbook and their husband's in the other

33:45.600 --> 33:54.000
yeah christine yeah open your window if you like pina coladas this is insane composting am i good

33:55.680 --> 34:01.760
christine am i good here's the takeaway uh people listening at home that thought for even a half of

34:01.760 --> 34:08.240
a second that what i did was a good idea um for the one time that it worked out there are 99 other

34:08.240 --> 34:14.240
times that she could have called my boss you did this 90 other times no no no no to the same person

34:14.240 --> 34:21.360
no i'm saying that there was a 99 probably 99.9 chance oh yeah that she could call my boss

34:21.360 --> 34:25.920
and be like uh one of your employees totally creeped my name off of my receipt yeah you

34:25.920 --> 34:32.960
definitely threaded the needle on this one yes so don't do it you know if travis had gotten fired

34:32.960 --> 34:51.520
you know what he wouldn't needed more of therapy well money zone our first driver money zone this

34:51.520 --> 34:58.320
week is a little thing called mob rules travis what can you tell me about them mob rules is

34:58.320 --> 35:02.480
uh an independent game company and right now they're working on a project called haunts the

35:02.480 --> 35:08.000
manse macabre and it's a really cool idea basically the idea is you can either be

35:08.880 --> 35:14.640
the haunt the denizens haunting the mansion or you can be the intruders that are coming in to

35:14.640 --> 35:18.560
investigate the mansion you can play from either side you can play single player you can play

35:18.560 --> 35:23.600
multiplayer and it's online but the coolest thing about the company is that they are completely

35:23.600 --> 35:28.080
transparent so basically they're really up front with their business model they make all their

35:28.080 --> 35:33.120
budgets sales schedule expenses everything's public so you know what's going on so basically

35:33.120 --> 35:38.000
the deal is they want your help getting their game finished so they're promoting a kickstarter

35:38.720 --> 35:44.400
and you can go check it out it's mob rules games dot square space dot com and you can go and check

35:44.400 --> 35:48.480
out the video and see screenshots from the game and everything but it's super cool and the video

35:48.480 --> 35:52.000
is great and they seem like really cool guys and they're giving out they're giving out free

35:52.000 --> 35:58.240
downloads of the game for every five dollars that you give to the kickstarter so there's some good

35:58.240 --> 36:05.360
bonuses so if you donate you know 50 bucks you get 10 codes to download the game and you can spread

36:05.360 --> 36:08.880
those out amongst your friends or they even encourage in the video they encourage you to

36:09.760 --> 36:14.880
sell them for profit so take the code and then sell it for seven dollars and make two dollars

36:14.880 --> 36:21.440
off of every code but they need you know they've already raised 40 000 and you just need another

36:21.440 --> 36:28.960
25 to get it done um so it's it looks like a really awesome game and and the art style is kind

36:28.960 --> 36:35.200
of uh edward gory uh kind of you know elongated features black and white kind of thing it looks

36:35.200 --> 36:40.880
very awesome very cool very brody-esque wouldn't you say it's pretty ask like something adrian

36:40.880 --> 36:46.560

44:27.360 --> 44:31.680
bartholomew thank you katie it's by yahoo answers user lumpy space princess who asks

44:31.680 --> 44:40.640
i ordered a pizza 45 minutes ago and it still hasn't arrived should i call the police is this

44:40.640 --> 44:42.640
a person that thinks they've been defrauded

44:45.120 --> 44:50.800
either that when you order a pizza either online or on the phone the moment that you place that

44:50.800 --> 44:54.800
order that pizza is technically your property you know what i mean if you pay online with a credit

44:54.800 --> 45:02.480
card it's your pizza so if they keep it from you then it's stolen and you have to call that um when

45:02.480 --> 45:09.440
i watch that bar fill on the dominos pizza tracker all i can think about is like okay donna be careful

45:09.440 --> 45:13.840
with my pie it says you're putting it in the oven right now please be gentle baby gloves i

45:13.840 --> 45:18.560
wish sometimes i want to call and just i don't want to just be like hey baby gloves i can watch

45:18.560 --> 45:24.800
you do everything on my computer i know what's at if i please put the pepperoni in concentric circles

45:24.800 --> 45:30.000
it will say donna dropped the pizza on the floor she picked the hair off it and looked around to

45:30.000 --> 45:36.960
see if anyone saw the internet saw donna is it possible that this person is worried about the

45:36.960 --> 45:43.440
safety of the driver i i guess because i do know that those people come under come under crime oh

45:43.440 --> 45:50.560
my god i've had a pizza delivered by nathan every day for the last six months and he's not here yet

45:50.560 --> 45:55.600
and he's always on time also i think something's gone wrong i also need police to help me get out

45:55.600 --> 46:01.360
of my couch because i've eaten nothing but pizza for six whole months here's a real conversation i

46:01.360 --> 46:07.440

47:00.160 --> 47:07.120
here's the problem the police don't show up for 45 minutes who do you call then a priest the

47:07.120 --> 47:12.320
avengers well listen if i if i order a pizza it takes 90 minutes to get there it's a good thing

47:12.320 --> 47:16.160
the police will be there because there will have been a suicide and they won't

47:17.520 --> 47:23.680
it will need to investigate my suicide oh this looks like a this looks like another

47:23.680 --> 47:31.280
pizza-related suicide another pizza side this is the third this week oh no he was so looking

47:31.280 --> 47:38.480
forward to the crazy bread and pesto sauce and cheese dippins he was getting pizza and wings

47:38.480 --> 47:45.280
with dippins and he none of it none of it followed through he's he obviously was eating cheez-its

47:45.280 --> 47:49.440
because there's an empty box of cheez-its as hand is stuck in like poo bear and jar of honey

47:49.440 --> 47:55.680
so it wasn't a hunger issue he was just super boned out for pizza and dip he was definitely

47:55.680 --> 48:03.680
snacking um did you guys see that uh somewhere in the middle east i want to say i don't know

48:03.680 --> 48:09.120
because i'm not sure of the countries that are over there but um the there's a the uh

48:10.400 --> 48:14.080
pizza it's over there are putting um cheeseburgers in the crust

48:14.080 --> 48:19.520
there's a way so there's pizza huts east of us somewhere they're putting cheeseburgers

48:19.520 --> 48:24.480
somewhere to the east they're putting like full-size like adult adult sized hamburgers

48:24.480 --> 48:32.720
in a crust no you gotta imagine like um it's a cheeseburger stuffed crust yeah okay so like

48:32.720 --> 48:45.120
there's a ring of dough um and jammed into it are it's our it's a mini cheeseburger it's a it's a

48:45.120 --> 48:51.600
succotash of cheeseburgers it's yeah it's a mishmash of cheeseburger gobbledygook it sounds

48:51.600 --> 48:56.320
like something i would have invented at my most boring and or you're most depressed

48:56.320 --> 49:03.440
i i i looked it up and i got really into this idea like man i have to try it so uh i was i was

49:03.920 --> 49:12.400
cruising over to the uh there was one sample by uh a guy named arva amed for the uh for the uh

49:12.400 --> 49:19.840
the serious eats.com and uh he he checked out the pizza and said if i took the anti-alcohol

49:19.840 --> 49:27.760
serious eats.com and uh he he checked out the pizza and said if i took the antonym of delicious

49:28.400 --> 49:35.120
strapped it into a rocket and blasted it 20 000 light years away i may begin to get close to my

49:35.120 --> 49:42.960
experience with the burger patty they also have chicken tenders that doesn't japan have a pizza

49:42.960 --> 49:47.760
with hot dogs in the crust are we doing that too now there's nothing that upsets me more that this

49:47.760 --> 49:53.200
is going on it's not in america like is there an area we haven't fallen off yet and could like oh

49:53.200 --> 49:59.120
i don't know justin we the one we haven't made tacos with snack chips as the shell oh wait we

49:59.120 --> 50:05.520
definitely have done that i guess that's pretty good those last they have a half-life a freshness

50:06.080 --> 50:12.720
firmness half-life of about 13 and a half seconds from the moment that meat touches shell touches

50:12.720 --> 50:17.360
through i want you to know that i've just pictured you in a lab coat and glasses with a clipboard

50:17.360 --> 50:23.440
and like a montage of like timing the tacos yeah yeah eating a taco in a centrifuge like oh god

50:25.120 --> 50:30.720
it's separating oh god i've separated now it's just a taco and doritos like a normal fucking

50:30.720 --> 50:36.720
human thing to eat can i get the torritos can i get the doritos loco taco with the doritos on the

50:36.720 --> 50:43.440
side i actually would like i would like to start buying bags of doritos that come in taco shell

50:43.440 --> 50:48.640
form that's where i i just want to start there i i just want to cut out the middle man by which i

50:48.640 --> 50:57.120
mean the fillings and eat the the shells from a bag can i do that um you can you can you can do

50:57.120 --> 51:04.560
anything in this beautiful country of ours can i stuff a pizza crust with doritos tacos and but

51:04.560 --> 51:13.520
then do a double decker sandwich kfc chicken sandwich where the yeah this pizza each pizza

51:13.520 --> 51:20.240
is a crust and also inside instead of a patty there is a blueberry pie but what's in the

51:20.240 --> 51:30.400
blueberry pie justa what was the question can we call the police for pizza crimes oh

51:30.400 --> 51:34.400
oh i'm not sure they have jurisdiction unless they're pizza police

51:36.080 --> 51:39.600
there is a separate branch right that's what law and order was about yeah the three branches of

51:39.600 --> 51:44.240
government it's a legislative executive judicial and pizza and pizza licious

51:46.480 --> 51:51.040
i can't i can't what's that ma'am they forgot your dipping sauce dun dun dun yeah

51:51.920 --> 51:57.600

52:24.160 --> 52:30.080
to finally be starting my career in law enforcement i've already started running every day and mentally

52:30.080 --> 52:36.240
psyching myself up is there any advice the brothers mcelroy can give me that's from soon to be po now

52:36.240 --> 52:41.040
we have a little experience in this arena because one of our dearest podcasting friends is james

52:41.040 --> 52:49.440
gowdy who's of course a police officer in the beautiful uh uk so um what do you now over there

52:49.440 --> 52:54.480
they they don't have crime which is a thing yeah that's the big not to say that he has an easy job

52:54.480 --> 53:03.200
of it but no there's no guns in in all of europe so right no guns no crime as far as i have seen

53:03.200 --> 53:11.760
he has to fight criminals that are using trebuchets um what do you guys want from your police just be

53:11.760 --> 53:17.280
could you just be cool just be cool like don't pull me over because i don't have a front plate

53:17.280 --> 53:22.800
on my car i didn't know don't bust me for skateboarding on the rails at city hall

53:22.800 --> 53:31.040
because this is sickest grinding in the city don't shoot any kids that's a good place to start i i

53:31.040 --> 53:36.880
love police officers but i don't think that there is a profession that has like one bad apple kind

53:36.880 --> 53:42.800
of yeah reference right yeah yeah absolutely do you know how many cops it takes to ruin the cop

53:42.800 --> 53:48.560
reputation in town like one guy who drives around just shooting his gun out the window yeah a pretty

53:48.560 --> 53:54.720
much almost without incident every time that i've ever been brought under the long arm of the law

53:54.720 --> 53:59.360
the guy's been totally decent about it because it's like usually if you're busted for a crime

53:59.360 --> 54:06.080
and you're a white person living in america you know what happens you know what you did you can

54:06.080 --> 54:13.840
follow the trail from cause to effect and you right that line gets a lot harder to weave if

54:13.840 --> 54:21.840
you are not a white white person of some of some means in america but uh like for me i i know what

54:21.840 --> 54:27.280
i did i know what i gave i'll never forget the time i got pulled over for going i think like 23

54:27.280 --> 54:33.760
miles over the speed limit um and the dude was really cool and he was like i'm gonna write down

54:33.760 --> 54:38.000
that you're going 19 miles over the speed limit because if you're going 20 or more it's reckless

54:38.000 --> 54:42.640
endangerment and i'd have to take your license away i was like thank you so much and while he

54:42.640 --> 54:46.800
was writing the ticket i called our dad and i was like hey dad i'm getting this ticket and he was

54:46.800 --> 54:52.640
like is there any way to talk your way out of it i was like the dude already cut you like going to

54:52.640 --> 54:59.680
jail the biggest solid ever yeah i'm i'm i'm gonna say i'm good on this one and just take take it

54:59.680 --> 55:05.440
take take the ticket and say thank you very much and then cry on my way to cincinnati um

55:06.480 --> 55:12.880
one time i was pulled over coming back from a road trip and i was by myself and

55:14.800 --> 55:21.840
this sounds like it would happen in a movie but i opened my glove compartment when he asked for

55:21.840 --> 55:27.120
my license my registration i opened my glove compartment completely forgetting that i had left

55:27.120 --> 55:33.840
a fifth of whiskey oh good in the glove compartment and it literally tumbled out like

55:33.840 --> 55:39.360
comically like a scene from a really bad prequel the dumb and dumber not that there's more than

55:39.360 --> 55:45.280
one but you could tell that the cops saw it and then just decided that his day would be a lot

55:45.280 --> 55:52.800
better if he hadn't seen it he just sighed and like rubbed his his nose yeah let's all pretend

55:52.800 --> 55:58.400
that didn't happen let's pretend i didn't see that and i mean it's not like i'm a lush it just

55:58.400 --> 56:03.040
i it seemed like a place to put it it probably been there for for weeks driving is stressful

56:03.040 --> 56:09.600
you know you gotta have some way to gotta relax just gotta unwind out there when i was uh with

56:09.600 --> 56:17.680
my group of friends uh uh at bonnaroo and we got busted by drug enforcement officials for having

56:17.680 --> 56:25.600
at bonnaroo yeah what um i gotta say it goes all the way down wasn't guys wasn't mine straight edge

56:25.600 --> 56:33.600
to the limit no hardcore straight edge who's that wrestler cm punk i'm like cm punk basically

56:33.600 --> 56:38.800
through and through wasn't mine okay but it was happening around me i tried to call an adult

56:39.520 --> 56:44.320
there were no adults to be found i tried to call a teacher or a parent did you snatch out

56:44.320 --> 56:47.680
of their hands they're like hey don't do this you're better than that what happened and that's

56:47.680 --> 56:55.040
rolled up holding the bag literally the bag was full of sweet dosha um but they were really cool

56:55.040 --> 56:58.960
they're like let's just hey let's just fill out some paperwork this might be because they were at

56:58.960 --> 57:05.760
bonnaroo and it was probably the three thousandth ticket that they handed out that day where our pad

57:05.760 --> 57:10.640
is empty we're down to the cardboard we're just gonna write on the cardboard iou one ticket yeah

57:10.640 --> 57:15.920
yeah it's like it's like it's like it would be like a writing people uh peanut shell littering

57:15.920 --> 57:23.360
tickets at logan's roadhouse texas style roadhouse it's exactly like that yeah yeah it would be like

57:23.360 --> 57:28.400
uh it would be like handing out pizza crime tickets to somebody who spilled a little bit of

57:28.400 --> 57:33.520
uh parmesan on the floor you know it's like cool it guys right take it easy

57:33.520 --> 57:40.800
do you want to hear my favorite interaction with the cops i i shouldn't i i think they

57:40.800 --> 57:47.120
prefer pigs with with the popo with the bacon with guys come on they're wonderful people kill

57:47.120 --> 57:54.400
them all occupied in college my friend tj was standing outside of a house party but he was

57:54.400 --> 57:59.440
drinking out of a red solo cup which is like oh you know it's it's like a red flag to the police

57:59.440 --> 58:04.880
like hey i'm drinking nobody drinks juice or milk out of red solo cups exactly there's only one case

58:04.880 --> 58:10.560
in which you drink out of a red solo oh this it's it's ovaltine yeah and so tj at the time was 19

58:11.360 --> 58:17.200
and so the cops roll up and they look at him standing in the front yard and they're like

58:17.200 --> 58:21.440
excuse me son how old are you and he looks right at him and he goes i am i am 19 officer

58:22.240 --> 58:27.120
and they said are you drinking tonight and he said oh no officer not only am i under age i'm

58:27.120 --> 58:31.760
the designated driver and they said let me see that cup and they take it and they step it and

58:31.760 --> 58:39.200
they said son there's alcohol in here and he goes what they told me it was punch okay why would my

58:39.200 --> 58:44.000
friends do this to me and the cops were like it's okay sir just be more careful next time he said

58:44.000 --> 58:51.680
thank you i guess they're not really my friend god cops are so fucking dumb stupid idiots

58:51.680 --> 58:58.800
so i guess just be smart apparently and you'll be ahead of the game be a lot smarter than most of

58:58.800 --> 59:04.320
those cops i mean we can just assume that this guy is a fucking paul blart idiot dummy if he's even

59:04.320 --> 59:11.440
gonna be if he's interested in this vocation stupid moron stupid sorry if you can't understand

59:11.440 --> 59:19.200
our jokes fucking we'll slow it down for you have fun hanging out with mahoney yeah fucking

59:19.200 --> 59:26.640
and hightower cops and michael winslow i think i can't do this to you um this yahoo was sent

59:26.640 --> 59:30.880
in by earl parsons thanks earl it's by yahoo answers user gabby who asks what do i say when

59:30.880 --> 59:37.760
i touch his dick i want to be confident should i say something like omg it's big or should i say

59:37.760 --> 59:42.320
that or what after and after i touch it what do i do it's like seven inches so that's why i would

59:42.320 --> 59:50.960
say it's big you just gotta look at him and say nice nice nice good one bro ah sweet dick that's

59:50.960 --> 01:00:00.480
like the sweetest dick do start it out with omg whatever you say omg i love this hog is there any

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.760
words the first time that you see and touch the genitals of a person that you're interested in

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.400
there's no words you can say right you just gotta all i can think of is things you shouldn't say you

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.720
gotta get to business like you just gotta get the the the highest compliment you can pay genitalia

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.920
is immediately going to town on them because if you say like just smacking it around even some

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:31.680
even something as innocuous is like oh wow like you're gonna sound like it's like preschool

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:38.080
teacher or something like that like you gotta get an old star yeah you gotta start just like just

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:45.520
like uh just like touching it just like it's like you got it rub it and like it's like punching it

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:51.680
touch it and like whisper at whisper to it blow on it blow on it wink at it

01:00:51.680 --> 01:01:00.320
give it eskimo kisses but you're like it's the fifth element and you don't know exactly what

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.800
activates it maybe it's butterfly kiss maybe it's fire water you're not exactly sure what the fifth

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.040
element is it's probably not fire i'm gonna go ahead and put that out there it might be fire

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.360
is chris tucker there maybe there's probably a bunch of quotes you could get from fifth

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:26.720
element to say when you see the penis that's what you do you light some candles turn on some

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:33.680
satay and then you light some candles you pop some some champ some bubbly and you sit down and

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:40.880
you kiss softly gently you pull pull those pants down and you pull his underpants down and you look

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.440
and you bend down and you get real close to it you know coban dallas into it

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.480
they just did a study that is um if you do an impression of chris tucker it's impossible not

01:01:54.480 --> 01:02:00.080
to sound racist they actually they actually worked that out just now with some research

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.440
some science research i know it's it's too bad what if it was like a really bad impression

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:11.600
of chris tucker well i i don't know yours was so good it's mine was flawless but what if it

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:18.400
was like coban dallas could you couple it with a really bad impression of jackie chan

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.200
oh man no because that one will be racist i don't have a good

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.720
my chan is my chan game is weak my fantastic yeah it'd be something like

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:35.440
like and he got one syllable out and we got a shutdown

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:45.680
but can we not i'm can i beat that out yes yeah you beat that out

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.560
oh shit dude you really could you just say like what's that

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.680
what's on this what's up what happens now am i good what's all this what's all the fuss about

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.920
where's the other one i don't think that one's gonna play you don't think that one's gonna work

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:11.680
i'm worried that this person is young because they said omg and i once you turn like 14 you're

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.480
not allowed to say omg anymore it would be i think a baller move to be like a 40 year old woman and

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:28.960
be like omg yeah that's actually travis that's the worst i'm what some might call a milf who's

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:38.000
ready to go to cougar town let me see your wiener take out that young wiener carbon dallas

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:47.760
yes i'm from sydney australia and soon the lfl the lingerie football league is coming to town

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:54.480
is that a bad choice to take a girl on a date to that's from guy hey yes it is all right good

01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:02.160
night everyone yeah it's a pretty bad choice but is it a bad choice to take a grown mature

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:09.840
thoughtful woman to it as a date uh pretty much any grown mature thoughtful woman uh that i've

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:16.800
known in my life is going to be livid at the idea of the existence of a lingerie football league

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:25.920
mm-hmm what's you know what i i kind of am that's i okay i don't want to i don't want to cast

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:32.400
i don't want to cast dispersions but i don't think that this is going to be the kind of sports

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:38.240
entertainment that i'm looking for do you know what i mean what are you what would you say you're

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:46.880
looking for i am looking for a a robust athleticism and i don't and i don't think would you settle for

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.560
robusty i wouldn't i wouldn't i like to keep my sports game and my boner game totally on opposite

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:02.640
ends of a it's 100 foot high wall i don't start what if you start associating um shoulder pads

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.520
with arousal that's gonna make for some awkward locker room moments when you're the intramural

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:13.520
season picks back up it's the thing that's the lingerie is the key my key complaint because you

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:19.520
can't really get you can't tackle anyone nobody's ever been tackled while wearing lingerie i feel

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.360
like you know it's there's no protection it's negative protection there's gonna be burns there's

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.400
gonna be bruises and breaks and bumps griffin would you be more inclined to watch elantra

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:37.040
football league if the teams were coached by hologram of the late great vince lombardi

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:45.840
i mean probably travis would i be more entertained by it if it all took place on a spaceship

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:54.480
is that like what if when you went to it you got a million dollars for free would i be interested

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.720
in going yeah probably what if while i was there they gave me uh pizzas with lasagna inside the

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:07.520
crust yeah travis i'd probably be down i would probably be down with that oh just by going my

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.720
vertical leap gets a foot better yeah i think i could probably get interested in going to something

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.840
like that oh i can live forever because with these lfl tickets i'm sure i'm glad i bought these

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.920
