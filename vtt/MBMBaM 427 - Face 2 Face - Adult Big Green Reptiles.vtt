WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.720
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:29.720 --> 00:40.160
It's a new craze, hey good girls do you wanna just say hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

00:59.720 --> 01:24.480
Ladies and gentlemen, a guitar!

01:29.720 --> 01:43.720
Hi, hi that was John Roderick, and thank you, hey do you want, hey John can you come out for just one second, you don't have to say anything, but I just, Griffin if you could just say it to him in person.

01:43.720 --> 01:50.720
I wanna say thank you.

01:50.720 --> 02:01.720
Two, John Roderick and the Long Winter's Fuse are theme songs to the bar trophy on Pretty Days of Bed.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.720
John flew all the way to Seattle, so honored just to play that song.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.720
For the folks listening at home.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.720
Hello everybody and welcome, my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

02:13.720 --> 02:19.720
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy, if we don't do it we'll forget.

02:19.720 --> 02:25.720
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy.

02:25.720 --> 02:34.720
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

02:34.720 --> 02:51.720
For, for the folks listening at home, Justin and Travis and I just spent about 30 seconds shredding air guitars next to John as if we were showing him, this is the, this is the correct way to rock.

02:51.720 --> 02:58.720
And for those of you at home, we fucking nailed it.

02:58.720 --> 03:05.720
We were at the, Travis and I and our, our families, our brood, our brood.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.720
You were invited.

03:07.720 --> 03:12.720
We were at the Salish Lodge and Spa in Snoqualmie, Washington.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.720
No, we were in the Great Northern and Twin Peaks.

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
Right.

03:16.720 --> 03:22.720
Obviously that's part of the history of this place, but it is also like very good.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.720
Yeah.

03:23.720 --> 03:29.720
It's also, and you can tell that the people there have this attitude of like, yes, it was into a piece.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.720
It also smells nice.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.720
Yeah.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.720
And is constantly playing spa music.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.720
Yeah, it was like a very spa.

03:35.720 --> 03:41.720
It's like, there's nice things and it's, we just want to say this, not spooky.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Yeah.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.720
They really go out of their way.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.720
When you check in, they say, here's your keys and no ghosts.

03:47.720 --> 03:54.720
Just no ghosts. And you'll notice that key isn't a weird spirit key.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.720
It's just a card.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.720
Now everything that happens beyond the threshold of this building, if you see the tree wizard,

04:02.720 --> 04:07.720
it's been a long time since I've watched Twin Peaks.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.720
I wanted to say that they do lean into it in weird ways.

04:11.720 --> 04:17.720
There was, you know, the coffee that they have, like, this is how fucking fancy this place was.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
Pour over, thank you.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.720
Pour over coffee.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.720
Thank you.

04:20.720 --> 04:25.720
Or maybe we've just said that to everyone who lives in Seattle and they're like, there's another kind?

04:25.720 --> 04:30.720
On the bag it said, Twin Peaks coffee.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
Good start.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.720
Twin Peaks coffee, dark and mysterious.

04:35.720 --> 04:42.720
And then it said, the beans are not what they seem.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
That's okay.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.720
That's good.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.720
Twin Peaks already had a coffee thing.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.720
They already had a coffee thing.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.720
I'm going to drink this.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.720
So why don't you tell me what they are?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.720
They put beans in quotes.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
Beans in quotes.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
The beans.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.720
I was like, I'm going to put this in my body.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.720
Yeah, I'm going to put it in my body.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
They're beans, right?

05:02.720 --> 05:03.720
They're beans though, right?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
You ain't fucking with me.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.720
They're having fun here, but they're beans, aren't they?

05:06.720 --> 05:07.720
Okay.

05:07.720 --> 05:12.720
While you all were doing that this morning, I was flying here at a very early time and

05:12.720 --> 05:17.720
I saw an even better thing than the great, beautiful, majestic waterfall you all saw,

05:17.720 --> 05:22.720
which is the dude in front of me pull out the, like, entertainment screen, like literally

05:22.720 --> 05:27.720
throws his bag up overhead, sits down, rips out the entertainment screen, starts frantically

05:27.720 --> 05:34.720
searching and he finds Geostorm and he's like, yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
Geostorm.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
Fuck yes.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
Yes, they have it.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.720
They have Geostorm.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.720
They were funny.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.720
And it was the star of Geostorm.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.720
Fucking crazy for Geostorm.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.720
That was so funny.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
It was.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.720
I just enjoyed it a lot.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.720
He, almost as much as this dude, enjoyed Geostorm, which was a great deal.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.720
I watched Over a Lady's Shoulder.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.720
Isn't it the best being able to, like, see what people are doing on airplanes?

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
Oh, yeah.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
For sure.

06:03.720 --> 06:07.720
I watched Over a Lady's Shoulder and she watched the Mr. Rogers documentary, Won't You Be My

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
Neighbor?

06:08.720 --> 06:09.720
Yeah.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.720
At 4x speed.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.720
Yes.

06:11.720 --> 06:17.720
I want to find out what the hubbub is on this fool.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.720
Ain't going to spend a lot of time.

06:19.720 --> 06:26.720
I watched a dude watch Rampage and when he got to the point where the big monkey started

06:26.720 --> 06:32.720
fighting the big reptile, started fighting the big wolf, fast forwarded.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720
Too scary.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.720
Too scary.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
He was like, I get it, I get it.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

06:36.720 --> 06:41.720
Dude, like, when it was literally all done and the rock was quipping and he was like,

06:41.720 --> 06:42.720
play.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
And I was like, wait, hold on.

06:43.720 --> 06:48.720
Why are you watching this film?

06:48.720 --> 06:51.240
So this is time for the podcast.

06:51.240 --> 06:58.160
My mom commissioned and paid for a four foot wide artist rendering of a nude portrait of

06:58.160 --> 07:06.380
herself.

07:06.380 --> 07:10.640
And now it's hanging on the wall in her actual home where she lives.

07:10.640 --> 07:18.320
I'm about to move back to my hometown so I'll be in geographic proximity to this abomination.

07:18.320 --> 07:22.240
Is there any way I can get away with destroying it?

07:22.240 --> 07:24.680
How can I convince her this is wrong?

07:24.680 --> 07:26.040
And that's from Annie.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.880
Annie, are you okay?

07:28.880 --> 07:32.160
Annie, are you here?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
Okay.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.720
Hi, Annie.

07:34.720 --> 07:41.120
I want you to know, I hadn't thought of it before this moment, but it might be the greatest

07:41.120 --> 07:46.520
power move I've ever heard in my entire life that like, especially if you have someone

07:46.520 --> 07:52.360
else open the front door and then your mom's standing underneath it like this.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.640
Like the Peter Pan pose.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.640
Yeah.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.640
What's wrong?

07:56.640 --> 08:02.880
Especially if you have Airbnb plans for your, that's a big move.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.080
What's that second cousin Debra I haven't talked to in forever?

08:06.080 --> 08:09.080
You want to stay at my home for two weeks rent free?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.000
You got it.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.080
I guess what Travis is trying to say is Annie, why are you so threatened by your incredible

08:16.080 --> 08:21.560
powerful sexual mom?

08:21.560 --> 08:24.880
Your mom has power and she's owning it.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
Yes.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.640
Like a great mom should.

08:28.640 --> 08:33.440
And is it, let me just ask this, and this is rhetorical Annie, because of course this

08:33.440 --> 08:37.480
is in the eye of the beholder, but what if it's a good painting?

08:37.480 --> 08:38.480
Yeah.

08:38.480 --> 08:44.520
Have you looked at it a lot to check for brushwork and stuff?

08:44.520 --> 08:48.460
Maybe it's a great, great nude painting of your mom.

08:48.460 --> 08:49.460
You know what?

08:49.460 --> 08:53.360
Justin has made a good point because every nude painting of a subject throughout time

08:53.360 --> 08:57.440
has been a nude painting of someone's mom and I bet.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.200
That's not that what you just said is fucking complete nonsense.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
Makes no sense.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.200
What you just said was complete douchey toy stuff.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
That was literal nonsense.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.200
They can't make it up.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.840
No, no, stop for a second.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.840
Okay.

09:08.840 --> 09:13.360
But think, like think about what you're saying, bud, bud, think about what you're saying bud.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.680
They're nude portraits of Jesus's mom and everyone's okay with it.

09:16.680 --> 09:21.120
No, bud, bud, that's not what you said, bud.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.160
Bud, you said every nude portrait is someone's mom, bud.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.400
I said of a subject.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
I did say of a subject.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.400
Of a subject.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
You did.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.400
But I thought about it as I was saying it.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.400
Yeah.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.400
Okay.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
As a subject.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.600
What I need to know is why is your brother a garbage person?

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
I said it.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.600
I was right.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.200
I thought about it.

09:39.200 --> 09:45.160
There is a possibility that this is all okay because all that we know is that it's a four-foot

09:45.160 --> 09:46.280
wide portrait.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.920
Maybe it's just one inch tall.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.920
Yeah.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.880
It only catches the belly button.

09:51.880 --> 09:52.880
Yeah.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.880
Please enjoy this magic eye painting of my naked mom.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.800
Cross your eyes appropriately to enjoy.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.920
Oh, wait, hold on.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.280
Were you saying it's squished down?

10:02.280 --> 10:06.480
No, I'm saying that not every subject in a nude painting is somebody's mom.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.480
I don't understand why you're so strong.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.480
I don't know.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.480
It's for somebody.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
Okay.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
Sure.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.960
If you put your nose on this strip of painting, you can kind of see just like wicked tall.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.680
It's like the witness.

10:18.680 --> 10:23.080
If you stand on those stairs, then the one painting over here and the other one line

10:23.080 --> 10:27.880
up to make a naked picture of my mom.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.880
Don't destroy it.

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
It's art.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.880
Art.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.880
Obviously, it's art.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.880
You should buy it.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.640
You should buy it.

10:35.640 --> 10:41.160
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by—do y'all want a Yahoo?

10:41.160 --> 10:43.400
This one was sent in by Raimi.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
Thank you, Raimi.

10:44.400 --> 10:50.000
It's Yahoo Answers user Jonathan, who has negative five points this week.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.640
Oh, no!

10:52.640 --> 10:53.640
He's been a member—

10:53.640 --> 10:55.220
They get worse than not answering.

10:55.220 --> 10:58.280
He's been a member since July 6, 2015.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.560
He has eight points, and he lost five this week.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.600
Jonathan's having a tough, tough time with his Yahoo career.

11:06.600 --> 11:12.080
Jonathan asks, no dress code funeral?

11:12.080 --> 11:16.280
I am going to a funeral on Tuesday, and the family have said there is no dress code.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.240
Wear something that the deceased would have liked.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.080
I'm a 19-year-old male.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
What shall I wear?

11:21.080 --> 11:24.400
This is how I'm going to go.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.520
This is how I'm going to go.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.760
Wear whatever.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.920
Toss your peanut shells on the floor.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.280
No rules just right.

11:32.280 --> 11:36.040
The people working at the funeral home are going to, like, say, like, shitty things about

11:36.040 --> 11:37.600
you, like you're at Dick's Last Resort.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
It's going to be fucking hysterical.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.920
Put a big, like, condom hat on you.

11:40.920 --> 11:41.920
Yeah.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.920
I love it.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.720
This is—like, if you think about it, like, why—you would think that if we were truly

11:46.720 --> 11:54.360
respecting the dead, that the dress code would be, like, as comfortable as possible.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.640
Because like, if I'm dead, I think I'm the most comfortable, and I would like you to

11:57.640 --> 11:58.640
match.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.640
It's true.

11:59.640 --> 12:06.760
Listen, as good as a choice as this was for a live show to talk about death extensively,

12:06.760 --> 12:09.840
which I'm loving, ba-da-ba-ba-ba, I'm loving it.

12:09.840 --> 12:16.000
I want to—do want to get back to Griffin's point of there aren't any rules at a funeral,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.520
and I feel like nobody's going to know how to act.

12:18.520 --> 12:23.680
I feel like it might get kind of silly at the funeral, kind of maybe—the one thing

12:23.680 --> 12:27.320
I'm worried about, and I'm sure you've already guessed it, is pranks.

12:27.320 --> 12:32.240
That's the problem with no dress code, is it makes people feel like, so is this a prank

12:32.240 --> 12:36.480
encouraged environment, or—they didn't send out any rules about pranks, and I feel

12:36.480 --> 12:38.200
like it kind of left the door open.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.400
Man, let's bail.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.400
Let's bail.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.400
Let's get out of this question.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
No, it's good.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.920
I do want to read this comment from my favorite Lucy, who said, you said the family said

12:48.920 --> 12:51.040
where something the deceased would have liked.

12:51.040 --> 12:56.920
You have told us nothing about the deceased, so how the hell are we supposed to know?

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
19.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
19?

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
You sound 8.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
Whoa!

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
Their friend just died.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
This is actually a much deeper question.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
Who's to judge what the deceased would like?

13:03.920 --> 13:04.920
Yeah.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.920
Like, is it like, where's something that maybe finally we'll get, like, that's—oh,

13:08.920 --> 13:20.920
that they've got a ouija board set up, and just, no, no, no, yes, no, no, no, no, no,

13:20.920 --> 13:25.920
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

13:25.920 --> 13:26.920
no, no, no.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.920
Yes.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.920
Yes.

13:28.920 --> 13:29.920
Yeah.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.920
Yes.

13:30.920 --> 13:31.920
That's how they decide who gets in.

13:31.920 --> 13:36.400
This is the kind of bouncer at the door with a ouija board.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
Here's another question.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.680
Our neighbor built his kiddo a treehouse over the summer.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.060
It's very nice.

13:42.060 --> 13:48.500
It has a spiral staircase, cedar siding, a flat screen TV, its own Wi-Fi network, couches,

13:48.500 --> 13:52.000
chairs, and a big nice window.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
That's a house.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.960
This is a house that a tree got up on.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.320
A house that does not fear the flood.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.600
It has a big, nice window that looks directly

14:05.600 --> 14:09.280
into my nice, small window in my bathroom.

14:09.280 --> 14:14.280
It looks in at just the right angle.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.320
Does it?

14:17.320 --> 14:18.400
For what?

14:18.400 --> 14:19.840
Here's the question.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.480
Is this my problem?

14:21.480 --> 14:25.160
So far, I've treated it as theirs.

14:25.160 --> 14:30.160
It's a bold, a bold stance.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.080
Healthy.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.760
Is I'm not making eye contact,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.860
you are an acceptable solution.

14:36.860 --> 14:40.820
That's from you looking at me here in row G.

14:40.820 --> 14:42.840
And the first thing I would say is,

14:42.840 --> 14:44.920
you could treat it like their problem,

14:44.920 --> 14:46.720
it's still your butt.

14:46.720 --> 14:51.560
When someone was done designing your house,

14:51.560 --> 14:52.920
and I'm like, you're gonna put a window there,

14:52.920 --> 14:54.560
but then people can see into the bathroom,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.520
like, yeah, but what are the odds?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.360
Ah, shit, man.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.980
I do like the tall windows that we can all dream

14:59.980 --> 15:01.680
as we poop.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.980
I wish I was out there like a bird.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.640
I can't poop unless I wistfully watch a butterfly go by.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.480
You know this.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.400
And I think about what it would be like to be free.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.140
So where do you want the window?

15:15.140 --> 15:17.360
Well, I need to see my wishing star

15:17.360 --> 15:19.000
when I'm sitting.

15:19.000 --> 15:19.840
My special.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.280
For my one song.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.120
I need to.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.720
I gotta be able to pray to the man in the moon, don't I?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.600
Yo, this is bad.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.760
It's bad.

15:30.760 --> 15:34.000
Hey, one thing is curtains.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.560
For them or for you?

15:36.760 --> 15:39.720
You were there first, don't listen to him.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.280
It's, again, it's your butt.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.280
You are, you have everything to lose.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.200
It's just their eyes.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.640
It's just their eyes, and it's your butt.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.760
And it could be an attack.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.320
Like, it's not good for you to have your butt.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
If they see, that's curtains.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.160
That's metaphorically speaking.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.560
It's your butt is on the line.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.740
They have nothing to lose.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.480
You have to put up curtains.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.760
Can you, and wait for me to finish

16:12.760 --> 16:15.440
before you, like, chide me.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.560
Chainsaw, go to the tree.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.720
Let me fucking finish.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.320
You cut it across,

16:22.320 --> 16:24.720
maybe in like the midsection of the tree.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.440
And then you go a few feet down,

16:26.440 --> 16:28.320
and you make another clean cut.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.320
Karate kick that section you've just cut out.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.640
The tree falls down again,

16:32.640 --> 16:35.520
breaks the sight line to your toilet zone.

16:35.520 --> 16:40.520
I'm okay with the tree dying after that, actually.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.080
Are you okay with the neighbor dying?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.400
No, absolutely not.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.920
But then it would just become a shed at that point, right?

16:53.920 --> 16:57.400
If tree house, no, no, no,

16:57.400 --> 16:59.640
tree house fall down, become shed.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.640
But it doesn't fall down like, okay.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.920
Tree house fall down like a Donkey Kong, become shed.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.320
Tree house am shed.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.200
It's true.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.480
You could tell the neighbor,

17:12.480 --> 17:14.520
if you don't get some curtains,

17:14.520 --> 17:17.880
I'm gonna spin kick that goddamn house at that tree.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.720
And the thing is,

17:18.720 --> 17:21.400
nobody knows how hard anybody else can spin kick.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.520
They don't know if it's a hollow thread or not.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.040
You could be one of the rare people

17:26.040 --> 17:29.640
that can fly off your roof, jump off your roof,

17:29.640 --> 17:31.680
spin kick the house on the tree.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.320
I've never seen him spin kick before.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.160
He might.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.000
He might be able to.

17:35.000 --> 17:35.840
I don't know how hard he can spin kick.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.800
He ran a half marathon last year.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.160
I don't know.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.120
Came in 29th.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.480
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.320
Thank you, Merritt.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.680
Thank you, Merritt.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.040
It's Yahoo Answers user Katlee who asks,

17:49.040 --> 17:52.120
what happens when the teenage mutant ninja turtles

17:52.120 --> 17:53.480
become adults?

17:55.760 --> 17:58.040
Are they just mutant ninja turtles?

17:58.040 --> 18:03.040
You always hear about the last three words in the title.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.520
Is there anything about their whole shit

18:12.520 --> 18:14.600
that would change if they...

18:14.600 --> 18:16.000
I don't think of them as being

18:16.000 --> 18:17.880
between the ages of 13 and 19.

18:17.880 --> 18:21.360
They're gigantic, muscular, green monsters.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.440
And is it in turtle years?

18:23.440 --> 18:25.360
Who even knows at that point?

18:25.360 --> 18:26.200
They're two?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.520
Two?

18:27.520 --> 18:30.520
Or they might be 200 because tortoises go forever.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.200
They go a long time.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.200
This is the argument that I would make.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.840
Once they are at a point along their lifespan

18:39.840 --> 18:42.880
where they are no longer comfortable being called teenage.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.440
Well, for one, they may love it.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.440
I know that I would love if someone

18:47.440 --> 18:48.800
must look me for a teenager.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.320
When I get carded?

18:50.320 --> 18:52.000
Yeah, so flattering.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
But they may not necessarily like any of it.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
Like, they may not want to be mutants or ninjas or...

19:01.360 --> 19:02.520
I'm obviously not a turtle.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.360
How about this?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.160
How about instead of mutant ninja turtle,

19:05.160 --> 19:07.320
how about Donatello?

19:08.840 --> 19:11.320
How about there's only four of us,

19:11.320 --> 19:14.240
we're all named after painters, fuck.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.040
Just learn our names and say like,

19:17.040 --> 19:20.560
Raphael, you are cool, but rude.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.720
That's easy to remember.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.040
And he would say, yeah, I have a lot to work on.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.840
Yeah, I have been talking to somebody.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.960
Yeah, it's my struggle.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.600
Pizza, are you kidding me?

19:29.600 --> 19:30.760
With my acid reflux?

19:30.760 --> 19:31.600
No, thanks.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.640
You know what I wish people would pour down the sewers more?

19:35.640 --> 19:37.560
Is bisque.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.600
Drop that down in the sewer, yes.

19:40.600 --> 19:44.320
A shredder and the foot clan are terrorizing the city?

19:44.320 --> 19:45.720
Call the police.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.880
Yes, call the police.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.000
It's past nine o'clock.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.640
After nine o'clock.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.160
Are you kidding me?

19:52.160 --> 19:53.880
Survivors back.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.040
What?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.560
Survivors back, by the way, tonight.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.400
Catch it.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
I tell you what I feel bad for

20:01.560 --> 20:04.440
is the group that sings the theme song

20:04.440 --> 20:07.360
because you know it'll take them a bit.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.440
There'll be a lot of like,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.400
mutant ninja turtles.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.640
It'll be the P-I-N-G-O.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.400
Teen, damn it, Ryan.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.120
What the fuck?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.520
I just know the old way, so I'm good.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.360
What could they replace?

20:22.360 --> 20:24.280
Two syllables, they need two syllables.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.960
I mean adult, but that's not good.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.400
People who are doing their best.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.880
People who are doing their best.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.240
They are just people.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.400
Watch us accept them.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.640
Turtle power, fuck.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.120
Okay, that still is good.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.320
We're gonna, yeah.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.880
Do you think that it was,

20:39.880 --> 20:42.720
that the name built as they got older

20:42.720 --> 20:44.520
or that it was aspirational?

20:44.520 --> 20:46.000
That Splinter found them and said,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.080
someday you will be teenager ninja turtles.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.400
What about after that?

20:51.400 --> 20:52.440
Let's listen.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.680
Three of you.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.280
The sewers are terrible

20:56.280 --> 20:59.320
and you fight a guy that's made of swords.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.560
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

21:03.120 --> 21:05.000
You should be pretty,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.040
honestly, you were raised to this point by a rat.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.800
You should be pretty fucking gized

21:09.800 --> 21:11.000
about getting to teenage.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.640
Your dad's a rat, okay?

21:15.640 --> 21:20.040
Hey, hold on a second.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.960
Why do they wear masks?

21:22.960 --> 21:27.960
Who is gonna be like, who are those anonymous crusaders?

21:34.160 --> 21:39.160
I saw them at the market just the other day.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.680
No, couldn't be them.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.520
I'm friends with four human turtles

21:44.520 --> 21:46.200
that have ninja skills,

21:46.200 --> 21:47.760
but that can't be you.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.240
Not without the mask.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.240
You're in a suit.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.960
Can't be, you can't be the brave crusaders.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.600
Here you are applying for a loan.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.920
Couldn't be you.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.560
Ah, nice to pick you up.

22:07.560 --> 22:12.200
The Lyft app says Donatello, so yeah.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.400
Wait, you're almost ready.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.160
Your ninja training is complete.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.760
First, my students, I have to hide your identity.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.160
Like, the jig is up at this point.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.560
The ship has sailed.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.000
I had a Bigfoot encounter in high school.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.840
The problem is, now that I'm 30,

22:34.840 --> 22:36.520
I've noticed people start to get weird

22:36.520 --> 22:37.640
when I talk about it.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.200
Even when they brought up Bigfoot

22:42.200 --> 22:43.600
and how they believe in him.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.840
This happens a lot at the office.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.680
Is there...

22:49.960 --> 22:53.080
Is there any way not to sound crazy

22:53.080 --> 22:55.440
when talking about my BFE?

22:57.640 --> 23:00.200
Or should I retire this story?

23:00.200 --> 23:03.400
That's from encountered in East Lewis County.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.120
Are you here?

23:06.120 --> 23:06.960
All right.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.560
Does the conversation...

23:09.560 --> 23:12.480
Is Bigfoot here?

23:12.480 --> 23:14.720
I thought it was worth checking.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.000
No, we're good.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.320
Does the conversation go like this?

23:17.320 --> 23:18.920
Like, you overhear people talking at work,

23:18.920 --> 23:22.080
like, yeah, Bigfoot, I saw him crush five cars.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.440
And you're like, yeah, I saw Bigfoot too.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.640
I walked around with him and gave him some beef jerky

23:27.640 --> 23:28.560
and he got real mad.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.400
Like, wait, hold on.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.240
Wait, hold on, huh?

23:30.240 --> 23:31.080
Hold on.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.160
You didn't mean the monster truck, did you?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.480
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.160
They, listen,

23:38.160 --> 23:39.720
I hate to be the one to break this to you,

23:39.720 --> 23:43.080
but they tricked you into telling your Bigfoot story.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.080
They pretended to believe in Bigfoot

23:47.080 --> 23:48.720
so you would tell your Bigfoot story.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.200
You got catfished.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.440
You got Bigfushed.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.360
It happens.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.840
But they tricked you into telling your story,

23:56.840 --> 24:00.080
which I'm sorry, but that's what happened.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.480
Is it possible that when you started telling your story,

24:04.480 --> 24:06.160
and you're like, yeah, I met him,

24:06.160 --> 24:09.200
I met Bigfoot August 12th, 2001,

24:09.200 --> 24:11.520
and they were like, no way.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.280
I was with Bigfoot August 12th, 2001,

24:15.280 --> 24:17.000
and you were not there.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.040
Is there more than one Bigfoot?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.320
Yeah.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.160
All right, that's a consensus.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.800
Well, there's only one Bigfoot.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.720
There are many Sasquatches.

24:30.520 --> 24:34.560
There aren't.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.120
And this, I think, is the heart of the problem.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.200
I don't think,

24:39.920 --> 24:42.200
I don't think, maybe,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.280
it's not because you used to be a teen

24:44.280 --> 24:46.400
and it was adorable.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.520
It's that when you were telling the story before,

24:50.520 --> 24:53.720
it was the aughts, and everything was fucking chill.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.760
And everybody was, yeah, man, Obama's president?

24:55.760 --> 24:56.600
Maybe there's Bigfoots?

24:56.600 --> 24:58.160
I don't know, anyway.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.200
That's so funny.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.040
That's kooky.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.840
Now it's 2018, and somebody's like,

25:01.840 --> 25:02.840
hey, there are Bigfoots.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.040
I feel like I have to be like,

25:04.040 --> 25:05.120
no, there aren't.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.240
There aren't Bigfoots.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.080
Stop it.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.280
You're embarrassing yourself.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.120
Stop.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.760
Comfort breeds whimsy.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.240
Comfort breeds whimsy.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.080
I can't hide it.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.800
You can say, stop it.

25:15.800 --> 25:16.640
There aren't.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.480
Move on.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.320
Next thing.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.640
We're dealing with Bigfoot hook right now.

25:20.640 --> 25:24.480
We're in, yes, 1990, early 2000,

25:24.480 --> 25:26.240
we were young, Peter,

25:26.240 --> 25:28.480
but now we've gone on to be a lawyer,

25:28.480 --> 25:30.800
and we've forgotten what it is to believe.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.720
And now we can't accept there's a Bigfoot,

25:33.720 --> 25:36.200
because that means dreams come true.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.800
And as we all know, they do not.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.640
We need,

25:40.840 --> 25:42.440
we need Bigfoot.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.280
We need Bigfoot.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.960
Bigfoot to come kick in the door

25:44.960 --> 25:46.600
of our British grandma's house.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.440
Yes.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.600
Where we are staying with our wife and children,

25:49.600 --> 25:51.960
and there's an estranged thing going on there,

25:51.960 --> 25:55.160
and then the Bigfoot just beats the shit out of us.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.680
Uh-huh.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.160
It's been a while since I've seen Hook, but yes.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.560
He beats the shit out of us,

26:00.560 --> 26:02.040
and then he takes my glasses off,

26:02.040 --> 26:04.840
and he's like, there you are, Griffin.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.280
He squishes my face for like 10 minutes.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.640
Yep.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.440
You know how he does.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.240
You remember how he does it.

26:18.240 --> 26:22.200
You wanna do another Yahoo, or should I do a question?

26:22.200 --> 26:23.160
I can do a Yahoo.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.360
This feels like a trap.

26:24.360 --> 26:25.280
Is it a trap?

26:26.400 --> 26:27.240
No.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.800
Okay.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.600
This is a Yahoo that was sent in by Tim Hall.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.760
Thank you, Tim.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Oh no.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
It's Yahoo Answers user, Angela, who asks,

26:44.480 --> 26:46.880
you can't, if I get to the subject of the Yahoo,

26:46.880 --> 26:49.200
you're not allowed to jump in with one of your bits.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.240
I wouldn't jump in with any bits.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.080
Okay.

26:51.080 --> 26:55.280
Angela asks, why are human babies more foolish

26:55.280 --> 27:01.880
than most other animal babies?

27:01.880 --> 27:04.720
Other animal babies like kittens, pups, et cetera,

27:04.720 --> 27:07.120
can survive even if they're orphaned or injured,

27:07.120 --> 27:10.280
but human babies are sure to die if they get no help.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.880
Why is that so when humans are actually more intelligent,

27:13.880 --> 27:26.400
parentheses, have the sixth sense than other animals?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.840
But, hold on.

27:27.840 --> 27:33.200
My baby does have a bit of the telekinesis.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.640
A baby wolf is still going at him up.

27:35.640 --> 27:39.960
This baby, yes, that baby, the baby wolf.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.880
Not even a contact.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.600
Be it a fight or a court case, the baby will always lose.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.520
Baby wolf ate my psychic baby.

27:46.520 --> 27:47.360
Yep.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.160
How come my human baby is so weak

27:53.160 --> 27:55.240
compared to the powerful horse baby?

27:56.880 --> 27:59.320
Giraffe, land on feet, walk, walk, walk.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.320
Yeah.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.200
Baby, take like two years.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.040
Takes like a long, long, long time.

28:04.040 --> 28:07.000
I will also say I like that they use the word foolish

28:07.000 --> 28:09.640
in the subject line, which I don't feel

28:09.640 --> 28:11.000
that's what they're going for.

28:11.000 --> 28:11.840
Not accurate.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.240
Ah, you know how babies are so foolish

28:13.240 --> 28:14.480
and could be eaten by a wolf?

28:14.480 --> 28:16.920
Yeah, babies are always wild and out.

28:16.920 --> 28:17.760
Well, listen.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.520
You know those trickster babies

28:20.520 --> 28:21.360
who can't bend for themselves?

28:21.360 --> 28:23.280
You know trickster babies always getting silly?

28:23.280 --> 28:27.120
Do you guys remember when the baby hippo, Fiona, was born?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.680
Yes.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.480
I remember it vividly, sir.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.440
And we all thought as a nation

28:32.440 --> 28:38.840
that thing could really kick my baby's ass.

28:38.840 --> 28:43.440
If there were 10 human babies versus one baby hippo, Fiona,

28:43.440 --> 28:46.280
a hundred, how many would it take?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.280
One brave baby.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.440
That's why I've been training BB accordingly.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.040
Every day I show her a picture of Fiona and go,

28:57.040 --> 28:58.360
not today.

28:58.360 --> 29:02.840
You don't know that the animal would eat the baby.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.320
Like, I think that all animals would,

29:06.320 --> 29:07.440
if I've learned anything from books

29:07.440 --> 29:09.200
is that the animal would raise the baby.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.040
Yes.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.280
A hundred percent of the time.

29:11.280 --> 29:15.280
A hundred percent of the time wild animal finds free baby.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.600
It says sick free baby.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.960
Oh, well, I'm not going to waste this, they say.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.520
Eventually he'll be able to explain to other humans

29:22.520 --> 29:25.880
to like not take, like not colonize my land

29:25.880 --> 29:27.200
or whatever it is animals do.

29:27.200 --> 29:31.160
And like Tarzan books or happy feet, happy feet,

29:31.160 --> 29:33.320
whatever you want to raise the baby.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.040
One exception, if I can jump in.

29:35.040 --> 29:35.880
Yeah.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.120
Do you remember the good joke?

29:37.120 --> 29:39.200
That's like, I didn't go like my baby.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.040
Do you remember him?

29:40.040 --> 29:43.480
Yeah, yeah, that was a, that was a scam

29:43.480 --> 29:50.480
because the dingo raised the baby to adulthood,

29:50.480 --> 29:54.080
but then was embarrassed that he hadn't brought the baby back.

29:54.080 --> 29:58.320
He realized, he realized that he should have.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.560
And then later Meryl Streep was like at Starbucks

30:01.560 --> 30:02.520
and then Bruce is like,

30:02.520 --> 30:03.760
anyway, do you want to drink?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.000
Woof, woof, woof.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.160
She was like, you look like exactly like my baby's son.

30:08.160 --> 30:11.000
And the guy was like, no, I was raised by dingoes actually.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.160
It's like, it's pretty chill.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.120
So what you're saying is there's a circumstance

30:15.120 --> 30:16.920
in which someone came to where the baby had been

30:16.920 --> 30:18.680
and there were dingoes there and they're like,

30:18.680 --> 30:19.520
have you seen a baby?

30:19.520 --> 30:22.840
And they're like, no, dingo ate your baby.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.200
Dingo ate your baby.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.360
Yeah, one of the dingoes ate the baby.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.640
And then the baby dingo's like, indeed.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.000
Yeah, they totally did.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.720
They did, check out my whiskers, anyway.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.320
Wait, how old is this baby?

30:35.320 --> 30:36.600
He's 17 years old.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.880
Always be my baby.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.000
Yeah, dingo ate your baby or whatever.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.760
They let me watch MTV, so.

30:43.760 --> 30:48.760
Yeah, I get to have, dingo mom lets me have fruit rollups,

30:49.240 --> 30:51.240
basically whatever I want.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.920
So I'm just gonna stay with dingo mom.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.320
I haven't had to go to driver's ed in a while now, so.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.360
I did not think that dumb dingo ate your baby reference

30:59.360 --> 31:01.520
was gonna give us so much material.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.360
One could argue it didn't.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.200
Sure.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.280
So, Griffin, do you have any more yahoos?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
Let him have this.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.680
Start another yahoo, bro.

31:16.680 --> 31:21.680
Say anything.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.720
I've got a yahoo here that was sent in by.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.760
Say what's in your mind.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.920
Say what's in your mind.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.840
Say what's in your mind.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.520
Say what's in your mind.

31:38.520 --> 31:46.520
so

31:46.520 --> 31:48.520
No, stop, you'll fuck me up.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.520
On the back beat.

31:49.520 --> 32:01.520
I want a munch!

32:01.520 --> 32:04.520
I want a munch!

32:04.520 --> 32:10.520
I want two munches!

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
This is Munch Squad.

32:11.520 --> 32:15.520
It's a podcast within a podcast.

32:15.520 --> 32:22.520
About the latest and greatest in fast food inventions.

32:22.520 --> 32:27.520
You guys know Dunkin' Donuts?

32:27.520 --> 32:30.520
No more.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.520
Sorry, they're closing all the Dunkin' Donuts.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
No, just kidding.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.520
Are you for real?

32:35.520 --> 32:38.520
Nah, bud.

32:38.520 --> 32:44.520
They're changing the name of it.

32:44.520 --> 32:48.520
And this is not when IHOP was like, we're IHOP.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.520
And everybody was like, fuck off.

32:50.520 --> 32:53.520
Can we brief the version?

32:53.520 --> 32:54.520
That was real, right?

32:54.520 --> 32:57.520
And everybody was like, hey, that's really bad.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.520
And they were like, yeah, can you imagine?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.520
J.J. Simmons, no.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.520
Can I also just say, I also like the way that you started it.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.520
Because it made me think, what if there was a fast food agent who was like, you know what?

33:09.520 --> 33:10.520
We're done.

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
Oh, are you going bankrupt?

33:11.520 --> 33:12.520
No, we're doing great.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
But you know what?

33:13.520 --> 33:14.520
You deserve us.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.520
I was going to say, we've done everything we could think of.

33:17.520 --> 33:20.520
We can't think of any other weird donuts.

33:20.520 --> 33:27.520
Nah, this is Dunkin' Donuts is no more.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.520
Welcome to the stage.

33:29.520 --> 33:33.520
Not to this stage, sort of the world stage.

33:33.520 --> 33:42.520
Dunkin'.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.520
All brands are so bad.

33:46.520 --> 33:50.520
Do y'all have Dunkin' here?

33:50.520 --> 33:52.520
See, you don't have a fucking horse in this race.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.520
You don't give a shit.

33:54.520 --> 34:00.520
Man, I wish I had a tiny piece of paper that I could just write down what I think their explanation for the thing is,

34:00.520 --> 34:05.520
feel it in an envelope, and then open it back up when you're done reading it.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.520
Okay, so America Runs on Dunkin'.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.520
That's the tagline.

34:09.520 --> 34:16.520
And with customers around the world naturally and affectionately referring to the brand as Dunkin',

34:16.520 --> 34:22.520
in recognition of this relationship as one of the many steps to transform itself into the premier beverage-led,

34:22.520 --> 34:29.520
on-the-go brand, the company today unveiled its new branding at its global franchisee convention.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.520
I bet that's a fucking party.

34:33.520 --> 34:39.520
That officially recognizes its name as simply Dunkin'.

34:39.520 --> 34:45.520
So, when it says beverage-led, is that bullshit?

34:45.520 --> 34:49.520
The cups just say D-N-K-N on them now.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.520
Oh my god.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.520
It's like a fucking social network.

34:53.520 --> 34:59.520
In case the coffee is so delicious that you want to buy their stocks.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.520
Somebody probably does buy the stock of Dunkin' Donuts.

35:03.520 --> 35:09.520
The brand tested the new logo extensively, including on exterior signage at Dunkin' locations,

35:09.520 --> 35:13.520
featuring this next-generation design concept over the past year.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.520
So let's check in with...

35:14.520 --> 35:17.520
I've never heard you so defeated by a munch squad before.

35:17.520 --> 35:24.520
Let's chuck in with Dunkin' brand CEO and Dunkin' U.S. President David Hoffman.

35:24.520 --> 35:30.520
Hi, I'm David Hoffman, and I'm the president of Dunkin'.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.520
Damn, that is a good title, though.

35:32.520 --> 35:36.520
I bet this was his call, right?

35:36.520 --> 35:38.520
I'm so good on the court.

35:38.520 --> 35:43.520
Yeah, I want to be officially recognized as the president of Dunkin'.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.520
Not Dunking, Dunkin'.

35:46.520 --> 35:53.520
Our new branding is one of the many things we're doing as part of our blueprint for growth to modernize.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
You shrank it.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.520
You shrank the name.

35:57.520 --> 36:01.520
To modernize the Dunkin' experience for our customers.

36:01.520 --> 36:06.520
From our next-generation restaurants to our menu innovation, on-the-go ordering, and value offerings,

36:06.520 --> 36:10.520
all delivered at the speed of Dunkin'.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.520
I don't know what that means.

36:12.520 --> 36:20.520
We believe our efforts to transform Dunkin' while still embracing our incredible heritage.

36:20.520 --> 36:30.520
What do you think that means?

36:30.520 --> 36:33.520
When they discovered the Dead Sea Doughnuts.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.520
Remember our proud heritage?

36:35.520 --> 36:39.520
A selling dough to people after we fried it?

36:39.520 --> 36:47.520
Do you remember when we found that Dunkin' Doughnuts in a gas station last January and it was still called Dunkin' Doughnuts?

36:47.520 --> 36:52.520
What a proud heritage that was.

36:52.520 --> 36:56.520
Do you think the CEO of the yo-yo company does this reading and is going,

36:56.520 --> 36:58.520
wait, hold on.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
Hey, hold on.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
Aren't we still Dunkin'?

37:00.520 --> 37:01.520
Aren't we Dunkin'?

37:01.520 --> 37:02.520
We're Dunkin'.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.520
Are we Dunkin'?

37:03.520 --> 37:05.520
Fuck.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.520
So they've, oh my God, the story.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.520
They are doing so much apologizing for this.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.520
Like they know how bad it is.

37:14.520 --> 37:18.520
There's literally a segment on here of this like very long story.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.520
Probably the longest I've ever seen on QSR.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.520
Dunkin' to remain sweet.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.520
It's a quick service question for the publication.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.520
Sure, sure, sure.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.520
Dunkin' to remain sweet on doughnuts.

37:29.520 --> 37:33.520
Although the word doughnuts will no longer appear in the logo or branding,

37:33.520 --> 37:39.520
doughnuts will remain a significant focus of the brand as the number one retailer of doughnuts in America,

37:39.520 --> 37:45.520
selling more than 2.9 billion doughnuts along with local favorites.

37:45.520 --> 37:49.520
So guests know they'll be able to find the top selling doughnuts and fun seasonal varieties

37:49.520 --> 37:52.520
no matter which Dunkin' location they visit.

37:52.520 --> 37:59.520
So here's what I, I see what they're going with sort of where they want to sell other things.

37:59.520 --> 38:04.520
So they want to change the name and they want to expand the brand.

38:04.520 --> 38:10.520
I think it's weird that they're like what's the best way to sum up what we do?

38:10.520 --> 38:20.520
It's kind of like the number one thing more so than doughnuts is we want to keep the pride tradition

38:20.520 --> 38:24.520
of taking one thing and putting it in a liquid.

38:24.520 --> 38:29.520
The one thing that we want people to know that they're going to come in here and do is take a solid thing

38:29.520 --> 38:35.520
and put it in a wet thing and then consume the result of that action.

38:35.520 --> 38:39.520
That is still a big part of our heritage and our brand.

38:39.520 --> 38:44.520
Sure. Also Dunkin' and that still sucks to say it like that.

38:44.520 --> 38:49.520
And the fact that I have to do it for the rest of my life bores me out in a huge way.

38:49.520 --> 38:55.520
You can't say but we still love doughnuts though when you've just struck doughnuts from your name.

38:55.520 --> 39:00.520
When you've like erased the fact that you ever made doughnuts in your entire life.

39:00.520 --> 39:06.520
If the old spaghetti factory was like we're just the old factory now but our spaghetti is still dope.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.520
But we still love spaghetti.

39:07.520 --> 39:10.520
We're crazy about this stuff.

39:10.520 --> 39:18.520
I just like this idea of like somewhere like the CEO who was like well we're number one in doughnuts so we beat that.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.520
We beat that.

39:19.520 --> 39:37.520
Now what we haven't beaten is the moistening of dry things.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.520
Oh you cards.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.520
Boy howdy that was a lot of fun.

39:41.520 --> 39:47.520
Hey baby I hear the blues a calling toss salads and scrambled eggs.

39:47.520 --> 39:54.520
We didn't do hey we didn't do that at all during the show and I just edited it and I felt like such a piece of shit.

39:54.520 --> 40:01.520
Because I didn't we didn't do and everybody needs that joke at a Seattle live show and we didn't fucking give it to them.

40:01.520 --> 40:07.520
And so they all left you know with blue balls.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
Quite stylish.

40:08.520 --> 40:09.520
Quite stylish.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.520
So our first sponsor is Casper.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.520
Casper is wonderful.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.520
They make quality mattresses.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.520

Yeah there is a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.520
They are really great mattresses.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.520
We have one on our guest room that I've slept on a couple of times.

40:30.520 --> 40:36.520
Every time we have guests in town they they sleep over and we always get just rave reviews.

41:00.520 --> 41:05.520

41:05.520 --> 41:12.520
Okay wine is basically scrambled grapes.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.520

41:25.520 --> 41:30.520

42:46.520 --> 42:50.520
I can't wait for all the things 24 will hold for you.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.520
Ah man I heard the new season's going to be so tight.

42:52.520 --> 42:56.520
Jack's back and this time he's got three guns.

42:56.520 --> 43:01.520
Here's to the first of a lifetime of birthdays together because you're the plan.

43:01.520 --> 43:06.520
I love you, your cute face and your cute butt.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.520
That is all. Namaste.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.520
P.S. We're dogs now and I can't stress that enough.

43:10.520 --> 43:11.520
Bow wow for now.

43:11.520 --> 43:17.520
I don't even want to say when they wanted this birthday message but we fucked up.

43:17.520 --> 43:21.520
Don't focus on that. Focus on the really good 24 bit that was in there.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.520
That's what people are going to leave.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.520
Jack's back baby.

43:28.520 --> 43:30.520
Jack's back baby on this one.

43:30.520 --> 43:35.520
I got a message for Lovebug and it's from Sweet and it says hey Lovebug it's Sweet.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.520
I wanted to say that I love you.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.520
You're so dang cute and I can't wait to see you again.

43:40.520 --> 43:45.520
I hope this sweet message read by some of our favorite brothers brings a smile to your face.

43:45.520 --> 44:00.520
That is very cute and beautiful but I am now obsessed with the idea that across the nation hundreds, perhaps thousands of lovers just looked at their partner and said oh yeah that was me.

44:00.520 --> 44:02.520
That was me for you for sure.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.520
That is for you.

44:04.520 --> 44:12.520
I also love how it says some of our favorite brothers reflecting the fact Travis is not here because of the parachute accident.

44:12.520 --> 44:17.520
I miss Travis so much and folks please don't try to eat an entire parachute.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.520
It's bad for you.

44:19.520 --> 44:21.520
It's bad for your body, your human body.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.520
I can't wait to get back to this fucking show.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.520
Yeah for sure.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.520
Before that though thank you to everybody who came out to our shows in the Pacific Northwest.

44:28.520 --> 44:29.520
It was super super fun.

44:29.520 --> 44:32.520
We had a really really good time on tour this time.

44:32.520 --> 44:35.520
Hey baby I hear the fans are calling.

44:35.520 --> 44:38.520
Toss tickets and let me try again.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.520
Oh yeah.

44:39.520 --> 44:48.520
Hey baby I hear the fans are calling. Toss tickets and scrambled bits because we do different bits.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.520
Yeah we do.

44:53.520 --> 44:57.520
I'm bailiff Jesse Thorn and justice is within your reach.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.520
My mom refuses to take my phone calls.

45:00.520 --> 45:04.520
My boyfriend says I should take our cats with me to graduate school but I think he should keep them.

45:04.520 --> 45:08.520
In the court of Judge John Hodgman, justice rules.

45:08.520 --> 45:12.520
My partner's board game collection is out of control.

45:12.520 --> 45:15.520
My sister won't stop stealing my clothes.

45:15.520 --> 45:18.520
I'm Judge John Hodgman. I'm tough but fair.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
Tough but fair.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.520
I'll bring you justice and I'm only a click away.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
Tipping.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.520
Automotive etiquette.

45:24.520 --> 45:25.520

45:41.520 --> 45:49.520
I want to do a Yahoo sent in by everyone and it's not like, seriously I got this from like 30 different people.

45:49.520 --> 45:59.520
I don't know that it's going to be the richest like conversation vein for me but it has 82 answers which is by far the most I've ever seen on a Yahoo before.

45:59.520 --> 46:02.520
I want to explore some of them. Thank you for sending this in.

46:02.520 --> 46:05.520
It's an anonymous Yahoo user.

46:05.520 --> 46:08.520
I'm going to call them.

46:08.520 --> 46:13.520
Duncan asks.

46:13.520 --> 46:21.520
Duncan asks, how are you able to be on Yahoo every morning and not work for a living?

46:21.520 --> 46:28.520
Now, that is of course, that's an email that Griffin gets daily.

46:28.520 --> 46:35.520
It took me a bit to decipher this question whether it was saying, this website is so delectable.

46:35.520 --> 46:39.520
I sit down at my desk at work booted up on my computer.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.520
Oh no, it's five o'clock.

46:41.520 --> 46:47.520
I've been on Yahoo all day looking at all of my great friends telling great answers to each other.

46:47.520 --> 46:52.520
But the other side of this is like, how can you be on Yahoo and not be inspired to have a job?

46:52.520 --> 46:59.520
I think or how do you all have time must be because you're unemployed. Any of them are bad.

46:59.520 --> 47:02.520
Let's start digging in.

47:02.520 --> 47:12.520
An anonymous Yahoo user top answer says, because poking fun at this shit show of a liberal circle jerk is my job.

47:12.520 --> 47:20.520
I'm Damien Yahoo.

47:20.520 --> 47:34.520
Jake McClake says, not every morning, but many I'm on sick leave because of an operation and blood clots.

47:34.520 --> 47:49.520
Retired old Sarge says, because I was military for almost 33 years and I was smart enough to start my own business and hire people who I can trust to be there and take care of it for me.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.520
What?

47:51.520 --> 47:58.520
I built a successful small business where I could hire trustworthy people so I could be on this fucking tasty website.

47:58.520 --> 48:04.520
Back in 1970, I started my own business because I knew one day I'd want to be on Yahoo all the time.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.520
Can we go back to the person who said this is their job?

48:07.520 --> 48:10.520
Because how far does that get you?

48:10.520 --> 48:18.520
That was Griffin.

48:18.520 --> 48:23.520
Yahoo answers B says, okay, Yahoo police.

48:23.520 --> 48:25.520
This person is your boss.

48:25.520 --> 48:27.520
This person is not trying to nark on you.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.520
They're just making conversation.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.520
Yahoo answers user E says, it's not the morning everywhere.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.520
Time zones, bruh.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.520
What?

48:37.520 --> 48:41.520
I only get on this website at 3 p.m.

48:41.520 --> 48:48.520
Jeffrey says, I'm happily retired and there's Jeffrey's picture so like you know he's legit.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.520
Y'all can't enjoy that but it's good.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.520
A lot of people are retired.

48:53.520 --> 49:02.520
I broke a few bones, got shot a few times, just a few bad days at my office and I do it again.

49:02.520 --> 49:11.520
I love this one too because there are people who don't understand like you can post something and then see it hours later.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.520
Someone responded, news flash, it's the afternoon.

49:14.520 --> 49:21.520
EIEIO says, I am largely retired except for some board of directors work in investment management.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.520
No, it's not true.

49:23.520 --> 49:29.520
What that was was a lie you said.

49:29.520 --> 49:33.520
Lots of people on here still work.

49:33.520 --> 49:38.520
Justin time says, I run heavy equipment, go to work at 7 a.m.

49:38.520 --> 49:43.520
Yeah, that's what they said.

49:43.520 --> 49:47.520
I don't even comprehend this question.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.520
All right, we're running short on time.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.520
We should do the audience questions.

49:51.520 --> 49:55.520
The way we do this now, please don't move a muscle.

49:55.520 --> 49:59.520
There are asps everywhere.

49:59.520 --> 50:03.520
Under each of your seat is one discrete asp.

50:03.520 --> 50:06.520
Some of them lazier than others.

50:06.520 --> 50:09.520
We have some submissions that people sent in.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.520
We got some one sentence briefings.

50:12.520 --> 50:16.520
We're going to call out names and seat numbers and you're going to come up to these microphones.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.520
Can we get house lights turned up, please?

50:18.520 --> 50:20.520
I don't know who I'm looking at.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.520
Paul, please.

50:21.520 --> 50:24.520
Can we turn boy lights down a little bit?

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
Hey, what's up?

50:26.520 --> 50:27.520
Over there.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.520
Hey, what's your name?

50:28.520 --> 50:29.520
Sam.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.520
Hi, Sam.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.520
I use they, them pronouns.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.520
Thank you so much.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.520
Hello, Sam.

50:33.520 --> 50:44.520
And my question is, well, so on the way here to get to my car, I walked through a giant spider web.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.520
Not for the first time.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.520
Were you home right now?

50:47.520 --> 50:52.520
I was trying to do a fucking no doubt joke, but it didn't come to me in time and I apologize.

50:52.520 --> 50:56.520
Can we get the audience mic turned up a little bit so we can hear Sam better?

50:56.520 --> 50:57.520
Thank you.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.520
Sorry.

50:58.520 --> 50:59.520
Oh, no.

50:59.520 --> 51:05.520
So to get into my car, my car is often like surrounded by spider webs and usually I'm pretty good.

51:05.520 --> 51:07.520
But sometimes.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.520
Can I break down that sentence?

51:09.520 --> 51:11.520
Hold on, Sam.

51:11.520 --> 51:14.520
What are you good at?

51:14.520 --> 51:16.520
Are you in the forbidden forest?

51:16.520 --> 51:20.520
Is there like an incommiserate amount of spider webs compared with like other cars near your car?

51:20.520 --> 51:25.520
Or do you just only work one day every thousand years?

51:25.520 --> 51:30.520
Anyway, I disappear like Brigadoon.

51:30.520 --> 51:37.520
No, it's like it's like a parking spot and an assigned spot and like there's like a pole next to it says fighters will like just.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.520
They'll strip on it.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.520
Is it a sign?

51:41.520 --> 51:42.520
It's gross.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.520
Is it an assigned parking?

51:44.520 --> 51:45.520
Yes, I cannot escape.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.520
I've tried.

51:47.520 --> 51:55.520
No, so today to get here after work, I went to my car and walked right into the biggest one I've ever seen.

51:55.520 --> 52:00.520
And people started laughing because apparently a family had been like watching from their apartment.

52:00.520 --> 52:05.520
And I heard one of them say, she walked right into it.

52:05.520 --> 52:06.520
Wow.

52:06.520 --> 52:16.520
So I'm just wondering, like, can I pull it off somehow or is there something I can do to mitigate everything about that?

52:16.520 --> 52:20.520
Maybe it's like, yeah, like cotton candy.

52:20.520 --> 52:23.520
That's where my mind immediately went.

52:23.520 --> 52:24.520
To eating it?

52:24.520 --> 52:26.520
To eating the web?

52:26.520 --> 52:30.520
To make it look like this is where I left my cotton candy yesterday and I'm just picking it up.

52:30.520 --> 52:32.520
That's good.

52:32.520 --> 52:44.520
No matter what move you do to like, like to react to the web, if you come up snapping, it's going to look very like you were starting a dance in a bad way.

52:44.520 --> 52:47.520
But then you're like, back with it, you know?

52:47.520 --> 52:51.520
Maybe as you run into the spider web, you just loudly announce, I'm helping him move.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
Yeah.

52:52.520 --> 52:53.520
Come with me.

52:53.520 --> 52:58.520
What I did is I backed up and I looked at the spider and I said, oh, sorry.

52:58.520 --> 52:59.520
That's great.

52:59.520 --> 53:00.520
That was really nice.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.520
Right.

53:02.520 --> 53:06.520
Do you have an ongoing relationship with this spider?

53:06.520 --> 53:07.520
It's hard to say.

53:07.520 --> 53:08.520
They all look alike.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.520
Do they?

53:09.520 --> 53:10.520
Whoa.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.520
Whoa, hey.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
Whoa, Sam.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.520
Whoa.

53:14.520 --> 53:22.520
Does the spider ever leave messages like, some Jetta.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.520
Stupid.

53:24.520 --> 53:36.520
You could start carrying devil sticks with you to your car and then before you get in, just give it a quick like, and that'll usually clear it out and you look super fucking cool doing it.

53:36.520 --> 53:37.520
So cool.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.520
So cool.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.520
That's like nine really good suggestions.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.520
Does that help?

53:44.520 --> 53:45.520
Does that help?

53:45.520 --> 53:46.520
Thank you so much, Sam.

53:46.520 --> 53:50.520
Thank you.

53:50.520 --> 53:51.520
Hi, I'm Jessica.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.520
Hi, Jessica.

53:52.520 --> 53:53.520
Hi, Jessica.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.520
This is my question.

53:54.520 --> 53:55.520
Sure.

53:55.520 --> 53:59.520
Oh, I like that gentle lead in.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.520
In case you didn't know.

54:01.520 --> 54:06.520
So I know that some or all of you have had GI issues and my questions relate to that.

54:06.520 --> 54:11.520
Me.

54:11.520 --> 54:15.520
So my husband seems to be developing a problem with dairy.

54:15.520 --> 54:18.520
He loves pizza.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.520
And it destroys him.

54:20.520 --> 54:21.520
Sure.

54:21.520 --> 54:35.520
We have a two year old, and when I come home with a two year old and I say go find daddy, the first place she looks is the bathroom.

54:35.520 --> 54:40.520
Kids do the most hurtful things.

54:40.520 --> 54:44.520
Kids do the truest things.

54:44.520 --> 54:48.520
To avoid any possible future embarrassments.

54:48.520 --> 54:55.520
What can I do to pizza to make my husband pizza lover never want it again?

54:55.520 --> 54:59.520
Oh,

54:59.520 --> 55:00.520
wait, hold on.

55:00.520 --> 55:01.520
Sorry.

55:01.520 --> 55:02.520
Most important question.

55:02.520 --> 55:07.520
Is your husband here?

55:07.520 --> 55:11.520
I appreciate you wanting to give him agency and putting himself on blast in that moment.

55:11.520 --> 55:13.520
That was very kind of you said.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.520
Maybe I watch him go.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.520
Super excited.

55:16.520 --> 55:19.520
Like, that's me.

55:19.520 --> 55:23.520
Pizza mistake person.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.520
Jessica, I gave him fair warning.

55:26.520 --> 55:27.520
Okay.

55:27.520 --> 55:32.520
I guess I was kind of hoping your question would end with.

55:32.520 --> 55:37.520
So what are some great fun time tested dairy free recipes for pizza?

55:37.520 --> 55:43.520
But your question was, how do I ruin pizza?

55:43.520 --> 55:47.520
Which is I guess another approach to it.

55:47.520 --> 55:58.520
And also you did phrase it not like how do I ruin a pizza I make for my husband, but rather how do I ruin that pizza concept of pizza?

55:58.520 --> 56:04.520
You ever see a, Hey, y'all ever seen that video?

56:04.520 --> 56:05.520
It's a new segment.

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
I'm a Bim Bam.

56:06.520 --> 56:12.520
Hey, y'all see that video and it's like a security camera and it's the pizza delivery person.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.520
The pizza falls out of the box.

56:13.520 --> 56:17.520
They really quickly scoop it back up and put it in the box to give it.

56:17.520 --> 56:23.520
What if we opened a chain of pizza restaurants that did that a hundred percent of the time?

56:23.520 --> 56:31.520
And it was specifically catered to people whose partners had lactose intolerance or some sort of G.I. issue, but still loved the pizza.

56:31.520 --> 56:36.520
But they won't after they see what we do to it.

56:36.520 --> 56:40.520
There have to be pizzas without cheese on it, right?

56:40.520 --> 56:43.520
You got to be able to make a pizza without cheese.

56:43.520 --> 56:48.520
I mean, Daiya cheese is legit, but that's not funny.

56:48.520 --> 56:49.520
All right.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.520
There's so many options, but you want to hurt pizza.

56:52.520 --> 56:54.520
And so that's where we are.

56:54.520 --> 56:55.520
Have you?

56:55.520 --> 56:57.520
Oh, you got to eat it all in front of your husband.

56:57.520 --> 56:58.520
Sorry.

56:58.520 --> 56:59.520
Go on.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.520
Pizza the Hut, Spaceball.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.520
Too scary.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.520
Very disgusting.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.520
Made of pizza.

57:05.520 --> 57:07.520
A man of pizza.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.520
No, thank you.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.520
I can't eat pizza again.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.520
I hate it.

57:10.520 --> 57:16.520
And he'll order out for you, which I still don't know what that means.

57:16.520 --> 57:21.520
Was that kind of a fun Spaceballs reference?

57:21.520 --> 57:27.520
It seemed like it went over super good.

57:27.520 --> 57:33.520
But now we know next time you want to make a Spaceballs reference to put it right back in your pocket.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.520
It's good.

57:34.520 --> 57:36.520
We have to trot those out because I didn't know and I was curious.

57:36.520 --> 57:40.520
Yeah, I had 18 throughout the course of this episode and I thought I didn't know.

57:40.520 --> 57:44.520
And then you tested the waters and I appreciate that.

57:44.520 --> 57:45.520
You can't.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.520
I just got to know you that well.

57:47.520 --> 57:51.520
You're not powerful enough to ruin pizza.

57:51.520 --> 57:52.520
None of us are.

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
I'm not.

57:53.520 --> 57:54.520
They're not.

57:54.520 --> 57:55.520
None of us are.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.520
But maybe if we all work together.

57:57.520 --> 57:58.520
To ruin pizza.

57:58.520 --> 58:01.520
Everybody clap your hands to kill pizza forever.

58:01.520 --> 58:02.520
Hey, y'all.

58:02.520 --> 58:05.520
Why are you clapping?

58:05.520 --> 58:07.520
It's forever.

58:07.520 --> 58:11.520
We don't have much left.

58:11.520 --> 58:15.520
A rat got famous for dragging it.

58:15.520 --> 58:24.520
And that fucking afternoon, all of America was still like, I'll have a pizza.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.520
I'll take one pizza.

58:26.520 --> 58:28.520
I'll have what the rat's having.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
For sure.

58:29.520 --> 58:30.520
And you know what I'm willing to bet?

58:30.520 --> 58:32.520
Sales went up.

58:32.520 --> 58:33.520
Jacked through the roof.

58:33.520 --> 58:36.520
That rat made people hungry for pizza.

58:36.520 --> 58:39.520
But you're going to destroy pizza.

58:39.520 --> 58:41.520
Doubt it.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.520
Some mutant Ninja Turtles made pizza cool.

58:44.520 --> 58:46.520
Paul, can we get some pizza out here or what?

58:46.520 --> 58:47.520
Yeah, I know.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.520
I'm dying for it.

58:49.520 --> 58:50.520
Does that help?

58:50.520 --> 58:56.520
Probably not because we went pretty aggro on you.

58:56.520 --> 58:57.520
No, but thank you.

58:57.520 --> 58:58.520
Thank you.

58:58.520 --> 59:06.520
And then let's get one more lined up.

59:06.520 --> 59:10.520
CJ, mezzanine, 34, row X, seat 9.

59:10.520 --> 59:12.520
And Jazz.

59:12.520 --> 59:13.520
Jazz.

59:13.520 --> 59:14.520
Hello, Jazz.

59:14.520 --> 59:15.520
Hello.

59:15.520 --> 59:16.520
How's it going?

59:16.520 --> 59:17.520
How's it going?

59:17.520 --> 59:18.520
It's going all right.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.520
I'm having a good time.

59:19.520 --> 59:20.520
Well, good.

59:20.520 --> 59:21.520
Good.

59:21.520 --> 59:22.520
Cool.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.520
Glad you're here.

59:23.520 --> 59:24.520
What's up?

59:24.520 --> 59:26.520
This is a question about my great grandmother, Dolores.

59:26.520 --> 59:27.520
Awesome.

59:27.520 --> 59:30.520
Oh, thank you for clarifying.

59:30.520 --> 59:32.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:32.520 --> 59:35.520
And her relationship with Ryan Stiles.

59:35.520 --> 59:36.520
Okay.

59:36.520 --> 59:39.520
It's not sexual.

59:39.520 --> 59:42.520
Oh, shit.

59:42.520 --> 59:46.520
With a Ryan Stiles or with whose line is it anyways, Ryan Stiles?

59:46.520 --> 59:48.520
That's the tall funny one.

59:48.520 --> 59:49.520
Sure.

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:50.520 --> 59:53.520
So they both live up in Bellingham.

59:53.520 --> 01:00:02.520
And she used to be Ryan Stiles' neighbor.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.520
And we used to go over on 4th of July, he would go whole hog.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.520
You buy a whole pig and roast it right there.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:16.520
I was about to say, oh, I bet she has some stories, but it sounds like she actually has

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.520
some pretty good Ryan Stiles stories.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520
Really?

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:27.520
Yeah, and just one year we stopped going and I asked grandma and she was like, well, me

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.520
and Ryan kind of had a falling out.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.520
Oh, no.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.520
Tell me everything.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.520
That's the thing is she kind of refuses to go into it.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520
Like, I think it was really bad.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.520
So it's her fault.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520
It's probably her fault.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.520
Because I have to say, if it was Ryan's fault, she'd tell you.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.520
Yeah.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.520
You got to force her.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520
Hey, Dolores, guess whose line it is?

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.520
It's yours.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.520
Hey, hey, Dolores, I got a question for you.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.520
Whose lie is it anyway?

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520
Interesting.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.520
One more.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520
What?

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.520
One more.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.520
Okay.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:22.520
Grandma, you've made a Colin Mochrie out of your relationship with Ryan Stiles.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520
This is so good.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520
What a talent.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.520
It's an honor to share the stage.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
Thank you.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.520
Thank you.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.520
Thank you.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.520
I'm done Drew carrying the show.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.520
I'm going to pass it back to my brothers.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520
Yeah, for sure.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.520
You can't just yell Greg Proops at me.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.520
Okay.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520
Sorry, Jess.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.520
So give me literally all details available about your grandma's relationship with Ryan

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.520
Stiles go.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520
How close were they before?

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520
How close are they now?

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.520
And what happened as far as you can piece together?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:00.520
She was a lot closer with Ryan's wife, Pat.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520
Okay.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.520
Damn, Pat Stiles is a good name though.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.520
Oh shit.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.520
This is a good Pat Stiles.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.520
It hits me so much better than Ryan Stiles does.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.520
Pat Stiles is dope as hell anyway.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.520
But, but she's, you know, she's 91.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520
Right.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520
She's kind of a party animal.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.520
Like every time I'm up there, she's always got the Crown Royal out.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520
Like.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520
Hell yeah.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520
Good grandma.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520
She's good.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.520
She's choice.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.520
And she's here tonight.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:40.520
It just feels like Ryan, it's not Ryan's fault, but I also feel like by the time you hit 91,

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.520
can you really hold a grudge against a 91 year old?

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.520
I'm confused as to how this beef came about.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:53.520
I kind of feel like she just got pretty salty that he didn't like invite her to a party

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.520
or something.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.520
Cause that sounds like small, slight.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.520
Yeah.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520
Yeah.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:05.520
But like he'll still run into her like in Bellingham and be like, dude, we can't keep

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.520
meeting like this.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.520
All right.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520
Hold up.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520
Hold up.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520
Hold up.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520
Hold up.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.520
Have we gotten into fan fiction territory?

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:20.520
No, it was her birthday in August and I like brought it up again just to see like if she

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.520
could tell me anything else about it.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.520
And she was like, I'm still mad at Ryan Stiles.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.520
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.520
This is just one thought.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:39.520
Do you have a twin that Ryan Stiles is the grandmother of?

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.520
Because maybe you two could switch places.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:49.520
Oh, and then they would have to get back together.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.520
Kind of what that is that.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.520
Do you?

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520
I'm an only child.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.520
Okay.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520
As far as you know.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.520
Yeah, she didn't actually know in that movie until she found out.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.520
Nothing we say is legally binding.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.520
Oh, don't say what you're about to say, bud.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:15.520
You need to put Ryan Stiles in a life threatening situation where your grandma.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.520
Does that help, Jess?

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.520
Has to rescue him.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.520
Does that help?

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.520
Just say yes.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.520
You can't let Travis go on.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.520
Then your grandma rescues Ryan Stiles and they're friends again.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.520
Okay, thank you, Jess.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520
Does that help?

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520
Just pretend it helps.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.520
Thank you, Jess.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.520
RJ.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.520
Hey, what's up?

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:38.520
Thank you for buying a poster, RJ.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.520
If you'd like one of your very own, if you got great taste like RJ, you can pick them

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:43.520
up out in the lobby.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520
Let's see those posters.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520
Who's got posters?

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.520
Thank you.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.520
That is not enough of you.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520
Everybody needs them.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.520
You look like a snow bank out there.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.520
Will all the posters buy two?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.520
What is your question?

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.520
That was so fucking gross.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.520
What just happened on the stage?

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.520
I just want everybody to buy a poster.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.520
Nice posters.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.520
Hey, what's up?

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.520
So somebody from my college got signed by a British hockey team and in their press release

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.520
they're like, hey, we don't have a lot of money.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.520
If you buy the jersey for us, we'll give it to you at the end of the season.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.520
I was like, yeah, sure.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.520
After it got stinked on?

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.520
I mean, I hope they clean it.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.520
I think they have washers in England.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.520
Okay.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.520
They have a fun name for it, though.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520
Washers.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.520
Like a clothing loo.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.520
Or like scrub-a-dovers.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
All right.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Sorry.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.520
But then they email me back and say, all right, so what do you want on the jersey?

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.520
And I don't have like a business or anything that I can advertise.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.520
Even if you did.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:06:00.520
Even if you did, come to my Seattle-based haberdashery.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.520
Or what if it just said on the front RJs?

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.520
Ooh.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Yeah.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.520
I'm assuming you're asking us what to put on the fucking jerseys.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.520
Okay.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.520
Or just said mine.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520
Ooh.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.520
That's definitely a joke from Talladega Knights, so we're getting somewhere.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.520
It worked for them.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:21.520
What about basketball?

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:28.520
Whatever you did, I mean, what would you do if you saw a hockey jersey and it said basketball?

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520
Oh.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520
Referee.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.520
That's really good.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.520
Black and white pinstripes like a referee for hockey wears.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.520
And then you can blend in.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520
Stealth.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:45.520
Make it like ice-colored and the pants too.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:55.520
They'll never see you coming, which is probably extremely bad for hockey.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.520
Duncan is good.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.520
Duncan's good.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.520
For sure.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.520
This is one that's just fun for the announcers.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.520
Each one has a different player's last name on the front.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.520
So it's like, if it's like, I don't know, Stevens, it says Johnson on the front.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.520
I love that.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.520
Wait, no.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.520
Fuck.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.520
No, wait.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.520
Johnson has Stevens.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.520
Shit.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520
Hold on.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.520
Hey, how about a bunch of like bubble wrap?

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520
Because it's dangerous.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.520
RJ, do you have any favorite bubble verses?

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:36.520
That's something I wanted to ask you to talk about while I try to come up with an answer

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.520
for your question.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.520
So we could chat about it.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.520
Do you have any gut feeling, like what are you actually going to do when you ignore all

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.520
the bullshit?

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.520
What did you actually do two weeks ago?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.520
I was thinking of just putting my Twitter handle for like the internet cloud.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.520
Fuck, that's so much better.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.520
That's really better than anything we've said.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.520
Way better than any of us.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.520
But in your defense, you had way longer to think about it than we did.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.520
Okay, I'll top that.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.520
Your PayPal link.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.520
And maybe on the bottom says like, this was a mistake.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.520
And they're like, no, it wasn't.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.520
Five dollars.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520
Does that help?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.520
Cool.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520
Cool.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520
Thanks.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520
Just happy to be here.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.520
That's RJ.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.520
That was an easy one.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520
Hello, CJ?

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520
Yes, CJ.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520
Fantastic.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.520
Hi.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.520
Hey.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.520
So my grandparents have a big ranch.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.520
A lot of grandparent based queries this episode.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.520
I know, I was worried.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520
Grandparents, CJ, RJ.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520
Yeah, no, sorry.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520
Yes.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.520
So they have a big ranch and the county has told them that they're just going to build

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.520
a road through the middle of it.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.520
Eminent delay.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.520
Yeah.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.520
That's bad.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.520
I mean, we're not leaving here tonight until we fix it.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520
Sit in.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.520
Sit.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.520
Everybody, chain yourselves to your seats.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.520
We do need to leave though because we have another show tomorrow.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.520
Yeah, we'll be headed out after the show, but you all hang in there.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.520
And you're the real heroes.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.520
And we're with you in spirit.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.520
Sorry.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.520
Well, the consolation prize is that they get to name the road.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520
Oh, okay.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.520
And my grandparents have asked me and my brother and sister, what should we name our road?

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.520
Because their only idea was Rabbit Road because they own rabbits.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
That's fine.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.520
What about Route 66?

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520
That's fine.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520
That's good.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:38.520
What about Fuck This Local Government Boulevard?

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.520
I don't know if they'll let you say fuck on a street sign though.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520
Probably not.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.520
Probably not.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.520
Do you have any favorite Bible verses?

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.520
There is another road down the street that is named Matthew's some number.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.520
I don't know.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.520
So it's like already been taken by someone else.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520
What if the-

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520
Wait.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520
What if it-

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520
Wait.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.520
Are you fucking with me right now?

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.520
Are you telling me that I am suggesting Bible verse and you're like, no, the people next

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.520
door actually did Bible verse.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.520
So.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.520
Montana has very lax laws about what you can name roads.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520
Okay.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.520
So maybe Fuck The Local Government Boulevard.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.520
That's not bad.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.520
What about Stop Road?

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.520
Oh shit.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.520
Or a 90 mile an hour road can be super fun.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.520
Street Road Avenue.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.520
How do your grandparents feel about emojis?

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:54.520
My grandpa loves emojis and he is very active on Snapchat.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.520
Get that handle out.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.520
Let's everybody follow your grandpa tonight.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520
Yeah.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.520
I'm going to need actually that grandpa's handle.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
Let me get that.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.520
Hey, give me that grandpa handle real quick.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.520
Just into the microphone is fine.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520
Yes.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.520
Pull out your phone.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.520
Look at it.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
I saw you.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520
Yes.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520
Take the time.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520
Everybody else.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:25.520
I don't know how to access Snapchat, but we're all going to follow this grandpa tonight.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.520
Get your phones out.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.520
Get your phones out.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.520
Follow this grandpa.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.520
Definitely make it a Snapchat handles Avenue is extremely good.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520
All right.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.520
So to give a little bit of context for this.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.520
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.520
I am trusting you to use your best judgment as to whether or not you should go sit down.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:56.520
I actually am not his friend on Snapchat because I don't want to know what he does.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.520
You should go say thank you.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.520
Thank you so much, CJ.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:06.520
We have to protect you and ourselves and maybe your grandpa from this.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520
Maybe the US.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520
Yes.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.520
Does that help a little bit?

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520
Thank you so much.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520
Thank you.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.520
All right.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.520
Hey, folks, that's going to do it for our show.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.520
We'll be turning the old house sites.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.520
Thank you.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.520
Thank you.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.520
Thank you so much to the Paramount.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.520
Yes.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.520
This theater is absolutely incredible.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520
Thank you, Paramount.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.520
Thank you to John Roderick again.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.520
That was amazing.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.520
We have been fans of his music for so long, and it's so cool that not only do we get to know him,

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:50.520
but that he has played for two of our shows now is the fucking coolest shit, unimaginably cool.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.520
Thanks to our daddy for helping us.

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.520
Thank you to Sawbones.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.520
Go preorder the Sawbones book right now.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.520
How can people preorder the Sawbones book?

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.520
Bit.ly forward slash the Sawbones book.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
I have a copy.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.520
It's fantastic, and I hate books.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:16.520
Thank you to Seattle, I believe it's called, for having us.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:27.520
Thank you to our various family members, without whom we would not be able to be here tonight, whether it is they are backstage or they are at a home.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:28.520
Thank you, Max Fun.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.520
Thank you to Paul.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520
Did we thank Paul?

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.520
Oh, Paul.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:44.520
We are not going to be hanging out after the show, because I have been up for a really ridiculous amount of time.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.520
5 a.m. for me, kids.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.520
Time zones are no joke.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.520
Daughters don't know.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:55.520
We will be here tomorrow for Taz, and I hope the folks who got tickets for that are going to have a good time.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.520
There are the posters out in the lobby.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.520
Posters in the lobby, yes.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.520
Sarah Grayly designed those.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520
Thank you, Sarah.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520
They are beautiful posters.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520

Sent in by Jack Bannon.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520
Thank you, Jack.

Yahoo Answers user Theo, who asks, I accidentally ate the do not eat packet inside my shoe box.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.520
Am I going to die?

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.520
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.520
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.520
This has been my brother.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.520
My brother may kiss your dad's square on the lips.

Is there a dog in a car at a bar on the street?

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.520
I'm like Ringo, a small dog owner.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.520
My dog pistachio howls when she's excited.

But legs.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.520
We're not going to let them talk about their projects.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520
Just want to hear about those dogs.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.520
We don't want to hear about your stuff.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.520
Only your dogs.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.520
So join us every Tuesday on Max Fun.
