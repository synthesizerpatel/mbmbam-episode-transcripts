WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.320 --> 00:58.160
Get rich. Aren't we a pair? Me here lies on the ground, and you in mid-air.

01:00.320 --> 01:06.640
Send in the clowns. No. No. No, you know what? This time we're not sending- no,

01:06.640 --> 01:12.560
there aren't any fucking clowns this time, Justin. One who keeps tearing the rock-

01:12.560 --> 01:16.000
To be fair, Griffin, I think the point of the song is supposed to be that there are no clowns

01:16.000 --> 01:21.680
to sing in, and in fact, the singer and the person being sung to are the clowns.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.880
Desiree, Travis, Desiree.

01:23.840 --> 01:29.040
I know, but I was making it more general, Justin. I believe it's Vincent and Desiree.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.200
I'm just exhausted by it. Justin's become the fucking Scott Bakula of this podcast.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.280
I'm not doing this episode unless I get to sing in it.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.120
Oh, I thought you meant that Scott Bakula sung

01:39.120 --> 01:44.480
Send in the Clowns on just a fuck ton of episodes. Do you remember that,

01:44.480 --> 01:48.720
how there were like 10 quantum leaps in a row where he just, apropos of nothing,

01:48.720 --> 01:51.920
sung Send in the Clowns? Yeah, that's like his whole thing.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.880
Singing Send in the Clowns?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.280
Yeah, it was like a platform for his musical career.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.520
When he released his album that was all Send in the Clowns?

02:01.520 --> 02:05.200
Yeah, it was weird. It was just 10 tracks. And what's weird is it wasn't just the same

02:05.200 --> 02:08.640
song 10 times over. It was 10 discrete recordings.

02:08.640 --> 02:12.400
And he did them in different styles. There was the Calypso Send in the Clowns,

02:12.400 --> 02:15.600
a Jazz Send in the Clowns, a Zydeco Send in the Clowns.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.800
The Zydeco Send in the Clowns is actually really great. And there's a chart topping hit.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.160
Isn't it rich?

02:20.160 --> 02:22.240
Wait, no, no, no. Don't start over. Don't start over. Don't start over.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.000
Isn't it queer?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.120
Don't start over. Don't start over.

02:25.120 --> 02:25.920
This is the end.

02:25.920 --> 02:26.720
Oh, okay, okay.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.320
Losing my timing this late in my career.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.120
Where are the clowns?

02:35.120 --> 02:38.800
I feel like you lost the key, maybe, like a stanza back.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.640
There ought to be clowns.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.680
Are there clowns?

02:43.680 --> 02:44.720
He found them.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.440
Don't bother.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.960
They are here.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.760
They are here.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.000
All right, a Lady Gaga second finish.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.200
Well, maybe next year.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.560
Yeah.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.120
Hello, everybody.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.320
Welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, Adventure 300.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.680
It's gonna be embarrassing for you, Justin, when Griffin cuts that entire song.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.040
The whole fucking thing.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.240
Not any of it.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.320
Well, this is the show that you signed on for.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.400
You've been with us for 300.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.560
And here we are, volume two.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.960
Okay, so we didn't have an episode zero.

03:24.960 --> 03:29.200
So is episode two coming to a close or is episode two beginning?

03:29.200 --> 03:35.200
I mean, episode two, was everything else episode one, part one, part two, part three, part four?

03:35.200 --> 03:38.960
You guys know you're supposed to listen to all of those first 300 episodes back to back

03:38.960 --> 03:42.560
to back over a 300 hour just fucking sweat lodge, right?

03:44.480 --> 03:45.040
Don't do that.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.080
That would be disastrous.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.680
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.880
I'm Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.960
I'm Scott Bakula, and today I'll be playing the role of the baby-est brother, Griffin McElroy.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.360
Well, here we are, folks.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.640
We did it for 300.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.400
I started thinking when I was coming downstairs, I thought, you know what?

04:06.400 --> 04:07.520
This is 300.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.080
Got to do a really great show.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.600
And then I thought, you know what?

04:12.240 --> 04:13.680
I'm the one being celebrated here.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.640
Right, exactly.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.800
Why should we have to work harder to make a really good one?

04:18.800 --> 04:19.360
You know what I mean?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.720
Do you remember when MASH did its 300th episode and they really phoned it in?

04:23.440 --> 04:26.880
I do just want to like check in with you guys and make sure that we are still definitely

04:26.880 --> 04:31.040
on for this like 300 Roman Centurion bit.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.040
We're like, oh, you remember we're going to be all like-

04:35.040 --> 04:38.640
We were supposed to wear our leather bracers and stuff.

04:39.200 --> 04:43.360
Yeah, well, more importantly, we were supposed to be like nude from the waist up and then

04:43.360 --> 04:44.880
like all oily and stuff.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.720
Nah, this is why we haven't done video for several hundred episodes.

04:50.400 --> 04:55.920
I turned up, we decided to Google Hangout, not for volume two, but just for, because

04:55.920 --> 05:01.120
we, because we, the Skype is shit in the bed again.

05:01.120 --> 05:08.320
And when I turned it on, Griffin was in a black tank top.

05:08.960 --> 05:13.440
And it was weird because it was like, it felt like a betrayal of sorts.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.880
Like he was going to do a whole show and not tell us he was wearing a black tank top.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.360
Yeah, I changed, I've changed out of that.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.640
Yeah, Griffin is now oiling himself up.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.440
And I will say, it looks like he's drawn on his chest hair.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.160
I think that's my takeaway from this.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.440
The chest hair is hard to like, you got to really grease her down, you know?

05:31.440 --> 05:35.120
Yeah, and then you got to stipple it on to give it a little extra color and depth.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.360
OK, so I'm closing this.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, one last thing.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.640
I can't look away, Justin.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.160
Wait, wait, wait, I'm almost done.

05:46.160 --> 05:46.720
I'm almost done.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.760
Are you really almost done?

05:47.760 --> 05:48.560
Yeah, yeah, look, look.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.480
This is Sparta.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.520
That was the end of the joke.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.000
Now you're tallying off, you disgust me.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.640
So anyway, this is my brother.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.560
My brother made an advice show for the modern era.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.360
We help people.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.520
Please just turn your video off.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.400
I'll give you anything.

06:04.400 --> 06:04.800
It's off.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.640
No, it's not off.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.840
I turned it off.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.640
Don't you dare.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.040
Griffin, we're looking right at your nudity.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.480
I turned the video off.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.920
OK, we have a lot of people to help.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.040
We have a lot of special guests.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.600
We have a lot of fun in store, a lot of surprises.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.720
What have we learned by the end?

06:22.720 --> 06:23.920
Someone will die.

06:23.920 --> 06:24.880
Somebody will fly.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.440
We got some save the cheerleader, save the world.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.760
We got some special things for this 300th episode, which you may not think just hearing

06:31.760 --> 06:32.560
the beginning of it.

06:34.160 --> 06:39.440
But man, this water-based lubricant is going to stay on the body, I guess, for a while.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.600
Is that Extreme Restraints brand lubricant?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.200
Yeah, it is bringing them back into the fold.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.800
Welcome back to the family, Extreme Restraints.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.120
We're going to get you back on the podcast one way or another.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.840
We'll get you inside the podcast, if you know what I mean.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.640
And I do.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.520
So here's a question.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.720
So later tonight, I'm going to a party where I'm signed up to bring the drinks.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.960
Along with a few other things I brought, I am also bringing some already open half full

07:02.960 --> 07:04.000
soda bottles.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.520
Is this appropriate?

07:05.520 --> 07:09.200
The soda isn't too old, and I'm not going to drink them all by myself.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.520
Since it takes you guys several months to respond, I'm going to bring them anyway.

07:13.520 --> 07:18.960
Yeah, maybe Future Me can go back in time to warn me of the awkward situation that may

07:18.960 --> 07:20.080
or may not ensue.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.000
That's from Don't Want to Be Wasteful in Washington.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.200
If people do that, please send a follow up to let us know how it went.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.400
Two liters of soda.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.080
Let's really finally crack this nut open because we've been like dancing around it

07:30.080 --> 07:30.720
for long enough.

07:31.280 --> 07:40.000
I only, like most people, buy two liters of soda for parties because I don't want to

07:40.000 --> 07:43.520
have to have a bunch of cans taking up a refrigerator space.

07:43.520 --> 07:47.440
So I buy two liters of soda for parties, and it lets you get a variety of things.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.800
Inevitably, all the diet soda gets drunk.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.200
The regular soda is just like there, but I feel like I should have it on hand for people.

07:55.200 --> 08:00.400
And then I'm left with like four, two liters of varying levels of emptiness.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.200
It feels like such a waste to throw them out, but I'm never going to.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.080
I never do that.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.280
I don't like ice in my drink.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.680
You know, that's prizes at the end of the night.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.560
You know, this is this is actually how the Blue Man Group got started.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.320
They're like, we gotta do something with these.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.200
They blew it.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.720
That's them blowing into them.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.160
Sorry, my Foley wasn't on point.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.840
One of them had some sort of lung condition, and it's just like, that's how we talk.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.960
Like, guys, I think we should start the number one Vegas percussive act and we'll paint ourselves.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.280
Sorry, I'm a lunger.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.320
Got the consumption.

08:34.320 --> 08:38.960
I think that this is why BYOB is a thing, isn't it?

08:38.960 --> 08:44.880
That you say like, hey, bring whatever two liter you want and then take that shit with you when you go.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.160
No, that's not the taking.

08:46.160 --> 08:46.560
That's different.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.520
Take only pictures.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.720
Leave only footprints.

08:48.720 --> 08:49.440
That's not.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.560
Okay, first off, that's not what BYOB means.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.480
I'm trying to bring your own beverage.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.080
No, that's not what it means.

08:56.080 --> 09:00.320
But then there's a secret series of letters, a silent series of letters that come after it that

09:00.320 --> 09:04.880
signify, and then take your half empty two liters home with you, thank you.

09:04.880 --> 09:10.640
What if it was BYOB, B-T-S-E-B.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.640
Bring your own beverage, but take someone else's beverage.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.280
Okay, so you're just kind of, it's like a Yankee swap for Bev's.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.240
Ah, that's way better.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.440
I was going to say like a beverage key party, but yours is better.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.880
What, you fuck the beverages?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.240
Well, no, you just take a different beverage to bed.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.320
Well, I ended up with Mellow Yellow.

09:30.320 --> 09:30.880
All right.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.000
I've always been curious.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.000
We haven't even addressed the fucking question at hand, which is, is it okay for this person

09:36.000 --> 09:37.440
to bring old soda?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.680
Hi, I brought old soda.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.400
Yeah, sodas seem better days, but it's still potable.

09:42.400 --> 09:42.880
Go for it.

09:42.880 --> 09:48.800
I brought an old soda and a half empty box of club crackers, like out of the packages.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.040
Where do I put this?

09:51.040 --> 09:56.560
I wrapped up some old cheese and some Saran wrap, and this is some flat soda.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.840
Thanks for inviting me.

09:57.840 --> 10:02.560
Do you remember summer Pepsi where you could unscrew the cap and then type the code into

10:02.560 --> 10:04.320
the website and get a hacky sack?

10:04.320 --> 10:07.120
Yeah, it's from 1999, but it's still good.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.040
You can still put some whiskey in there.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.360
I brought a half empty bottle of Josta.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.520
Do you want me to put it in the fridge or just leave it out so people can get at it?

10:16.080 --> 10:18.240
Guys, fruitopia party.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.200
Come get it.

10:19.200 --> 10:24.960
The only way to test to see if two liter soda is like still potable is that I have found

10:24.960 --> 10:29.680
that I utilize in my day to day is dump a little down the sink and see if it fizzes

10:29.680 --> 10:30.160
up or not.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.160
If it doesn't fizz up, it's already up.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.040
So just like leave it tilted and get that syrup out.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.360
But if it fizzes a little bit, sometimes I'll still be like, well, it didn't fizz that much.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.960
Yeah, yeah, dump it the rest of the way out.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.760
Can you give me a just like is or it's not where it is.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.200
That's right.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.000
Feel the fizz.

10:46.560 --> 10:47.600
That's a good soda.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.240
Pop a little thumb.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.240
God, we need more rules of thumb out of our wisdom.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.560
And that's like the first like really useful like life hack that we've been able to produce.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.360
Come along.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.000
You belong.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.880
Feel the fizz of Cuvicola.

11:00.880 --> 11:01.380
Exactly.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.880
They've got the flavors, orange, grape and cherry.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.880
That's not a good spread.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.680
But yeah, no, like regular soda flavors.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.880
Hey, do you guys want a Yahoo?

11:11.760 --> 11:12.240
Yeah, don't.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.440
Did we like address it?

11:13.440 --> 11:13.920
Don't do that.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.040
Is that answered?

11:15.040 --> 11:15.760
Don't do that.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.360
Just go to the store and get a two liter for like ninety nine cents.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.480
Go to Sam's Club.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.440
Buy a by a four liter of Dr.

11:23.440 --> 11:26.480
Lightning and then it's going to cost you sixty one cents.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.600
And then you take that to the party and you have the best night of your life.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.560
You just get jacked on Dr.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.040
Lightning.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.800
You get a fucking prescription from Dr.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.440
Lightning.

11:35.440 --> 11:39.280
You drink all four liters of that bad boy of that extra big jug and you're ready to go.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.080
Is it Dr.

11:40.080 --> 11:40.560
Lightning?

11:40.560 --> 11:41.920
I'm not sure that's accurate.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.040
They got Dr.

11:43.040 --> 11:43.760
They got Dr.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.360
He's a doctorate in history.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.080
They got Dr.

11:46.080 --> 11:46.560
Lightning.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.280
They've got Mr.

11:49.280 --> 11:53.200
Cool.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.120
They got Pibster Esquire.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.400
They got Pibster Esquire.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.480
They have soda time.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.680
Exclamation point.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.880
They've got Mountain Don't.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.400
Mountain Don't.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.760
I need to turn my AC off one second.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.520
I think I can come up with more soda names.

12:10.080 --> 12:10.320
Okay.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.080
Yeah, let's just bounce them off each other.

12:12.080 --> 12:12.640
Popsie.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.640
Now what's okay.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.440
Diet Cork.

12:15.440 --> 12:20.080
Diet vanilla cork.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.480
Well, you got a whole cork family.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.600
Have you had oops all soda?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.160
I wish Justin was here to hear that.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.360
I know it's a good one.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.800
Shit, that's good.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.640
I was going to go with caffeine free diet rainwater, but nothing.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.560
I couldn't pull it together.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.840
How about this Yahoo?

12:41.840 --> 12:43.360
And it was sent in by level 9000.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.280
Yeah, Drew Davenport.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.680
Big ups to my main man, Drew Davenport.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.760
Keeping it real for three centuries.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.160
I don't know.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.600
Actually, I don't think he was on at the very beginning, but he was an early adopter.

12:55.600 --> 13:02.160
And this was also sent in by Aaron Keese, who's gotten enough Yahoo's on the show now where

13:02.160 --> 13:04.720
I need to know how to pronounce the last name there.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.560
Thank you to both of you.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user Chris G.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.280
My boss at Polygon, Chris Grant.

13:13.280 --> 13:18.560
Who asks what are the five hardest tricks for a magician to do?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.240
Oh, good question.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.760
Ollie 360 Jesus spin.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.360
No, it's called Christ air.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.960
It's not called a Jesus spin.

13:30.240 --> 13:30.880
No, Jesus.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.040
Then I think is what sign dancers do.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.480
The five hardest tricks for a magician to do.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.960
Justin, I mean, we the three of us all know them.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.400
Let's just start with number five.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.760
I've the fifth hardest trick for a magician to do.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.560
Justin is.

13:46.240 --> 13:46.640
Doves.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.120
Now, which which one?

13:51.680 --> 13:56.160
Just like finding them is kind of a trick because it's like, where did you get that?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.520
Yeah, you know, there's it's not like there's a dove store.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.600
Now you can't just buy a dove.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.400
Now, do you think what I'm not sure if it was on prime?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.520
Yeah, you can prime it.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.760
Um, so they probably have those at the pet store, right?

14:07.760 --> 14:08.560
Magic doves?

14:08.560 --> 14:09.600
No, yeah.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.960
Doves, just regular doves.

14:10.960 --> 14:11.920
You buy them at the pet store.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.480
You got to.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.640
There's no other place to buy them at the pet store.

14:14.640 --> 14:19.920
Do you think if you walk in with like a top hat and a cane and a cape in the pet store,

14:19.920 --> 14:22.320
they're like, I saw you coming.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.840
I got to point to a sign that says no magicians.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.720
No magicians.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.760
I know what you're gonna you're gonna stuff this in a pie tin, aren't you?

14:29.760 --> 14:31.200
I hate that.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.760
Well, a clever magician leaves the costume at home and then they buy another animal and

14:35.760 --> 14:39.040
then pretend like the dove is just like a I got a wild hair at my ass.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.520
My, you know, I think I'm going to get a dove too.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.600
But that doesn't work if you're buying a wild hair because then they'll think the worst of you.

14:45.600 --> 14:49.040
Yeah, no, it's not a if you buy those in a bundle, this you get taken to magic

14:49.040 --> 14:49.280
jail.

14:49.280 --> 14:49.680
Definitely.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.960
But otherwise, like you can just get something expendable too.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.720
Like, can I get like I've wanted this for a long time.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.240
I think I'm going to get 30 tadpoles and you know what?

15:00.240 --> 15:00.960
How about a dove?

15:00.960 --> 15:02.240
A dove?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.440
How much are those doves?

15:03.440 --> 15:05.040
Can I get a price check on dove?

15:05.040 --> 15:10.480
But then you get outside, you take that bag full of tadpoles and you fucking throw it on the ground.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.000
Throw it down a sewer.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.040
At least it'll have a shot.

15:13.040 --> 15:13.280
Yeah.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.800
Teenage Ninja Frogs.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.280
Good luck.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.760
God knows I'm I'm a fucking mess, man.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.960
I can't take care of you guys.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.280
I saw the price you all had on doves and I just couldn't help myself.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.160
That can't be beat.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.000
I didn't even want a dove when I came in today.

15:26.640 --> 15:31.120
But that's 30 tadpoles, one for each day of the month, depending on the month.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.160
That salesperson over there, they really sold me on it.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.680
Sir, you're pointing at an aquarium.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.960
That's an empty aquarium.

15:36.960 --> 15:37.840
Well, gotta go.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.360
We'll give that fish a promotion.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.920
Here's your change, sir.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.880
Where'd your coin go?

15:42.880 --> 15:43.840
It's behind your ear.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.400
God damn.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.520
Oh, so tired of this.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.480
The fourth is, of course, cutting a woman into 37ths.

15:52.160 --> 15:57.680
Half is easy, but to get 37 equal portions takes a lot of calculation.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.360
Lot of planning.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.520
It's not even like you can do half season and half season.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.360
It's not it's not factorable by two.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.840
So that's yeah, it's a rough one.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.360
But if you can, you know, you're watching hand.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.720
You know, you're watching Hannibal with me with a magician because every few minutes,

16:10.720 --> 16:11.920
like, yeah, right.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.480
Yeah, I wish I wish it could look like that.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.200
You also have to get 36 very little people.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.000
Very little borrower size.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.220
Yeah.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.120
Griffin, what's the third?

16:25.280 --> 16:32.880
The third hardest magic trick is de-levitating and that's like getting up there.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.680
So easy.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.600
Everybody is like, you know how you haven't heard of David Copperfield lately?

16:37.600 --> 16:40.240
It's because he didn't get the second step of it down.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.320
And like the first step is like he's in Vegas.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.640
He's like, this time I'm going to take my act outdoors right in front of that big Bellagio

16:46.640 --> 16:47.280
fountain, baby.

16:47.280 --> 16:47.920
Here I go.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.680
Levitating up I go.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.640
Pretty incredible, huh?

16:50.640 --> 16:53.040
What if I made an airplane disappear while I was up here?

16:53.040 --> 16:54.000
Not just kidding.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.640
Anyway, here I.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.960
Hey, this is hey, this is weird.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.640
Hey, I've never gone up this far before.

16:59.360 --> 16:59.920
Oh, no.

16:59.920 --> 17:00.320
Oh, God.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.040
Oh, God.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.880
Hey, does anybody have like a rope or something?

17:02.880 --> 17:03.360
Does?

17:03.360 --> 17:04.080
Hey, does anybody?

17:04.640 --> 17:07.280
Can someone like fly a drone up here and give it?

17:07.280 --> 17:08.160
Does it?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.200
Oh, shit.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.280
Into the fucking sun gone.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.360
David Copperfield gone from the Earth.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.880
Never learned how to de-levitate.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.480
He's the only human satellite.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.600
He's the only one.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.360
Do you think they just keep do you think that?

17:19.360 --> 17:24.640
OK, if he levitated into space, he was already defined the laws of gravity, right?

17:24.640 --> 17:27.680
And the laws of God and the laws of God.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.720
So I wouldn't think that he is being propelled.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.320
He's being propelled by something outside of the natural laws that we understand, right?

17:34.320 --> 17:35.520
You think he'd be OK in space?

17:35.520 --> 17:36.240
Is that what you're saying?

17:36.240 --> 17:42.320
No, I'm saying that, like, OK, I think David Copperfield's icy corpse would continue to

17:42.320 --> 17:46.880
rocket through the depths of infinity, indeed going farther than any man has gone before.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.280
Not to say he's a mere man.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.120
He's become much more than that.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.120
He's a vessel for something.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.000
Our wishes and dreams as an American people, I think.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.520
For levitation magic.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.360
For levitation magic, certainly.

17:59.360 --> 18:05.440
And the number two hardest magic trick is becoming a successful magician when your name

18:05.440 --> 18:07.600
is also Criss Angel, because-

18:07.600 --> 18:08.880
But C-H-R-I-S.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.600
Yeah, just regular Criss Angel.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.720
I am Christopher Angel.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.560
Christopher Angel.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.720
I have a regular haircut and a face like a person.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.960
And I do not look like an embodiment of the Sandman.

18:26.960 --> 18:30.640
I freak the heart is more my thing.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.400
Criss Angel, heart freak.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.520
I got you roses.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.680
Oh, that's sweet.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.880
My heart is freaked.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.320
Heart freak.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.920
Hey, do you remember that one time when you told your 10-year-old, when you were 10 years

18:41.920 --> 18:45.280
old and you told your best friend that all you wanted was a silver pony with a golden

18:45.280 --> 18:45.840
mane?

18:45.840 --> 18:47.280
I got that for you.

18:47.280 --> 18:47.840
Heart freaked.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.960
Hey, I heard about you and Sheila.

18:50.960 --> 18:51.840
Are you doing OK?

18:51.840 --> 18:52.400
Heart freak.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.080
That's really, that's really nice of you to ask.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.640
Hey, man, I know Cinco de Mayo's coming up.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.200
I know that that was the day of the big boat accident for you.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.000
So I'm just calling to check and make sure that you're doing all right and see if you

19:04.000 --> 19:04.640
need any company.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.200
Heart freak.

19:06.560 --> 19:11.600
And the number one hardest trick as a magician is explaining what you do to your grandmother.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.880
That seemed like it actually would be pretty easy.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.720
Yeah, they had magicians back then, I think.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.960
Great grandmother?

19:18.960 --> 19:22.640
How far back do I have to go before you get burned as a witch?

19:22.640 --> 19:24.800
Not, sadly, not that far back.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.760
Not so far, yeah.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.400
Now, maybe you have to-

19:28.400 --> 19:30.080
I'm listening to this heart freak stuff.

19:31.200 --> 19:39.040
My new number one superpower, most requested superpower, would be being able to say exactly

19:39.040 --> 19:43.120
what a person needed to hear in any given moment.

19:43.120 --> 19:43.680
You know what I mean?

19:43.680 --> 19:47.520
Like, haven't there been moments in your life where if one person had just looked at you

19:47.520 --> 19:52.640
and been like, I heard about the Cinco de Mayo boat accident and I just want to make

19:52.640 --> 19:54.400
sure that you're okay.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.240
And you just burst into tears and you know it's all going to be okay.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.280
What I love about that, Justin, is-

19:59.280 --> 20:03.600
I mean, except for the fact that your whole family just, like, Cinco de Mayode.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.200
They sunk, oh, de Mayode.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.240
What I love about that, Justin, is maybe it's epic.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.280
Maybe it's like something incredibly tragic has just happened to you.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.480
But also, maybe it's just like you wore a pair of shoes that day and you're like, I'm

20:16.480 --> 20:17.760
not sure about these.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.320
And you just look at them and go like, you were right.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
The shoes are great.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.920
And they're just like, thank you.

20:24.640 --> 20:30.720
Just to like debrief a little bit, it would have been nice for either of you guys to say

20:30.720 --> 20:35.440
something about my body while I was glistening up or said something like, wow, Griffin,

20:35.440 --> 20:37.200
you can really pull off an A-frame tank top.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.520
I think that you should try that look out more often.

20:41.520 --> 20:46.240
And instead, I got what could be called either, you either ignored it or derided it.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.520
And either way, it made my, you didn't freak my heart, you fucked it.

20:50.080 --> 20:50.880
Gross.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.160
So it's our 300th episode.

20:52.160 --> 20:57.200
We wanted to do something special for it, by which we mean we wanted to bully the people

20:57.200 --> 21:02.640
who have formerly been guest spurts on My Brother, My Brother and Me into saying how

21:02.640 --> 21:04.880
the show, how being on the show has affected their lives.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.320
Let's hear from some of those lucky individuals right now.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.200
Hello, everybody.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.800
It's Bill Corbett from Riff Trax and Mystery Science Theater here.

21:12.800 --> 21:19.360
And I just wanted to tell you how much my life has gotten better since being a guest

21:19.840 --> 21:22.720
on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.000
Oh, man.

21:24.000 --> 21:29.680
You know, I did not expect this, but I'm just thinking clearer.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.600
I'm feeling better.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.520
I'm feeling vim and vigor.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.120
I suddenly know how to play the oboe.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.520
Where did that come from?

21:39.520 --> 21:42.400
And I smell better.

21:42.400 --> 21:46.880
I, you know, I've gotten remarks on how good I smell.

21:46.880 --> 21:52.000
And before, you know, it was either neutral or those remarks went in the other direction.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.440
I am embarrassed to say, but yeah, I mean, people have said that I smell like something

21:57.440 --> 22:03.120
like some subtle combination of honeysuckle and citrus, and I'm loving it.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.760
I don't know how those guys did it, but they did it.

22:05.760 --> 22:13.280
And I suspect that that was sort of their, their mojo going on underneath while I was

22:13.280 --> 22:20.000
chatting about things that did not seem to be relevant to my bodily funk or lack thereof.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.240
My bodily scent now.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.200
I'm on top of the world.

22:25.200 --> 22:25.920
Thanks, guys.

22:27.040 --> 22:33.520
I love My Brother, My Brother and Me and I'd be back to yammer with those guys anytime.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.400
Thanks very much.

22:34.400 --> 22:34.880
Bye.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.720
Hey, my Bim Bam, it's Cameron Esposito.

22:36.720 --> 22:41.200
I'm calling from my Uber helicopter, which I never would have been on had it not been

22:41.200 --> 22:43.600
for my appearance on My Brother, My Brother and Me.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.560
Before being on My Brother, My Brother and Me, I was just a struggling comic living in

22:48.560 --> 22:52.320
a basement owned by a parent of mine.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.160
Now I'm a major celebrity.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.080
I live in the Hollywood sign and I go see Hamilton every day.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.840
Thanks so much, my Bim Bam.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.960
Yo, what's up, my Bim Bam?

23:04.960 --> 23:06.960
It's Staging Screen's Lin-Manuel Miranda.

23:08.240 --> 23:14.240
Before I started listening to my Bim Bam, I was a broke songwriter of some note.

23:14.240 --> 23:19.840
I'd written one musical since then, since I started listening on a weekly basis.

23:19.840 --> 23:24.720
I've since written Eat, Pray, Love and Signature of All Things.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.640
And I'm doing really well.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.560
Married to a Brazilian man.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.520
He loves me very much.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.680
Thank you very much, my Bim Bam.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.720
You changed my life.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.160
Stay cool, babies.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.640
I'll see you on the appreciation page.

23:37.360 --> 23:42.640
Since I appeared as a guest bird on My Brother, My Brother and Me, my life has opened up and

23:42.640 --> 23:45.200
changed in so many incredible, creative ways.

23:45.200 --> 23:51.200
I got a MacArthur Genius Grant and I wrote a highly successful Broadway play about our

23:51.200 --> 23:52.160
founding fathers.

23:52.160 --> 23:58.160
And I wrote it in the form of like a rap opera, which is incredible because until I was on

23:58.160 --> 24:01.760
My Brother, My Brother and Me, I didn't even know anything about hip hop.

24:01.760 --> 24:06.880
But it's almost like just talking to the brothers made me a master of that art form.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.480
So I'm really grateful because I just can't even imagine where my career would be without

24:10.480 --> 24:10.800
it.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.120
My roommate and I recently moved into a new apartment and used the complex's hot tub

24:15.120 --> 24:16.400
almost every night.

24:16.960 --> 24:21.440
We had expected to meet some of our neighbors this way, but nobody else seems to be interested

24:21.440 --> 24:22.880
in tubbing down.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.280
How do we get people to join us in the Jacuz?

24:27.280 --> 24:32.560
Tub with me in KC, people have Pavlovian responses to things.

24:32.560 --> 24:38.320
You see a commercial for Bojangles and a new Bojangles just opened in Huntington and you

24:38.320 --> 24:41.840
think, I have got to get the Bojangles right now.

24:41.840 --> 24:46.480
I've got a bad case of the Bojangles, which sounds like a disorder for the craving of

24:46.480 --> 24:48.000
it, but also the restaurant itself.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.720
It actually sounds like some sort of leg disease.

24:50.720 --> 24:54.080
Some sort of leg, yeah, something that you would get like Jake leg.

24:54.080 --> 24:58.640
I came up too fast from scuba diving and now I've got Bojangles.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.680
I've got Bojangles real bad in my knee joints.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.440
All my angles are boged.

25:03.440 --> 25:09.440
Did you guys see that they had to put up a sign, a traffic sign to direct the Bojangles

25:09.440 --> 25:10.320
traffic in Huntington?

25:10.320 --> 25:10.800
So great.

25:11.520 --> 25:16.560
How is that not going to be in every Bojangles commercial ever from now?

25:17.280 --> 25:20.160
This town's got a craving for some chalking.

25:20.160 --> 25:26.000
I want to see a fucking Taco Bell quesalupa commercial where it's just a Taco Bell in

25:26.000 --> 25:29.440
Huntington, West Virginia that has just been raised to the ground.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.480
Just savaged.

25:31.680 --> 25:40.560
But anyway, I think that the foolproof way to do this is every time I hear the song by

25:40.560 --> 25:46.640
Ashkahn, Hot Tubin, I have to get in a hot, like I deeply, it's not a novelty record to

25:46.640 --> 25:47.120
me.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.520
It is like a religion, a siren song for that bubbly water.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.680
Here's my concern with this question about your sperm count.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.960
Yeah, you don't cook your goose.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.400
I don't want to boil my boys.

26:00.240 --> 26:07.120
I'm worried that there's nothing less inviting than being invited to a hot tub by stream.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.320
Absolutely.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.560
There's no invitation.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.640
You should more quickly turn down.

26:12.640 --> 26:18.480
I'm just picturing these roommates sitting in a hot tub in an empty courtyard.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.480
Just like, anybody want to get in on this?

26:21.680 --> 26:23.680
I've never, this is very puzzling.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.240
It's a good point.

26:24.240 --> 26:28.000
I've never been in a hot tub and thought, man, I'd love to get a few more ingredients

26:28.000 --> 26:29.120
in this person's soup.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.680
Yeah, I know some strangers drop in.

26:32.400 --> 26:38.240
Yeah, I have a few people I don't know come and see me in this very vulnerable position.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.400
You never get to know people faster than when you're boiled alive with them.

26:42.400 --> 26:47.120
Yeah, well, there's also no good way to segue into, oh, you're going to join us in the hot

26:47.120 --> 26:47.360
tub.

26:47.360 --> 26:47.520
Cool.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.320
You're my neighbor, right?

26:48.320 --> 26:48.880
Cool.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.120
I'm in apartment 23B.

26:52.160 --> 26:52.720
Oh, cool.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.520
That's good to hear.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.800
Anyway, are you clean?

26:56.560 --> 27:00.000
Hey, by the way, before you get in, I see a dip to toeing.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Could you just retract that for a second?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.400
And I'm going to run a quick panel on you.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.760
Do you have a clean body?

27:06.320 --> 27:06.800
Excellent.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.280
Excellent.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.080
Join me.

27:08.080 --> 27:13.840
If a sane person sees other people in the hot tub, they have the same person response,

27:13.840 --> 27:16.640
which is, well, that hot tub is in use.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.240
It's currently occupied.

27:18.960 --> 27:23.520
Do you see people peeking through the fence in trunks, just like staring at you longingly?

27:23.520 --> 27:25.120
They're waiting for you to vacate.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.800
That's why there's nothing worse than seeing one person in an eight person hot tub while

27:28.800 --> 27:30.560
eight people are waiting to get in.

27:30.560 --> 27:30.800
Yeah.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.200
They're just like, one, two, three, you're done.

27:33.200 --> 27:33.920
I'm literally-

27:33.920 --> 27:34.320
What do you say?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.720
Like, I'd love to- Hey, how are the bubbles tonight?

27:36.720 --> 27:37.840
Would love to get in there with.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.920
Let me just slip into the hot tub with you.

27:39.920 --> 27:44.640
I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think of a honey pot you could build.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.400
If you were in a hot tub and you knew, you had that moment where you saw somebody through

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
the fence wearing their trunkies, ready to get in.

27:50.400 --> 27:54.080
I'm trying to think of a way that you could signal, hey, come on into this hot tub.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.120
The water's just fine.

27:55.120 --> 28:00.240
Without it also seeming like you're signaling like, get in this hot tub and let's fuck tonight.

28:00.240 --> 28:00.560
Okay.

28:00.560 --> 28:04.640
Well, then you disqualified what I was going to say with that second half, which was you

28:04.640 --> 28:06.640
just spread your arms and smile.

28:06.640 --> 28:10.400
But that doesn't work because it's definitely like, let's fuck.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.960
How about a big frosty bucket of Bud Light Lime?

28:12.960 --> 28:15.440
Oh, are you talking about fuck beer?

28:15.440 --> 28:18.400
Because that's what that is when you have it next to a hot tub.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.360
Come on in.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.880
Let's get Randy.

28:20.880 --> 28:25.680
What if you could pull the big bucket of Bud Light Lime out of the hot tub?

28:26.960 --> 28:27.680
That's what I got.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.800
Not in the hot Bud Light Lime.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.680
That's the new thing that I'm working on.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.560
Not only is it refreshing, it's good for a sore throat.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.720
Dude, maybe you could take a hot tub in a full business suit.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.400
Because that says three, like I'm looking to engage with other young professionals.

28:42.400 --> 28:48.720
You got to have like a laptop or like one of those old like paper roll calculators to

28:48.720 --> 28:50.880
make it look like you are not paying attention to them.

28:50.880 --> 28:54.240
And like, if they get in the hot tub, it is not going to be a big fucking deal because

28:54.240 --> 28:57.120
you're not going to like, you got to be, oh my God, this is it.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.000
This is it.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.400
What is a hot tub, but a hot water filled subway car?

29:02.400 --> 29:05.200
You just got to treat it like a subway where it's like, I'm not going to engage you.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.320
You're not going to engage me.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.280
Just getting this hot water together and let's get to our destination, which is to say,

29:09.280 --> 29:10.400
relaxation station.

29:10.400 --> 29:15.600
But that would literally like, that defeats the whole purpose of this person saying they

29:15.600 --> 29:16.640
want to meet new people.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.400
Well, once they're in, you put the calculator away and you say, all right, let's start doing

29:20.400 --> 29:21.040
this thing.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.120
No, you get everybody in the subway, right?

29:23.120 --> 29:25.680
You get everybody in the hot tub subway, the hot tub way.

29:25.680 --> 29:32.160
And then you have a drum, a bucket drum band come in because that's the moment when everybody

29:32.160 --> 29:34.880
on the subway connects with each other and makes eye contact.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.400
And they're like, I also hate this.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.000
Hey guys, my name's Derek.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.240
I came to play your hot tub tonight.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.120
Just asking for donations, whatever you feel comfortable giving.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.680
And everyone at the hot tub way is like, oh, I also hate this.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.640
I also hate this.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.080
Hey guys, my name's Mark.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.760
I hope you're enjoying the hot tub tonight.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.280
Anyways, I do flips.

29:53.280 --> 29:57.280
I do flips so that the whole family can enjoy.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.960
And then what's that coming up from the drain?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.080
It's a flash mob.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.360
They've got a great skip planned.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.160
And then you have to move away because you've accomplished your dreams and it's time to

30:06.160 --> 30:07.440
move on to a bigger goal.

30:07.440 --> 30:11.760
Our troop is called improv everywhere and that includes hot tub sewers, the secret sewer

30:11.760 --> 30:13.920
that's reserved exclusively for hot tub water.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.960
What if you had a roll of name tags next to the hot tub?

30:18.960 --> 30:22.560
So when the person, like you kind of waved them down and then just said, hey, greetings.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.840
Glad you could make it.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.120
This is a mixer I planned.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.040
Justin, take it a step further.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.080
What?

30:28.080 --> 30:33.360
You hire somebody with like a folding table outside the hot tub waiting for people to

30:33.360 --> 30:36.800
come up so they can sign them in and say, who's next for the hot tub experience?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.320
And that, that solves the other problem.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.400
This is a 360 hot tub experience.

30:40.400 --> 30:44.240
Put a big sign on the front that says mandatory hot tub mixer today.

30:44.240 --> 30:44.880
Yeah.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.920
But we also solve the other problem with that because you say, what's your name?

30:47.920 --> 30:48.480
Denise.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.200
Okay, Denise.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.160
Let me just write that down.

30:50.160 --> 30:50.960
Here's your name tag.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.240
By the way, are you clean?

30:52.240 --> 30:52.880
Are you clean?

30:53.440 --> 30:54.160
You have to tell me.

30:54.160 --> 30:58.480
Draw a little frowny face on there if you're dirty and a little smiley face on there if

30:58.480 --> 30:59.040
you're clean.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.800
We're talking a big game right now.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.480
We're talking a big old game.

31:03.520 --> 31:08.880
If you held up a bag or a briefcase with a hundred thousand American dollars in it,

31:08.880 --> 31:10.880
I probably wouldn't get in a hot tub with you.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.240
I'm saying there's nothing you could do.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.160
Well, the money's wet for starters.

31:16.160 --> 31:16.960
Somebody wants that.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.680
Oh, Griffin, you've hit the nail on the head.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.720
You have to act like you don't want them to get in the hot tub.

31:23.760 --> 31:28.400
That's the only time anyone ever gets in a hot tub with me is when I'm like, I hope that

31:28.400 --> 31:30.800
I keep this hot tub all to myself.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.440
Oh, no, it's three middle aged people.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.080
That's a good point.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.800
I wonder when this question after sitting in the hot tub, are they just looking a little

31:36.800 --> 31:37.600
too thirsty?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.640
Are they maybe like a little wanting to get around too much?

31:40.640 --> 31:45.760
Maybe you go the other way and just anytime you see a person just yell like, please, no,

31:45.760 --> 31:46.400
please, no.

31:47.120 --> 31:47.600
Stay away.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.640
I'm dirty.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.840
This is my water.

31:51.120 --> 31:55.120
I would worry that maybe everyone in the apartment complex knows something you don't.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.640
If you're the only people that ever use the hot tub, maybe they're like, that's where

31:58.640 --> 32:00.080
all the raccoons pee.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.080
Like, holy shit, Travis, yes.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.640
You mean hepatitis canyon?

32:04.640 --> 32:05.360
No, thank you.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.240
I'd rather not.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.680
Wait, you get in that water hole where all those people died that one time?

32:10.720 --> 32:11.840
Chlamydia lagoon?

32:11.840 --> 32:12.400
No, thank you.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.680
No, thank you.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.080
That's the but that's the hot tub time machine.

32:16.080 --> 32:20.240
But the shitty one that takes you into the robot annihilated future.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.280
You don't want to get in that one.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.320
That's not a fun romp.

32:22.320 --> 32:23.600
Well, neither were the movies.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.120
Hey, the second one was dump.

32:27.120 --> 32:27.840
This is my brother.

32:27.840 --> 32:31.520
My brother and me started Justin Griffin and the only person who's seen both hot tub

32:31.520 --> 32:32.560
time machine movies.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.520
It was on a plane.

32:33.520 --> 32:48.960
My brother, my brother and me is supported in part by Casper, an online retailer of

32:48.960 --> 32:53.200
premium obsessively engineered mattresses for a fraction of the price.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.240
We have a Casper in our guest room and it is incredibly comfortable.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.560
I think at least one of you guys has slept on it, right?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.480
I think both of us.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.200
Both of us.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.240
Probably at different points.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.840
Yeah, it's a comfortable bed in there, right?

33:05.840 --> 33:10.640
Why I've slept on mattresses all across this great land of ours, Justin.

33:10.640 --> 33:14.080
Travis would know if he'd slept on a bed that I had previously slept on and that's

33:14.080 --> 33:15.120
all I'm going to say about it.

33:16.160 --> 33:16.560
Gross.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.320
They got a risk free trial.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.120
Slime time.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.200
You can try sleeping or sliming on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery and painless

33:25.200 --> 33:26.160
returns.

33:26.160 --> 33:30.560
Mattresses are made in America and they're really, really well priced.

33:30.560 --> 33:35.520
We're talking like 500 bucks for a twin mattress, 950 for a king like and that's

33:35.520 --> 33:36.800
the top end 950.

33:36.800 --> 33:42.960
It's to be nigh impossible to be in a mattress store and certainly not going to beat the

33:42.960 --> 33:43.600
quality.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.640
And you get to swamp them open in a really fun way.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.040
Swamp?

33:47.040 --> 33:47.520
Yeah.

33:47.520 --> 33:52.160
Yeah, they come all sealed up in a box and then you open them and they unfold like, you

33:52.160 --> 33:56.000
know, those little like plastic things used to drop in water and they got hot and foam

33:56.000 --> 33:58.240
things unfolded from them in the form of a dragon.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.640
That but a mattress.

34:01.760 --> 34:06.800
Our listeners can get $50 towards any mattress by visiting Casper.com slash my brother and

34:06.800 --> 34:09.520
using the promo code my brother.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.520
Don't throw the mattresses into hot water.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.080
Hey, listen, terms and conditions apply.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.120
The beds are all haunted.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.560
That's why they that's why they named it what they fucking named it.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.880
They try to sneak that shit in and that's not even the fine print.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.320
They put it in the big print and just hope that you don't even notice.

34:24.320 --> 34:24.880
I love them.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.600
They've been good to us.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.560
They've been real good to us.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.160
All the beds are haunted.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.000
Casper.com slash my brother.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.400
Got another sponsor here.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.120
Maybe you've heard of them.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.160
Harry's dot com.

34:34.160 --> 34:39.440
They sent me a box with a razor and some gel in it and it gave me a gave me a smooth finish.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.000
Should be called not Harry's dot com.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.320
How good is that new razor handle?

34:44.320 --> 34:45.680
It's so comfortable.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.400
It's good as hell.

34:46.400 --> 34:51.760
It's like holding a it's like holding a finely tuned sword.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.200
Did I cut out?

34:53.200 --> 34:53.920
Did you guys not?

34:53.920 --> 34:56.800
I said more like not Harry's dot com.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.080
Yeah, and it's a great point Travis and well made.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.320
Griffin, tell me about Harry's.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.560
Well, they supported us in part this week.

35:08.720 --> 35:12.640
Listen, buying razors is the worst fucking thing ever because they put them in in little

35:12.640 --> 35:15.040
Ocean's Eleven safes and you can't get in there.

35:15.040 --> 35:18.320
But you can't get in there because each of the razors cost a hundred thousand dollars.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.000
They cost they cost too much.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.920
That's why two guys started Harry's dot com.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.360
They sell high quality blades that provide a close comfortable shave for half the price

35:25.360 --> 35:26.560
that you're used to.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.080
So I know I said a hundred thousand dollars.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.600
So that would mean these are fifty thousand dollars.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.840
No, they're they're much, much cheaper than that.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.000
These are German engineered five blade cartridges.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.760
You get a close, comfy save.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.920
You get you got a good quality razor.

35:37.920 --> 35:41.280
You get a full refund if you're not happy and you get factory direct prices.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.240
You cut out the middleman.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.560
You say get the fuck out of here, CBS.

35:44.560 --> 35:49.200
Get out of here, Norman Reedus.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.480
What's the New York chain?

35:51.040 --> 35:52.240
No, that was it.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.600
If Norman Reedus tries to sell you some razors.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.920
They ship don't buy from him, scruffy little goon.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.320
They ship these razors right to your door.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.600
You can get a Truman starter set.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.040
It's a good option for new customers.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.720
It's an amazing deal for just fifteen dollars.

36:06.720 --> 36:11.360
You get the razor handle, get some moisturizing shave cream and three of Harry's five blade

36:11.360 --> 36:12.960
German engineered razors.

36:12.960 --> 36:17.200
You give all of our listeners five dollars off your first purchase at Harry's.

36:17.200 --> 36:22.320
That's H A R R Y S dot com and use the promo code my brother.

36:22.320 --> 36:22.800
All one word.

36:22.800 --> 36:27.120
That's Harry's H A R R Y S dot com and use the code my brother.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.160
All one word.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.680
More like not Harry's.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.720
God, Travis.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.840
Cause like cause you have hair and then you shave it off.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.440
Trav, read the personal message.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.000
You got it.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.600
This is to Molly Groupie and it's from Garrett Baird and the message is

36:41.600 --> 36:43.200
Happy birthday, Molly.

36:43.200 --> 36:48.000
You're an awesome cousin and as always, my favorite Facebook friend.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.040
I hope you're enjoying your birthday in snowy Wisconsin.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.960
I already know that I'm your favorite cousin, but I hope this really cements me further

36:54.960 --> 36:56.160
into that status.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.520
Much love, Garrett.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.160
And Trav, what's the requested time frame on this birthday message?

37:02.160 --> 37:04.640
That would be over two months ago, Justin.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.080
Hey, happy birthday, Molly.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.640
Sorry didn't- Garrett didn't get you nothing.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.000
He's trying his best.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.560
The beauty of this, Garrett, is not only have you submitted yourself as the favorite cousin,

37:16.560 --> 37:22.160
you can now fuck up a couple times like by having your message read two months late,

37:22.160 --> 37:24.000
perhaps or by- Totally bomb.

37:24.000 --> 37:24.960
Yeah, just whatever.

37:24.960 --> 37:30.320
Like you can get away with it now because not only did you get Molly a happy birthday

37:30.320 --> 37:34.720
message, you timed it out perfectly so that it was on our special 300th episode.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.880
Yeah, this is going to be such a big app.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.480
I got a message to Jabba J from Maddie.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.480
It says, Hey, my sweet Jabba J.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.760
It's me, your wife.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.480
We've been married for a year and it's great.

37:46.480 --> 37:47.760
I love you so much.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.040
Happy anniversary.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.720
I'm writing this as you're cracking up over Glass Shark for the millionth time.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.720
I think you love Glass Shark more than me.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.000
Sorry this got weirdly confrontational at the end.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.360
Justin just made that part up.

38:01.200 --> 38:06.080
And oh, got this one pretty darn.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.400
Wow, wow.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.760
April 24th is the requested time frame on that.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.840
So just about stuck the landing.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.040
I want you to know that Jabba shouldn't feel bad.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.520
I've listened to Glass Shark so many times.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.800
I may be reaching up towards a million too.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.440
You're not alone.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.880
Remind me, what was that?

38:24.880 --> 38:25.360
Which one?

38:25.360 --> 38:29.200
It was the one where we talked about Scott Bakula.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.160
Oh, okay, thank you.

38:30.160 --> 38:30.960
Does that narrow it down?

38:31.520 --> 38:32.020
Yeah.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.520
When Scott Bakula swam down that pool and ate that gift.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.240
Let's take people inside the show a little bit.

38:38.240 --> 38:41.680
We got a lot of guest spurts on the show this week, which is very exciting for us.

38:41.680 --> 38:47.760
There is one guest spurt that we have reached out to to try to book on our program that

38:47.760 --> 38:49.760
their manager gave us a pass-a-rooney.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.560
Just one strong pass.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.400
Just a strong pass.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.800
There is one human that we have.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.600
We haven't reached out to that many people because I don't know.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.080
There's not a lot of people that we think would be a great fit for this.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.200
There's one person.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.520
I'm not going to say who.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.400
But let's just say it was a polite but hard no.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.360
I think we've had a lot of people that we've reached out to who just didn't even bother

39:11.360 --> 39:11.920
to respond.

39:11.920 --> 39:16.080
This is the first one to just make sure you guys know, go fuck yourselves.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.960
It just said at the end, it just said, oh, no.

39:20.960 --> 39:25.200
And you know, sometimes you get a response from someone's rep and you think, oh, I bet

39:25.200 --> 39:27.280
that even didn't make it across the person's desk.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.920
I bet the rep just said no offhand.

39:29.920 --> 39:34.000
I would like to think that this was a solid no from the person themselves.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.680
Yeah, I think it's a personal.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.320
I like to think this came directly from the desk of...

39:40.320 --> 39:42.640
Let's say, bot-racula.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.800
Let's say, let's say got-dracula.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.480
OK, let's say Scott-bacula Jr.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.760
But maybe let's say bot-scacula.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.840
Like, I just want to say, though, for the record, in case he's listening to this, because

40:01.840 --> 40:06.960
maybe he was just too nervous to come on the show because he's such a big fan, I want to

40:06.960 --> 40:09.840
say it did not disappoint me in the slightest.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.160
I would have been disappointed if he'd agreed to it.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.760
Yeah, you know what?

40:13.760 --> 40:15.840
He's just, he's like big fish.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.600
You know, it's going to take me a while to reel in Scott-bacula, but when I do, there's

40:19.600 --> 40:20.080
like an intense respect.

40:20.080 --> 40:20.640
Then you'll die.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.520
That'll be the last day of your life.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.080
You'll die and then he'll carry you out into the lake.

40:26.080 --> 40:30.720
Yeah, Scott-bacula won't even go see Hamilton because he's worried Lynn will try to get

40:30.720 --> 40:31.520
him to talk to him.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.020
Yeah.

40:33.200 --> 40:37.840

40:53.120 --> 40:56.160
And if it's not clear, this is a comedy podcast.

40:56.160 --> 40:56.720
Beef out.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.560
Here's one from Level 9000.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.840
Yeah, Drew Drew, Drew Davenport.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.400
Thank you, Drew.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.320
It's by Yajuru Answers user, The Mystic, who asks.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.000
What do pilots dream about?

41:19.120 --> 41:21.520
Fucking oh man, I didn't even read this.

41:21.520 --> 41:28.400
The top answer from livergirl98 is you would have to ask pilots.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.680
That's fucking great, yeah.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.640
You went to Yajuru Answers, not pilot answers.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.720
What do you guys think pilots dream about?

41:34.720 --> 41:35.840
Well, that's the thing, right?

41:36.480 --> 41:39.440
They get to experience the majesty of flight.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.480
Sorry, can you say that word again?

41:42.480 --> 41:46.160
Yeah, I added like an extra like an umlaut syllable to it.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.480
There was a U in there somewhere.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.800
They get to experience the magic of flying.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.960
You were transferred to Grey Gardens for a second.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.760
They get to experience the magic of flout.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.120
Fly it, mother.

41:57.120 --> 41:57.760
Fly it.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.800
Of floutus.

41:58.800 --> 42:03.120
They dream about like not being in the air and they're like, I'm walking.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.720
That would probably be a wonderful break for them.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.560
Yeah, because you know what I bet?

42:08.560 --> 42:12.960
I get nervous when I drive like on the freeway and I'm going like 60 miles an hour.

42:13.680 --> 42:18.960
I bet like the whole time you're flying a plane, it's nonstop terrifying.

42:20.000 --> 42:20.560
You think?

42:20.560 --> 42:28.880
You're probably just tense the whole time because like you know like you're defying gravity.

42:29.520 --> 42:33.040
You're going against everything that is right and natural.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.680
Is that outside the window?

42:35.680 --> 42:36.480
Yeah, it's David Copperfield.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.200
It's David Copperfield.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.080
There he goes again.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.160
There goes my hero.

42:40.160 --> 42:40.720
Up to space.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.000
Oh shit, he's not coming down this-

42:42.000 --> 42:42.560
Oh fuck.

42:43.120 --> 42:44.160
Breaker breaker.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.360
Just saw David Copperfield die.

42:46.560 --> 42:47.600
Feeling pretty upset about it.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.480
This is now a truck.

42:48.480 --> 42:52.720
Being a pilot is really an abomination.

42:52.720 --> 42:53.200
Yeah, yeah.

42:54.400 --> 42:58.080
Maybe they just dream of one day being freed from their flight to prison.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.600
What do you mean?

42:59.600 --> 43:01.280
Like they don't have to fly anymore.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.320
They're tired of breaking the laws of man.

43:04.320 --> 43:09.440
Yeah, but it's also like once you've done it, it's so addictive.

43:09.440 --> 43:13.040
The power of rising above the pole.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.960
You're trapped by this big blue bastard and you're just being drawn back to Earth,

43:16.960 --> 43:19.680
but then escaping Earth, but then having to return.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.480
That struggle.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.120
That struggle.

43:21.120 --> 43:26.240
That struggle of being free for one moment and knowing you have to return and knowing

43:26.240 --> 43:31.440
that nothing in life will ever please you the way that that moment of breaking the grasp

43:31.440 --> 43:33.200
of this planetary asshole.

43:35.200 --> 43:38.560
The hardest part of being a pilot isn't flying the plane.

43:38.560 --> 43:43.520
It's hiding your utter delight and it all going smoothly and landing safely.

43:43.520 --> 43:47.440
Like you want to hop out and just kiss the ground and rejoice,

43:47.440 --> 43:49.040
but you don't want the passengers to see that.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.560
You don't want to get on the horn and just be like,

43:50.560 --> 43:52.480
hey everybody, really glad that went well.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.640
Can you believe that shit?

43:54.640 --> 43:57.200
Every pilot after they get off a plane, if you actually hang,

43:57.200 --> 44:00.400
everybody gets off the plane as quick as they possibly can because people are monsters.

44:00.400 --> 44:03.280
If you hung out for like a second and you thank the pilot because he just defied the

44:03.280 --> 44:06.560
laws of gravity, you would hear every pilot when they're done flying,

44:06.560 --> 44:08.480
they always say like, never again.

44:08.480 --> 44:15.920
That was, I swear to God, I say it every time, that was the last time that was so dangerous.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.200
There's no way.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.200
I didn't think I'd be able to pull it off that time.

44:19.200 --> 44:19.920
I'm not going to lie.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.400
Like I just look, I looked down and suddenly it was like,

44:22.400 --> 44:25.360
I couldn't remember what I was supposed to do.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.680
You know, it was like, there's no way this goes well.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.880
Every time if you're a pilot in DC and you ask people,

44:30.880 --> 44:31.680
so where are you flying to?

44:31.680 --> 44:33.120
They say, New York.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.880
Are you fucking shit?

44:34.880 --> 44:35.840
Are you kidding me?

44:35.840 --> 44:38.480
Seriously, you're going to go up there to get there?

44:39.040 --> 44:39.840
Seriously?

44:39.840 --> 44:40.480
Just walk.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.760
Every time a pilot gets told that their flight's going like over the ocean,

44:43.760 --> 44:46.720
they're just like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.400
What am I supposed to do when it goes wrong?

44:49.200 --> 44:52.640
We're just like, we're just like chomping boats flavor right now.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.600
That's their game.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.120
We do the sky, they do the sea.

44:55.120 --> 44:58.480
That's always the weirdest part of the in-flight announcement when the pilot tries to talk

44:58.480 --> 45:01.040
everyone into getting off the plane and getting on a cruise ship.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.120
Wouldn't you guys rather?

45:03.120 --> 45:05.600
They have like casinos and like bars and stuff.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.720
That sounds way more fun.

45:07.440 --> 45:12.400
The real answer to this question is it depends on which pilot you're talking about.

45:12.400 --> 45:16.960
Okay, so if you're the co-pilot, you go to sleep every night and dream of one day

45:16.960 --> 45:17.920
just getting that big chair.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.680
Killing the pilot.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.520
Killing the pilot and getting that big chair where you finally get to take control.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.480
If you're a pilot, then you dream of becoming the super pilot,

45:26.480 --> 45:30.240
the pilot that rides on the top of the plane and is actually steering the whole thing.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.680
The one that Teen Wolf's up there.

45:31.680 --> 45:36.480
You wanna get up there, grab the reins, and bring this baby on home.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.560
A pilot, co-pilot, and super pilot.

45:38.560 --> 45:42.400
And the super pilot just Teen Wolf's on top the entire flight.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.440
The super pilot doesn't sleep.

45:45.440 --> 45:49.280
Doesn't sleep, doesn't need to dream high on cocaine all day.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.240
No, he just leads the pack of horses that power the plane.

45:53.360 --> 45:57.360
Do you guys think that pilots, they dream about all this,

45:57.360 --> 46:01.440
like the sexy shaped clouds that they saw that day?

46:01.440 --> 46:05.600
I saw one, swear to God, Jeff, looked just like a boob.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.960
Saw one, Jeff, you're not gonna believe this shit, dude.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.440
Round.

46:09.440 --> 46:10.480
Check this shit out, dude.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.640
Dude, check it out.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.400
It was round, but then there was like a little hole in the middle of it.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.400
Jeff, I swear to God, dude.

46:19.440 --> 46:20.720
Dylan, Dylan, wake up.

46:21.520 --> 46:21.840
Wake up.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.640
Get your camera.

46:22.640 --> 46:24.000
Fuck that cloud.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.640
Dude, two nimbuses came together against a Cirrus.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.560
A huge hog, dude.

46:28.560 --> 46:31.120
I fucking like lost my nut, bro.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.880
Bro, it looked like a huge hog, and I loved it.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.280
Dude, I saw this huge old hog cloud,

46:37.280 --> 46:39.840
and you know I'm gonna be dreaming about that tonight.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.720
They don't teach you that stuff in aviation college.

46:42.720 --> 46:46.640
Wish I was the fucking super pilot so I could have just like gone face first.

46:47.200 --> 46:51.200
Just did a swan dive into that big old beautiful cumulo hog.

46:52.480 --> 46:55.600
If I was a pilot, I would tell everybody my Instagram username

46:55.600 --> 46:58.880
when the flight took off, and then I'd just keep hitting them with pics the whole flight.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.680
Hey, got a new one up.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.120
Let's get those likes going.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.480
Let's get the faves.

47:04.480 --> 47:05.280
Here's a question.

47:05.280 --> 47:10.240
I take a figure drawing class in college where we have to draw nude models.

47:10.240 --> 47:14.480
Drawing the model no longer feels awkward, with the exception of one model in particular.

47:14.480 --> 47:18.560
My friends and I have noticed that rather than staring at the wall or an inanimate object,

47:18.560 --> 47:22.000
she stares directly at each of our eyes as we draw her.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.680
If we try to look away or break eye contact,

47:23.680 --> 47:27.120
she'll continue to stare at each of us one by one,

47:27.120 --> 47:30.240
with her lips upturned in a sort of strange smile.

47:30.880 --> 47:36.160
Brothers, how can we make these three hour long class periods less uncomfortable?

47:36.160 --> 47:37.840
That's from nude drawing in New York.

47:37.840 --> 47:38.800
Holy shit.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.400
This is exactly what I would do if I were in this scenario.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.880
And I would just keep shouting,

47:46.880 --> 47:48.000
Gaze upon me!

47:49.680 --> 47:50.560
Drink it in!

47:50.560 --> 47:55.120
Yes, this is the human body, and it is all supposed to look like this.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.560
None of this is weird.

47:57.760 --> 48:02.720
Your eyes may be tempted to merely flip past my dark materials,

48:02.720 --> 48:04.320
but please stay.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.920
Let them feast.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.040
Let them rip past.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.240
Fill your corneas with my beauty.

48:10.240 --> 48:14.560
Drink deep from my fleshy torso.

48:14.560 --> 48:15.920
We're in this together.

48:15.920 --> 48:19.680
This moment, you and I, paint, paint like the wind.

48:19.680 --> 48:20.640
Paint like the wind.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.440
Two flesh becomes one?

48:23.440 --> 48:24.240
I love it.

48:24.960 --> 48:28.320
Millions of years of evolution have led to this moment.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.360
Let them feast.

48:29.360 --> 48:33.280
My body shall forever be the standard by which you judge beauty.

48:33.280 --> 48:35.520
Don't let this moment pass by, Derek.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.720
I would definitely, definitely memorize a class list.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.400
Oh, for sure.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.880
Which one of you motherfuckers is Brandon?

48:45.680 --> 48:48.400
I hear you on the spelling bee in third grade.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.240
Are you proud of that now?

48:50.240 --> 48:51.040
Holy shit.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.640
I just got a fucking great idea.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.040
You're in a life drawing class, right?

48:55.040 --> 48:58.880
You're the life drawing person is nude, nude, totally nude

48:59.520 --> 49:00.720
up in front of the class.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.480
Okay, great.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.000
What's the art teacher doing?

49:04.000 --> 49:04.800
Nothing, right?

49:04.800 --> 49:06.960
They're saying like, draw this motherfucker.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.560
I don't know why they don't have clothes on.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.060
Sorry.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.360
Do a great job drawing them.

49:12.560 --> 49:18.000
Why don't you make the nude model a teacher?

49:18.000 --> 49:22.160
But not the art teacher, because they're not gonna have anything to add.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.120
What if you could go to your nude drawing class

49:25.120 --> 49:29.360
and that nude drawing person was also teaching you anthropology?

49:29.360 --> 49:32.080
Oh, double, double learning.

49:32.080 --> 49:33.040
Double learning.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.880
So you're like drawing them nude.

49:34.880 --> 49:38.720
And like when you hear key stuff, you already have a paper and a pen there.

49:38.720 --> 49:41.360
You're just like taking notes around their figure.

49:42.080 --> 49:45.600
I like the idea better of the art teacher doing it,

49:45.600 --> 49:49.440
because then they can be like, now, Brandon, I've scoped out your work.

49:49.440 --> 49:53.360
And I notice that you tend to skimp out on the butt meat.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.560
Don't, Brandon.

49:54.560 --> 49:55.760
It's juicy, Brandon.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.400
Don't act like it.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.160
Brandon, look where I'm pointing.

49:58.160 --> 49:58.720
I'm gonna move.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.360
Guys, everybody stop drawing for a second.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.560
Brandon, look where I'm pointing.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.160
Draw that butt.

50:04.160 --> 50:04.560
Good.

50:04.560 --> 50:04.880
All right.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.240
I'm back in position.

50:06.240 --> 50:09.200
I bet it'd be a real power move if the art teacher was walking around

50:09.200 --> 50:11.680
looking at everyone's drawings of you drawing, you know,

50:11.680 --> 50:13.040
of everyone drawing the nude model.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.920
But when they got to yours, you had drawn what you imagined

50:15.920 --> 50:17.360
the art teacher looks like nude.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.320
I don't think that's appropriate behavior.

50:22.320 --> 50:26.080
And then you just like look at them and go, I don't know what happened.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.040
I started with them.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.160
And then one thing led to another.

50:28.160 --> 50:28.560
You know what?

50:28.560 --> 50:30.640
I'm going to drop out of college now.

50:30.640 --> 50:33.440
Now, Brandon, I see that you haven't painted anything

50:33.440 --> 50:38.560
as much as you have pencil traced Spider-Man from one of your comic books.

50:38.560 --> 50:41.520
And let me just say, you got it perfect.

50:41.520 --> 50:42.000
A+.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.280
You got the goods.

50:43.280 --> 50:44.320
You got the goods.

50:44.880 --> 50:45.600
And I do too.

50:46.320 --> 50:46.560
Whip.

50:48.160 --> 50:48.640
That's right.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.440
You knew all along.

50:49.440 --> 50:50.960
I really am the real Spider-Man.

50:50.960 --> 50:54.800
All those movies you see up there, you think those are works of fun fantasy fiction.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.120
Nope.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.400
It's me, your art teacher.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.760
Mrs. Spider-Man.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.880
Mrs. Naked art teacher, Mrs. Spider-Man.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.080
I know you would think it should be Spider-

51:04.080 --> 51:04.480
Whatever.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.840
Don't worry about it.

51:05.840 --> 51:10.720
This ointment that I rubbed all over my body for a joke that I did 50 minutes ago

51:10.720 --> 51:12.080
is like irritating.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.600
My skin feels bad on me.

51:14.640 --> 51:15.280
Yeah.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.400
You don't like it, huh?

51:16.400 --> 51:17.120
I don't like how-

51:17.680 --> 51:18.960
I thought it would make me feel good.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.280
The opposite is true.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.640
Should we do one more Yahoo?

51:22.640 --> 51:23.120
Yes.

51:23.120 --> 51:23.360
Okay.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.040
Let's do a quick one.

51:25.680 --> 51:26.160
Yes.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.240
I also have four closers this week.

51:28.800 --> 51:32.000
I thought this episode 300, let's just have a little pinata there at the end.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.360
This first one was sent in by Aaron Keys.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.240
Thank you, Aaron.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.160
It's by an anonymous Yahoo user.

51:36.160 --> 51:40.880
Uh, this anonymous user asks, I am looking for hype, clean songs.

51:40.880 --> 51:44.400
I need an intro song for an event I do with middle schoolers.

51:44.400 --> 51:49.360
Songs like Dessert, Awesome, by the Black Eyed Peas, The Time Is Now.

51:49.360 --> 51:54.720
They have to be clean songs, not even clean versions of songs, like truly cleans songs.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.960
Also trying to use current relevant songs.

51:56.960 --> 52:00.560
So staying away from rock songs, like Seven Nation Army or Crazy Train.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.640
All suggestions are appreciated.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.680
Doesn't sound like it.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.560
Doesn't sound like it.

52:06.400 --> 52:07.680
Doesn't sound like you appreciate-

52:07.680 --> 52:09.440
Because I responded to this Crazy Train.

52:09.440 --> 52:10.720
And you say, get the fuck out of here.

52:10.720 --> 52:11.600
Get the fuck out of here.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.880
I told you no.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.960
What about just the entirety of Wilinium?

52:15.840 --> 52:17.280
Any- Anything from the will.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.040
The will you.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.120
Is it just language?

52:21.120 --> 52:23.120
Language or I think adult concepts.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.040
Like a lot of Sugar Ray's music.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.560
You hear it and you go, this is fun music.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.000
I'd love to share this with my family.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.080
But then you hear it and there's adult situations in there.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.240
Like a one night stand, that's a sex thing.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.240
Yeah, and the halo I believe is a condom.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.840
You think it's a condom?

52:35.840 --> 52:37.200
And that's a prophylactic.

52:37.200 --> 52:40.560
Why would you have a condom hanging from the corner of your four post bed?

52:40.560 --> 52:42.400
That's not where the condoms go.

52:42.400 --> 52:43.760
It sounds like you had a really wild night.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.480
But I certainly don't want to sing about it in front of my middle school class.

52:46.480 --> 52:47.440
That's the problem, Griffin.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.720
You got to get to the bottom of the true meaning of all the songs.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.320
Maybe there's no wordy dirts.

52:52.320 --> 52:57.200
But maybe they say like, you know, I'm riding on a dragon.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.200
And you're like, oh, that's heroin, I think.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.080
Or cocaine.

53:00.080 --> 53:03.040
Well, and you also have to keep in mind the intent of the artist,

53:03.040 --> 53:04.480
because you listen to any Sugar Ray music.

53:04.480 --> 53:06.400
And even the cleanest Sugar Ray songs,

53:06.400 --> 53:08.400
hard for me to like enjoy the subject matter of it,

53:08.400 --> 53:10.960
because I know that that day that that song was recorded,

53:10.960 --> 53:12.560
Mark McGrath probably punched a kid.

53:13.120 --> 53:14.320
Probably punched a child.

53:14.320 --> 53:16.880
And it's like, I don't know if I can feel okay about that.

53:16.880 --> 53:17.920
And this is a fact.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.800
Every Sugar Ray song is about masturbation.

53:22.560 --> 53:23.760
Go back and listen.

53:23.760 --> 53:24.960
I just want to fly, yeah.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.160
In the rap part, maybe you listen to the chorus

53:28.160 --> 53:30.000
and you don't listen to the rapping going on behind it.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.080
But the guy's just like, jerking off all night.

53:34.080 --> 53:34.720
Yep.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.320
You know, have you ever heard the phrase,

53:36.320 --> 53:37.520
I'm going to go Sugar my Ray?

53:38.400 --> 53:38.880
That's why.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.120
I'm going to go McGrath and my Mark.

53:41.920 --> 53:43.440
Justin, a clean hype song for you?

53:44.880 --> 53:46.720
Just something by Raffi, I guess.

53:46.720 --> 53:47.120
One of the-

53:48.480 --> 53:50.880
The baby blue gives me fucking pumped, dog.

53:50.880 --> 53:52.480
Like the hard ones, you know what I mean?

53:53.200 --> 53:55.440
He's like, especially if I was in Canada,

53:55.440 --> 53:57.200
if he just like ripped into like,

53:57.200 --> 54:01.520
if I could get Raffi to do a heavy metal version of C-A-N-A-D-A,

54:01.520 --> 54:05.200
like I would, I think that that would really get me like ripe

54:05.200 --> 54:06.080
before battle.

54:06.080 --> 54:06.800
Yeah, man.

54:06.800 --> 54:07.920
For going into battle.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.120
What if he did a song called Adult Beluga,

54:11.840 --> 54:16.000
but it was an all curse word version of Baby Beluga,

54:16.000 --> 54:19.680
where every, I don't just mean you drop some curses in there.

54:20.800 --> 54:25.200
I'm saying you replace every noun, every verb,

54:25.200 --> 54:30.960
every conjunction, and then the one time he says fuck

54:30.960 --> 54:32.400
in the song Baby Beluga,

54:32.400 --> 54:34.480
you would just switch that out with another curse word.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.160
Yeah, you wouldn't switch that one.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.080
You don't want to mess with the artist's intent too much.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.920
He definitely meant to say fuck at that one part.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.760
This big fucking whale, Baby Beluga.

54:46.640 --> 54:49.600
Can you believe this shit, Baby Beluga?

54:49.600 --> 54:52.080
It's as big as shit, but it starts little,

54:52.080 --> 54:53.360
but it's still big.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.400
I'm just saying comparatively fuck.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.760
That's two curse words, Travis.

54:57.760 --> 55:00.480
We explicitly said there's only one curse word.

55:00.480 --> 55:03.280
There's only one secret curse word.

55:03.280 --> 55:05.440
Aw, Dick, look at all that plankton.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.560
He's going to eat it all up.

55:08.560 --> 55:09.600
We're almost the end of our show,

55:09.600 --> 55:12.480
but before we close, we have just a few more former guest

55:12.480 --> 55:14.320
spurts talking about how our show has changed their life.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.240
So let's hear from now.

55:16.800 --> 55:20.400
Greetings, brothers and listeners to Brothers,

55:20.400 --> 55:22.640
and I'm talking about specific brothers.

55:22.640 --> 55:26.160
Travis, Justin, Griffin, my brothers,

55:26.160 --> 55:27.120
my brothers and them.

55:27.920 --> 55:32.160
This is John Hodgman of the Judge John Hodgman podcast

55:32.160 --> 55:36.720
and once, and I dare hope, future guest pert

55:37.520 --> 55:39.920
on the My Brother, My Brother and Me podcast.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.720
Appearing on My Brother, My Brother and Me

55:42.720 --> 55:45.920
was very important to me because it reminded me

55:45.920 --> 55:49.200
that I am an only child and I have no brothers

55:49.200 --> 55:52.080
and am thus incredibly sad.

55:52.080 --> 55:56.320
Sad and wiser still to have bathed in their wisdom.

55:56.320 --> 56:04.720
Also, via them, I managed to meet Lin-Manuel Miranda

56:06.160 --> 56:10.800
of Hamilton fame and My Brother, My Brothers and Me's fame.

56:12.240 --> 56:14.080
And that has been a great delight in my life.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.840
And the confluence of meeting all those brothers

56:17.840 --> 56:23.120
and that one, Lin, inspired me in my new life's work,

56:24.320 --> 56:28.240
My Brothers, My Brothers and Me, a rap musical,

56:29.760 --> 56:31.920
which I've already copywritten in Singapore

56:32.720 --> 56:34.640
so no one can stop me.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.400
Thanks, guys, for giving me a purpose in life.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.640
Hey, this is Dan Savage from the Savage Lovecast

56:40.640 --> 56:43.600
and I just wanna offer my congratulations to everybody,

56:43.600 --> 56:46.160
to all the brothers at My Brother, My Brother and Me

56:46.160 --> 56:49.200
on the occasion of your 300th episode.

56:49.200 --> 56:50.560
And I wanna once again thank you guys

56:50.560 --> 56:53.520
for having me on your show as a guest

56:53.520 --> 56:55.600
because my career was really going nowhere

56:55.600 --> 56:56.800
until that moment.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.560
Thank you, My Brother, My Brother and Me

56:58.560 --> 57:00.240
for all you've done for me.

57:00.240 --> 57:03.120
Hey, this is John Roderick of Seattle's

57:03.120 --> 57:04.640
The Long Winters Band.

57:05.440 --> 57:07.840
You know, obviously, to those of you

57:07.840 --> 57:11.200
who are My Brother, My Brother and Me fans,

57:11.840 --> 57:15.200
the guys a long time ago wrote me

57:15.200 --> 57:17.680
kinda out of the blue and asked if they could use my song,

57:18.400 --> 57:21.600
It's a Departure, as the theme song for the podcast.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.840
And at the time, I had never heard of these ding-a-lings

57:23.840 --> 57:26.880
and I was like, yeah, okay, kids,

57:26.880 --> 57:31.040
you can use my song as the theme to your podcast.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.880
I hope it goes well for you.

57:32.880 --> 57:34.880
I hope you make it past five episodes.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.360
Good luck, Godspeed.

57:37.360 --> 57:41.120
And of course, history played out in such a way

57:41.120 --> 57:43.840
that it was a successful podcast

57:43.840 --> 57:46.880
and it introduced a lot of people to my music

57:46.880 --> 57:50.880
and over time, I've grown to be friends

57:51.840 --> 57:53.520
with the McElroy brothers,

57:53.520 --> 57:58.080
who are lovely, lovely, lovely people.

57:58.080 --> 57:59.600
Their whole extended family,

57:59.600 --> 58:02.880
which frankly, sort of roams the earth

58:03.840 --> 58:06.480
in a way that's vaguely culty, honestly,

58:06.480 --> 58:07.680
when you see them all together.

58:08.880 --> 58:11.920
You get that kind of strange feeling

58:11.920 --> 58:16.080
that it's maybe like one of those hippie families

58:16.080 --> 58:19.120
that travels around in a old converted school bus

58:19.120 --> 58:21.840
and I don't know, maybe has some strange

58:21.840 --> 58:24.240
unorthodox practices, but nonetheless,

58:24.240 --> 58:26.800
and in fact, even, let me say,

58:28.640 --> 58:31.280
let me say that that has influenced me as well

58:31.280 --> 58:32.480
because it made me realize

58:32.480 --> 58:35.760
that I wanted to be kind of part of a weird hippie cult,

58:35.760 --> 58:37.440
but I don't have two other brothers.

58:37.440 --> 58:41.280
So I've started to have to manufacture that in my own life,

58:41.280 --> 58:42.640
but that's beside the point.

58:43.360 --> 58:47.600
What I want to say is that my brother and me

58:47.600 --> 58:51.440
and the entire, again, weird cult of Max Fun Con

58:52.320 --> 58:53.760
or the Maximum Fun Network,

58:53.760 --> 58:55.280
I'm really getting kind of lost here,

58:57.440 --> 59:00.240
again, because frankly, I'm not sure what they do,

59:00.240 --> 59:01.440
I've never listened to their podcast,

59:01.440 --> 59:05.280
but they have been, they've been very influential on me,

59:05.280 --> 59:09.840
on my career, and I know that a lot of you

59:09.840 --> 59:14.640
have discovered my music as a result of listening to it

59:14.640 --> 59:18.080
repeatedly over and over and listening to the brothers

59:18.080 --> 59:21.360
extol my virtues and sing my praises to you.

59:21.360 --> 59:23.360
I can't think of a more generous group

59:23.360 --> 59:26.480
of weird West Virginia mountain people,

59:26.480 --> 59:29.280
and so I would like to thank them and congratulate them

59:29.280 --> 59:33.040
on their 40 years of service to the podcasting industry.

59:33.040 --> 59:35.600
Boy, that's all I have to say, except that you should all,

59:35.600 --> 59:38.560
also listen to my podcast, Roderick on the Line.

59:38.560 --> 59:40.400
I don't know why you don't already,

59:40.400 --> 59:45.280
I'm kind of astonished because I feel like my podcast

59:45.280 --> 59:47.840
should be as big as my brother and me.

59:48.560 --> 59:51.920
I don't have the two other brothers, maybe that's why.

59:53.040 --> 59:58.160
But so with that, I love you guys, good job,

59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.200
thanks for continuing to make me relevant,

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.240
even as I decline into late middle age.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.880
And good luck, Godspeed, cheers.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.160
Thank you all, we're at the end of our program now,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.320
episode 300, and I just want to take a moment

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.840
to say a very sincere thank you.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.680
We've been at this for six years,

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.360
if you can believe that shit,

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.280
and a lot of people told us that this would never work.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.280
A lot of people try to stand in our way

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.000
and try to mess our show up and like just,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.080
and like just mess everything up and ruin it for us,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.040
and they never did because of you fine people listening.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.760
It's really meant the world to us,

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.280
as a show that started as an excuse for us

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.520
to just like talk to each other more

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.280
because we had to move to separate places.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.520
It has become kind of an extended family for me,

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.320
and I feel really lucky to have you all here

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.640
week in and week out, and even for the bad ones,

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.760
you still find something to like about them,

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.520
and I've always really appreciated that.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:06.640
We quite sincerely would not be where we are

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.680
if it weren't for you.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.520
I mean, word of mouth and you guys liking the show

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.080
and telling people to listen and share it

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.360
has been the most powerful force driving this show,

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.920
and I go through the emails every week,

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.200
and I see on Twitter people talking about

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.960
loving the show and liking the show,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.800
and it means the world to me.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.400
I put out the call for people to send in

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.200
what's changed in their lives

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.200
since listening to my brother and my brother and me,

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.240
and I got like over 150 responses.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.440
I edited down a thing that you'll hear later on

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.560
at the end of the show, but I was touched.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.040
Like literally, I teared up just at the response

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.960
and everybody with everything,

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.080
all the nice things you guys said, it meant a lot to me.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.800
I wasn't able to put all of them in

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.480
because I ended up with like a half hour's worth of audio.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.240
And this has been maybe our most masturbatory episode,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.880
but that seemed a little, like we don't want to finish.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.760
You know what I mean?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.480
Maybe as a thank you, a genuine thank you

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.080
for these people who have changed our lives,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.920
maybe fewer jerk off jokes.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.000
We won't talk about the tantric masturbation

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.760
that is 300 episodes.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.720
Yeah, fantastic.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.360
Yeah, no, seriously, you've changed our lives.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.640
Thank you, thank you.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.080
And I will eventually put out maybe like a YouTube video

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.120
or a special audio thing of all the responses I got

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.920
because they were all so great.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.600
I want everyone to be able to hear all of them.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.520
And thank you to our guest spurts who sounded off.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.280
We had Lin-Manuel Miranda, we got John Hodgman,

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.320
Elizabeth Gilbert, John Roderick, Dan Savage,

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.560
Cameron Esposito, Bill Corbett.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.880
We also want to say thank you to Max Fun.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.800
We joined Max Fun on what, episode 32?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.000
Yeah, like 268 episodes ago.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.840
And we would not be where we are if it weren't for Max Fun.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.320
And we have so many shows on Max Fun now.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.800
Thank you to Max Fun.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.240
They just added a new show that I am a huge fan of already

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.600
called the Beef and Dairy Network.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.120
Oh, God, it's so good.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.200
Listen to episode eight, it'll blow your mind.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.720
It's my favorite episode.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.760
I feel like I've learned a lot

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.520
about how cheese and steak get made.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.640
It's so good, you guys.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.320
It's a very short show too, which I love.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.680
Yeah, and it's funny and weird and it's great.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.800

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920
Thanks to John Roderick and The Long Winters

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.640
for the use of our theme song.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.640
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.640
I think we're gonna keep it going through volume two,

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.440
just like the fan reaction has been so great.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.840
So let's keep that tune rocking

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.280
and you can hear it on that album,

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.120
Putting the Days to Bed, go buy it and listen to it.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.800
Let's wrap this thing up.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.960
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.200
Here's a salvo of final yahoos

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.840
because I found four really good final yahoos

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.080
and I didn't want to just trash three of them.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.720
And stick around afterwards for the whole

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.280
thanks NBNBAM memories thing.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.520
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.160
Thank you, Drew.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.240
It's by yadrewanswersuseranonymous who asks,

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.520
do members of Linkin Park smoke marijuana?

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.880
Drew sent this one in too.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.440
Thank you, Drew.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.200
It's by yahooanswersuserkurth who says,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.920
do you think Winona Ryder is bad?

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.760
Brooks Oglesby sent this one in.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.320
Thank you, Brooks.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.120
It's by yahooanswersusererickkartman who says,

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.280
do you think the KFC in heaven will have a bigger menu?

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.600
Final one was sent in by ridinghigh, Zoe Kinski.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.080
Thank you, Zoe.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.400
It's by yahooanswersuserkurth who asks,

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.680
can I hire someone to do vape tricks

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.200
at my son's birthday party?

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:57.680
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.880
I'm still Justin McElroy.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.920
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.560
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:19.920
Kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.920
Maximumfun.org.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.960
Comedy and culture.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.000
Artist-owned.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.280
Listener-supported.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.120
Since I started listening to music,

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.120
I've been listening to music for a long time.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.120
I've been listening to music for a long time.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.120
I've been listening to music for a long time.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.840
Since I started listening to my brother, my brother and me.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.960
Since I started listening.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.400
Since I started listening.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.000
Since I started listening.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.960
Since I've started listening.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.080
Since I started listening.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.120
Since I started listening to my brother, my brother and me.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.280
My commute has gone from miserable to ooh mommy.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.760
Sales for my haunted doll business have been great.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.160
I've come to appreciate the F-bomb

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.400
and those who use it liberally with relish, style and panache.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:05.840
I started to figure out that I was very weird in very different ways.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.600
I laugh a hell of a lot more.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.520
I've discovered I'm not the only one that asks random questions to themselves.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.600
Things that, if you ever asked anyone else,

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.360
they'd wonder if you've been drinking all day.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.640
I've discovered the beauty of ASMR.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.920
I'm at the love of my life.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.000
We got engaged, we got married,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.640
and we even drove round trip from Nebraska to Minneapolis

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.320
to listen to three goofballs from West Virginia give hilariously bad advice.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.480
I've started calling my own brothers more.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.480
We live very different lives in different parts of our country

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.480
and it's kind of hard to keep in contact.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.360
That wasn't really funny, but I hope my German accent makes it funny.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.720
I can no longer tell my students great job

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.560
without saying it like that or just busting out laughing.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.960
I now refer to everything in my life as boys.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.680
I saw a fish a few days ago and I thought, oh, that's a wet boy.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.320
That's not right, but I love it.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.480
I've learned to use jelly as a tool to climb my way up the social ladder.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.920
To quote Archimedes,

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.360
give me jelly in a place to stand and I will move the world.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.120
I got my master's degree from college, not university.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.240
This is America.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.760
I started saying things like my dude and fish lifters a lot.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.760
I've achieved notoriety beyond my mildest dreams.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.960
I make my girlfriend laugh a lot more by quoting the show,

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.000
mostly when I say, ooh, mommy.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.400
People have stopped sitting next to me on the subway.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.680
I've graduated high school.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.440
I broke a Guinness world record.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.960
I won a national championship.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.080
I'm halfway done college, and most importantly, I've grown a mustache.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.440
My nine and seven-year-old daughters have learned words like fuck,

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.520
shit, jizz, dick, hog, and of course, hachi-machi.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.000
Hey, McElroys, it's your old pal Ira.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.200
Thanks to MBMB AM, whenever I introduce myself to a stranger as Ira Ray,

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.000
there's a pretty good chance that they'll immediately respond with,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.400
are you Ira Ray, which wouldn't make any sense in any world other than this one.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.120
So thanks.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.800
My housemate Bob Peterson upgraded from a one-horsepower

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.960
KitchenAid standing mixer to a 1.5-horsepower KitchenAid standing mixer.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.080
I met the love of my life, an equally weird, if not weirder, partner in crime.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.400
I just can't stop fucking ghosts.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.040
I've become a nun.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.000
I'm pretty sure that's an unrelated development, though.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.280
I've started to slowly metamorphosize into a beautiful butterfly,

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.880
where each segment is a different McElroy brother, and I couldn't be happier about it.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.200
I laugh every time I meet somebody named Ron, Deborah, or Darrell.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.800
Thanks, MBMB AM.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.840
Thanks, m'Bim Bam.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.160
Thanks.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:32.880
Thank you.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.200
Thanks.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:33.520
Thanks.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:33.920
Thanks.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.320
Thanks.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:34.640
Thank you.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:34.960
Thanks.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.360
Thanks.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.480
Thanks, m'Bim Bam.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.040
Thanks!

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.160
Thanks, m'Bim Bam.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.440
Thanks, m'Bim Bam.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.760
Thank you, MBMB AM.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.240
Thanks.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.520
Thanks, MBMB AM.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.240
Thanks.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.760
Thanks, MBMB AM.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.200
Thank you, MBMB AM.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:47.520
Thanks.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.400
Thanks, m'Bim Bam.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.440
Thanks, m'Bim Bam.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.440
Thanks MBNBAM!
