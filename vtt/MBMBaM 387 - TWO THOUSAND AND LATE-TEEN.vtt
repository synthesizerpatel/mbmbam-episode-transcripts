00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:46.080
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother,

00:46.080 --> 00:50.320
and me at Advice Show for the Modron Era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.640 --> 00:57.520
And I'm your new year's baby and sweet 30 under 31, Griffith McElroy.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.840
It's- we're more Modron than ever.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.360
Oh yeah, baby, we're in those sci-fi years now.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.600
It's the most Modron we've ever been.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.800
People say we weren't gonna make it, and we did.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.280
Looks like we made it.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.320
Who the fuck said that?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.320
A lot of naysayers.

01:12.320 --> 01:12.960
Point them out.

01:12.960 --> 01:13.920
Name them one by one.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.560
Name names.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.000
Alan Alda.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.920
Alan Alda said that?

01:17.920 --> 01:21.600
Damn, I don't want to burn Alan Alda, but if he's talking a bunch of shit about

01:21.600 --> 01:23.680
our ability to make it, then-

01:23.680 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, he doubted us, and I guess we showed him.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.400
You know what? It buzzed me out especially because I just talked to him a week ago,

01:30.400 --> 01:32.800
and he's like, I always said you guys would make it.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.960
That's the two-timing. That's the thing.

01:35.600 --> 01:41.840
Wow, you know, way to start 2018 off on a bad foot to find out that Alan Alda is a two-faced

01:41.840 --> 01:42.640
son of a gun.

01:43.840 --> 01:51.120
I feel a little at sea though, gentlemen, because we are in a new year, and yet in a sense we aren't.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.920
In a sense we are still in a sort of limbo.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.560
Yes.

01:54.560 --> 02:03.360
Because we have not sort of thematically found what this year is going to be about.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.840
So we've had a lot of people tweeting at us.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.120
And I'm not sure that they've necessarily helped us.

02:10.640 --> 02:17.120
If only anything, they've added more C by giving us a billion very good suggestions

02:17.120 --> 02:18.240
of what the year should be.

02:18.240 --> 02:23.520
And just listen, I can't stress enough how much I appreciate the participation which

02:23.520 --> 02:25.120
everyone has put forth.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.480
But rhyming teen with things is easy and could apply to any year.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.880
So serpentine works because it's like 17, but serpentine.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.040
Even that was a stretch.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.240
I think we can all agree.

02:38.240 --> 02:43.200
You can't just say like 28 clean because that could be anything.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.960
Like that could be this year or next year.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.400
I guess 2020 would have-

02:46.400 --> 02:48.080
I wanted to float one.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.040
And we agree that 2020 is going to be looking forward.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.600
But that's not what 2020 means, but sure.

02:55.040 --> 02:55.760
Clear vision.

02:57.680 --> 03:03.200
I want to float this one because we didn't talk about last time, but I think it's powerful.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.600
I think it has power and it is 2018.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.960
And it's like the Black Eyed Peas song, but it's obviously it's been 10 years.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.200
10 years since that tune.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.200
And we're all really looking forward to the anniversary.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.320
I don't think I speak for-

03:18.320 --> 03:18.960
Yeah.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.840
I think I speak for all of us.

03:19.840 --> 03:27.200
The reunion, they're going to blow the horn of Gondor and the peas will get back together

03:27.200 --> 03:27.680
in the same way.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.760
When William and Taboo and Ferguson-

03:31.760 --> 03:33.200
Ferguson and-

03:33.200 --> 03:40.240
Here's one from Percival Press who says, 20 trampoline, time to bounce back.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.960
Now, when you sent that one in, did you know that you were going to change my life on a

03:44.960 --> 03:46.240
personal spiritual level?

03:46.240 --> 03:51.440
Because maybe this is the year we get specific about it and it's like, this is it.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.520
Go buy a fucking trampoline and get hot.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.440
20 trampoline, higher and higher.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.320
Now, here's the thing though-

03:58.320 --> 04:02.880
Now, I will say, I did just say that this is just rhyming the teen part.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.680
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.000
Okay.

04:04.000 --> 04:04.800
No, no, no, no.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.120
2018, we're going fishing.

04:08.080 --> 04:08.960
Who's that?

04:08.960 --> 04:10.000
Tyler Petty says 2018.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.280
No, it sounds like a literal, like literally going fishing or is this like catfishing?

04:15.280 --> 04:18.720
I think a lot of parts of fishing seem chill to me.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.720
The one I can't do-

04:20.720 --> 04:22.000
I'll fuck up a worm.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.280
I don't care.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.360
But when the fish is on the hook-

04:25.360 --> 04:25.840
Too big.

04:25.840 --> 04:26.080
That's-

04:26.880 --> 04:28.240
I can't close that deal.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.560
What do I do with this slimy fella?

04:30.560 --> 04:31.520
It's a big worm.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.760
If you think about maybe it's a big worm with eyes and mouth, it'll help.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.960
But no, it won't.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.320
And I can convince myself that that worm has done some shit.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.200
You know what I mean?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.840
But like, I look at a fish and I'm like, that fish has never-

04:43.840 --> 04:44.800
It didn't do nothing.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.440
A soul.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.960
It's never done anything wrong.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.480
Might be somebody's grandpa with a bunch of stories that got dropped down in the water,

04:51.360 --> 04:52.800
transfigurized.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.040
Right.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.480
Or it could be Don Knotts.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.920
You never know.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.720
Most fishes are.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.880
Also, there's obviously people are going to take that one and run with it in a sort of

05:02.880 --> 05:04.480
masturbatory direction.

05:04.480 --> 05:10.720
And that's its own can of worms to continue talking about worms.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.160
Can we go there just one step further?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.800
Do we already talk about 20 Master 18?

05:14.800 --> 05:15.280
We should.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.200
20 Master 18 is achievable.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.000
Easily achievable, I would say.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.840
I want to try to avoid-

05:23.840 --> 05:27.360
What I liked about Serpentine is it's very personal.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.200
And I think that we want to-

05:29.200 --> 05:33.760
I don't want any that could be easily disappointing.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.600
Like, which one was building bridges?

05:35.600 --> 05:37.200
2016 building bridges.

05:37.200 --> 05:43.280
Okay, that required actually two people on either end to sort of like get it done.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.440
You know, nobody builds a bridge from one end and then-

05:45.440 --> 05:46.080
But that's good.

05:46.080 --> 05:53.440
I would argue that we need to move back in that direction as opposed to having more years

05:53.440 --> 06:01.440
about, you know, individual distrust of the system and almost Neil Breen-esque distrust

06:01.440 --> 06:02.240
of the system.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.320
And more of like where we can get-

06:06.320 --> 06:11.520
I'm just, guys, I can't get away from this image of two horses getting doubly strong

06:11.520 --> 06:16.080
or triply strong because of their friendship pulling this big cart we call life.

06:17.040 --> 06:24.080
A few people have suggested 20 Gayteen, which I love, except for it is phonetically

06:24.080 --> 06:27.520
indistinguishable from 20 Gate-teen.

06:27.520 --> 06:32.560
And I don't want people to think that we're kind of putting up barriers.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.400
Now, I like this one from Warrior Princess.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.080
He suggested 20 Blade-teen the year of Wesley Snipes.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.000
Once again, specific.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.840
That's some specificity.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.560
Everybody can get into Wesley Snipes this year.

06:46.560 --> 06:52.560
Also 20 Slayteen, but that could break bad pretty fast, I think.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.280
Yeah, that's the problem with a lot of these.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.680
Yeah, apparently 8 rhymes with a lot of sort of, I mean, hate.

06:59.680 --> 07:04.240
Like, it rhymes with a lot of words that I don't think we want to make the sort of-

07:04.240 --> 07:07.280
20 Skate-teen, bringing back rollerblades.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.560
20 Skate-teen, back from the brink.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.120
20 Skate-teen, back from the brink.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.880
I feel like I'm really fucking good at coming up with the subtitles and really bad at coming

07:16.880 --> 07:17.920
up with the year names.

07:17.920 --> 07:26.000
Now, somebody, because we did talk about Mount Up, and somebody suggested 20 Regulate-teen,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.520
and I'm sorry that I can't remember.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.320
Or just Regulate-teen.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.600
No, we got, I mean, we got a billion people saying, like, how could you not say Regulate-teen

07:31.600 --> 07:33.600
after saying Mount Up as much as you did?

07:33.600 --> 07:33.920
Yes.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.920
And I don't know that that's the right spirit of the thing.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.760
I have one that I'm very enthusiastic about.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.080
Okay.

07:42.960 --> 07:47.520
Because I can't, like I said, the horses, that's very much our thing.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.200
Pulling carts, working together, friendship, love.

07:51.200 --> 07:56.720
Last episode, or last non-live episode, I suggested 20 Mate-teen, stronger together.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.840
And we got a lot of tweets from people concerned about 20 Mate-teen being sort of the thing,

08:01.840 --> 08:05.680
because it sounds like almost a Paul Ryan-esque sort of challenge to increase.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.400
I did mention that specifically in the moment.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.200
I believe yes.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.440
So how about this?

08:11.440 --> 08:12.720
And we've gotten this from a lot of people.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.040
I can't claim credit for it, but I think it's kind of great.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.560
Collaborate-teen, stronger together.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.400
Because that can mean anything.

08:20.400 --> 08:25.040
That just means two hearts, two minds, two souls, or more.

08:25.040 --> 08:25.600
Many souls, many different minds.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.200
It is important to me, Griffin, that it does not mean anything.

08:29.200 --> 08:34.800
It has to, we need to give it some sort of boundaries, I think, for it to be an effective,

08:34.800 --> 08:36.400
I do like Collaborate-teen.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.520
Well, that's it, that's it.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.160
It could mean like creatively, if you have a thing that you want to do that you struggled

08:42.160 --> 08:44.560
with or been hesitant to do, get somebody else.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.080
A like-minded individual on board who can help you fulfill your dreams.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.560
It can also mean like get involved with something that's important to you.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.240
Maybe let's go fucking rain fire down on the midterm elections.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.440
Just a fucking biblical reckoning on those, on them shits.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.200
I'm very into that.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.880
Collaborate-teen, we're stronger together.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.960
You're strong alone, but we're stronger together.

09:06.960 --> 09:13.600
It could be collaborating as far as like, as Griffin said, creativity or like social

09:13.600 --> 09:16.720
action, but it could also be like accountability.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.520
You know what I mean?

09:17.520 --> 09:23.200
Like having a friend that keeps you on track of your writing project while you keep, not

09:23.200 --> 09:28.160
necessarily working together so much as just like that, like horse working across the-

09:28.160 --> 09:29.520
It is necessarily working together.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.000
It is.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.720
But that's what I'm saying.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.520
It doesn't have to be working together on the same project so much as it could be working

09:33.520 --> 09:35.920
together to help one of you finish something.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.360
To help one another become stronger, validate one another.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.800
Validate-teen.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.640
Validate-teen's pretty good.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.440
Validate-teen's pretty good.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.200
From John, who says, navigate-teen.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.160
All hands on deck.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.120
I love that.

09:51.120 --> 09:51.920
I love sailing.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.640
I love nautical, that sort of vibe.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.160
What are we navigating though?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.600
Just life's choppy waters?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.040
Just navigating it.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.560
We're just navigating it.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.640
This big blue spaceship we call Earth.

10:05.680 --> 10:11.360
Listen, I'm willing to throw my hat over the fence, my weight throwing-

10:11.360 --> 10:13.840
Why did you just throw a hat at collaborate-teen?

10:13.840 --> 10:18.240
I don't know, but I'm willing to throw my support behind collaborate-teen.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.760
I think that's my huckleberry.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.240
Because not only do I like the spirit of it, I also like that we wouldn't have to say 20

10:26.240 --> 10:28.080
at the beginning of it every time.

10:28.080 --> 10:28.720
Yeah.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.400
Which I think is a little played.

10:30.400 --> 10:36.880
A little played at this point, and we're gonna keep doing it for the next, what, in 82 years?

10:36.880 --> 10:42.080
And then when 2,118 rolls around, we can just do it again.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.360
Yeah, so I think collaborate-teen, stronger together.

10:45.360 --> 10:49.840
And then just the picture of a bunch of horses pulling the world out of orbit.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.320
Yes, maybe pulling it so that global warming's not an issue anymore.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.920
Pulling it away from the sun.

10:55.920 --> 11:00.560
Yeah, we moved one degree over, one centimeter out of our orbit.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.560
That's how we're gonna fix this whole thing.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.320
Just get a little bit further away from the sun.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.720
Not very far, but just a little bit further.

11:06.720 --> 11:11.440
Which I actually think will give us like one more day a year that's just like a rest day.

11:11.440 --> 11:11.760
Yeah.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.720
I actually think that that's a future Rama plot now that I'm thinking about it.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.280
But anyway, stronger together.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.000
Justin, do we have a consensus?

11:20.880 --> 11:26.080
I just want to make sure we've thought about all the different things.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.320
Well, hum a few more at us, big boy.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.480
Do you guys know what spate means?

11:32.720 --> 11:34.720
I don't, but I thought there might be something there.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.640
I think it's like a fight.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.600
No, that's a spat, isn't it?

11:40.640 --> 11:44.720
Okay, spate is a large number of similar things or events

11:44.720 --> 11:47.040
appearing or occurring in quick succession.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.040
This is nothing.

11:49.040 --> 11:49.840
That's nothing.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.040
Okay, let me pitch one out that we did talk about earlier

11:53.040 --> 11:56.480
that I wanted to give one more chance here.

11:56.480 --> 11:56.800
Okay.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.320
20 slates clean.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.600
But I still have the same reservations about it

12:01.600 --> 12:03.920
in that I don't want anybody to start over.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.280
I don't want anybody to start over.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.080
That's the sentiment that might have carried us into 2017.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.920
We're like, boy, 2016 sucked.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.360
2017 slates clean.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.160
Let's do this thing.

12:12.160 --> 12:16.400
And 2017 was like a dump and it dumped all over.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.120
And then it was like, wow, I wish I hadn't had a clean slate.

12:19.120 --> 12:24.880
I wish I'd had some of my experience points left over from the previous year

12:24.880 --> 12:29.120
to help bolster me going into this new game plus.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.960
2018, we're a little bit wiser.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.400
Now we know it's time to, you know.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.320
Is this collaborate teen or 20 collaborate teen?

12:38.320 --> 12:41.040
20 collaborate teen is such a vicious mouthful.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
It actually stung my mouth to say it.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.480
I think collaborate teen.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.240
But it's like-

12:46.240 --> 12:48.560
Now what about, Justin, can I take your idea

12:48.560 --> 12:50.080
and just put a little spin on it?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.400
Sure, not my idea, but go on.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.760
Blank slate teen.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.160
And it's just all about the movie Blank Slate.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.000
Let me hit you with this.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.600
Blank check teen.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.000
Uh-huh.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.800
Uh-huh.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.280
How about captivate teen?

13:03.280 --> 13:04.000
Can't look away.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.520
From what?

13:05.520 --> 13:09.920
Now, once again, that's a good turn of phrase, I guess,

13:09.920 --> 13:13.360
but not super actionable as far as what to do this year.

13:14.640 --> 13:15.680
Aspirate teen.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.240
Just breathe.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.040
No, aspirate is when you choke on your own vomit.

13:19.920 --> 13:23.280
Well, yeah, but aspirate teen.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.880
Fluoridate teen.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.360
Nope.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.400
Keep those teeth.

13:26.400 --> 13:26.640
No.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.160
Germinate teen.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.840
Watch it grow.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.040
Watch what grow?

13:31.040 --> 13:35.200
This is the thing you keep referencing these arcane subjects.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.040
Lubricate teen.

13:39.040 --> 13:39.680
Get it wet.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.760
Jesus God, Justin.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.640
Now hold on.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.680
We might have something here.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.400
Get what yet?

13:46.400 --> 13:47.280
You might be wondering.

13:47.280 --> 13:47.920
The year.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.080
Get the year wet.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.240
Just a sloppy, slimy year.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.080
Machinate teen.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.120
Watch the gears turn.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.840
No, okay, once again, what does that mean?

13:59.040 --> 13:59.440
What?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.200
It means devise a plan.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.680
Devise a plan and watch the gears turn.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.720
Watch it grow.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.280
Get it wet.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.760
Elucidate teen.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.960
Becoming clear.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.200
Wait, no, that makes it sound like we're becoming Scientologists.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.560
Hey, maybe this is it.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.440
Maybe this is the year.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.000
This is the year.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.840
Relocate teen.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.200
2013, time to audit.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.680
Is there something with like illuminate, but it's about Illuminati?

14:26.320 --> 14:30.000
I mean, yeah, I mean, but that's literally all you just said and it wasn't much.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.760
Okay, all right.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.360
I think we've done our due diligence at this point.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.320
Collaborate teen, I think, is the standout.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.960
So I think we can officially say it at this point that this year,

14:42.000 --> 14:47.360
the year of our Lord 2018, has been re-dubbed Collaborate teen.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.440
And you don't gotta do this today.

14:49.440 --> 14:54.240
Who is our Lord that was born 20,018 or whatever years ago?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.160
What Lord are we referencing here?

14:57.280 --> 15:01.040
The one true Lord, Jesus of Nazareth.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.000
Oh, wow.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.920
Okay, I thought there was gonna be a joke in there.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.680
There's no joke.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.560
There's only Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.720
The true Christian God.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.520
A strange twist of a strange sort of, okay.

15:15.520 --> 15:19.360
Is this our ICP twist?

15:19.360 --> 15:19.920
Yeah.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.000
The lamb, guys, the lamb.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.320
The big one, the big guy.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.760
So we should make it clear.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.640
Jesus.

15:26.640 --> 15:29.040
Yeah, you don't gotta do this today.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.320
Emmanuel.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.520
Him, all right.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.360
You don't gotta do this right now.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.200
I feel like that's the problem with our mottos is people are like,

15:37.200 --> 15:40.880
it's January 2, I need to start zacking right now.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.960
And you get burned out and you don't follow through.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.000
It's just, think about it.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.960
Think about what you could do.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.120
That could be improved with the help of another person.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.920
And how you can help them.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.240
That's what it's all about.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.160
This is how I see it working best, right?

15:54.160 --> 15:57.760
This is how I think all of our years should be implemented moving forward.

15:58.480 --> 16:03.280
I think that this is something that when you find yourself in a situation, right?

16:03.280 --> 16:08.800
Where you would normally say no, or you would normally do something by yourself,

16:08.800 --> 16:10.320
or you would normally, whatever.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.800
And I want you to hear in your head, collaborating.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.520
Mm-hmm.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.360
And you say, no, you know what?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.400
I could use some help.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.680
Thank you for asking.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.720
Don't be afraid to reach out.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.240
That's what I'm saying.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.760
So like that, I don't want it to be like, okay, guess I gotta go.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.040
I don't want you to have to feel that way.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.560
You can if you want to.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.360
But instead, I want this to be that little, you know,

16:31.360 --> 16:36.080
the pebble in the stream that just changes the current a little bit for you.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.040
Perfect.

16:37.040 --> 16:37.360
Right?

16:37.360 --> 16:43.680
That's how I think it is most actionable as a gentle guide to your year.

16:43.680 --> 16:50.400
I would love to collaborate with you two, Jags, to do the podcast that we do sometimes.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.280
Oh, okay.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.400
Sheesh.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.000
Kind of rushing it, but let's get into it.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.960
It's been 20 minutes.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.880
We take your questions and turn them back into wisdom.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.040
It's an advice show, as you almost certainly guessed.

17:01.760 --> 17:05.440
My friend is kind of an awkward guy when he doesn't know how to reply in a text,

17:05.440 --> 17:06.880
tweet, post, or chat.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.800
He will throw in a random emoji.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.000
I think he thinks it's funny, but it's not.

17:12.640 --> 17:17.040
At best, it grinds the conversation to a halt and force the other person to pivot awkwardly

17:17.040 --> 17:18.720
because it doesn't make any sense.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.760
At worst, the emoji he chooses end up being kind of insulting.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.840
For instance, today I asked him would I should get a mutual friend for their birthday

17:25.840 --> 17:29.360
and he replied with a snoring emoji, which was super rude.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.240
I told him off and he didn't get why I was mad because it was just a random choice for him.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.760
How can I teach him the art of emoji use, or even better, get him to stop?

17:37.760 --> 17:39.360
And that's from Exhausted by Emojis.

17:40.160 --> 17:46.800
I think 2018, collaborate, stronger together, pull the world out of orbit is all very important.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.200
But I would love to have sort of a secondary thing going on where we ban the use of the

17:51.200 --> 17:55.200
word emoji and we try to find a different word for these little guys because-

17:55.200 --> 17:56.320
Icons.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.920
Icons is good.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.040
Face cons.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.160
Tiny pictures.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.120
Tiny pics.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.160
Little guys.

18:02.160 --> 18:08.000
Are you worried because emojis sound so much like emotions that some people might be confused

18:08.000 --> 18:12.400
that emojis is new teen slang for emotions as I was back in 2013?

18:12.400 --> 18:13.040
Absolutely.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
This is a, boy, what a-

18:16.000 --> 18:16.880
I'll tell you the problem.

18:18.320 --> 18:23.760
The problem here is clearly the emojis being chosen, excuse me, the tiny pics being chosen

18:23.760 --> 18:25.200
are not random enough.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.480
Like, what should we get our friend for a birthday?

18:28.480 --> 18:32.800
You're going to want to use that little, like the cable car that hangs from the wire

18:32.800 --> 18:36.240
that goes between Mountain Chalet and Switchwood, right?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.120
That's random.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.840
No one's ever going to get offended by Skytram car.

18:40.960 --> 18:48.160
It drives me crazy when the keyboard on my iPhone tries to auto complete with a picture.

18:48.720 --> 18:53.040
Like I type in bread and it meant like, did you mean a picture of bread?

18:53.040 --> 18:56.560
And it suggests that to me like, no, I actually didn't.

18:56.560 --> 19:01.840
I'm kind of 37 years old, so I'm just going to keep using words for now.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.080
The last thing I want is the person on the receiving end of this shopping list to have

19:06.080 --> 19:09.600
to solve a fucking rebus to know what I need from the store.

19:09.600 --> 19:09.760
It's ridiculous.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.040
And that is what this person-

19:11.040 --> 19:19.440
I get having social anxiety and even in sort of telecom scenarios, definitely.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.440
Because my go-to is just not responding at all.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.280
And I don't know what is worse in this situation, not responding

19:27.280 --> 19:34.960
or responding with this sort of random sort of piece of art for them to interpret.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.680
Because I think that's even a little bit more annoying than just like,

19:37.680 --> 19:40.960
oh, well, Griffin's anxious and not responding to this.

19:41.920 --> 19:46.640
My worldview on all this really shifted when I found out one of the emojis means dick.

19:47.200 --> 19:51.600
And I think after that moment, I really had to start getting more careful.

19:51.600 --> 19:56.080
I mean, you can't randomly choose emojis when one of them means penis.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.200
And one means butt.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.400
Yeah, the peach one is a fanny.

20:00.400 --> 20:06.960
So what I'm confused about is how Eggplant got picked for this and not the hot dog.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.200
Did we have a vote?

20:09.200 --> 20:10.800
I don't remember voting on this.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.320
Is the hot dog emoji just a loose hot dog or is it not in a bun?

20:14.320 --> 20:17.280
No, it's on a bun, but I mean, you get the idea.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.560
I would have thought it'd be banana or a cucumber.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.760
The problem is hot dogs come up in conversation all the time.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.600
I'm very rarely talking about eggplant,

20:25.600 --> 20:31.120
but I can't have a conversation about ballpark snacks where people think that I'm being weird.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.200
You want to go to the game and get a penis.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.640
I guess the context does help there.

20:37.840 --> 20:42.160
But I guess you don't really use the word eggplant as much as you use hot dog.

20:42.160 --> 20:42.960
And that is me.

20:42.960 --> 20:47.360
Unless you live in Italy and where they eat those dang little purple guys all the dang time.

20:47.360 --> 20:53.200
And you think over there, people are texting just like, yo, why are you talking to your own mom about dick?

20:53.200 --> 20:57.360
And it's like, no, it's about dinner tonight because we are eating an eggplant parmesan.

20:57.360 --> 21:01.680
It would also probably be a problem if you're just a huge fan of Captain N

21:01.680 --> 21:02.880
and you're just like constantly recounting-

21:02.880 --> 21:04.720
Jesus Christ, Travis.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.200
What's wrong?

21:05.840 --> 21:06.560
What happened, Griffin?

21:06.560 --> 21:11.680
It's just, that's a very obscure reference, my boy.

21:11.680 --> 21:16.720
I would like to go back in time now and watch the Captain N cartoons

21:16.720 --> 21:19.040
and think of King Eggplant.

21:19.040 --> 21:19.760
What was he?

21:19.760 --> 21:20.800
Eggplant Wizard.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.400
Eggplant Wizard is a penis.

21:23.200 --> 21:23.520
Yeah.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.320
As a representative, excuse me, as a metaphor for a penis.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.800
It's actually from Kid Icarus, which I get.

21:30.800 --> 21:35.520
When you think look at it that way, it's an angel just blasting dongs nonstop,

21:35.520 --> 21:41.120
which maybe that game had more sort of heavy religious undertones than we gave it credit for.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.600
I actually think you guys, Kid Dicarus.

21:43.600 --> 21:49.440
I really feel bad for Eggplant Wizard the day he found out about the whole penis thing.

21:50.960 --> 21:51.680
Because that's like-

21:52.320 --> 21:53.920
That's my whole brand.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.920
Like his whole brand's kind of wrecked.

21:55.920 --> 22:00.720
He's got an eggplant like on the end of his staff.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.320
Like that's ridiculous now.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.240
And you know, there was probably a delay too where he was just like,

22:06.240 --> 22:09.600
I don't know what this new surge in popularity has been.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.160
What's that?

22:10.160 --> 22:13.680
Oh, well, I'm a penis now.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.520
Shed a tear for the ice climbers who are climbing this whole dang mountain

22:17.520 --> 22:21.360
when they get to the top to get the penis emoji at the top of it.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.800
And they didn't own that.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.000
That wasn't their choice.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.080
So should we talk about something accessible?

22:28.080 --> 22:28.720
Yes, please.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.040
How about a Yahoo?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.280
Yeah, that sounds good.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.120
I need to tell you guys something about Yahoo right now on January 1st, 2018.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.240
Um, it's fucked.

22:41.040 --> 22:46.720
The website is full-blown Y2K Colonel Panic fucked up bad.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.760
Is this gonna be the year we lose it, you think?

22:49.760 --> 22:59.920
If this is any indication, then the website has crossed the event horizon down the internet drain.

22:59.920 --> 23:05.760
Because I'm looking at it now, all the elements on the page are aligned in a single column,

23:05.760 --> 23:09.760
meaning they're all just on top of each other, meaning I can't read a lot of it.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.440
Which was difficult.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.320
I had to like pick questions that didn't have a lot of additional details.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.360
Wait, and this was like all of the questions?

23:17.360 --> 23:17.760
Everything.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.400
The website.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.520
It's fucking gone.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.160
Y2K hit it 18 years late.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.680
It's fucked up bad.

23:23.680 --> 23:29.680
So I have a question here that I'm very drawn to because I can't read any of the additional

23:29.680 --> 23:31.200
details about it.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.440
And with that in mind, I want to dive into this one.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.240
Abby sent it in.

23:34.240 --> 23:34.880
Thank you, Abby.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.520
It's from, I don't know, it's covered up.

23:37.520 --> 23:42.800
But it's asked by a person who's named, I'll call them Rinaldo, asks,

23:44.160 --> 23:46.320
Can I eat twice at Denny's?

23:49.120 --> 23:49.760
What does this mean?

23:49.760 --> 23:53.360
Does this mean can I eat there twice in one week or twice in one day?

23:53.360 --> 24:02.320
Or how I like to interpret it, you've just ordered and completely eaten either on a dare

24:02.320 --> 24:06.560
or voluntarily, you know, a Denny's egg mess.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.920
And then they say, here's your check and you pay it.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.240
And they bring it back and they say, all right, you have a nice day.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.400
And you say, actually, hold on a minute.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.160
I think I'd like to go again.

24:16.160 --> 24:16.400
Yeah.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.320
I think I'd like to go again.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.160
And you can walk me back up to the host table and walk me back down to either this seat

24:22.160 --> 24:23.760
or a different seat if you'd like to.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.080
But I think I'd like to do a Denny's again.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.000
Can I go one more again?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.040
One more again, please.

24:29.040 --> 24:29.360
One more again?

24:29.360 --> 24:32.960
I'm wondering why not just order two entrees in the same.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.680
Nah, it's twice at the Denny's.

24:38.320 --> 24:43.280
Bring me the check for round one and then let's fire it up again.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.080
And let's see.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.400
And I want to compare and contrast, you know, certain elements of service.

24:48.400 --> 24:52.480
I might, do you order the same dish again and just check their consistency?

24:53.520 --> 24:58.960
Because at Denny's, when you get the egg mess, I imagine consistency is not

24:58.960 --> 25:02.880
a top bullet point sort of strength there.

25:02.880 --> 25:07.280
When you guys go out to eat and you order, right?

25:07.280 --> 25:12.320
And the server person takes away your menu.

25:13.200 --> 25:19.440
Do you ever feel this moment of completely irrational panic when they take the menu away?

25:19.440 --> 25:20.480
Every single time.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.200
Every single time.

25:21.920 --> 25:27.520
Especially if they have, this kills me, when they have a lot of fun cocktails in there.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.440
Actually, I'm going to drink more.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.840
So go ahead and leave that with the table place.

25:31.840 --> 25:36.560
Or, you know, cool pictures of food and people eating them that I might just want to enjoy

25:36.560 --> 25:37.520
during my meal.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.960
And recreate.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.480
And recreate with my great friends.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.720
Especially if they have a lengthy dessert section in the menu.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.600
And I'm just like, but I don't know if I want that yet.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.360
Okay, so we'll have that right out.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.160
Let me grab your menus.

25:50.160 --> 25:55.360
Well, hold on a moment because I seem to have fallen in love with one of the people inside

25:55.360 --> 25:56.080
the menu.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.600
And I need to, I would love to have them here with me, dining with me.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.920
I'm going to cut them out and Larsen the real girl them.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.840
Do you have the contact info for your menu models?

26:05.840 --> 26:11.440
Do you think it's because they don't want you to compare the pictures of the food?

26:11.440 --> 26:14.000
That is definitely it, that's 100% it.

26:14.000 --> 26:14.800
Absolutely.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.040
I mean, if you should just accept that if you're eating at a restaurant with pictures

26:19.040 --> 26:22.000
of the food in the menu, it ain't going to look like that.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.200
They're not going to get it right.

26:23.200 --> 26:23.520
They're not going to do that good.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.040
It's ironic, isn't it?

26:25.040 --> 26:25.440
Yeah.

26:25.440 --> 26:25.920
It is.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.880
They are always off-put when you're like, well, actually, I'm going to hold on.

26:28.880 --> 26:29.760
Oh, you're going to.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.960
Oh, okay.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.920
Okay, well, I guess.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.840
Okay, well, I'm going to have to check with my manager.

26:37.840 --> 26:42.240
And here you'd need to because you need to plan for round two during round one.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.320
I'd like to do Applebee's again.

26:44.320 --> 26:50.480
They should really have enough menus for everybody to enjoy a menu while they're at the restaurant.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.160
Why don't they have enough for everyone?

26:53.440 --> 26:54.400
This one's mine.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.280
You borrowed it to me for the entirety of my meal.

26:57.920 --> 26:58.880
Well, I'll tell you.

26:58.880 --> 27:03.040
Before anybody tweets to this, having worked in the restaurant industry is because people

27:03.040 --> 27:04.480
are horrible monsters.

27:04.480 --> 27:09.280
And if you leave their menu with them, they will inevitably get food in it and stuff and

27:09.280 --> 27:10.240
ruin the menu.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.080
That's why so many menus are laminated.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.240
But that's my fucking right.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.040
That is my God-given right.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.240
Inalienable.

27:18.240 --> 27:23.600
Given to me in the Bible to ruin the menus at the restaurants I go to.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.320
What about this?

27:24.960 --> 27:25.600
Print it off.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.400
Piece of paper, right?

27:26.400 --> 27:28.880
When you hand it to someone, when you sit them down at the table and you hand it to

27:28.880 --> 27:30.560
them, you say, that's yours to keep.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.600
Yeah, yuck it up.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.480
Here's yours.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.680
Here's three crayons.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.960
It says Todd at the top.

27:34.960 --> 27:35.760
That's yours.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.120
Here's three crayons.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.080
Have fun.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.040
Go to town.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.600
And you know when you see kids menus that do do this.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.320
Travis, by the way, you've just invented kids menus.

27:44.320 --> 27:49.040
And you see them coloring on it and not really engaging in conversation with everybody else

27:49.040 --> 27:49.680
at the table.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.760
You know, you look at them like, damn, that looks fun.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.760
Damn, that looks good.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.840
They got this whole activity there to do.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.600
Oh, I love, I love that activity.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.400
I never doodle and I never do little jumbles.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.080
I would love to do a jumble right now.

28:04.080 --> 28:04.800
How good?

28:04.800 --> 28:07.440
Talking about my, you know, my friend, how it's going at work.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.240
How good would it be if people started like awkward dinner conversation and you looked

28:12.240 --> 28:15.200
up like, uh, I'm halfway through my maze.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.760
So just pump the brakes.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.960
You're going to have to circle back.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.240
A thing which I cannot do because I keep running into all these dead ends.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.800
We're so off topic about double, double time.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.160
Double food.

28:28.160 --> 28:28.880
Can you?

28:28.880 --> 28:29.360
Yes.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.000
Should you?

28:30.000 --> 28:30.400
Yes.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.120
Next question.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.800
Can you, do you have to go to the back of the line?

28:34.800 --> 28:38.320
Or can you, like, do you get preferential treatment because you're very, you're kind

28:38.320 --> 28:39.200
of a repeat.

28:39.200 --> 28:44.800
I feel like if there's a line long enough that you have to wait, you might talk yourself

28:44.800 --> 28:46.800
out of it while you're in the line.

28:46.800 --> 28:52.240
I can't imagine how I would feel as a Denny's employee if a customer finished.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.280
Oh, thank you very much.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.240
Oh, sorry, Bill.

28:54.240 --> 28:54.720
Okay, great.

28:54.720 --> 28:55.440
Thank you.

28:55.440 --> 29:01.440
Stood outside silently, but like mouthing the words counted to 60 and then walked back

29:01.440 --> 29:04.080
in and said, like, one for Denny's, please.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.920
Like, I think I just called the police.

29:06.800 --> 29:11.280
Yeah, for everybody in the situation, that would probably be the best sort of outcome.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.560
Do you think Denny themselves would show up at that point and say, like, you've done

29:16.560 --> 29:18.000
it, you've solved my puzzle.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.840
The Empire is yours.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.840
Now you're in charge of Denny's.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.920
You know, the story about the boy who got all of the Denny's he wanted.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.040
Yeah, they get his stomach pumped.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
You didn't finish your first egg mess.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.080
You get nothing.

29:32.080 --> 29:32.880
Good day, sir.

29:33.920 --> 29:38.240
My big worry would be that the freshest big boy would be watching from across the street.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.680
Like, that's painful.

29:39.680 --> 29:44.640
It hurt enough that you went one time over to Denny's, but he knows that you're full

29:44.640 --> 29:44.880
now.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.920
Like, you don't even want to come see what I have to offer.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.440
I thought I was your big boy.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.200
I thought I was your big boy, you said.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.600
You said I was your big boy.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.600
The other night, I ripped my pants at a local bar.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.760
That's not me, Justin, talking, although it very well could be.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.440
Except for me being at a bar, I guess.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.400
I stayed until the end of the event I was watching.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.200
How much do you have to rip your pants to leave immediately?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.800
Is this a condition that you can, quote, pull off?

30:15.360 --> 30:17.920
And that's from Split Decision in KC.

30:17.920 --> 30:18.720
Hmm.

30:18.720 --> 30:24.160
Man, I don't want to get too Andy Rooney on it, but like, I've seen pants in all kinds

30:24.160 --> 30:29.840
of different states of both array and disarray, and just not question the fact that it was

30:29.840 --> 30:33.440
like a legitimate style decision.

30:34.960 --> 30:39.440
And so I feel like I'm not the best person to ask this question, but I do want to state

30:39.440 --> 30:45.440
that right now, and last night at the New Year's Eve event, I am and was wearing my

30:45.440 --> 30:48.480
ripped pants I ripped on an episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.000
I can't let these things go.

30:50.000 --> 30:50.480
I love them.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.840
I'll never let go.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
When did you tear them?

30:53.840 --> 30:55.360
When he was trying to pull his pocket out.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.560
I was trying to pull my pocket out.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.040
I tore the pants, and this is a small hole, and I think that's acceptable.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.000
Although you can, if you look very closely, see me on these.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.640
The question stands, how far would you have to rip your pants?

31:08.640 --> 31:15.760
Rip your pants before just sitting down until you're done isn't an option.

31:15.760 --> 31:18.640
Well if it's on your butt, you can sit down for as long as you want, because that's where

31:18.640 --> 31:19.760
the butt is.

31:19.760 --> 31:23.120
I don't know if you know that, Trav, but the butt is on the back, and it's where the seat

31:23.120 --> 31:23.120
goes.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.560
That's a great point about where the butt is.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.760
That is where the butt is, you are right.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.880
The butt's on the back, and that's also where a chair goes, so.

31:28.880 --> 31:35.920
I think my pants would have to rip from my waistband above my butt all the way around

31:35.920 --> 31:38.160
to the waistband at the front.

31:38.160 --> 31:42.400
It's gonna have to, Travis is right, it's gonna have to be a logistical issue.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.320
It's going to have to be a cold comfort issue.

31:46.320 --> 31:51.360
If it is no longer comfortable because you're letting too much of the elements outside,

31:51.360 --> 31:57.920
inside, and your shit's not freshness locked, then I think it's probably time to get up

31:57.920 --> 31:58.320
and go.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.360
Right, if they've become chaps.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.000
Yes.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.520
If at any point they become chaps and you didn't make that decision before you left

32:05.520 --> 32:09.840
the house, then it's probably time to get in the car and go home.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.760
You know, I was actually thinking about this because, like, now since having a baby and

32:13.760 --> 32:18.080
carrying around a diaper bag that has, like, changes of clothing and stuff in it, I thought

32:18.080 --> 32:21.120
about, like, why do we ever give that up?

32:21.120 --> 32:26.000
Like, why do we ever give up, like, having a backpack that's just like, yeah, at any

32:26.000 --> 32:30.720
given time, I have another pair of pants and another shirt in there, just like, whenever.

32:32.320 --> 32:32.800
Right?

32:32.800 --> 32:36.480
Like, my life becomes way more rough and tumble the older I get, it seems.

32:37.200 --> 32:37.680
Does it?

32:38.320 --> 32:38.480
No.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.920
What's going on?

32:39.920 --> 32:42.160
No, come on, you can't just say a bunch of shit.

32:42.160 --> 32:46.000
I eat a lot of strawberries and I just can't really do them, you know?

32:46.000 --> 32:51.200
All right, so Travis is a big yucky brown bear just making a mess in the brambleberry patch.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.320
This is not the first time we've had a question about someone ripping their pants.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.760
I'm like, what do I do now?

32:55.760 --> 32:58.720
And the thing is, I understand this because this happened to me once when I was working

32:58.720 --> 33:04.560
at Best Buy, and I ripped my khakis, and I had this moment of like, well, here I am.

33:04.560 --> 33:09.440
Well, then let me suggest this, instead of a backpack you carry around everywhere, which

33:09.440 --> 33:12.880
that's an issue, because somebody's like, uh-oh, Travis's backpack looks a little bit

33:13.600 --> 33:15.680
thinner, so I'm wondering what happened.

33:15.680 --> 33:20.960
They're going to assume it was a dookie mistake, and you don't maybe necessarily want to own

33:20.960 --> 33:21.200
that.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.680
Instead of that, a backpack that you carry around everywhere, because a lot of places

33:23.680 --> 33:27.360
won't let you in with a backpack, because they think you're a thief, and they won't

33:27.360 --> 33:28.720
say that to your face, but I will.

33:29.680 --> 33:35.520
Instead of a backpack, what about a series of dead drops located in some of your most

33:35.520 --> 33:36.800
frequent haunts?

33:36.800 --> 33:42.480
So your local bar's a great place for this, because local bar dookie mistakes probably

33:42.480 --> 33:44.080
aren't even the number one thing here.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.080
There's drink spills.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.440
Drink spilled.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.400
Nacho cheese whoopsies, maybe, perhaps.

33:50.400 --> 33:53.120
Some escaped cherry from some sort of beverage.

33:53.120 --> 33:57.760
Oh, the bartender was doing a frickin' trick, and the cherries went and landed right on

33:57.760 --> 34:04.000
your pants, and it makes it look like a nasty stain, and so you go to the dead drop that

34:04.000 --> 34:08.240
you have in the bathroom duct taped to the back of the toilet chamber, like in Godfather,

34:08.240 --> 34:12.800
but instead of pulling a revolver out that you'll use to kill two men, you pull out just

34:12.800 --> 34:13.840
new pants.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.520
That you use to kill two men.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.400
No, no, no.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.280
Oh, no, no.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.000
No, wait, sorry.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.200
Don't kill with your pants.

34:21.200 --> 34:21.920
This is my work.

34:21.920 --> 34:29.280
This is my place, and then under this one particular box of this one, you know, household

34:29.280 --> 34:35.280
device that I know nobody ever uses, nobody's ever gonna buy one of these things, this jalopy,

34:35.280 --> 34:38.560
it's just full of new pants that I can use in case of a stain.

34:38.560 --> 34:43.840
If I was gonna do it, I would do this for underwear, because I think that the odds of

34:43.840 --> 34:46.960
me ruining underwear are immensely higher.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.960
Well, they're the first line of defense, right?

34:48.960 --> 34:55.840
Right, they're the 300 phalanx protecting the captain of pants.

34:55.840 --> 35:01.280
I think it would ease a lot of anxiety on my part if I knew that if my day was sort

35:01.280 --> 35:07.440
of run a little long, and I needed a little get up and go, the ability to just throw on

35:07.440 --> 35:13.840
some clean undies, I think would be huge for just my whole mental state.

35:13.840 --> 35:17.120
Oh, okay, I'm gonna pitch this, because this is what I think I would both need and

35:17.120 --> 35:22.160
appreciate it most. From now on, whenever I attend some sort of convention, I'm gonna

35:22.160 --> 35:28.480
duct tape a fresh pair of me undies and socks somewhere in the convention for next year,

35:28.480 --> 35:30.320
and then I'll just know that they're there.

35:30.320 --> 35:38.240
I mean, why fucking stop there? New undies, new socks, a, like, nourishing face mask that

35:38.240 --> 35:43.120
you can just, like, get in the toilet stall and just, like, plop that on, and a little,

35:43.120 --> 35:47.280
maybe, like, a little, you know, five-hour energy drink, or actually something that is

35:47.280 --> 35:48.880
good, something good equivalent.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.000
Like a bottle of water?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.080
A bottle of water that you can use to just sort of freshen up, and then you come out,

35:54.080 --> 35:58.800
and you're just a new person. Hello! How's it, wow, you seem, what's, must've had a great

35:58.800 --> 36:04.320
bathroom trip. You could say that. Are you talking about a big shit you took? I don't

36:04.320 --> 36:05.840
know. I'll never tell.

36:05.840 --> 36:08.320
Why are you winking at the camera? Don't worry about it.

36:08.320 --> 36:08.880
Don't worry about it.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.440
Wink, wink!

36:09.440 --> 36:11.840
Care package secured. Wink.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.040
Self-care package.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.080
Self-care package.

36:14.080 --> 36:14.800
That's what we call it.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.240
Now, at this point-

36:16.240 --> 36:20.000
Where would you guys hide? Where would you guys hide? We're all pretty homebodies at

36:20.000 --> 36:24.240
this point in our life trajectories. Where would you drop your dead drop?

36:24.240 --> 36:24.880
Upstairs.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.160
That's a bad-

36:27.840 --> 36:31.600
What a lot of flexibility that would give to my day, huh? Don't you think?

36:31.600 --> 36:38.320
Whoa, look out. I don't know, probably, like, in the CVG airport. I tend to be there a lot,

36:38.320 --> 36:38.720
like, in the max and almost.

36:38.720 --> 36:44.000
That airport is such a- Oh my god, Travis. Seed them across every airport in this great

36:44.000 --> 36:49.120
country of ours. Every time I fly to a new airport, the Atlanta airport, I have the Nashville

36:49.120 --> 36:54.000
airport with its long layovers. I have never been in the Nashville airport and not wanted

36:54.000 --> 36:54.320
new underwear.

36:54.320 --> 36:59.440
Okay, let's walk through it. Hi, excuse me. Yes, my name is Travis McElroy. This is my

36:59.440 --> 37:06.160
license. I'm looking for a discreet location in the airport where I can duct tape a mysterious

37:06.160 --> 37:06.720
package to.

37:06.720 --> 37:11.840
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission on this specific one. They don't gotta know.

37:11.840 --> 37:16.480
Listen, the level of discretion, Justin, yes, there's a challenge there. I'm gonna have

37:16.480 --> 37:20.400
to. But, I think it's possible. Let me suggest this.

37:20.400 --> 37:25.040
You can't just skip out halfway out of a sentence when you do not have an ending to

37:25.040 --> 37:30.000
the sentence. You can't get around to talking about circumventing airport security measures.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.680
I know that there are places where you can, like, there are places in airports where you

37:33.680 --> 37:38.320
can, like, rent. Basically, it's like a tiny hotel room for, like, an hour to nap in.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.080
What are you talking about?

37:40.080 --> 37:41.920
This is the thing. This is not in every airport.

37:41.920 --> 37:45.680
Yeah, it's a thing. Yeah. Yeah, little micro hotels in the airport.

37:45.680 --> 37:50.240
I think maybe there's, like, a locker in there. If that exists, I could do that.

37:50.240 --> 37:55.360
Is this what the American Airlines Admirals Club is? Like, if I went into the adm- if

37:55.360 --> 38:00.960
I ever got behind those glistening doors, would I just find dozens of duct tape underwear

38:00.960 --> 38:02.400
to the wall for rich-

38:02.400 --> 38:06.000
Well, the original name was the American Airlines Clean Butt Experience.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.560
Why don't you go to Shoe Shine? Go to Shoe Shine, slip them a hundo,

38:10.560 --> 38:13.280
just say, I need to keep something here, and then you'll be arrested.

38:14.320 --> 38:18.080
Okay. Damn it. I think that there's something to this, though, because I think you could

38:18.080 --> 38:23.280
make this, like, a form of geocaching where it's, like, take some underpants, leave some underpants.

38:23.280 --> 38:32.320
Oh, Travis. I hadn't even considered the act of, you know, take a penny, need a penny.

38:32.320 --> 38:37.280
Right? Like, you open up an app on your phone, and it is like, do you need fresh socks? Cool.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.440
20 feet to your right, go down that alley.

38:39.440 --> 38:45.600
All it would take is one, and I don't want to get too blue here, but Bad Apple, who puts

38:45.600 --> 38:51.520
some maybe less than clean stuff in there, and then it's the- it spoils the bunch.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.360
One Bad Apple, if you will.

38:53.360 --> 38:57.360
I mean, you put literally a bad rotten apple in the bag of dead drop underwear,

38:57.360 --> 38:59.040
and it's- none of it's going to be wearable.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.960
Well, that is the thing. Like, it's- no matter how good you are at hiding this stuff,

39:02.960 --> 39:05.760
it's always going to be a risk if you start counting on it.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.000
Yeah.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.040
Where it's just like, you know what? I don't even have to worry about this,

39:09.040 --> 39:10.320
because I know I got that underpants over there.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.680
But if you can't count on it, there's no point in this.

39:13.680 --> 39:19.120
No, it's there if you need it, and it's like, oh, thank God this worked. But you can't take

39:19.120 --> 39:22.000
it for granted that it's going to be there. You can't be like, well, I have to pee,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.200
but rather than find a bathroom, I'm just going to, like, burn this one.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.600
This is just a burner underpants.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.080
This is it.

39:28.080 --> 39:28.800
You can't do that.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.360
Collaborate team. You have underpants, leave underpants. Maybe just start doing this.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.560
Next time you're at the airport, you pack too many underwear, and you're leaving.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.960
You're not coming back, because then all your stuff's done.

39:38.960 --> 39:42.560
But you got a fresh pair, you don't need it, just hide it somewhere.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.840
And put that energy out there in the universe. It's a secret. They'll come back to you.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.280
You won't want them to.

39:47.280 --> 39:52.880
Could you start, could you do this mobily? Could you have, could we have some buttons

39:52.880 --> 39:58.000
made up that are like, just ask me, I've got them, and then a picture of a wink,

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
and people see that button, and they know that you're packing undies for them.

40:02.000 --> 40:02.800
Yeah.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.200
Ooh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.040
That's a good conversation, too.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.200
You're the one with the underwear for me, right?

40:09.200 --> 40:12.320
No. A lot of us have red carnations, so.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.840
So, we should have talked about it more before we started.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.120
Hey, let's take a break and go over to the Money Zone.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.080
Do you think everybody's going to think that we're messy underwear boys, though?

40:32.080 --> 40:34.240
Because I just worry that we talked about it for like 20 minutes,

40:34.240 --> 40:36.240
and people are going to think we're just sort of messy underwear boys.

40:36.240 --> 40:40.000
We've been doing this show like 369 times, something like that.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.080
They, if they wanted to build a case file against our messy underwear abilities,

40:44.080 --> 40:47.840
they would have plenty of evidence to compile a very compelling case.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.920
So, tell me about Casper Trapp.

40:50.480 --> 40:55.280
I traveled out of the last like 10 days, nine of them,

40:56.720 --> 41:01.600
and I missed sleeping on my Casper mattress so much.

41:01.600 --> 41:06.240
Not only emotionally and mentally, but physically.

41:06.240 --> 41:10.320
My body craved that Casper comfort.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.480
I miss it so much.

41:12.480 --> 41:15.360
And like, this is not a joke- As somebody who you spent three of those days with,

41:15.360 --> 41:16.640
thank you very much.

41:16.640 --> 41:21.120
Listen, I love you, and I love my in-laws, and I traveled to LA,

41:21.120 --> 41:23.600
and I love my friends, and I love my co-workers and shit.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.840
But not, I don't love any of you as much as I love my Casper mattress.

41:27.840 --> 41:28.800
I'm sorry.

41:28.800 --> 41:31.040
My Casper mattress is my closest and dearest friend.

41:31.040 --> 41:34.640
He's always there for me, wrapping his loving arms around me.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.200
I love him, and it's so comfortable.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.200
Oh, it's the best. It's the best. I love it.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.640
Do you want to talk about how people can secure their own Casper-

41:44.640 --> 41:45.440
What are you doing?

41:46.400 --> 41:47.520
Oh, we have an ad.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.760
Oh, I was just talking about how much I love my Casper mattress.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.360
Well, Casper mattresses combine multiple supportive memory foams

41:53.360 --> 41:57.360
for quality sleep service with the right amounts of both sink and bounce,

41:57.360 --> 41:58.640
and sounds and bing.

41:59.200 --> 42:05.200
And you can be sure of your Casper purchase with 100 nights risk-free sleep on it trial.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.280
So start sleeping ahead of the curve with Casper.

42:21.280 --> 42:23.920
Because we're a podcast and we're the only ones that are going to tell you

42:23.920 --> 42:25.120

42:41.840 --> 42:43.280

42:53.840 --> 42:58.080

43:00.640 --> 43:01.760
We're getting there.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.440
I was going to say, it's 2018.

43:03.440 --> 43:03.680
Yeah.

43:03.680 --> 43:08.480
Yeah, right now you too can enjoy the stamps.com service with a special offer that includes

43:08.480 --> 43:11.920

43:13.760 --> 43:14.480
Well, I hope so.

43:14.480 --> 43:18.080
Just go to stamps.com and click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in my

43:18.080 --> 43:18.640
brother.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.880
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.640
I love to mail shit.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.520
Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.800
I'm getting pretty excited about this.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.240
I'm signing up right now.

43:28.240 --> 43:28.720
Are you?

43:28.720 --> 43:29.280
Are you really?

43:29.280 --> 43:31.280
Is that why you're not reading the Jumbotron?

43:31.280 --> 43:33.280
Yeah, hold on, I'll get back to it.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.560
Okay.

43:36.160 --> 43:41.680
News Goblins is a weekly podcast focused on hard news, not hard news, nerd news.

43:41.680 --> 43:42.400
I mean, it is hard.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.240
It is challenging sometimes.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.600
Challenging nerds.

43:45.600 --> 43:52.400
Hard nerds get swole with these hard nerds, nerd news, nerd culture, nerd relationships,

43:52.400 --> 43:53.920
and maybe goblins.

43:53.920 --> 43:59.520
News Goblins is hosted by Jared and Leslie Anderson, real, live, married weirdos with

43:59.520 --> 44:04.320
graduate degrees in writing and publishing credits in places like Asimov's, Drabblecast,

44:04.320 --> 44:05.440
and Escape Pod.

44:05.440 --> 44:10.480
Jared and Leslie are curious, silly, creative professionals who love to discuss serious

44:10.480 --> 44:14.480
and not-so-serious topics with a mix of humor and insight.

44:14.480 --> 44:18.320
You can find out more at newsgoblins.com.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.600
Or on iTunes.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.600
Just search iTunes for News Goblins.

44:21.600 --> 44:30.320
Yeah, I got another message here from Clayton, and it's for Yoshi, Eli, and Ruggles.

44:30.320 --> 44:30.880
Hell yeah.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.720
Those are some choice names all around.

44:33.680 --> 44:34.720
Told you I'd get one.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.040
Got a little hard there.

44:39.840 --> 44:44.080
Anyway, congrats on being the coolest group of people ever and inspiring me to create

44:44.080 --> 44:44.960
every single day.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.000
Collaborate team.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.200
Collaborate team, there it is.

44:47.200 --> 44:53.200
Here's to another year of talking to bears, gambling with goblins, and going to Bangor

44:53.200 --> 44:54.560
for chicken wings.

44:54.560 --> 45:01.360
I love you, time traveler boy, stab child, and Yoshi, but spelled with a B emoji.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.200
And as always, Rudy dies.

45:03.200 --> 45:07.200
I'm pretty sure it's Bangor, Maine.

45:07.200 --> 45:11.440
Bangor just does not trip off the tongue in the same way.

45:11.440 --> 45:15.840
I bet they have a lot of fun with that turn of phrase up there though, like it's a

45:15.840 --> 45:17.760
Bangor, get it, it's our town kind of.

45:19.520 --> 45:21.040
Boy, I'd love to go eat some chicken wings.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.800
That's my main takeaway from this sweet message.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.480
We have one more message.

45:24.480 --> 45:26.880
This is for Claire, and it's from Ivy.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.600
It says, Claire, I need to tell you something.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.160
I'm gay.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.800
I know this is sudden.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.280
I'm not sure if you suspected when you proposed to me.

45:35.840 --> 45:40.960
I look forward to building a forge in our backyard where we'll create powerful silverware

45:40.960 --> 45:44.080
and other sacred artifacts to pass down to our children.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.440
I love you.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.280
This is the fucking best.

45:47.280 --> 45:55.040
There is very little punctuation in this message, which makes it reads like a very energetic.

45:55.840 --> 46:00.800
It's a lot of sort of thoughts and ideas crammed into this message, and I adore it.

46:00.800 --> 46:05.600
Knowing the speed at which people had to operate to get a Jumbotron in 2018, I think we're

46:05.600 --> 46:09.680
going to see a lot of fucking radical stream of consciousness Jumbotrons this year.

46:09.680 --> 46:14.160
Becomings like slam poetry.

46:14.160 --> 46:18.880

46:53.440 --> 46:54.240
How about a Yahoo?

46:55.040 --> 46:55.760
Yep.

46:55.760 --> 46:58.880
Okay, again, it's fucked up really bad.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.600
It was sent in by Level 9000 Yajuru Drew Davenport.

47:01.600 --> 47:07.040
Thank you, Drew, and it's from, I don't know, but I'm going to call this one.

47:07.040 --> 47:13.840
Esther asks, who do you think will win in a fight, your mailman or your garbage man?

47:14.560 --> 47:21.600
Let's just gender neutralize this and mail carrier or sanitation worker, I guess.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.100
Yes.

47:23.680 --> 47:28.240
These two have been obviously beefing for a long, long time, and it's a secret war,

47:28.240 --> 47:35.680
kind of like the underworld movies or the Twilight movies where the vampires and lycanthropes

47:35.680 --> 47:37.440
are sort of at each other's throats.

47:37.440 --> 47:43.360
There is a secret war constantly going on, and read literally any book or Google it or

47:43.360 --> 47:47.360
whatever, but the mail carriers of our country and the sanitation workers of our country.

47:48.320 --> 47:52.240
Secret underground war fought at night, and nobody sees it.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.680
Nobody knows about it except for us now.

47:53.680 --> 47:56.560
Also, just real quick, it's 420 right now, so we're recording.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.640
I'm just trying to observe it.

47:58.640 --> 47:59.680
Okay, can you hear us?

47:59.680 --> 48:00.320
Blaze one out.

48:02.640 --> 48:09.920
The secret war between mail, and I have a really hard time putting my finger on what

48:09.920 --> 48:13.040
the solution, because I think there's more mail carriers, right?

48:13.040 --> 48:20.240
So they have the personnel advantage here, but we cannot discount the sanitation workers,

48:20.240 --> 48:23.600
big, powerful, and sometimes automated trucks.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.200
Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.960
They are literally driving like tanks.

48:28.240 --> 48:32.720
Yeah, they got tanks, and the mail carriers, though, they do have everything that's ever

48:32.720 --> 48:39.680
been mailed to use as weaponry in their proud fight, and God knows that I've bought a bunch

48:39.680 --> 48:48.560
of swords on Amazon.com, and so they've got those working for them, but the trash ones

48:48.560 --> 48:52.320
have all the swords I've thrown away, which is a considerable amount, because I can't

48:52.320 --> 48:55.360
have 200 freaking swords in my house.

48:55.360 --> 48:55.920
That's true.

48:55.920 --> 49:02.960
Garbage carriers will have accessible swords, because they'll know they've been cataloging

49:02.960 --> 49:07.440
sort of where the swords are, but every sword that they have access to has been discarded

49:07.440 --> 49:11.200
for unneeded swords.

49:11.200 --> 49:17.600
The mail carriers are going to have to guess at which boxes hold new swords, so a lot of

49:17.600 --> 49:22.400
times they're going to get a baguette or something that someone has mailed in a sword

49:22.400 --> 49:23.360
box as a joke.

49:24.720 --> 49:29.120
Well, and not only that, but your mail carrier is going to have access to everything that's

49:29.120 --> 49:34.080
been sent to you, but your garbage carrier or garbage sanitation worker is going to have

49:34.080 --> 49:37.360
access to everything you're ashamed of and are trying to get rid of.

49:38.480 --> 49:41.600
You're suggesting that they could blackmail you somehow.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.960
Well, if we're looking at this not as like a one-v-one war, but rather more like when

49:46.960 --> 49:50.720
the sun and the wind tried to figure out who's more powerful to see if they could get the

49:50.720 --> 49:52.080
human to take their jacket off.

49:52.080 --> 49:52.800
That's not what this is.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
That's not what this is, and that makes me uncomfortable.

49:54.800 --> 49:55.840
They're not fighting for us.

49:57.680 --> 49:58.400
Whichever side wins, we lose.

49:58.400 --> 50:06.160
That is a weird sort of like neoconservative fantasy, but that I do not espouse.

50:06.160 --> 50:10.240
This is, and they've got their reasons, and it has nothing to do with us.

50:10.240 --> 50:15.680
They got their own reasons, they got their own inspirations for this battle, and it's

50:15.680 --> 50:19.040
just a big, big street fight, and they're doing it at night, in the dark hour, when

50:19.040 --> 50:25.840
none of us can see it, or underground, and that's all there is to it, and I just, I'm

50:25.840 --> 50:31.920
so torn, and I'm so sad that Yahoo is so deeply fucked up, because I see little teases

50:31.920 --> 50:36.880
and hints at the great comments in here that I can't read all of, but here's a fragment.

50:37.680 --> 50:40.720
AIDS and diesel fumes all day and never gets out of his truck.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.400
The vehicle does the actual work.

50:42.400 --> 50:46.560
I don't know which one that's talking about, because both have trucks that they

50:46.560 --> 50:47.520
ride around in a lot.

50:48.080 --> 50:51.120
Somebody says, a switchblade or a butterfly.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.760
What could that possibly mean?

50:54.960 --> 50:57.520
But we'll never know, because Yahoo's all garbled.

50:57.520 --> 51:04.960
Do you know that both garbage trucks and mail trucks both dispatch from the exact same place?

51:04.960 --> 51:06.000
Is that true?

51:06.000 --> 51:10.240
They return to the same place, and there's a lot of tension in the air as they all clock.

51:10.240 --> 51:14.800
It's like that scene where the wolf and the sheepdog are both clocking in, and they're

51:14.800 --> 51:16.560
like, another day at the office, right?

51:16.560 --> 51:19.840
But then, out there on the streets, it's war.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.120
That makes a lot of sense, because there was one time I opened up my mailbox, and there

51:23.120 --> 51:29.440
was a stinky banana peel and two old bottles in there, and I looked, and my mail was in

51:29.440 --> 51:30.320
the garbage can.

51:30.320 --> 51:37.040
The garbage, the sanitation workers can take the mail away from the mail carriers and throw

51:37.040 --> 51:39.360
it in their trucks, and then it's trash.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.280
And I think that's a huge power play.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.720
It's a huge advantage.

51:42.720 --> 51:47.040
It's a huge power play, because you can't, the mail carrier can't take the trash away

51:47.040 --> 51:48.880
and put it in a box and put a stamp on it.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.760
I mean, they can, but at great personal expense.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.000
But it's nothing like the power play of like, oh, you just delivered those.

51:56.000 --> 51:56.720
Cool, cool, cool.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.720
Let me just, and then swipe them.

51:58.720 --> 52:02.640
It's a federal crime, but like, are you going to get in the truck to find them?

52:02.640 --> 52:03.440
Find the evidence?

52:03.440 --> 52:04.160
I don't think so.

52:04.160 --> 52:11.120
Gosh, we can't, we cannot discount the garbage truck's huge automated crushing arms.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.840
It's huge, you can't get rid of a body, get rid of whatever.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.920
Well, or get rid of a living person, because that arm grabs you.

52:17.920 --> 52:21.680
If it gets its hand on a person, I think you're already dead.

52:21.680 --> 52:22.560
Like, do you know what I mean?

52:22.560 --> 52:27.840
Like, once the grabbing process of that huge trash arm has got you, you're pretty much

52:27.840 --> 52:28.800
done already.

52:28.800 --> 52:32.400
There is no exit, because it basically lowers you into the big trash mouth.

52:32.400 --> 52:36.960
It's like the people who say like, when you fall off a mountain or something, you die

52:36.960 --> 52:38.320
before you hit the ground, you have like a heart attack.

52:38.320 --> 52:40.560
Yeah, yeah, you're dead as soon as that arm gets its hand on you, because it will not.

52:40.560 --> 52:45.040
There is no forgiveness, there is no escape, you know, emergency eject button, probably.

52:45.040 --> 52:50.960
Yeah, my mail carrier, I saw him with a big sack of packages, carrying it up to my porch.

52:50.960 --> 52:54.880
I'm like, I think it was probably about five days before Christmas.

52:54.880 --> 52:58.800
I was like, hey, hanging in there, and he said, I'm just living for the 26th.

52:58.800 --> 53:04.240
It's like, man, cool, happy holidays to you too, my friend.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.360
Well, damn, I didn't even think about that.

53:05.360 --> 53:12.000
There's a week here or so where the mail carrier is gonna have their hands full, and by which

53:12.000 --> 53:19.920
I mean literally full of holiday deliverables, and not necessarily a Glaive or a Halberd.

53:20.800 --> 53:26.000
And I feel like the sanitation worker doesn't necessarily have that same, yes, obviously

53:26.000 --> 53:31.040
they're dealing with maybe more boxes or whatever, but I don't think they're gonna be at as much

53:31.040 --> 53:32.240
of a disadvantage.

53:32.240 --> 53:43.680
The first trash day after Christmas, I ruined my sanitation workers with just a number of

53:43.680 --> 53:48.640
pink boxes that are just unfathomable to me.

53:48.640 --> 53:52.560
I wish I could have looked at my trash like eight years ago and just be like, no, no,

53:52.560 --> 53:54.560
no, really, I promise.

53:54.560 --> 53:58.000
You're gonna carry all of this out, I swear to you, seriously.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.400
Oh, shit, okay.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.320
I've always wondered about it, because sometimes when you order something from Amazon, the

54:04.320 --> 54:09.520
item is in a box already, but then Amazon puts it in another box.

54:09.520 --> 54:10.160
I hate that.

54:10.160 --> 54:15.200
But what if that's just the mail carriers fucking with the sanitation workers?

54:16.480 --> 54:19.760
Like, guys, I put it in another box.

54:19.760 --> 54:22.080
That would have been two boxes.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.400
It's probably where this beef got started.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.080
Yeah, absolutely.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.520
Stop with all the boxes.

54:27.520 --> 54:30.000
Just put a stamp on this vacuum cleaner.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.280
Don't even put it in a box.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.040
Just put a stamp on it, mail it, it's fine.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.720
They're gonna take it out of the box anyway.

54:34.720 --> 54:41.040
This is probably one of the main causes, and also the assassination of the Duke of Trash.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.640
Nobody wants to talk about it.

54:44.640 --> 54:51.440
Nobody even talks about it, but it sent ripples and really caused this huge scuffle.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.480
How about another question?

54:52.480 --> 54:56.560
Yeah, I'm spending some of my holiday at my grandparents' house, and I'm pretty drunk.

54:57.600 --> 54:58.560
Cool, thank you.

54:58.560 --> 54:59.840
I went into the cold room.

55:00.480 --> 55:00.980
What?

55:02.240 --> 55:04.320
I went into the cold room to refill my drink.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.280
What's a cold room?

55:06.160 --> 55:07.520
The cellar?

55:08.320 --> 55:09.680
What is a cold room?

55:09.680 --> 55:12.720
Sorry, we can't continue the question right now.

55:12.720 --> 55:13.920
What is a cold room?

55:14.640 --> 55:16.080
What is a cold room?

55:16.080 --> 55:18.320
It's a cold, it is just a cold room.

55:18.320 --> 55:22.960
It's like a cold room in the basement.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.720
Okay, this is like a Northerner thing.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.120
It's like a root cellar.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.480
A room in the back of the basement that was naturally chilly.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.320
We put bins of potatoes from the garden in there, and they kept all winter.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.520
It's like a big fridge.

55:35.520 --> 55:40.000
It's like the, you know, the refreshment zone at a gas station.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.480
It's like a big fridge that sometimes ruins everything you put in there.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.360
Okay, fine.

55:45.360 --> 55:50.080
Okay, so I went into the cold room to refill my drink, and I saw a gun.

55:50.720 --> 55:54.640
It's my granddad's old air rifle, and while it looks like it hasn't been used for ages,

55:54.640 --> 55:57.440
it seems in good repair, and also it looks really cool.

55:57.440 --> 56:01.360
So I check it out, figure out how to load it and cock it, but not how to uncock it.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.600
So I ended up pulling the trigger just to uncock it.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.160
After all, it had spider webs all over it.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.200
It won't be loaded.

56:07.200 --> 56:07.920
Bad logic there.

56:07.920 --> 56:11.040
You have made so many issues already.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.600
Crack, and there's a hole in my granny's wall.

56:13.600 --> 56:17.680
I put the gun back, take my drink, and now I'm sat in the living room with my mom, dad,

56:17.680 --> 56:20.080
sister, and granny watching the end of Skyfall.

56:22.480 --> 56:26.960
It's been 20 minutes since I've punched a hole straight through the cold room.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.240
How do I break the news?

56:28.240 --> 56:30.560
And that's from Naughty Not Nice in Newcastle.

56:30.560 --> 56:31.760
I mean, I'll say.

56:31.760 --> 56:33.520
That's pretty naughty, bud.

56:33.520 --> 56:39.040
Let's just go ahead and preface this by saying, just preface whatever we're about to say.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.720
Don't play with guns.

56:40.720 --> 56:44.000
Don't play with guns drunk in a house that's not-

56:44.000 --> 56:45.920
No story has ever begun.

56:45.920 --> 56:51.920
So I was playing with this gun and aided with, and nothing happened and everything was fine.

56:51.920 --> 56:52.400
Don't play with guns.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.680
Even if it's an air rifle, it's still a bad time for you.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.760
Clearly, you punched a hole in the cold room.

56:57.760 --> 57:00.000
Yeah, ain't gonna stay cold for long.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.600
It's a lot of bad potatoes.

57:01.600 --> 57:06.960
Or you have just made the cold room larger by sharing the cold with whatever bigger room

57:06.960 --> 57:08.960
is containing the smaller cold room.

57:08.960 --> 57:12.000
Possibly.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.800
Yeah, I guess maybe it is a, yeah, I guess it's a-

57:14.800 --> 57:15.600
Northern UK maybe?

57:15.600 --> 57:19.760
Okay, the thing where I found it being a northern thing is on a website, the subtitle for which

57:19.760 --> 57:22.480
is Everything About Old English Sheep Dogs.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.440
So who's to say the veracity?

57:25.440 --> 57:30.640
You have broken every rule of gun usage.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.040
Number one is, of course, don't.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.760
But number two, right after that is like, it's always loaded.

57:37.760 --> 57:39.440
You treat it like it's always loaded.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.560
It's a dangerous thing.

57:40.560 --> 57:41.440
What's wrong with you?

57:41.440 --> 57:42.960
Especially when you are.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.720
Treat it like it's loaded when you are.

57:46.240 --> 57:46.960
Jesus.

57:46.960 --> 57:50.000
Yeah, we're having a lot of fun here, but there's also a part of this question that

57:50.000 --> 57:51.600
scares the living shit out of me.

57:52.400 --> 57:52.640
Yeah.

57:53.680 --> 57:58.800
So let's, I don't know how to get past that and get into the fun zone, necessarily.

57:58.800 --> 58:00.560
He did say air rifle, right?

58:00.560 --> 58:01.520
I don't understand.

58:01.520 --> 58:06.080
Should that be able to put a whole, I guess it would, huh?

58:06.080 --> 58:07.280
It obviously has.

58:07.280 --> 58:07.680
It did.

58:07.680 --> 58:09.360
It did, huh?

58:09.360 --> 58:12.640
Let's not pretend like we have any idea what a cold dream is made out of.

58:12.640 --> 58:14.160
It might be rice paper.

58:14.160 --> 58:14.800
I don't know.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.520
You seem efficient, but you're right.

58:17.520 --> 58:20.080
You have to say, I mean, you've got to say something.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.160
James Bond did it.

58:22.160 --> 58:23.760
James, you blame it on James Bond.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.320
I mean, you blame it on whoever you want to blame it on.

58:26.320 --> 58:31.040
We're talking about a lot of spoiled potatoes if I'm going off of this Old English Sheep

58:31.040 --> 58:31.760
Dog website.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.640
You're talking about a lot of-

58:34.640 --> 58:36.160
Which is the new Yahoo.

58:36.160 --> 58:43.600
Yeah, I'll get off Yahoo and go to oes.org, the Old English Sheep Dog information hub.

58:45.200 --> 58:48.400
It's a lot of bad potatoes, and you can't do that to your grams.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.280
So you've got to speak up.

58:51.280 --> 58:52.560
Now, who do you blame it on?

58:52.560 --> 58:53.920
Travis suggests James Bond.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.840
I do not dislike this.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.760
You could say it's a new TV technology.

58:58.320 --> 59:02.960
It's the 4D like Captain EO, but instead of spraying water in your face, when James Bond

59:02.960 --> 59:05.280
shoots a gun, bullets do come out of the TV.

59:05.280 --> 59:09.440
And one, thankfully, you should be fortunate it only destroyed your cold room.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.880
You could blame it on your granddad.

59:11.600 --> 59:12.720
Blame it on your granddad.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.600
Blame it on an Old English Sheep Dog.

59:15.600 --> 59:17.200
Wait, is granddad still in the picture?

59:17.200 --> 59:19.360
Granddad is not in the room watching Skyfall.

59:19.360 --> 59:21.760
Maybe he's upstairs doing something else.

59:23.280 --> 59:27.280
In another area of the cold room, just wait.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.600
We also don't know how big the cold room is.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.880
One of those Christmas carols.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.360
Are there any of the Christmas carol ghosts that would have done this?

59:33.360 --> 59:34.800
Because I know that they're in the UK.

59:34.800 --> 59:35.760
You know Present.

59:35.760 --> 59:38.000
You know Present would fuck around with an air rifle like,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.640
Oh ho ho, I'm fucked up.

59:40.640 --> 59:42.720
Look at the stunts I can do with this gun.

59:45.600 --> 59:48.240
I feel so good because I'm holding a gun.

59:48.240 --> 59:50.640
Like, yo dude, you need to calm down a little bit.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.920
Don't tell me what to do.

59:53.920 --> 59:55.680
I'm in charge now.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.400
Oh god.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.120
My brothers and sisters have no scoped here for ages and now I am here to play with-

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.000
Everyone has told me how great it is to play with guns.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.520
This is ignorance and this is want and their KD ratio is a joke.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.080
Now I have an air rifle.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.680
Ho ho ho.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.120
Now which movie are we doing now?

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.240
That was Die Hard.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.880
That one was Die Hard and it was a little on the nose.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.520
Can you find some way to create a locked room mystery?

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.720
Because if you can't blame it on somebody, blame it on the unsolvable mystery.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.360
Although you gotta be careful because Sherlock will roll up.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.760
Sherlock will roll up in this one.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.080
You got Sherlock and Poirot up in your neck of the woods.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.120
You gotta be careful.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.600
Then you gotta pit them against each other and that's the only way you win.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.680
Locked room mystery is gonna be tricky though.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.720
You're gonna have to get a wire in through the small hole you've created in the wall

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.640
and use it to lock the door.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.480
That's a pretty easy locked room mystery.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.920
You're gonna need a block of ice to melt but that's gonna be hard to do in the cold room.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.480
Yeah, it's true.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.280
It's gonna take a while.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.840
Can you stick a bit of gum in there?

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.840
Stick a bit of chewy.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.680
Little ducky tape?

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.560
Little ducky tape or a little bit of chewy and you're fine.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.840
You're probably not fine.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.160
Listen.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.960
Don't play with guns.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.400
We've had a lot of fun here.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.200
I think this is actually a very important thing for the three of us to do.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.280
Question asker, naughty not nice in Newcastle.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.720
We had a lot of fun with your question.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.000
I need you to go get a chair.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.480
Go ahead and put it in the corner, facing the corner.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.480
I need you to sit right there in the chair for 15 minutes.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.680
Pause the podcast.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.560
You're in timeout.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.400
We are literally putting you, I'm assuming an adult, right in timeout.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.840
15 minutes, sit right there.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.240
What you did was quite bad and we had a lot of fun with the question but we shouldn't have

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.920
because what you did was a bad thing.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.880
Go timeout.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.800
Take a picture from the corner and email it to us on the same thread so we know it's you.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.320
We're going to be doing some punishments here in 2018.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:45.440
So that's going to be one of our new things is like if you, okay, all right.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.160
If you write in a question to us, you need to accept that you might get a legally binding

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.760
punishment and we're going to be punishing some people this year for getting out of line

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.880
and kind of upsetting the apple cart a little bit and it sounds like you've

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
earned our first punishment of 2018.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.480
Naughty, not nice in Newcastle.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.800
So go to the corner and think about what you did.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.840
Set a timer on your phone.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.520
Oh, I swear to God, if you get on your phone and you play your flappy bird or a game or

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.800
you get on Twitter, no.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.560
Put your phone away after you set the timer on it.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.720
Set it down and you just think about it.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.440
I would also say that you could, if you owned the entire thing and then fix the hole in

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.200
the cold room, I think that would be acceptable too.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.080
Not only that, and not to glorify this at all, but that is also a good way to then actually

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:38.080
earn a few points because like not only were you honest, but you took care of the problem

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.960
and you fixed it and you admitted it.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.920
That is a good, responsible thing to do that almost makes up for your irresponsible

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.440
playing with gun actions.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.120
I need photo evidence of either one.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.760
Whatever option you want to take, I don't really care.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.760
I don't live in your grandma's cold room, so it's your call.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.320
Yes, think that, you know, 2018, who knows?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.240
Should we wrap up?

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:04.000
Yeah, I believe we should.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.520
I've had too much fun already.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.640
I can't handle any more fun.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.080
But people at home, if you're looking for more fun, I just guested on a couple podcasts

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.440
that are going to be coming out soon.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.000
I'm on an upcoming episode of Can I Pet Your Dog?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.840
Upcoming episode where I returned for an episode of Bunker Buddies.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:29.040
Uh, I just guested on a video that's going to be coming out on Gary Dunn's YouTube

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.640
channel, but I also just did an episode of Good Christian Fun, which-

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.560
That is such a great podcast.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.040
Yes.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.880
I'm very into Good Christian Fun right now.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.560
I can't recommend it enough.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.080
If you've ever heard Gilmore Guys, Kevin Porter from Gilmore Guys, and his friend

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.680
Caroline are hosting Good Christian Fun.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.040
It's a review show of Christian pop culture that neither glorifies Christianity, neither

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.200
glorifies Christianity, nor makes fun of it.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.520
It just talks about why they made the things that they made.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.480
Justin, there's a Bibleman episode with your name on it, bud.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.000
Ooh, nice.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.640
Let's see, also coming up very soon-

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.560
What did you do on your episode?

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.600
We did an episode of McGee and Me called Twister and Shout.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.640
Fuck, yes.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:19.760
Yes, it was very fun, and Griffin, I just did one episode to leave the door open for

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.400
you to come on and discuss other McGee and Me episodes.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.920
Thank you, I appreciate that.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.440
But yeah, also coming up in, well, 11 days from today, Teresa and I are going to be at

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.720
San Francisco Sketch Fest.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.360
I'm performing in a couple shows, one Friday night, one Saturday night, but then we're

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:42.080
doing a Schmanners on Sunday the 14th in the afternoon, and you can find out all the details

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.520
about that at sfsketchfest.com.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.040
And you got the cruise, too, right?

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.040
Yeah, and we're doing the JoCo cruise, which is coming up middle of February, February

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.560
18th through 25th.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.800
We're going to be doing Schmanners there as well, just a bunch of other random things,

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.960
and Dad's going to be there, and yeah, it's going to be a good time if you want to come

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.520
check that out.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.760
I think it's going to be an absolute blast.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.280
Not only have I never been on JoCo cruise before, I've never been on a cruise before,

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.480
so I'm super excited about it.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.280
Yeah, I'm going to say-

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.600
You can find out about that, JoCoCruise.com, J-O-C-O-Cruise.com.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:20.240
I want to say thanks to everybody who pitched in during the holiday season for both MoBimBam

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.840
Angels, who just crushed the empty stockings list this year.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.400
That's a thing that when I see people in Huntington, that's the thing they talk about,

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.960
and that is so wonderful, and I hope that you all appreciate what a change you make

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.120
in our lovely hometown and Justin's current place of residence, and everybody who came

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.600
out to the Candle Nights show, and everybody who chipped in on the Candle Nights Star project

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:49.520
that Riley spearheaded, who helped raise, I think it was like $45,000 total for Big

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.680
Brothers Big Sisters of South Central West Virginia.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:59.680
They were asking for $60,000 to help open one of their closed branches up again, and

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:05.520
the fact that the listeners of this podcast almost single-handedly got there is so-

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.120
They weren't asking us for it.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:07.680
No, no, no.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.120
That was their big ask when they lost their funding.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:18.640
The fact that you all came out for that to such a huge degree is so wonderful, and we

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.000
love you all so much for it.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.000
Also, I want to say thanks to John Roderick in The Long Winters for the use of our theme

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.320
song, It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.120
It's a very good album, and thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

All right.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.400
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Thank you so much for listening.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:42.880
Collaborate, team.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.920
Collaborate, team.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.640
Just think about it.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.680
You don't got to act on it right now.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:46.400
Just think about it.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.280
Uh, and, uh, Griff, you got one more Yahoo for us?

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.320
Yeah, I have one more off this fucking blighted website.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.960
Uh, it's from Andrew Gerald.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.800
Thank you, Andrew, for sending this one in.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.600
I can't see it because the website's all fucked up, but I'm going to say, uh, Dennis

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:11.360
asks, what if, for the last episode of Frasier, Kelsey Grammer was butt naked the whole time?

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.440
My name's Justin McElroy.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.720
My name's Travis McElroy.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.200
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.760
May it kiss your dad's square on the lips.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:47.520
Hello, Internet.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.440
I'm your husband, host Travis McElroy.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.680
And I'm your wife, host Teresa McElroy.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.360
And together we present Schmanners.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.800
It's extraordinary etiquette.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.400
For ordinary occasions.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.440
We explain the historical significance of everyday etiquette topics, then answer your

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.280
questions relating to modern life.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.440
So join us weekly on MaximumFun.org or wherever podcasts are found.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.520
No RSVP required.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.040
Check out Schmanners.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.560
Schmanners, Schmanners.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:23.760
