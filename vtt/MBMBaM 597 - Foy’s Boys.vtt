WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
Better it's better

01:10.640 --> 01:13.740
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me

01:13.740 --> 01:21.020
It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis the great

01:21.140 --> 01:26.220
My name is Griffin McElroy. I want to warn everybody there was a moment where I

01:27.020 --> 01:32.020
Like what I said my name in a what could be like a melodically tuneful manner

01:32.020 --> 01:38.360
Yeah, you're happy for the first time in so long. Well, no, I just I I had the compulsion in that moment of

01:38.360 --> 01:44.000
I'm gonna sing the rest of this and I'll make everybody sing the rest the episode. It's a musical

01:45.560 --> 01:50.080
I just want to tell you guys like I fought that off like I fought that un-listenable urge

01:50.080 --> 01:55.160
I appreciate you fighting that off because it saved me from having to do that

01:55.600 --> 01:59.000
Mike like myself and I I don't know that I

01:59.720 --> 02:06.120
Physically mentally emotionally could have done it. Are you guys just gonna let me get away with adding a flourish to my name like that?

02:06.120 --> 02:11.000
What was the flourish? I was thinking about the thing I was gonna say rather than listening. Yeah, I'm so sorry about that

02:11.000 --> 02:11.320
That's okay

02:11.320 --> 02:15.520
No, I said Travis the great cuz I'm watching the great and I thought I need a flourish and yeah

02:15.520 --> 02:19.700
I'll be fancy or like Travis the powerful. I don't know. I'll find it but I want to talk about

02:20.400 --> 02:21.840
Guys, okay

02:21.840 --> 02:27.240
This is gonna depend on where people are listening to this because there are laws differing in states of state

02:27.240 --> 02:31.080
But I don't know about you guys. I got a lot of money riding on the big game

02:31.080 --> 02:33.080
Oh

02:37.880 --> 02:42.100
It's basically all of our collective life savings

02:42.100 --> 02:48.520
Oh, and I have been so curious why our financial advisors did tell us to

02:50.040 --> 02:52.640
Have a shared pool of life savings

02:53.880 --> 03:00.360
We're living three different lives at this with children. I mean we have dependents and wives and everything right?

03:00.360 --> 03:06.040
I paid the financial advisor to do that because I knew the big game was coming up and you know every year

03:06.040 --> 03:12.160
You know, I I watched the game and I think I should have I should have bet because now I know who won and I

03:12.160 --> 03:14.160
should have bet and

03:14.280 --> 03:16.820
Yeah, it's so easy when you know

03:18.360 --> 03:22.560
Sherry and logic and here's the best part. I mean I put about 75%

03:23.680 --> 03:28.100
Of our life savings on the big game and about 25% on the puppy bowl

03:28.100 --> 03:31.220
So I figure one way or the other yeah

03:31.220 --> 03:36.860
We're gonna come out big because I bet 25% of our life savings that the puppy bowl would be a doable

03:37.740 --> 03:42.680
And that was it was I mean to be fair. It's two to one odds a doable

03:46.100 --> 03:51.520
I put 50 large on the Bengals in the puppy bowl

03:52.220 --> 03:56.920
The Bengals are playing. Well, no, I'm let me do my joke. Okay, I

03:56.920 --> 04:03.520
I put 50 large on the Bengals in the puppy bowl because I am wagering that they will release a

04:04.320 --> 04:10.580
Handful of Bengal Tigers during the puppy bowl because let's be honest. Those games are rarely

04:11.480 --> 04:13.000
intense or

04:13.000 --> 04:15.400
Like dramatic the stakes are so low

04:17.120 --> 04:19.000
And I want to be like, yeah

04:19.000 --> 04:25.360
But did he fucking get that sack lunch from fucking smashing the QB into a fucking

04:25.360 --> 04:31.840
Bone meal that's I notice the the puppy bowl is very globetrotter asking that way Griffin. Yeah

04:32.120 --> 04:38.700
They're very lax on some of what I would consider the rules that make football fun to watch

04:38.960 --> 04:41.800
Right, and it's just like what's happening here?

04:42.400 --> 04:47.600
And the puppies never beat the human players. That's true. Like what's the point, right?

04:49.840 --> 04:55.200
It's never seen I've never seen one of the puppies get thrown out of the game for unsportsmanlike conduct

04:55.200 --> 05:01.360
but I've seen them piss on yes, absolutely if like one like, you know, if

05:02.000 --> 05:04.640
Troy Aikman just took a big one, right?

05:05.160 --> 05:07.720
Yeah, thank you. They would kick him right

05:08.720 --> 05:11.760
thick-armed fucking damn marino just took a

05:12.240 --> 05:17.680
Dumper right there on the 50. That's not gonna they're not gonna let him finish that one out. I

05:18.680 --> 05:24.740
Haven't announced it. We're calling it the Super Bowl from this point forward. I decided this come at me

05:24.740 --> 05:30.540
Please come soon. Nothing would delight me more than for the National Football League

05:30.540 --> 05:34.140
The NFL or as I call it, no fun left

05:35.140 --> 05:37.140
Come get me

05:46.100 --> 05:50.460
Back when people used to be able to take swords on the field. Come on

05:50.460 --> 05:55.060
Come on, Raph. Let the but the fellas what are you afraid of?

05:56.100 --> 05:58.100
Oh, I

05:58.420 --> 06:04.980
Had this moment after the so after the Bengals secured their place the Bengals are in it

06:05.020 --> 06:12.540
Yeah shooter my man shooter got that big kikaruski for the right. That's why you drive. That's why you drafted kicker

06:12.540 --> 06:15.640
That's why you drafted kicker. That's why you draft a kicker

06:16.460 --> 06:17.900
and

06:17.900 --> 06:22.860
I had this thought like I'm gonna you know, what dad loves the Bengals, huh?

06:22.860 --> 06:27.460
I'm gonna get him tickets, you know, like I'm gonna get I'm gonna get I'm gonna get him a flight

06:27.460 --> 06:32.660
You know, this will be birthday and Christmas combined whatever but I knew that it would fill up, you know flights from Cincinnati to

06:33.540 --> 06:35.780
Lax we're about to get like wilds. I was right

06:35.780 --> 06:39.100
I'm gonna do it right now and I was like I was checking the flights on that

06:39.100 --> 06:41.100
I was like, okay, maybe you know, I've got a lot of

06:41.500 --> 06:47.500
Miles saved up from traveling and then I was like, oh, wait a minute. He'll lean actual tickets to the game for oh, yeah

06:47.500 --> 06:49.980
That's our winnows. Yeah, so I went on to

06:50.920 --> 06:55.980
The the place where they sell the tickets or the Internet. Yeah, and um

06:57.420 --> 07:02.500
The bad ones are six thousand dollars. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey everybody

07:03.580 --> 07:09.020
It's that yeah, it's a it's a after all it's a game guys. It is a game

07:09.020 --> 07:13.740
It's a game and the players aren't getting paid. They're doing it for fun. Thank you

07:13.740 --> 07:17.780
So like where's this money going right down the toilet? That's where it's going

07:18.060 --> 07:25.220
Don't do six dollars for a ticket to the no Super Bowl in the bad seats where you can't I think about that

07:25.260 --> 07:28.780
There's a scalper somewhere right who's who bought those tickets

07:28.780 --> 07:34.660
I somehow probably a robot bottom and there was like I'm gonna resell these for six thousand dollars

07:34.660 --> 07:41.540
Like they fought with their human slash AI brain that six thousand dollars was like, this is a good choice

07:41.540 --> 07:46.540
This is a normal amount. Yeah, this is an amount someone will pay to sit in bad seats

07:47.300 --> 07:53.260
To watch people run at each other real fast. And that's yeah, that's really all that's really all football is

07:53.260 --> 07:57.760
You know what? I mean? Well except for kickers. Can we talk I'm I've decided to make this the only

07:58.660 --> 08:04.900
Pro kicker podcast on earth. Yeah, like our whole deal professional kickers. Yeah our whole deal

08:04.940 --> 08:11.320
What's our whole deal kickers are underappreciated in the NFL and I'm talking listen, hear me out place kickers

08:11.320 --> 08:15.480
Yes, but I'm also talking about like the punters

08:16.140 --> 08:19.860
It if it if it kicks it sits

08:20.620 --> 08:26.980
With us, that's not if it kicks it sits with us in our home. We'll talk to you. We'll talk to you

08:40.020 --> 08:46.460
Okay, and I want you to guys and I really I don't want you to do your usual sports sports bowl

08:46.780 --> 08:48.780
Like none of that

08:49.340 --> 08:54.140
I have four kickers. I would never do that. Okay, I want you to make your best run at it

08:54.140 --> 08:58.020
All right talking if I was talking to a kicker if we got a kicker on today, what would I say?

08:58.820 --> 09:00.820
Well, yes

09:01.260 --> 09:06.240
Start the kicker segment. Yeah, and I'll be like a kicker. All right, you have onto the show

09:06.240 --> 09:10.160
Can you do you have any music on the board juice that you can kind of like throw down for us?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.680
That's the same

09:14.640 --> 09:19.040
Hey, welcome to faces and laces I'm here with kick Johnson

09:19.600 --> 09:24.360

09:30.240 --> 09:36.860
Um, okay. Yeah, we're joined now by kick Johnson kick. That's a man. That's that's probably not his name

09:37.000 --> 09:41.080
No, well, it's his the nickname. His real name is Rick Johnson, but they call him kick

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
Kick I just want to say excellent

09:44.640 --> 09:49.040

Yeah, can I can we call you thick Johnson? Cuz it's like a funny like you have a oh, it's like a penis

09:55.320 --> 10:00.240

10:00.800 --> 10:04.520
Thanks thick now. Listen, um, I just want to say man great

10:05.320 --> 10:11.000
Are you okay? Charlie horse get leg cramps. Yeah. Yeah, you try bananas

10:11.360 --> 10:17.960
My body is riddled my legs specifically my kicking leg, right? It's riddled with pain

10:18.960 --> 10:21.080
Okay, these three hours out of

10:21.080 --> 10:25.640
Of every day. Oh is a waking hell what happens during the one-hour?

10:26.640 --> 10:32.640
Shoot me up the doc. Shoot me up real good. Oh with it. They call they call it spinach

10:32.640 --> 10:37.920
But it's in this it's in a syringe. I know it's not my spinach, but it releases me from

10:38.440 --> 10:43.360
The the hell right my every day is right long enough for me

10:45.120 --> 10:47.360
How old are you hey thick how old are you

10:48.440 --> 10:49.720
22

10:49.720 --> 10:51.720
Jesus

10:52.280 --> 10:59.560
Jesus do you find it hard to sort of navigate can I request? Oh sure, but Bethany you said this was a curse-free

11:00.800 --> 11:07.760
Sorry, my sister Bethany. Did we cut did we Kurt? Sorry? It's said the boy took the Lord's name in vain. Oh, sorry

11:08.480 --> 11:16.160
Crackers man, that's wild. You're 22, huh? Also, did you just call me a boy? I'm 16 years your senior kick

11:16.160 --> 11:22.400
It's an affectionate nickname that we have for other players

11:22.400 --> 11:26.880
Oh, you see me as another player in this field of power

11:27.440 --> 11:31.240
Castaglia, that's a weird way to say that. Hey, do you talk about?

11:32.000 --> 11:38.400
What get kicking or my career? I was trying to kick and then your bedeviled leg came up

11:38.400 --> 11:40.840
But we were very trying to do our job

11:41.680 --> 11:42.760
brief

11:42.760 --> 11:44.680
There's brief

11:44.680 --> 11:47.380
valleys between the crests of pain

11:48.160 --> 11:50.160
Are we in one of those manageable?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.440
Agony as the hellish sine wave that is my life, right?

11:56.200 --> 11:58.200
Rises and falls getting dark

11:59.680 --> 12:05.880
Valley, I mean something in a valley right now our terms of right. Got it. Got it. Got it. So what's your record?

12:05.880 --> 12:10.760
What's your longest? What's the biggest kick you've done? What's your biggest kick? We could have looked at your favorite

12:10.760 --> 12:16.320
But I I have been known to I came short at one point

12:16.440 --> 12:22.980
Of the record held by Dan Strazinski. Yeah, the Falcons he holds it down at about 60

12:24.080 --> 12:27.320
Yards, and I did kick a 58 and a half yarder

12:28.120 --> 12:30.800
when in our matchup against the the

12:31.360 --> 12:35.200
Tennessee tight did you ask did you ask the coach if you could scooch it back?

12:35.200 --> 12:41.080
Yeah, two or three yards just so you could scoot scoop that um that that record. I

12:42.560 --> 12:46.840
Would never compromise. Okay, where do I have a question for you?

12:46.840 --> 12:50.840
Go ahead good day go for travel when your pain management is going

12:50.840 --> 12:52.160
All right, you know what I mean?

12:52.160 --> 12:56.840
And you're in one of them valleys you think you could kick a ball hard enough that you could kick it through a man

12:56.840 --> 12:58.840
I always think about this

12:59.440 --> 13:01.160
Or or or sorry, sorry

13:01.160 --> 13:05.680
Or you kick it Adam and it hits him in the head and their head goes flying off like oh good question

13:05.680 --> 13:10.940
And then the head goes through and the head goes through and the and then the refs are like three points

13:10.940 --> 13:13.800
I guess I guess it counts. There's no rule against it

13:13.800 --> 13:20.640
I'm surprised you guys are privy to this, but that is how you become the kicker for a team

13:20.640 --> 13:26.800
Oh, you got all the previous kicker have to blast one of those beautiful pig skins right through the

13:26.800 --> 13:32.680
Uprights that are their ribs. Oh, I think just blasted clean through it's rough

13:32.680 --> 13:38.200
And honestly, it's supposed to be a private and I'll be frank tasteful ceremony

13:38.200 --> 13:44.440
Oh sure between two consenting adults, right? I have another question for you kick. Is there anything in the rule book?

13:44.440 --> 13:50.040
This has long trap us. Okay. Yeah, let him back. Okay. Is there anything in the rule book?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.040
This has a dog can't play football

13:52.200 --> 13:54.880
This is one that we like to ponder. Yeah

13:54.880 --> 13:55.960
Oh

13:55.960 --> 13:58.720
Seems like a straight up and down. Yes, or no question

13:59.360 --> 14:01.360
Yeah

14:01.720 --> 14:03.720
Yeah, sorry

14:04.240 --> 14:11.440
Cuz every time I say this another one of you kids gets is a wild idea that you're gonna trade up your pup to take out

14:12.120 --> 14:14.480
Think Johnson. Yeah, but there is

14:15.440 --> 14:18.120
Nothing in the rules that says a dog

14:19.280 --> 14:23.680
Can't play football right? Oh, I will say yeah

14:23.680 --> 14:25.240
they

14:25.240 --> 14:27.240
are not

14:27.440 --> 14:36.080
Reliable no bugs. Mm-hmm. They're reliable usually but not in terms of of play. They don't get a lot of graphs. Yeah

14:37.040 --> 14:42.720
They won't join the Union which to me is weird. Yeah, but they refused

14:43.600 --> 14:49.800
Because they say it's a big issue. You cannot put rings on those paws. That's true

14:49.800 --> 14:54.480
I told you you're not gonna get a ring with the dog behind the ball. It's it's a human's

14:55.280 --> 15:00.140
Human, it's a fingers game. You need a person right? You need a person

15:00.640 --> 15:06.580
Johnson you need a dancer since key you need, you know, any of the many other kickers with which I am well

15:10.440 --> 15:12.680
Do you weird and we all fight boys

15:12.680 --> 15:22.680
We would like to ask us we ask everyone where you do buy your pants that have one big pant leg good question

15:23.120 --> 15:25.360
This is an excellent question. I

15:26.280 --> 15:28.280
You stitch fix. Oh

15:28.480 --> 15:30.480
That's kick-ass

15:30.480 --> 15:35.060
But it's a special service that they maintain just for me called fix fix

15:35.060 --> 15:39.500
Oh, and they just get the pants just for me not stitch fix

15:39.500 --> 15:42.180
I'm sorry. Mine was

15:42.980 --> 15:49.740
Not thick thick. Hey, you started a little bit like like the agent from from matrix. Yeah that a lot

15:50.740 --> 15:55.380
Mr. Anderson the prices on thick thick are so good

15:56.300 --> 16:00.900
Can I ask you a question kick because Griffin said kick ass and made me think about it

16:00.900 --> 16:05.460
Are you ever afraid that like you'll lose control and you'll kick someone in the ass and you'll kick them so hard that you'll kick

16:05.460 --> 16:11.220
I'm in half or that their spine will shoot out of their mouth like in Mortal Kombat and I'll go through the uprights. I

16:11.940 --> 16:13.940
That would be impossible

16:14.140 --> 16:17.060
in when I am NOT on the field my

16:17.820 --> 16:23.340
Kicking leg is weighted down with over 130 pounds of dry weight. I wasn't asked about that

16:23.340 --> 16:26.420
I can see that here under the table. So you

16:27.780 --> 16:33.820
Lifting it is a torturer. There would be no way of me kicking a civilian in the open world

16:33.820 --> 16:36.780
Yeah, because of the weights on the leg

16:36.780 --> 16:42.600
They only release those when it's time to make the doughnuts go nuts, if you know what I mean? Yeah, I do

16:43.100 --> 16:45.700
So we're gonna let you go thick, but I have one more

16:46.380 --> 16:50.180
Don't have anywhere else. Okay, you can stay here, but just please don't talk anymore

16:50.180 --> 16:54.420
I'm worried about what it's doing to your voice, but I have one more question for you thick

16:54.420 --> 16:57.900
Do you have any predictions on how you think the Puppy Bowl is gonna go this year a?

16:57.900 --> 17:03.700
Lot of people in my circles are saying, you know, I still cute

17:04.100 --> 17:06.500
That's the way we're leaning right now. Really?

17:07.020 --> 17:09.020
I'm not allowed to bet

17:09.460 --> 17:12.140
Anymore sure. Oh, so it's not like a league thing

17:12.140 --> 17:18.580
It's like a personal thing for your personal thing for between me and my my lord. Oh, okay. Cool. And who's that?

17:19.380 --> 17:24.820
Sorry, you don't know him. Oh, okay. Oh, this is like a feudal situation. It's a different

17:24.820 --> 17:26.820
Disregard, yeah

17:27.700 --> 17:30.540
We have our own DD our own language. Oh

17:32.220 --> 17:37.620
Yeah, our own dress code and kicks ass yeah, it's well, sorry that's blasphemy

17:38.260 --> 17:42.220
Yeah, you don't like it when we take kick in vain, huh? Please don't take kick in rain

17:43.540 --> 17:49.220
Got it. God this pocket. Hey kick or thick. Don't you agree that this podcast was a fucking great idea?

17:49.220 --> 17:56.740
Like a really good idea for a podcast. I just think you got nowhere to go but up. Okay, great

17:56.740 --> 17:58.740
All right, just like the ball

18:02.100 --> 18:04.740
Okay, hey Justin Griffin, yeah

18:09.460 --> 18:14.500
Directly from from through the uprights in the riddle me piss boy

18:15.660 --> 18:17.300
Yeah, let's hear it

18:17.300 --> 18:23.740
If a chicken says all chickens are liars, right is the chicken?

18:24.380 --> 18:26.380
telling the truth

18:26.820 --> 18:27.860
No

18:27.860 --> 18:32.740
This comes from Paul, by the way to her manager. Why oh, thank you for tour manager Paul

18:34.020 --> 18:37.400
Yeah, why can I ask why it had to be a chicken?

18:38.340 --> 18:46.340
Interesting. Is this is this the riddle is that like a chicken can't speak and so the chicken cannot be telling either a lie

18:46.340 --> 18:47.860
Or the truth

18:47.860 --> 18:55.060
Do not I mean hey Griffin? Yeah, you solved it. Oh, did I really yes, but here's why I wanted this guy the answer

18:56.260 --> 18:58.420
What's the answer chickens cannot talk?

18:59.220 --> 19:01.220
but

19:02.180 --> 19:08.980
Hate this shit, but this goes deeper because here's what I would like to pause it. This question is written by a chicken

19:09.940 --> 19:14.340
Right. So all chickens are liars a chicken tells you that but then the chicken also says like no

19:14.340 --> 19:18.820
Don't worry chickens can't talk and you're like now. Hold on. I don't know what's up. What's down?

19:18.980 --> 19:21.860
You got me all turned around here chicken. I don't know what to believe you guys

19:22.260 --> 19:26.100
Is that I'm sorry trap. Hold on one second. Is that really it?

19:26.860 --> 19:28.700
That chickens cannot talk

19:28.700 --> 19:30.820
But this is the riddle that you've brought to us today

19:31.020 --> 19:36.180
Yeah, this is the real I brought to you because I'll change their lives, but I gotta say man

19:36.180 --> 19:40.300
I think we've moved past this. I think our brains have evolved to a point where

19:40.300 --> 19:45.660
Like we know the dark corners of the internet so well that the riddles will not

19:46.180 --> 19:49.980
Like I literally just shitted the answer out in an instant

19:49.980 --> 19:53.620
And I think that says a lot about sort of how I have been turned

19:54.620 --> 20:00.340
No, I broke Griffin a long time between riddle me piss and sad libs and of course work a fart

20:00.340 --> 20:04.340
It's very clear that I've broken Griffin's brain and somehow

20:05.820 --> 20:07.540
Dragged him down

20:07.540 --> 20:14.180
To where I'm at all the time where my brain operates all the time. Yeah, and I'm okay

20:14.180 --> 20:18.260
I tell you I'm pretty proud of it. Yeah, I broke a human beings thought process

20:18.340 --> 20:23.440
Yeah, I'm bada bada bada loving it. Anyways chickens or liars. Yeah, Justin

20:23.440 --> 20:26.460
maybe do a question cuz we'd I don't think we did any last episode and

20:27.060 --> 20:30.100
I didn't see the response to the last episode

20:30.980 --> 20:36.700
They loved that shit. I've been cast in a play which my character is a former high school

20:36.700 --> 20:44.020
American football champ. You don't need to do that on this show. This is a safe space. Okay, there's my picnic. Is it picnic?

20:44.580 --> 20:47.700
What but I don't know you because two of us were talking at once

20:48.260 --> 20:50.260
Why does Travis I'd make his great

20:50.620 --> 20:55.020
Reference to picnic like I it's just that I have a degree in theater Justin. I don't know if you know that

20:56.980 --> 21:03.120
One scene I even hold and toss around the old pigskin so you this person knows some of the slang going on

21:03.120 --> 21:09.640
Cool. However, I have no real-life experience with this. I've never tossed the old pork flesh. We don't call it that

21:11.100 --> 21:14.460
The shows in a month that I don't want to embarrass the rest of the cast with my shrod

21:14.800 --> 21:20.960
You are siblings surely you spent many hours throwing around the old hammer. I'd that is what can you tell me how to convincingly?

21:20.960 --> 21:27.280
Hold one lights up on a touchdown. No one Google. I will say this is all I know dad taught us

21:28.160 --> 21:31.680
Okay, these two things I know are important. Yes one

21:31.680 --> 21:32.760
wrap

21:32.760 --> 21:38.800
Your hand around the ball and put your fingers on the lace got a lover's embrace on the laces

21:39.200 --> 21:40.320
Yes

21:40.320 --> 21:48.200
Second tight spiral tight spiral also in like a tight spiral. This is something dad taught me which is

21:49.000 --> 21:52.640
You're really worried about it hitting you in the face, but it's not gonna hurt nearly as bad as you think

21:52.640 --> 21:56.640
It is watch and then like bonk, you know, it was right

21:56.640 --> 22:01.880
This it does hurt, but it didn't hurt as much as I thought it was for what is a bunch of leather?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.280
Like an oblong leather balloon

22:04.480 --> 22:11.360
Yeah, that shit hurts if it hits you hard and the other the other guys throw it fucking hard man. Same with a baseball

22:11.360 --> 22:17.480
That's another like very prominent dad lie by the way, like you're afraid of it hitting you but it's not gonna hit that hard

22:17.560 --> 22:24.120
Yeah, fucking hard man. Baseball is hard like a rock and a softball. Don't let the name fool you still

22:24.120 --> 22:31.720
It's nice to be hit by the size way bigger is weird that somebody invented softball and they're like pretty soft and no one was like

22:33.400 --> 22:40.680
Way softer things my dude, do you think it was invented before there were other soft things? Yeah, maybe is that possible?

22:41.120 --> 22:45.660
Until then everything was hard. And so instead well, this is this has a little give to it

22:45.660 --> 22:49.520
I'm gonna call it soft and people said I wonder if there's anything softer than this

22:49.520 --> 22:55.940
I was playing with a softball in my bongo bat at the park one time somebody threw the softball at me shattered my fucking bongo bat

22:56.960 --> 23:01.240
That shit did not go sailing which is the typical response you do get from a bongo bat

23:01.960 --> 23:03.960
anyway, you need a

23:04.480 --> 23:06.480
props master or

23:06.480 --> 23:08.480
someone who is going to

23:09.120 --> 23:15.040
Go up on the catwalk above the stage with a football tied to a string and like maybe a fishing rod if we want to

23:15.040 --> 23:16.600
go full sort of

23:16.600 --> 23:23.920
Goofy movie on it and then like you make a ball throwing motion and then they just kind of swing the football on

23:24.200 --> 23:29.200
The long fishing line to the other person. Do you know I mean? Oh even better

23:29.760 --> 23:36.340
Practical effects if you're doing some practical magic and you want to like show up like really make it clear that this person is

23:36.440 --> 23:41.320
really good at football what you're gonna do the postmaster up there you're gonna whistle and

23:41.320 --> 23:47.480
They're gonna like bring the football to you. Like you called it through the air. Oh, that's cool, right?

23:48.520 --> 23:52.120
Yeah, do they have the money to get like flying by for him? Oh

23:52.720 --> 24:00.560
Rigging that's huge a huge reference that for people are gonna get definitely. Yes, but I'm saying just listen for a second

24:00.680 --> 24:04.200
That's a company. There's one company that flies Peter Pan's around

24:04.200 --> 24:08.520
Yeah, if you want to fly somebody in in a show not just like in a plane to your house

24:08.520 --> 24:14.560
You get flying by Foy. Okay, you get flying by Foy. They're gonna come they're gonna they're gonna do swing back and forth

24:14.560 --> 24:18.280
They're gonna do up and down maybe even forward to back if you've got the money. Yeah

24:21.920 --> 24:27.080
There's one why is that still in there? Why is it still in there?

24:29.520 --> 24:31.520
Why is it in your head I

24:31.520 --> 24:39.040
I don't need to know it. I directed Superman. It's a birthplace. You're in a musical about Superman. That's

24:39.880 --> 24:45.560
Like and they and and they help with that. That's the only opportunity. I've got it. I've used the information

24:45.560 --> 24:47.560
You don't need it. I've slumdog millionaire. Yeah

24:48.400 --> 24:52.480
Gonna be a time where you're just like sitting there and someone's like, I don't know man

24:52.700 --> 25:00.400
Could there possibly be a company that specializes in flying specifically children in like shows and you're like wait, what did you say?

25:00.400 --> 25:02.400
Yeah, I know it

25:03.200 --> 25:06.640
You're a hero. Do you think that they do big boys?

25:07.280 --> 25:10.000
Like us do you think they do big boys like us?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.120
That would be a great

25:11.120 --> 25:16.680
Funny would it be if at one of our live shows and we wouldn't announce it ahead of time and we wouldn't even say which

25:16.680 --> 25:18.160
One of the three of us it was

25:18.160 --> 25:24.960
But we're like do the kick-ass final yahoo and then just one of us stands up and flies off the stage sins

25:25.720 --> 25:29.280
They're in Vegas. You think they're open yet flying by boy

25:29.280 --> 25:34.280
Yeah, you mean like time change why I got their phone number right here. I could just call him up

25:35.160 --> 25:38.480
Ask how big a boy they can do and if you podcast up

25:39.600 --> 25:41.840
Hey, do you do pod you fly for podcast?

25:42.320 --> 25:45.920
You guys have exactly 10 seconds to talk me out of this. Well, I don't think

25:46.840 --> 25:51.520
Just I want the mental image of us doing a live show only one of our shirts looks vaguely

25:52.040 --> 25:57.960
Rectangular and well, we'd all have to wear the harness fly. Yeah. Yeah, we have to wear the we'd all wear the harness

25:57.960 --> 26:01.800
But only one of us would fly away and it would keep a little surprise in there

26:01.800 --> 26:06.200
We're gonna fly tonight. Yeah, and we could do it of like there's a buzzer under your seat

26:06.200 --> 26:10.200
Yeah, you're all gonna vote on which one you think it's gonna fly away. Can you nail it?

26:10.740 --> 26:15.800
Yeah, and then like Paul comes out and hooks up. Maybe that's it, right? So Paul has the hook

26:15.800 --> 26:19.520
We're all waiting right and you're all in the audience gonna vote. We don't know

26:20.200 --> 26:23.080
Paul's gonna sneak out hook one of us and then whoa

26:23.080 --> 26:28.920
Oh, we'll talk it. We'll be like, oh Paul. I got a wicked wedge right now. Can you come fix for me?

26:28.920 --> 26:34.440
And yeah, so insulting you make me fix your wedge, but really it's not a wedgie

26:34.480 --> 26:39.200
He's hooking the cables up. That's gonna let us Paul. Could you adjust my balls for me?

26:40.640 --> 26:44.600
For like for like a minute and a half until you know, it's safe

26:44.600 --> 26:52.600
My balls so they're in the same I'm not calling I'm tired. I want to make this I

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
Want to make this show normal again. Oh

26:59.120 --> 27:01.120
I was thinking about it and

27:01.360 --> 27:03.920
I just feel like after the last

27:04.480 --> 27:08.000
Few I was gonna say episodes, but I think I mean years

27:08.000 --> 27:12.640
I just feel like I want this show to get back to normalcy, you know

27:12.640 --> 27:17.560
It's like a normal normalcy has to start somewhere and Justin's saying it's gonna start here

27:17.560 --> 27:24.160
It's just like this is not the sort of podcast where people call flying by for the standard of the industry

27:24.880 --> 27:26.060
like

27:26.060 --> 27:29.940
When they did Mary Martin Peter Pan on Broadway fine by foie

27:30.680 --> 27:35.620
See NBC was there and they did the live versions in in the 50s

27:35.680 --> 27:42.240
Yeah, that's flying by foie. And then when they did that one with them Allison, what's her face?

27:42.240 --> 27:49.320
Yeah, I'm on to Allison Janney. No, Allison. It was Allison Janney Williams cuz Brian Williams daughter. Um, the the

27:50.200 --> 27:53.600
Slime by foie like you can only get them and they only do Peter Pan

27:53.760 --> 27:59.160
They don't only do Peter Pan but like you know, they clearly also do Superman gotta do you gotta get foie

27:59.160 --> 28:03.920
You gotta get foie gotta get how does it say on their webpage? How many people they've lost?

28:05.240 --> 28:09.920
They have like well, no, they haven't days since boys boys have fallen

28:09.920 --> 28:11.920
Well

28:12.440 --> 28:18.680
Now to be fair a list and they it's a very it's a very touching memorial wall where it says boys boys

28:20.640 --> 28:22.640
You no longer need our

28:23.160 --> 28:25.160
own angel

28:27.160 --> 28:30.960
Now Bobby to be fair we didn't drop him we launched him too hard

28:31.280 --> 28:36.240
That was a different one. So if anything we did it to you good show this this one over here

28:36.240 --> 28:42.880
Ricky he choked on a carrot which we did tell him to not eat carrots while in the harness

28:42.880 --> 28:46.800
We settled that I mean and lay out of court. So don't worry that one

28:46.800 --> 28:49.160
We're that's why there's a question mark over his face

28:49.160 --> 28:56.580
I do I if you do go to a production of a foie production of Peter Pan where there is a boy based

28:56.800 --> 29:03.160
Whoopsie, that's got it. That's got to be on some bird man or the unexpected virtue of ignorance shit where it's like, whoa

29:03.160 --> 29:09.360
Damn, that child's committed to the bit. He ran into that armoire going really fast

29:16.080 --> 29:18.640
He is not getting up damn

29:19.520 --> 29:21.520
He's selling it Wow

29:22.360 --> 29:28.720
Wow, man the place then the rest of the place stopped. Whoa, I've never seen something like this

29:29.400 --> 29:31.400
commitment I

29:31.400 --> 29:33.040
I

29:33.040 --> 29:35.040
Think we should start our own

29:35.520 --> 29:40.160
Flight company like to do performer flying like our own

29:40.160 --> 29:45.600
But it's like the whole bit is that we undercut flying by for like whatever flying by foie hats for you

29:45.920 --> 29:50.040
Like we we will we will do it for less. We're called flyers

29:50.080 --> 29:56.840
Yeah, and with a Z and you could just get us for cheaper and our slogan is basically just as good

29:57.800 --> 30:00.160
Yeah, it should be fine

30:00.160 --> 30:01.520
I

30:01.520 --> 30:05.280
Not too high. I'm going to hit up Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

30:05.920 --> 30:13.560
About breaking up this fucking boy based flight monopoly that always got on that cuz like thank you crushes

30:14.640 --> 30:16.480
creativity

30:16.480 --> 30:21.240
Think of all the different ways we could be flying boys right now. Yeah, was it flying with boys?

30:21.240 --> 30:27.440
That's the name of ours flying with boys. We're gonna try some new innovative solutions. They may not always work, right?

30:27.440 --> 30:33.880
But we're willing to try something new foie has been rigging kids the same way, right?

30:33.880 --> 30:37.960
Right, we're gonna wait rig them a different way, right? Exactly. Well, and you know what?

30:38.760 --> 30:45.200
There might be a few break good eggs. Listen, I'm not gonna say that we won't break a few eggs. Right a legs

30:46.200 --> 30:49.400
Legs and eggs. That's another thing that I'm trying to pitch

30:50.040 --> 30:52.160
Maybe that's the name of the company. Yeah

30:53.320 --> 30:55.320
legs legs and eggs

30:55.320 --> 30:58.520
Legs and eggs. That's can I say for like

30:59.600 --> 31:03.440
Just really yeah, just do it. Just real quick legal disclaimer

31:04.120 --> 31:11.960
Flying by four. I have no idea if they've ever lost anybody. I will say they do not have a page called foies boys

31:18.280 --> 31:19.340
Why don't we do this

31:19.340 --> 31:26.000
Why don't we just leave a gap here where we can drop in the specific audio that flying by foie's lawyers?

31:26.200 --> 31:28.200
like

31:29.000 --> 31:35.400
Let's leave a break right because they're gonna use some terminology that like we can't generate right now with because we don't have law degrees

31:35.640 --> 31:40.080
Yeah, we'll just leave like a little gap here and then we can drop that in later. Yeah

31:41.880 --> 31:45.480
It was probably silence because we're incompetent but still yeah, definitely

31:45.480 --> 31:51.160
Um, yeah, let's go we're sponsored this week by flying by foie. Oh

32:02.960 --> 32:07.520

Hi, I'm biz and I'm Teresa and we're the hosts of one bad mother a podcast about parenting

36:11.940 --> 36:17.500
Parenting is hard and we have no advice, but we do see you doing it

36:17.540 --> 36:19.540
I'll give you like to do it

36:20.620 --> 36:24.600
Didn't we have a bumper sticker a while back that was like I'll give you did it

36:24.600 --> 36:27.260
That's what I was honk if you're doing it

36:27.260 --> 36:33.980
Why did we not ever make them? Oh, we didn't like them. I think there's still in the max fun store

36:34.940 --> 36:36.940

You can find us on maximum fun dot org, honk-honk toot-toot. I

36:49.860 --> 36:56.940
Listen to bull's-eye because Jesse always has really good questions. What did John Malkovich wear when he was 20, huh?

36:57.500 --> 36:59.180
I don't know how to describe it

36:59.180 --> 37:06.060
There's always that moment where Jesse asks a question that the person he's interviewing has not thought of before

37:06.060 --> 37:11.180
I don't think anyone's ever said that to me or acknowledged that to me and that is so real

37:11.780 --> 37:15.100
Bull's-eye interviews with creators you love and creators

37:15.100 --> 37:20.100
You need to know from maximum fun org and NPR

37:24.340 --> 37:29.340
Here's another question, so I pulled into the drive-thru a Taco Bell for a breakfast burrito

37:29.500 --> 37:31.900
They took my order, but when I got to the window

37:31.900 --> 37:38.340
They told me their system was down and that quote it was my lucky day quote and that quote

37:38.340 --> 37:40.820
My order was free and quote. I'm

37:40.820 --> 37:46.620
Done too many quotes. I realize that now. They handed me my food, and then closed the window

37:47.260 --> 37:49.260
awesome free food except

37:50.140 --> 37:53.020
They forgot to give my drink. Oh

37:54.140 --> 37:58.100
My god, this is real. I need my morning caffeine boost brothers

37:58.100 --> 38:02.060
Would it be okay for me to flag them down to ask for the missing drink?

38:02.060 --> 38:06.700
I ordered but didn't pay for or should I just be happy?

38:06.700 --> 38:12.020
With a free burrito and scram, that's from thirsty in Tennessee

38:12.580 --> 38:15.540
I have no idea. I don't know guys

38:16.420 --> 38:17.700
I'm

38:17.700 --> 38:22.060
Thanks, just based on how much we've discussed Taco Bell on this show

38:22.060 --> 38:24.860
Which is I would say more than the average bear

38:25.900 --> 38:29.820
We would have a sort of foothold on the diamond. I'm on the tall grass

38:30.460 --> 38:32.460
I'm I'm like

38:32.460 --> 38:37.140
I'm spiral. Yeah, can I be honest? Yeah, this I'm

38:38.140 --> 38:42.380
Melting my noodle, you know what I mean? This is this is our white whale

38:42.380 --> 38:44.940
This is this for me is our greatest challenge

38:45.580 --> 38:50.660
Like we've solved almost everything up to this is our more already. I'm just gonna say entire life

38:51.340 --> 38:57.340
Including give birth to my two girls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's this is like nine. Yeah, that's more exactly nine

38:57.340 --> 38:59.340
I mean I carry those things

38:59.340 --> 39:05.060
Yeah, exactly. No, I mean I you carry those for nine more weeks because that's more more accurate

39:05.060 --> 39:10.600
That's more accurate and back to back to you. It was 80 weeks total. I got it. Oh, yeah

39:10.740 --> 39:16.560
I'm gonna call if he white away. Okay, perfect. Now, are you sure cuz we only get one phone a friend per episode

39:16.560 --> 39:18.740
Well, yeah, no, no, no, it's fine

39:19.940 --> 39:23.180
It's less fun when you actually use real touch tone sounds

39:23.180 --> 39:28.360
A lot of numbers. It's like a toll like

39:36.540 --> 39:44.580
He's not it's ringing she's sending a message like more skill couldn't get that sound effect. Hey, how's it going? How's everybody feeling?

39:45.460 --> 39:51.160
Wake you up. I'm sorry, man. Oh, you know, you know, I'm always ready to answer the call. So

39:51.160 --> 39:57.120
As like the Ghostbusters. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, have you been waiting? Have you been waiting this whole time?

39:57.120 --> 40:00.680
Yeah, I'm sitting in a dark room staring at my cell phone. It's been

40:01.400 --> 40:09.040
Three to five years. I don't know what time is anymore, but oh boy. Oh boy. Oh, you've missed so much in the world

40:10.280 --> 40:16.440
I'll tell you it's not great. We got bud. We got some pretty heavy news to drop on you

40:16.440 --> 40:20.520
Yeah, I think that being not going yeah. Yeah, what do you mean?

40:20.520 --> 40:26.160
I was ready to just step outside, you know barefaced and start doing my ritual of kissing everyone

40:26.160 --> 40:30.960
I see it's so funny that you said that oh, oh boy. Oh, yeah

40:32.800 --> 40:37.920
There's this new rapper the baby and I think he's got good opinions and

40:37.920 --> 40:45.200
Oh, yeah, and you know, you know how you campaigned so hard for Trump's re-election

40:47.320 --> 40:53.280
No way I was I was on the street and by the way, he is he's the toddler now

40:53.840 --> 40:55.840
That's one of the big things

40:56.320 --> 41:02.060
If you're you're a comedian, you're an actor a writer, but you're

41:02.060 --> 41:09.900
Just right. Did you just read his email signature? No, what do you want me to say? What do you want me to say saying you?

41:11.180 --> 41:13.500
You taught me professionally talk about John Cena

41:13.740 --> 41:19.540
You're someone who for a living talks about how funny is that opening number by the way, I'm never skipping the intro

41:19.540 --> 41:21.720
I'm watching this so good crash every time

41:22.620 --> 41:28.020
Anyway, we got a question and I got to read it to you because you wouldn't have hurt at it

41:28.020 --> 41:35.180
you're good, but yeah, let me sum it up to like basically this person got a free burrito, but not but they didn't get the

41:35.180 --> 41:37.180
drink they ordered and

41:37.820 --> 41:39.820
Sit sit down because

41:39.820 --> 41:45.020
They didn't get the so it's like they didn't know if they should go back for their drink or they should just appreciate the free

41:45.020 --> 41:52.060
Food they got and I just kind of wanted to take your temperature real quick. Oh, yeah. No, I'm glad that you know

41:52.060 --> 41:58.140
That you you've hit me up for this. You know, I I would like to say I'm a Taco Bell expert

41:58.140 --> 42:04.620
Yeah, I I was there for the launch of the breakfast menu. Oh really there that morning. I I have pictures

42:04.620 --> 42:11.420
Oh, wow, saved of me and two other sad fellas who was like we gotta we gotta be here day one

42:11.780 --> 42:17.140
See what they got going and you know, I also I've worked at Disneyland

42:17.140 --> 42:22.740
Oh, wow, I wonder you're probably wondering where this is gonna come into play, but I'm gonna let you know right now

42:23.340 --> 42:30.060
Working at Disneyland. We have these things called magical moments. You try and create a magical moment for your guests

42:30.060 --> 42:35.340
Yeah at the park what is a way and here's what I'm thinking. That was a magical moment

42:36.340 --> 42:42.620
Between between them, you know Taco Bell and their systems toxicity of the city of the city

42:42.620 --> 42:50.300
So you got to just take it and scram you yeah

42:50.300 --> 42:51.680
I don't think you you know

42:51.680 --> 42:59.300
You just take because they're already having a bad day as someone who has worked in the fast-food setting like it was cool for you

42:59.300 --> 43:03.580
But I'm telling you on the inside they're losing their mind like what are we gonna do?

43:04.260 --> 43:10.980
Did it count when I clocked in am I working for free that that's if the class is that's the biggest thing

43:10.980 --> 43:15.260
I am I think your reaction to it depends on what level of

43:15.780 --> 43:21.540
Like what level you are with the Taco Bell corporation, which yeah yum brands, right?

43:21.540 --> 43:25.540
Is that yeah, I I feel like if you're a lower level sort of cog

43:25.540 --> 43:32.080
It may be turned into a pretty cheery day and honestly, we're gonna be able to slap that that big we're closed side on the window

43:32.400 --> 43:33.520
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

43:33.520 --> 43:40.540
I'm sure if I'm sure if you would have returned for your for your drink and walked in it would have been like the

43:40.540 --> 43:47.660
Island and yellow jackets like they're all wearing like deer bones, and they're like we are free from the Bell

43:49.220 --> 43:53.020
I don't love that Taco Bell

43:53.860 --> 44:00.060
Sells coffee. I guess they don't say coffee explicitly. This could be a war a morning Baja blast

44:00.340 --> 44:04.320
They can't they cannot start their working day without being by Baja

44:04.320 --> 44:11.840
uh, but it feels like coffee to me and yeah, it's it can't be you can't be coffee and

44:12.720 --> 44:18.440
Burrito, though, right? Those don't seem like those would go well together for y'all poo-poo the coffee. I

44:19.320 --> 44:27.080
Will pitch to you their other breakfast drink, which is just orange juice and Mountain Dew mix together. Oh, that's right

44:30.240 --> 44:32.040
Start your day, honestly

44:32.040 --> 44:34.600
So so y'all jokingly set the bar

44:36.320 --> 44:38.320
That just gave me

44:38.400 --> 44:43.040
That gave me heart palpitations to hear you say it. Oh boy, howdy

44:43.440 --> 44:47.160
But also I need that drink. Yeah, this is my problem

44:47.160 --> 44:52.560
I like if you're going if you're going through Taco Bell or in I guess this applies to any store

44:52.560 --> 44:59.360
But it's definitely definitely true talk about you've already made the decision in your head that it's worth trading your dollars

44:59.360 --> 45:03.960
For your refreshments like that's a some cost at that point that money's gone

45:04.560 --> 45:07.120
But it's not because it was free, right? Yeah

45:07.560 --> 45:12.200
Now you do run the risk if you go back through at a time you go back through the systems up again

45:12.200 --> 45:14.200
And I like good now we can charge you

45:14.200 --> 45:35.680
Yeah, that is good good theory also just consider the fact that that money you've budgeted can now go towards like that

45:36.360 --> 45:41.100
Super expensive coffee shop. You've been wondering about but you're like, I don't want to spend that much on coffee

45:41.100 --> 45:44.740
So now the burrito fund has some rollover bucks

45:47.300 --> 45:53.740
And we can take it there and see what it's talking about see what this turmeric pistachio milk latte is all about

45:55.740 --> 45:58.700
Hey me while you're there maybe take some wire cutters

46:00.380 --> 46:04.260
Systems down there. Oh, it's a daisy. Oh, no. Oh god

46:04.260 --> 46:10.940
I guess I'll take this yeah to go and they're like, well we can still accept cash and you're like, it's 2022

46:10.940 --> 46:12.940
And you just walk out the door with your free coffee

46:13.140 --> 46:19.740
Welcome to my pit for ocean sports are we to assume that the system broke down as like between the time that you ordered and

46:20.700 --> 46:26.260
The time you got to the window. Yeah, they wouldn't have taken the order. Yeah, that's what that's good fortune

46:26.260 --> 46:31.580
I think you need to just roll. I I'm I'm taking it back. You shouldn't go back through this Taco Bell

46:31.580 --> 46:36.340
You should never go back to this Taco Bell like your this is your moment. You won

46:36.700 --> 46:38.700
You need to get out while it gets good

46:39.060 --> 46:44.820
This is the one time where you're up, right the house always wins when you go to Taco Bell, right?

46:44.820 --> 46:50.380
But this time you won, you know, it's time to walk away. You're up one over talk about never go back

46:51.100 --> 46:54.300
Because one time what's gonna happen is you're gonna pay they're gonna hand you the bag. All the bags empty

46:54.300 --> 47:01.980
Yeah, fuck right. No, man. That's so true. Yeah, it's you'll be like I did not order this I

47:02.700 --> 47:08.420
Or like when you get the trade when when you get something you didn't order and like you're up

47:08.420 --> 47:14.180
I got something better, but you're down if you got something worse like I like those Cinnabon buckets

47:14.180 --> 47:17.100
I like a good, you know, Taco Bell Cinnabon bites. It's crispy

47:17.100 --> 47:17.820
Oh, yeah

47:17.820 --> 47:22.280
You know and it definitely has to be I have to be have the heart for it

47:22.280 --> 47:26.140
because when you bite into it and you don't have the heart for you realize what it is and

47:26.580 --> 47:32.300
Sad, but when when all the stars align and you can eat that it's great

47:32.300 --> 47:35.700
And one time I ordered it and I got the cinnamon twists

47:35.740 --> 47:41.860
which I knew were cheap because my buddy my best friend worked at a Taco Bell and I would

47:41.980 --> 47:45.980
in this is when I was like 18, so, you know, I was pulling up and I was like

47:47.100 --> 47:49.100
What can I get for free?

47:49.100 --> 47:56.020
And he and he always said it was like the cinnamon twist because we just make the like we don't make it to order

47:56.020 --> 48:01.180
We just make a whole bunch so we can we give them for free just as a treat a magical moment

48:01.180 --> 48:05.580
Just a magical moment. It's not you're giving away so much information. Oh, yeah

48:05.740 --> 48:09.780
Yeah, like you're gonna put the bail out of business. How do you capitalize on this?

48:09.780 --> 48:13.900
You just go to the window and you're like, hey, listen, I want cinnamon twists and I ain't gonna pay for

48:13.900 --> 48:20.900
You do it that which that will do you think do you guys do that thing where you'll get your order and then you pull

48:20.900 --> 48:23.460
Up a little bit and you stop and you go through the back to make sure it's all in there

48:23.540 --> 48:29.300
Do you think like the employee ever watches you do that from the window and they're like fuck man, you don't trust me probably I

48:29.980 --> 48:32.940
Can still see you here at my house?

48:32.940 --> 48:38.380
You just checked it what probably but also one time not one time a couple times now

48:38.380 --> 48:44.780
There has not been a toy inside of happy meals that has oh full-blown

48:45.380 --> 48:47.380
five harm house fires

48:48.580 --> 48:53.620
So that's the worst. We fool me once or twice. No way. Yeah. Well see you got it

48:53.620 --> 48:57.760
You just gotta be like me and be a turbo nerd and be like, oh no. No, they didn't forget the toy

48:57.820 --> 49:01.900
Here's a super Saiyan 5 Goku statue. They put in here

49:01.900 --> 49:03.900
I

49:06.620 --> 49:10.260
We're gonna put it on the shelf so we can look at it, but they did

49:12.460 --> 49:14.460
This is a 12-inch

49:15.340 --> 49:20.140
Sculpted statue that they put in your bag. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Yeah, that's a

49:22.900 --> 49:28.020
Kill Bill sword. It's all yours, buddy. Have fun. That's an Atari right there

49:28.020 --> 49:33.100
Like I took my three-year-old through Burger King yesterday and the toy was I kid you not

49:33.780 --> 49:40.940
pictures of dolphins and I handed it to her and she looked at me like I had just kicked her in like how

49:41.260 --> 49:47.620
Fucking dare you. Sorry. What is it again? Dad pictures of dolphins? Wow, that's so cool

49:47.620 --> 49:52.900
I wish everybody had an electronic device that could instantly pull up high-resolution video of dolphins

49:52.900 --> 49:55.100
Oh what we do, but thank you for these great

49:55.100 --> 49:57.820
Cherishable pictures of dolphins

49:58.420 --> 50:02.900
They're half like most of the time now when I get a children's story for my child in a bag

50:02.900 --> 50:07.740
It's like something that then I the parent have to build and I think this is completely

50:07.820 --> 50:11.340
Defeating the purpose of having something to distract my daughter so that I can have five

50:11.980 --> 50:16.940
Peaceful moments to myself while she's staring at me going fish building that tackle or whatever

50:16.940 --> 50:26.260
Yeah, you keep going to the McDonald's when they have the gunplug giveaways with that

50:26.260 --> 50:30.420
Can you build this HG Gundam Freeman, please?

50:32.140 --> 50:34.140
Yeah

50:34.900 --> 50:42.220
You know and a well-ventilated area, yeah, no I I feel the same way whenever it's a whack toy

50:42.220 --> 50:47.740
I'm like I failed you but also I'm like you failed yourself because I did research as a kid

50:47.740 --> 50:52.700
I remember you would look and you know, okay, okay Lion King's coming out. They got the Simba toys

50:52.700 --> 50:57.860
This is what I'm asking dad for McDonald's. Okay, they got they go. Yeah, whenever it was like, oh

50:58.340 --> 51:03.820
Here's this like slightly not cool. So I was like, oh we can eat it. We got McDonald's at home dad. It's fine

51:03.820 --> 51:13.380
I recently a BB on a Saturday saw that they had in cancer toys. So we went on Sunday and

51:13.860 --> 51:19.660
The window like it was the toy changeover and I said, do you still have in Canada? Like and they're like no

51:19.660 --> 51:22.860
We had I got and I said, can you know?

51:23.820 --> 51:27.900
I know and there was a long pause and then they're like, yeah

51:27.900 --> 51:32.580
We don't have any and I wanted to be like I don't listen. I I don't think they

51:32.580 --> 51:39.900
Did guarantee they did not look my child is in the car. Like can you tell I'm like you got it

51:39.900 --> 51:45.420
But you remember when Burger King sold golden Pokemon cards inside of metal

51:45.420 --> 51:47.740
Po like you would roll up to Burger King bill

51:47.740 --> 51:53.020
Let me get a kid's meal and those have the golden pokeball Pokemon cards that have right and they would be like no man

51:53.260 --> 51:59.320
That's five extra dollars and it's like you're a toy store now Burger King. Nice try. Yeah. Yeah

51:59.320 --> 52:06.640
Yeah, they did that on the reg because they also did that what like I remember buying a nightmare before Christmas watches

52:06.640 --> 52:11.520
Oh, yeah. No, I got the Wild Wild West sunglasses

52:17.000 --> 52:18.280
Boy

52:18.280 --> 52:19.880
Boy, oh

52:19.880 --> 52:27.320
Man, do you still have them? No because that same day we went to Disneyland and me being an idiot kid

52:27.320 --> 52:33.960
Wore them on Space Mountain, which if you know what Space Mountain is, there's no reason to wear sunglasses

52:34.520 --> 52:36.520
They're gone

52:37.520 --> 52:39.520
It's that you want to get rid of

52:46.960 --> 52:49.160
West Jim West Desperado on space

52:49.160 --> 52:59.520
But it's just you reaching out towards nothing as your parents

53:05.920 --> 53:07.920
Hey

53:07.920 --> 53:16.280
Please look on the floor Space Mountain decapitated looking for sunglasses

53:17.680 --> 53:19.960
If he can I ask what you did it Disneyland

53:19.960 --> 53:25.200
Oh that if you're one, I know you're one of the princesses you have to say you were like Ariel's friend. Yeah

53:25.200 --> 53:27.800
Yeah, that's that's the scale they do and you know

53:27.800 --> 53:33.960
I gotta say the magic dies the moment you walk backstage because the first thing I saw on my first day

53:33.960 --> 53:41.160
I'm working at Disneyland was Mickey with his head off smoking a cigarette and I was like, well, there it is

53:41.680 --> 53:46.760
But I worked on honey. I shrunk the audience and Astro orbiter eventually

53:49.080 --> 53:55.920
Was once the no, well Astro orbiter kind of sucks honey. I shrunk the sorry. I'm sorry. I was your fault

53:55.920 --> 53:57.920
You didn't design it

53:58.240 --> 54:01.960
Honey, I shrunk the audience. I was the kid one time on that was on the giant

54:01.960 --> 54:05.000
Yeah, that got blue screen. I had to act like oh no

54:05.000 --> 54:10.160
I'm gonna be is like I did a really good job like the cast member said that I did great

54:10.440 --> 54:16.160
Which I feel like if I had not done really well, they would have said good. Yeah

54:16.640 --> 54:21.880
Yeah, right. All right, but you nailed it back back when it used to be the MGM

54:23.120 --> 54:27.440
Studios instead of Hollywood Studios. I was in a live show and I don't want to brag

54:27.440 --> 54:32.360
But I was waiting backstage to go on and do my bit or whatever. And this isn't the Alfred Hitchcock

54:33.040 --> 54:37.200
No, that's a universal right? Yeah, well, that's another great one, but it doesn't exist anymore

54:37.200 --> 54:39.840
but this was like some kind of old-timey movie show and

54:40.720 --> 54:46.040
read the one of the performers filled up pie set with some whipped cream and then turned me and said put your hands out and

54:46.040 --> 54:50.800
I cut my hands and they filled my hands with whipped cream and it was one of the like when people say like hey

54:50.800 --> 54:53.960
What's your favorite Disney memory? I'm like, well, there's one time when I was nine years old

54:53.960 --> 54:57.680
I got to eat a handful of just whipped cream. It was the greatest experience

54:57.680 --> 55:00.220
I have ever had a Disney because an adult was just like

55:02.920 --> 55:05.680
So don't I would not complain at Taco Bell

55:06.760 --> 55:08.760
Yeah, yeah in closing

55:09.000 --> 55:14.040
Yeah, just take your free burrito and go. Yeah go with God if you what what do you got going on?
