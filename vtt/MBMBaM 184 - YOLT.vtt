00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.320
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

00:48.320 --> 00:52.320
oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm your baby,

00:52.320 --> 00:58.800
baby, baby, Griffin McElroy. This week, Travis told me that we've been overthinking intros,

00:58.800 --> 01:03.440
that we don't need to keep planning. Like we're always having this conversation about current

01:03.440 --> 01:09.840
events right before. And maybe there's, and he said, just, just start running.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.600
You know, that's a, that is a complaint that we get probably more than any other complaint,

01:13.600 --> 01:20.320
which is that our intros are too thought out and overproduced. They have too strong a sense

01:20.320 --> 01:25.520
of direction, uh, almost as though they'd been written for us ahead of time by Bruce Valanche,

01:25.520 --> 01:32.480
which of course everything we say on the show is, it just kind of ruins the, the mystery of it all.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.440
So I feel like, you know, let me just look for some material. There's no reason to like,

01:37.440 --> 01:38.400
overthink this.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.920
Just look around your room, pick an assortment of objects.

01:41.920 --> 01:46.480
Okay. You know what? I love this. This is sort of a freestyle. It's like somebody give me,

01:46.480 --> 01:50.160
somebody give me like a, uh, an action, you know, something that people are doing every day.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.040
Uh, euthanasia.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.160
Euthanasia. Okay.

01:54.160 --> 01:54.560
Great.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.880
Uh, someone give me a noun, you know, something to, to work.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.240
Colin Mockery.

02:00.240 --> 02:06.640
Colin Mockery. Okay. This is good so far. So far I got a euthanasia, Colin Mockery.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.360
Now I just need a musical style that I can set this to.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.360
Anything at all? Let me just hear the first thing.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.560
Gregorian chant.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.240
Okay. Anything. Just shout it out.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.520
He already said it and it was perfect.

02:15.520 --> 02:24.400
Okay. So here we go with that. Here is some improvisational comedy from the masters of,

02:24.400 --> 02:26.880
uh, improv comedy, my brother, my brother, me.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.600
Okay. Hold on. Here comes.

02:35.120 --> 02:40.800
Colin Mockery. Your time has come.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.200
Freeze.

02:41.200 --> 02:46.400
Hey, hey, Gov. Can you, can I borrow a biscuit?

02:46.400 --> 02:50.880
I'm a Gregorian.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.680
No, I said freeze, Justin. You're supposed to say yes and you don't go back to the thing

02:53.680 --> 02:54.240
you already did.

02:54.240 --> 02:54.640
Okay.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.560
You don't fucking go back to the safety of, like, the perfect goof you already created.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.880
We have to create new. We're constantly destroying and creating. That is part of improv comedy.

03:02.880 --> 03:03.520
Okay. All right.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.360
No problem, Gov. No, I'm a Gregorian monk. Colin Mockery.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.840
You're just doing the same fucking thing that we just did.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.960
It's all about destroying your art from before and create, kill your-

03:12.960 --> 03:13.360
Freeze.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.600
I didn't have something better. I just needed time to think.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.840
Okay. That's not really how freeze works.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.800
Travis.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.080
Freeze. Hey, Gov. Would you fancy a biscuit?

03:24.080 --> 03:26.800
Okay. You're just doing the same fucking things.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.040
No, I hadn't done that before.

03:31.600 --> 03:31.840
That's new.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.480
Yeah, improv comedy is easy. I don't know why. I don't know what Drew Carey was giving

03:36.480 --> 03:43.440
people points for. So, this is my brother. My brother and me, it's a comedy advice show.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.240
When we told, we've told people before it's a comedy advice show and they say,

03:50.800 --> 03:53.680
so you wait, you give advice to comedians? And it's like, well-

03:53.680 --> 03:54.160
Now we do.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.680
Now we do.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.360
Here's how you improv, fools. Listen up.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.240
That's how you improv.

03:58.240 --> 04:04.240
Listen, pay us $50,000 a month and you can move up the MBM improv comedy levels. Like,

04:04.240 --> 04:08.160
right now I'm level four. And if I want to move up, I have to test out,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.160
but I also have to pay another $50,000.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.960
There's also a significant amount of auditing that has to go on there.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.040
A lot of auditing. I mean, that's basically all-

04:15.040 --> 04:17.200
And lots of otters. There's so many otters, you guys.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.960
So many otters. See, that there was improv comedy on Travis's behalf.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.280
Improv is basically when you think of something and then you just say it.

04:25.280 --> 04:25.520
Yes.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.840
What improv comedy is, basically-

04:27.840 --> 04:33.040
It's talking without thinking about what you're saying. So, basically,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.560
everything Travis has ever done or said has been improv comedy.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.960
Basically, you know how words are usually used to communicate ideas, thoughts,

04:41.840 --> 04:45.440
that kind of thing? What improv comedy does is it takes that away and it says,

04:45.440 --> 04:46.800
what if it was just noise?

04:46.800 --> 04:47.680
What if it was sound?

04:47.680 --> 04:49.440
Let me suggest this because this is what I do.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.800
Pretend like you have an audience of one and it's yourself and don't worry about anyone else

04:54.800 --> 04:58.240
and just try to make yourself laugh and say things you think are clever.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.600
Just think like, what would I like?

04:59.600 --> 04:59.840
We are.

04:59.840 --> 05:00.880
Just do that.

05:00.880 --> 05:07.760
I love the image of Travis standing alone in a nightclub with Travis,

05:07.760 --> 05:10.880
another Travis, maybe like a slightly older, more wizened Travis,

05:10.880 --> 05:14.080
sitting alone at a table with a bourbon.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.160
Just, you can hear him call out from the back,

05:16.880 --> 05:18.080
Otters! Nice!

05:18.080 --> 05:19.520
Yeah! Nice!

05:19.520 --> 05:20.960
Make more fart noises.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.680
And then maybe they meet up after the show, they have a couple of drinks

05:23.680 --> 05:25.680
and they realize that they have a lot in common.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.360
And, you know, they just see where the night takes them.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.920
Let's get to the advice.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.600
I've studied abroad in the UK and since coming home, I've been really depressed.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.720
I left everything about living there and all the adventures I got to have on a daily basis

05:38.720 --> 05:41.680
without the responsibilities of a difficult classes or a job.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.880
It was the best time of my life.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.960
Being home in Texas now seems dull and America's troubles just make me want to pick up and move there.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.040
But I can't leave my family and friends.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.680
I've been trying to use my experience to open my eyes to the greatness of my own home without much luck.

05:55.680 --> 06:02.320
Can you help me find my love of America and get over this study abroad withdrawal?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.680
And that's from Gmail.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.760
Is it possible that it's...

06:09.040 --> 06:14.400
Maybe it has nothing to do with the place so much as it does the experience.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.800
Like it was a really super fun, wonderful thing.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.040
And it's like, yeah, of course you're going to be.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.360
Vacation is great and everybody wishes they could live on vacation all the time.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.560
But you can't.

06:24.560 --> 06:29.360
If you lived in the UK all your life and then you went to visit somewhere else,

06:29.360 --> 06:30.640
you would love that place too.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.640
It's new and different.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.560
Here's the thing about studying abroad, right?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.840
You go to another place where you don't know anybody.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.920
You know that whatever you do there, A, your time is finite.

06:41.920 --> 06:47.280
And B, the things that you don't have to put down roots or try to figure out.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.760
Some of the bigger questions, you just live moment to moment.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.960
Let me tell you what you were doing for that time you're studying abroad in the UK.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.440
A, you lived like you were dying.

06:55.440 --> 06:55.920
Indeed.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.080
You went skydiving, you went Rocky Mountain climbing,

07:00.080 --> 07:02.160
or maybe Stonehenge climbing, either way.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.920
They don't let you do that, I don't think.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.520
You lived in a way that you were free of the serious responsibilities

07:07.520 --> 07:12.480
that make day-to-day life as an adult such a just a slog.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.480
Just a just a slog.

07:15.680 --> 07:20.800
And maybe that attitude is something that you could inject a little bit more

07:20.800 --> 07:24.080
into your day-to-day life in Tejas.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.080
And maybe you should just move out of Texas.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.600
Hey, shut the fuck up.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.320
Texas rules.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.080
I mean, unless you live in Austin.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.520
He probably does, because God, where else would you even live?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.520
I don't... Are there other towns here?

07:35.520 --> 07:36.080
Here's the thing.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.920
You guys touched on it.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.680
If you lived in the UK, imagine you lived in the UK your whole life,

07:41.680 --> 07:43.600
and you came to America and you ate a hot dog,

07:43.600 --> 07:45.440
you're like, fuck, I'm moving here.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.480
Because that's sort of our main tourism is hot dogs.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.800
We have a hot dogs and aquariums.

07:52.800 --> 07:52.960
Right.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.240
I've thought this about every place I've ever...

07:56.240 --> 07:57.200
Almost every place.

07:57.200 --> 08:02.080
Not every place, but almost every place I've ever taken vacation at.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.720
Like, you know, when we go to Tybee Island near Savannah,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.800
I think, oh, my God, I could totally live here.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.520
Or Austin.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.960
Oh, my God, I could totally live here.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.040
But the thing is, what you're doing is basically...

08:14.160 --> 08:17.600
Like, for a few days, you're living a life where all you have to do

08:17.600 --> 08:19.920
is worry about entertaining yourself and having fun.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.320
Right.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.720
And like, yeah, that's gonna be pretty addictive.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.600
Let me throw this out.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.280
It's like you're watching a TV show, right?

08:27.280 --> 08:30.160
In which the characters are always having the fun, happy,

08:30.160 --> 08:32.720
or like action-packed, exciting times.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.520
But what you don't see is them going to the grocery store.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.800
You don't see them like...

08:36.800 --> 08:39.520
Yeah, Jack Bauer never poops on 24.

08:39.520 --> 08:44.880
He never like eats some really foul nachos in like episode three.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.400
And then episode six, he's like, I'll be right back.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.320
And then... Although, I don't know.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.440
Think of your time there.

08:51.440 --> 08:55.600
But think of your time there as like an episode of the television show

08:55.600 --> 08:58.240
in which all you had was the highlights.

08:58.240 --> 08:58.640
Right.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.920
And then you come back and it's shitty 24, literally.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.880
I hope that they incorporate that into the new season.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.000
I think that that's must-see TV.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.640
Because like, you'll see one episode and you'll be like,

09:10.640 --> 09:13.440
I haven't seen Jack Bauer in like two entire episodes.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.320
What the fuck?

09:14.320 --> 09:16.240
And then you find out at the end of episode eight,

09:16.240 --> 09:17.680
he has really bad food poisoning.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.680
He is not going to be a major character in this one.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.120
I wish in this modern era, we probably...

09:23.120 --> 09:25.920
If 24 was on the air right now, and I know it's coming back,

09:25.920 --> 09:28.480
but if it was on the air right this moment,

09:28.480 --> 09:30.640
I think there would probably be a web series

09:30.640 --> 09:32.880
after that was like the next 24.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.880
And it's just Jack Bauer sleeping for 14 hours.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.400
And catching up on Downton Abbey.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.840
I'm so tired.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.640
I'm getting Thai.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.400
Waiting for Thai.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.160
Waiting for Thai is a whole episode.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.600
God, is it going to get there?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.440
Is it going to get there before Downton comes on?

09:47.440 --> 09:48.160
God, I hope so.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.800
What about just a whole season of just him like oversleeping

09:55.360 --> 09:56.960
for the first like five hours?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.800
And I was like, oh my God, everything's going to shit.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.680
And there's bombs going off.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.480
Where's Jack?

10:00.480 --> 10:01.200
Where's Jack?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.080
I haven't seen him in a while.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.080
Listen, he had really bad food poisoning yesterday.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.360
He's plump tuckered.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.040
Will you get off his case?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.320
He just shit his guts out last season, which was yesterday.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.000
Maybe you could calm down for a second.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.200
Jack, it's Chloe.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.440
We need you to bring down the terrorists who finally...

10:15.440 --> 10:17.120
Chloe, damn it.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.280
Can you bring him here?

10:19.280 --> 10:20.160
Can he come here?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.640
I'm still in my cookie pants.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.800
Can you please bring him here?

10:24.800 --> 10:25.840
I'm not even...

10:25.840 --> 10:28.480
Didn't shave, feel a bit...

10:28.480 --> 10:29.920
Can it wait until tomorrow?

10:30.640 --> 10:33.840
I've sort of told myself I'm just going to kind of putter around today.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.480
You know how you putter to try to get your strength back up?

10:36.960 --> 10:39.280
Chloe, I got a diarrhea.

10:39.280 --> 10:39.920
I got diarrhea.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.000
Why does he get diarrhea every time?

10:42.000 --> 10:47.200
Why do we want to see Kiefer Sutherland just like spewing his guts out?

10:47.200 --> 10:49.360
Why is that something that fascinates us?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.400
I think it's because he's so strong.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.680
He's such a strong stoic.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.480
Because there can't be heroes anymore, Griffin.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.520
I guess it's true.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.560
We as a society cannot allow heroes and we must watch them poop.

11:02.800 --> 11:03.840
You guys know Yahoo?

11:03.840 --> 11:06.000
Here in America, we just want to watch our heroes poop.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.840
Here's the other thing.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.720
The UK is great.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.200
Every time I go there, I feel like I want to get back there.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.560
Got to get my paper right.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.320
And I'm on that hustle constantly just to try to get back over the UK

11:18.320 --> 11:20.800
because I've had a great time every time.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.440
But every time I've been there, I've also been on vacation.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.160
So I don't know.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.440
Just get a highlight reel, really.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.200
Hang in there.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.800
You'll find it again.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.360
Or you know what?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.200
Just move.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.880
I don't think you can move to the...

11:32.880 --> 11:35.040
I don't think you're allowed to just like move to another country.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.120
It's a one in one out kind of thing.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.280
You got to convince someone in the UK to move here.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.400
Just wait until the next time you see Russell Brown on TV,

11:42.400 --> 11:45.520
ask him to please stay put for a little while

11:45.520 --> 11:47.440
and then get back over there.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.280
Sounds pretty easy.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.320
Here's a Yahoo answer.

11:51.520 --> 11:56.000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Dan Yoel.

11:56.000 --> 11:56.640
Thanks, Dan.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Hook who asks,

11:59.120 --> 12:05.360
Am I cursed or is 2014 cursed?

12:08.160 --> 12:11.520
I'm I cursed or is 2014 cursed?

12:12.800 --> 12:16.640
I failed in my college and just yesterday I had accident

12:16.640 --> 12:18.400
and it's cost me a lot, $2,500.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.480
My new car, it's Hyundai Elantra 2013

12:22.480 --> 12:24.560
and I don't know what to do.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.800
And I was planning to buy a new phone, but now I can't.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.560
Does anyone have a lot of money and want to give me?

12:32.880 --> 12:33.680
First off, yes.

12:34.240 --> 12:34.880
How much do you need?

12:36.400 --> 12:37.920
This is a promising investment.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.880
I've been watching a lot of Shark Tank lately

12:40.880 --> 12:44.640
and I've learned to identify when there's a promising...

12:44.640 --> 12:46.320
So what's your business?

12:46.320 --> 12:47.600
I just failed out of college.

12:48.240 --> 12:52.160
I'm pretty sure that the year that we are in is cursed.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.840
Can you float me like four grand?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.200
Yep.

12:55.200 --> 12:55.920
You know what?

12:55.920 --> 12:56.720
Here's what I'm going to need.

12:56.720 --> 13:02.400
I'm going to need 50 cents for every car that you wreck

13:03.120 --> 13:04.160
until I get my money back

13:04.160 --> 13:06.000
and then I'm going to need a quarter in perpetuity.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.360
I don't need a portion of your business.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.920
I actually would like to stay out of the you business

13:09.920 --> 13:10.960
if at all possible.

13:10.960 --> 13:11.760
And we're going to need...

13:11.760 --> 13:13.040
It does not seem super promising.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.880
I'd like to be in charge of the branding.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.840
So just like call yourself Justin McElroy from now on.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.120
Is that something we can negotiate?

13:19.120 --> 13:21.200
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this story

13:21.200 --> 13:22.240
and I'm going to license it.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.160
I'm going to take it to Black & Decker.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.520
You know, I'm going to take it...

13:25.520 --> 13:25.920
Fuck that.

13:25.920 --> 13:28.400
I'm going to take it to fucking George Clooney

13:28.400 --> 13:30.240
and it's going to be his next film.

13:30.240 --> 13:30.960
It's the story of...

13:31.680 --> 13:33.760
It'll be called A Cursed Year

13:33.760 --> 13:35.120
and it will star who else?

13:35.120 --> 13:36.320
George Clooney.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.240
Well, that's great because you get in a car accident

13:38.240 --> 13:39.200
and you call somebody like,

13:39.200 --> 13:40.080
I was in a car accident.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.960
Like, oh my God, are you okay?

13:40.960 --> 13:41.520
Like, yeah.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.720
I mean, it's just like $2,500 of damage.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.560
It's not even that serious,

13:46.560 --> 13:48.080
but still like bummer.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.320
And I was going to get that phone.

13:52.320 --> 13:52.960
You know, but...

13:52.960 --> 13:54.240
Music swells.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.280
Tears, tears, tears.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.000
You're joking.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.160
But there are whole episode arcs on the OC

13:58.160 --> 14:00.000
that are far less dramatic than this.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.040
This could have a potential on television.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.080
Guys, is 2014 fucking cur...

14:08.080 --> 14:09.440
I know we talked about 20 forward

14:09.440 --> 14:10.560
and like everything's great,

14:10.560 --> 14:12.080
but like, I don't...

14:12.080 --> 14:13.040
What it like...

14:13.040 --> 14:15.920
This person's having like a shitty day

14:15.920 --> 14:17.920
to good Rick Day ratio so far.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.240
2014 has not been working in this dude's favor.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.000
What it seems to me is that in 2013,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.200
it all kind of spread around

14:25.200 --> 14:27.600
and everybody got like 1% of it, right?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.720
Maybe in 2014, it's just a dump on this guy

14:30.720 --> 14:33.840
and everybody else is going to have a banner year, right?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.640
Because all the shit has just been funneled.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.120
Just been funneled into this one person.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.520
Yeah, he's the Job of our generation.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.800
He's taking on all of it so we can have a great 2014.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.280
God and the devil have an agreement about Job 2.0.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.960
You're saying Job in the biblical sense,

14:50.960 --> 14:52.960
not in the Arrested Development sense.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.760
Yes.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.560
Okay.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.080
Yeah, everybody thinks a great way

14:56.080 --> 15:00.880
to close out New Year's Eve is by taunting Rolani's.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.800
That's not ideal.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.800
You think it's going to work out.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.080
You think it's going to be a real lark

15:08.080 --> 15:09.040
for you and your friends.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.000
It's going to be a laugh,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.840
but like that laugh is going to cost...

15:11.840 --> 15:14.880
You're going to be haunted by a satyr or something.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.880
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.320
Don't taunt people.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.760
Stop taunting people, please.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.520
And don't drink and drive

15:21.520 --> 15:23.920
and run over people's daughters.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.000
They might curse you.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.440
Well, that's like good fucking advice in general, Travie.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.560
That's fair.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.520
I mean, that's also just a bad way to start 2014.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.560
Is to kill someone?

15:34.560 --> 15:35.760
Yeah, I would say it's pretty...

15:35.760 --> 15:36.400
Yeah, it's bad.

15:37.680 --> 15:42.240
I don't believe in curses that I believe in is momentum.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.840
You make your own curse, right?

15:43.840 --> 15:45.840
You make your own curse in this life.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.040
And this guy made his by taunting Rolani on New Year's Eve.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.600
You can't get away with that.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.160
This guy taunted Ray Romano on New Year's Eve.

15:57.440 --> 15:57.920
And he made...

15:57.920 --> 16:01.120
Ray Romano is a treasure who got a bad rap

16:01.120 --> 16:05.280
for doing comedy that was broadly enjoyable,

16:05.280 --> 16:06.960
as if that's some sort of crime.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.800
I feel bad about this guy because like 2014 is,

16:10.800 --> 16:12.400
for me, been pretty good.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.320
For me, I guess it's all subjective, isn't it?

16:14.320 --> 16:16.320
Because for me, it's not cursed.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.840
I would say I'm having a blessed...

16:17.840 --> 16:20.240
Hey guys, have a blessed year.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.320
That's something I'm gonna start saying to people.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.840
Let me throw this out though.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.760
Okay, you got in a car accident.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.600
I could see where that's a horrible twist of luck.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.840
You fail out of college?

16:29.840 --> 16:33.360
That's not like a sudden thing that happened in 2014.

16:33.360 --> 16:33.680
The only...

16:33.680 --> 16:36.000
We've only been in 2014 for three weeks.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.960
But the only class he was taking was Safe Driving 101.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.440
Is it this?

16:40.640 --> 16:41.840
That's the problem.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.800
This is pass fail advanced calculus one week edition.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.280
Here we go.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.360
Nope, you got one question wrong.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.560
Get the fuck out of here.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.840
You're out of school.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.560
You're out of...

16:50.560 --> 16:51.360
Listen, this sucks.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.600
It's a bad term, but hey, have a blessed year.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.960
And be careful as you walk out.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.400
We've seen Romani on the lawn.

16:59.920 --> 17:04.000
Do you like how we have tried to be more sensitive

17:04.000 --> 17:06.320
by not referring to Romani as gypsies,

17:06.320 --> 17:09.760
but still clinging to the idea that Romani's

17:09.760 --> 17:11.280
are people that will curse you?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.800
Yeah, we're the worst.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.000
We're the pits.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.720
I love them.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.840
I think they're great people.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.840
You know who's having a good 2014 is Drake.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.000
Drake was on SNL.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.720
Is he a Romani?

17:22.240 --> 17:25.600
Drake is half Jewish, half black, half Romani.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.320
Well, he's one and a half man.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.200
That's why he has that extra torso coming out of his butt

17:33.200 --> 17:35.760
and that has a second person that he keeps inside

17:35.760 --> 17:36.880
the big jackets he wears.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.160
You know, you always see Drake and he's wearing

17:38.160 --> 17:40.000
a big puffy jacket and you wonder why is that?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.600
He seems like a pretty trim dude.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.880
You'd think he'd dress in a sort of more Metro fashion,

17:44.880 --> 17:48.480
but no, he has a second torso that comes out of the base

17:48.480 --> 17:53.120
of his spine and he has to keep it inside of his clothes.

17:53.120 --> 17:53.760
It used to be great.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.920
He used to be able to fold it back on itself

17:55.920 --> 17:58.480
and wear JNCO jeans, but nobody can really wear

17:58.480 --> 17:59.600
JNCO jeans anymore.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.360
I have to be honest, I spaced out for the beginning

18:03.360 --> 18:07.200
of that bit and it got pretty bizarre there in the middle.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.120
You know who else gets bizarre in the middle?

18:09.120 --> 18:11.840
Drake, because he has a second torso that comes out of his ass.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.320
Sydney looked at me, Sydney was a huge Degrassi fan,

18:16.320 --> 18:18.160
which of course everybody knows.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.840
Fucking Drake, that human being is bulletproof.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.720
That motherfucker got to be the kid in a wheelchair

18:24.720 --> 18:27.680
on Degrassi and not in a wheelchair the whole time.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.640
Obviously, Jimmy was shot in that one episode

18:30.640 --> 18:31.680
in the school shooting episode.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.120
Making him literally bulletproof.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.040
Oh, I guess now he's not super bulletproof.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.160
Not super bulletproof.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.280
He's bullet resilient.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.440
She was penetrated by a bullet,

18:39.440 --> 18:41.920
which had some adverse effects on him.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.680
And then he's going to be a rapper.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.920
Do you know how hard it is for regular people

18:45.920 --> 18:47.840
to establish rapper cred?

18:47.840 --> 18:50.800
Like to get cred and believability as a rapper.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.040
This motherfucker, we saw his adolescence.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.120
He was on Canadian TV.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.360
Like you can't snap back from that,

18:57.360 --> 19:00.000
but somehow Drake has made a living as a rapper.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.320
Like he's rapping as if he is not also Jimmy from Degrassi.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.360
After the episode, after the episode of SNL,

19:07.360 --> 19:10.240
Sydney looks at me and says, I'm proud of Drake.

19:12.240 --> 19:12.960
What?

19:12.960 --> 19:15.280
She said, I'm proud of Drake.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.240
Do you think Drake knows whenever anybody in the world

19:18.240 --> 19:20.560
says that and it's like a little bell rings

19:20.560 --> 19:24.000
and he's like, oh, all right, working my way back.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.960
YOLO, I guess.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.360
He came up with YOLO.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.320
That's the other thing.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.440
Did he really?

19:29.440 --> 19:30.880
Yes, Drake invented YOLO.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.120
Oh, great.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.160
Now someone's Googling.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.400
He popularized it.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.600
I don't know if he invented it.

19:37.600 --> 19:41.280
He said on SNL, he said, I invented YOLO.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.440
Actually, Mae West was the first person to say YOLO.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.080
This is true.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.440
Mae West did not say YOLO.

19:49.440 --> 19:55.200
Mae West, popular actor of the early 1900s,

19:56.080 --> 19:57.040
invented YOLO.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.080
She didn't say YOLO.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.240
She said you only live once, but that's.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.160
Yeah, but it's 2014.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.920
Everybody lived as much as they wanted to.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.600
And Mae West brought down the judgment and said, from now on,

20:08.160 --> 20:09.040
you only live once.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.000
And everyone panicked.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.160
And then the stock market crashed.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.760
Mae West was half-fay.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.000
So she got to decide the fate of humanity.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.120
That makes sense.

20:17.120 --> 20:17.520
Yeah.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.320
Do you think Drake, while he was doing Degrassi,

20:20.320 --> 20:21.520
somebody came up to him and was like, hey, Drake,

20:21.520 --> 20:23.840
can I tell you something that Mae West once told me?

20:23.840 --> 20:24.960
You only live once.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.280
And he was like, fuck, I thought I would get like another go-around

20:27.920 --> 20:29.280
on my second torso.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.640
I thought I would get like a second life.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.240
I've been wasting all this time doing Canadian teen dramas.

20:34.240 --> 20:39.040
Yeah, Drake got to be on a Canadian teen drama called Degrassi.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.080
And then after that, he got to be a rapper named Drake.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.320
If anybody should not be preaching to me about how we only have one life,

20:46.320 --> 20:47.200
it's Drake.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.160
That motherfucker has obviously, at this point,

20:50.160 --> 20:52.000
lived two very distinct lives.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.220
YOLT.

20:54.160 --> 20:54.640
YOLT.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.140
YOLT.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.040
IOLT.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.040
IOLT.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.560
IOLT YOLO.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.120
OK?

21:01.120 --> 21:01.620
IOLT.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.200
That's fine.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.080
But YOLO.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.960
I think it would actually, it'll be like ODLT,

21:06.960 --> 21:08.720
which is only Drake lives twice.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.280
Nobody else can even try it.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.320
How about another question?

21:12.320 --> 21:15.360
Our question to goof ratio has been pretty bad.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.200
It's Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.120
We're just, everybody else gets the day off.

21:19.120 --> 21:23.040
I don't know why we can't take the day off from being topical or funny.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.520
I think we've done a pretty good job so far.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.160
Like others, my grandmother bakes cookies and other goods.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.560
One problem.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.240
She often uses expired ingredients to make the food,

21:34.240 --> 21:37.280
saying that the new food has its own expiration.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.320
Hold the goddamn phone.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.600
A moment.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.520
You're saying, like, if she uses some rotten ass, like,

21:46.160 --> 21:48.640
eggs that she found in a mummy's crypt,

21:49.280 --> 21:51.440
and then, like, bakes that into a pie,

21:51.440 --> 21:53.200
she's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.400
Don't even worry about it.

21:54.400 --> 21:54.800
Now it's new.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.760
It's been reborn.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.680
Refresh the clock on this pie.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.480
You think those eggs are like,

22:02.480 --> 22:04.480
oh, guys, guys, guys, we're pie now.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.680
All right, start it over.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.120
Cool, cool.

22:07.120 --> 22:07.840
Start it over.

22:07.840 --> 22:10.320
Germs, germs, bacteria, you guys get out of here.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.200
We're starting fresh.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.840
It's got to be a stressful thing as an egg, though.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.160
You get this new lease on life as pie,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.560
and then you have to hope that you're,

22:18.560 --> 22:20.640
you start racking your egg brain like,

22:20.640 --> 22:21.680
what else could pie be?

22:22.400 --> 22:22.960
Oh, fuck.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.680
She could transform the pie into maybe a smoothie.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.040
Can you put us in a blender, please?

22:29.040 --> 22:30.400
And then you just take that smoothie,

22:30.400 --> 22:31.680
pour it into another pie.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.680
That's actually what the movie Life of Pie is about.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.520
And also what the Miracle of Hanukkah was.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.120
A lot of people don't know that.

22:39.120 --> 22:39.840
That's what that was.

22:41.040 --> 22:41.840
That part's not true.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.440
Do you want to finish the question?

22:44.640 --> 22:45.200
Yes.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.120
My family won't confront her about it.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.240
And even says she's right.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.360
What the fuck are you doing?

22:49.360 --> 22:51.040
You need to emancipate.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.440
Your family's fucking crazy.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.760
Am I right in thinking this is disgusting and wrong?

22:55.760 --> 22:58.320
And if so, how do I get my family to stop eating her food

22:58.320 --> 22:59.440
or get her to stop?

22:59.440 --> 23:02.560
That's from Nana's Nasty Nibbles in Naga Doches.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.600
Hey, here's a fun game.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.520
Nacog Doches.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.480
Here's a fun game.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.400
Wait till you're in the middle of a crowded room

23:08.400 --> 23:10.880
and then just patiently lean forward and say,

23:10.880 --> 23:13.600
hey, my grandmother cooks with expired food.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.280
And then lean back and watch everybody react and go,

23:17.280 --> 23:19.120
okay, yes, I am 100% correct.

23:19.120 --> 23:24.080
And no one in that bar, stranger or no, will go,

23:24.080 --> 23:25.360
well, yeah, that's perfectly normal.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.120
She uses old ass eggs and gross milk.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.080
Yeah, that's fine.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.960
Please just promise me one thing, question asker.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.400
If you and your family have an intervention

23:34.400 --> 23:36.880
for your grandma over her old food

23:36.880 --> 23:38.720
and you get your old, old grandma

23:38.720 --> 23:41.120
and you get to shame her about using expired ingredients,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.640
please promise you'll invite me.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.480
I just need to be in the circle

23:44.480 --> 23:46.800
where I can stand up and read my letter

23:46.800 --> 23:48.560
about how her use of expired ingredients

23:48.560 --> 23:50.640
has hurt me personally and how I care about her.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.520
It's hurt you in a very, if you're eating it,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.640
it'll hurt, it'll hurt you.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.000
I'm not like a doctor

23:58.800 --> 24:01.200
and I'm probably not even very good at science

24:01.200 --> 24:03.520
just like compared to the average person.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.960
But if you eat an old egg,

24:06.160 --> 24:08.160
you're gonna get sick from it probably.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.800
Here's the thing, listeners, listeners,

24:10.800 --> 24:12.320
here's what I don't need.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.720
I don't need any of you to email me and go,

24:14.720 --> 24:16.640
well, actually, because the baking process,

24:16.640 --> 24:18.960
blah, because the fact of the matter is

24:18.960 --> 24:20.800
she's using old-ass eggs and old-ass milk

24:20.800 --> 24:22.320
and I don't even let that shit in my house.

24:22.320 --> 24:22.960
No.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.480
Let alone in my cookies.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.480
Now, I feel like Nana needs an advocate here.

24:26.480 --> 24:30.000
So I'm gonna say, I mean, you're cooking it.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.680
It is safe, like it's safe.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.200
It's gross.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.240
Wait, wait, no, hold on.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.720
Because this argument is starting to take a real turn

24:36.720 --> 24:38.080
for the worst because you're saying,

24:39.840 --> 24:41.920
regardless of the age of the egg,

24:41.920 --> 24:43.680
if you apply enough heat to it,

24:43.680 --> 24:44.960
it will become safe to eat.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.240
Yeah.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.040
Unless she is cooking at 1200 degrees.

24:49.040 --> 24:49.360
That's right.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.560
If she's irradiating them, then yes, I agree.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.240
There's no danger of anything.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.360
It's not dangerous.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.840
It's dangerous to your palate.

24:57.840 --> 24:58.480
It's gonna taste like-

24:59.360 --> 25:00.960
You realize that you can cook food

25:00.960 --> 25:02.640
and still get food poisoning from it, right?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.600
That's not how that works, Travis.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.880
It is, in fact, how that works, Justin.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.920
That's not how it works.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.760
If you cook, okay, I have my food handler's license, okay?

25:13.760 --> 25:14.880
So everybody take a step back.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.840
Jesus, what did you get?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.360
Where did you, Olive Garden?

25:18.160 --> 25:19.200
What, yes.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.920
Okay, can I, I think that that food handler's license

25:21.920 --> 25:24.880
is no longer, I think you have to re-up that every,

25:24.880 --> 25:26.080
I don't know, decade.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.160
Yeah, but I don't think the science on food handling

25:30.160 --> 25:30.880
has changed that much.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.960
Also, I don't think during your food handler's classes,

25:32.960 --> 25:34.560
they're like, yeah, don't even worry about it.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.680
Once you cook it, the clock resets on that one.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.960
No, I mean that we didn't cover that.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.680
I think that though, once you bake it

25:45.680 --> 25:47.440
and you kill all the bacteria.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.240
Justin, I want you to take a chicken cutlet,

25:50.240 --> 25:52.640
set it on the counter for three days.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.000
Wait, I got one here.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.240
Okay, set it on the counter for three days

25:56.240 --> 25:59.680
and then I want you to bake it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes

25:59.680 --> 26:00.960
and then I want to watch you eat it.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.360
I would do that.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.960
I have enough patience.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.680
Bullshit.

26:05.680 --> 26:06.480
I would do that.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.160
I have enough patience, I would do it.

26:08.160 --> 26:08.960
Let's do a quick edit.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.160
Let me leave some chicken out.

26:10.160 --> 26:10.560
Okay.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.680
Okay, I've got the chicken here.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.240
We're back.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.120
It's been three days.

26:13.120 --> 26:13.920
It's Thursday.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.120
Let me just, yeah, I'm fine.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.880
Gosh, guys, through the magic of radio,

26:18.880 --> 26:20.160
I've proven you wrong.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.080
You ate that really fast, Justin.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.120
I'm worried about how quickly you were cooking it.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.040
I had to cut away some stuff.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.160
There wasn't a lot of salvageable meat left.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.880
It had largely decomposed, but it was still delicious.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.680
Little Dijon, delicious.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.000
I think you need to go to your old grandma and say,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.800
listen, you don't have much time left.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.880
Wow, okay, come on.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.320
What are you supposed to say?

26:44.320 --> 26:46.240
Well, don't bring up her impending death.

26:46.240 --> 26:49.120
That's probably not a good way to start up any conversation ever.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.840
You guys, you guys, you guys, you guys.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.320
Travis.

26:52.880 --> 26:56.160
What if she's using expired food as a metaphor

26:56.160 --> 26:58.000
for how she still has a purpose

26:58.000 --> 27:00.080
and they shouldn't put her in the home?

27:00.080 --> 27:02.800
Oh my God, she's trying to stay out of a home.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.120
Of course.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.320
She sent you a message like,

27:04.320 --> 27:05.840
yeah, maybe these eggs are a little old,

27:05.840 --> 27:07.920
but that doesn't mean they're not still useful.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.960
Hey, Nana, can I make a quick suggestio?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.800
If you could get Nana on the line real quick.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.000
Make this point with anything else.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.560
Make it with old board games.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.520
Like this Scrabble may have a little dust on it,

27:21.520 --> 27:22.880
but it's still a hoot to play.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.760
We lost all the E tiles, but it's still a pretty fun game.

27:25.760 --> 27:26.560
Reset the clock.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.600
VHS copy of Spaceballs may be a little cracky

27:30.240 --> 27:32.240
and a little staticky, but it's still pretty fun.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.440
Reset the clock.

27:33.440 --> 27:36.160
Reset the clock on these Spaceballs.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.600
These fresh Spaceballs now.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.880
Put it in the DVD player.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.240
Like Meeps, we can't.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
We can't be, it's a VHS, Meeps.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.760
That movie's fucking definitely expired.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.360
Tried to watch it the other day.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.960
That shit gone bad.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.080
It went rancid.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.720
You watch that and you watch Men in Tights

28:02.720 --> 28:04.560
and you're like, oh, now I get it.

28:05.120 --> 28:05.840
Now I understand.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.920
No, F you, Men in Tights is great.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.840
Yeah, sure, sure.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.880
Eat these eggs, Travis.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.640
Eat these old eggs.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.080
Eat these old eggs, you're gonna love it.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.040
I got some prime Florida real estate to sell you, my man.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.080
Audience Travis is like, yeah, he's right though.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.560
Nailed it, stuck it to him.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.000
You know what never goes bad?

28:26.000 --> 28:26.500
What?

28:27.360 --> 28:27.840
Money.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.360
I mean, it does if it like defaults.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.720
Like I don't think they're-

28:30.720 --> 28:32.320
Or if you like soak it in eggs.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.960
I think it's still legal tender like forever.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.960
But I don't think they use francs anymore.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.360
I think if you have francs, they just like,

28:39.360 --> 28:40.720
they won't accept those.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.240
And hey pennies.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.400
And hey pennies, doubloons.

28:45.120 --> 28:45.620
Amazon.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.720
Amazon takes doubloons?

28:48.720 --> 28:51.120
I was trying, okay guys, listen.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.720
I was trying to say money zone just now

28:54.720 --> 28:57.120
and the word that came out of my mouth was Amazon.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.160
I had like a mini, I'm worried.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.440
Can one of you get down here?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.080
Can one of you get down here?

29:02.080 --> 29:03.680
You ain't done expired chicken.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.120
And look at you, your brain's shut now.

29:05.120 --> 29:05.760
Guys.

29:05.760 --> 29:06.560
Piece by piece.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.320
We need to get the magic school bus up in your face.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.040
We're wasting time.

29:11.040 --> 29:11.840
We need to get paid.

29:11.840 --> 29:12.320
We need to get paid.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.360
Let's go to the puppy pool.

29:16.160 --> 29:16.660
All right.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.760
Let's go to the family zone.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.720
I'm going to set it up.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.080
I mean, I'm keeping all that in the show.

29:22.080 --> 29:31.680
Let's go to Tremzalore.

29:31.680 --> 29:38.800
What's the first message for?

29:38.800 --> 29:43.520
This message is for Chris, who is apparently also known as the Phoenix.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.840
You can't just do that, Chris.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.400
You can't.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.480
Well, I mean, I don't think Chris wrote the message.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.920
In fact, it's from Nate, Brian, Chelsea, Jeremy, and Alicia.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.400
Or Alyssa.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.040
That's their gift.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.000
That's their gift to him.

29:54.000 --> 29:54.880
Like, finally.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.600
OK, fine.

29:56.160 --> 29:56.640
Fine.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.360
You're the Phoenix.

29:57.360 --> 29:57.520
Fine.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.320
What do you want to be?

29:58.320 --> 29:59.200
Space Hawk?

29:59.200 --> 29:59.520
Sure.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.000
Fuck it.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.400
Whatever.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.720
Can't believe we won't see your beautiful angst filled face at the office anymore.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.440
You're a super hardworking, smart, and amazing writer.

30:07.440 --> 30:10.320
Hilarious, spirited, and made the best coffee.

30:10.320 --> 30:14.880
Your absurd sense of humor and habit of openly napping at your desk will be missed.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.080
Damn you for leaving.

30:16.080 --> 30:16.960
Damn you.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.080
But best of luck out there.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.200
That's for Nate, Brian, Chelsea, Jamie, and Alicia.

30:21.200 --> 30:21.520
Jeremy.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.640
Jeremy, not Jamie.

30:22.640 --> 30:22.880
Jeremy.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.080
There is no Jamie.

30:24.080 --> 30:24.720
From Jamie.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.600
Maybe there's a Jamie at the office, but I don't want her getting credit for this.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.600
So best of luck, Chris, in all your future endeavors.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.480
For a second, I worried that Chris was dead, and that he had died,

30:34.480 --> 30:37.520
and they were writing this, and then I remembered he's the Phoenix.

30:38.160 --> 30:38.960
Oh, shit.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.920
That is impossible.

30:39.920 --> 30:40.720
Miss you, Phoenix.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.240
We'll see you, like, in a week.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.800
He's been reborn as a gas station attendant.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.760
Please don't touch the pile of ashes on Chris's desk.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.400
That's Chris.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.320
He's gestating.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.640
He's gestating right now. He's going to come back more beautiful than ever.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.240
You only live twice.

30:55.600 --> 31:00.960
My brother, my brother being supported by Squarespace, an all-in-one platform that

31:00.960 --> 31:04.880
makes it fast and easy to create your own professional website or online portfolio.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.960
You want to dedicate a website to Drake?

31:07.520 --> 31:11.440
Of course you do, but you can do that now through the magic of Squarespace.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.480
They're always improving.

31:12.480 --> 31:17.840
They got a support team available 24-7, and it's just eight bucks a month with a free domain if you

31:18.400 --> 31:19.600
sign up for a year.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.880
You can get a trial with no credit card required, and you can start

31:22.880 --> 31:24.960
building that Drake website right now.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.480
Just go build your website.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.200
You want to write Justin Drake slash fiction.

31:29.200 --> 31:33.760
You can make a Jake website, and that's the name of his weird torso.

31:34.480 --> 31:38.960
If you want to write Travis slash older, more distinguished Travis in the audience slash

31:38.960 --> 31:41.360
fiction, and then we can compare what we've written.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.600
Travis already has some literature on the subject.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.240
He would be happy to share.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.520
I've been published twice.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.020
Mm-hmm.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.680
I'm the only published slash fiction author.

31:51.680 --> 31:59.280
The great thing about this terrible website you're making is that it'll work on mobile,

31:59.280 --> 32:00.080
just like that.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.200
It'll match your style, and that's automatic, so don't worry about it.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.720
It will be terrible in content.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.960
It will design in the programming.

32:06.960 --> 32:07.920
It'll be terrific.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.520
Go to Squarespace.com, use the offer code MYBROTHER1.

32:11.520 --> 32:16.960
That's all one word, MYBROTHER, and then the number one to get 10% off your first purchase.

32:16.960 --> 32:21.440
Squarespace, everything you need to create an exception.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.160
I think it's an exceptional website.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.840
Okay, that got cut off.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.000
Everything you need to create an exception.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
I bet you there's no good Drake slash fiction websites.

32:32.560 --> 32:36.880
I have an exception to that rule, and it's my Squarespace site.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.280
I know everybody's tried Hulu.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.720
All right, that's old news.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.600
Everybody's got Hulu.

32:41.600 --> 32:45.440
I've got it at my contacts, streamed through Wi-Fi to my contacts I wear.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.320
You have Google Eyes.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.440
I have Google Eyes.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.760
I have googly eyes, and I'm going to upgrade that experience.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.960
You wear as Googles.

32:52.960 --> 32:53.920
I wear what?

32:54.800 --> 32:56.560
They're like goggles, but with Google in them.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.600
I'm going to upgrade that experience.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.320
Why did they call Google Glass Googles?

33:02.320 --> 33:03.920
We call them Googles.

33:03.920 --> 33:04.720
Googles.

33:05.760 --> 33:12.080
You've probably tried Hulu, but Hulu Plus is the better version of that, okay?

33:12.080 --> 33:14.240
You can watch your favorite shows anytime, anywhere.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.560
Smartphone, tablet, it doesn't matter.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.720
Whatever show you want to watch ever in the history of mankind, they're all on there,

33:20.720 --> 33:22.720
and that's legally binding because I just said it.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.560
I don't think, I don't think like...

33:25.120 --> 33:26.880
Well, agree to disagree.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.480
It's all the ones you'd ever want to watch.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.600
Travis, name literally any show you can think of.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.640
Jimmy Kimmel Live.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.520
Yes, on there.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.120
Shark Tank.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.080
On there.

33:36.080 --> 33:36.800
Scandal.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.200
On there.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.080
Do you see Griffin?

33:38.640 --> 33:42.240
Any show, and there is original stuff too.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.240
Travis, just like come up with a name for a show that isn't on TV that you would just

33:46.240 --> 33:47.040
like to see.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.560
The Wrong Man's.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.280
Yeah, it's on there.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.000
Hulu Plus.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.240
What, they made it just because I said it out loud?

33:52.240 --> 33:53.280
There's one on there.

33:53.280 --> 33:57.200
Anything your mind can conceive of, Hulu Plus will summon into existence.

33:57.200 --> 33:57.760
Can I try?

33:58.480 --> 33:58.640
Yeah.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.600
Law and Order SVU.

34:02.960 --> 34:03.920
Yeah, it's on there.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.120
It's like Law and Order.

34:05.120 --> 34:10.400
It just got retrofitted to all of like, we all remember SVU existing now because Hulu

34:10.400 --> 34:12.160
went back in time and made it.

34:12.160 --> 34:17.760
And this amazing technology can be yours for $8 a month, but you're not going to have to

34:17.760 --> 34:18.240
pay that.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.360
No, you're with us.

34:19.360 --> 34:25.040
HuluPlus.com slash my brother will get you an extended two week free trial.

34:25.040 --> 34:30.400
So head on over to HuluPlus.com slash my brother and they'll know we sent you and you can get

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
your two free weeks of Hulu Plus.

34:32.400 --> 34:37.920
Every referral we get, they give us one more episode of Law and Order SVU.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.000
It's like a referral bonus every time.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.120
And by the way, these are episodes that nobody else can watch.

34:43.120 --> 34:48.080
These are bespoke episodes of Law and Order SVU just for us.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.760
We can even, we can even specify what we want the crimes to be.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.080
It's mine crime.

34:55.200 --> 34:58.960
The one thing they won't do is make another season of Flavor of Love.

34:58.960 --> 35:03.120
I've tried so many times and it just isn't going to happen.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.120
It would destabilize the time stream.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.440
Well, they also have explained that they can't find a single woman that would

35:09.440 --> 35:11.600
agree to do that show on Earth.

35:11.600 --> 35:16.880
They've actually started sending probes out into the vast corners of the universe

35:16.880 --> 35:21.760
to try and find some sort of living being that would agree to be on Flavor of Love.

35:23.200 --> 35:29.040
By the way, just so you people know at home, you would expect, just statistically speaking,

35:29.040 --> 35:32.560
that eventually an advertiser would be mad at us for something we did.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.120
Hasn't happened.

35:33.120 --> 35:33.600
Nope.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.040
Has never happened.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.240
I don't know if they just shoot this money into space and like,

35:38.240 --> 35:39.440
well, best of luck, money.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.400
That or we are like fucking like madmen.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.320
We're like so fucking good at this.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.400
Listen, all right, listen, I'm going to fire this entire board of directors

35:48.400 --> 35:52.080
unless someone tells me why we never thought to offer every show in existence.

35:52.080 --> 35:57.680
And the nominees for Advertisement of the Year are the Coca-Cola Polar Bears.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.480
Always a classic.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.440
That one commercial water refrigerator, Perry, gets the Coca-Cola from kid

36:03.440 --> 36:07.840
kid before the big game and everything that my brother, my brother and me have ever done.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.360
The best act with Coca-Cola.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.360
Thank you for joining us for the Coca-Cola Awards.

36:18.000 --> 36:18.800
I'm Carrie Poppy.

36:18.800 --> 36:19.680
I'm Ross Blucher.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.720
And we make a show.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.920
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

36:21.920 --> 36:22.480
Oh no.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.480
We investigate fringe science.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.520
Spirituality.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.480
Religious groups.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.840
Alternative therapies.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.720
We put ourselves through a lot of uncomfortable situations.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.840
So that you don't have to.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.440
Because really, why would you?

36:33.440 --> 36:37.440
For example, I watched a tube be inserted into Ross's anus.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.920
That's true, but it sounds terrible out of context.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.880
We've tried penis and breast enlargement pills.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.360
We spent six months undercover becoming Mormons.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.040
We hung out with the 9-11 truthers.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.880
The UFO cult, the Raelians.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.760
And we're going to do more.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.560
It's one of the newest shows on MaximumFun.org.

36:52.560 --> 36:58.720
On my way to class the other day,

36:58.720 --> 37:01.120
I found a nice camelback water bottle lying on the ground.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.640
That sounds like an anecdote, but I promise there's a question.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.720
After looking around to make sure no one was looking,

37:08.720 --> 37:10.320
I swooped in and picked it up.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.400
Later that day, and before drinking from the bottle,

37:12.400 --> 37:14.240
I went to the store and bought a new mouthpiece

37:14.240 --> 37:15.360
and straw for the bottle.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.320
This is getting exciting.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.960
Despite this, my girlfriend says,

37:20.960 --> 37:22.640
still, it's disgusting to drink out of,

37:22.640 --> 37:23.920
and I should throw it away.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.680
A bottle like this would cost around $26.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.600
So I don't want to get rid of it.

37:31.920 --> 37:32.560
All right, sorry.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.280
I'll stop laughing, because there's a lot of math

37:35.280 --> 37:36.960
being bandied about on this question,

37:36.960 --> 37:40.000
and I want the audience to really consider all the variables.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.400
I don't want to get rid of it so quickly.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.040
What should I do?

37:43.760 --> 37:45.520
That's from Waterless in St. Louis.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.400
Let me throw this out.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.720
Oh, your camelback that you found on the ground.

37:50.720 --> 37:51.600
You want to throw that out.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.880
You want to throw that right in the garbage,

37:52.880 --> 37:54.320
because it's a liquid that somebody else

37:54.320 --> 37:55.520
had used with their mouth.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.200
If you've already drank out of it once,

37:58.160 --> 37:59.520
what's it matter now?

37:59.520 --> 38:00.160
Have they?

38:00.160 --> 38:01.680
In for a penny, in for a pound.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.160
Okay, yeah.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.600
He has already drank from the bottle.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.240
I think the problem is,

38:06.240 --> 38:08.000
is this bottle going to be a point of friction

38:08.000 --> 38:09.120
between you and your girlfriend?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.040
Because if that's so, hop in the old car,

38:11.040 --> 38:13.040
sit there for 15 minutes, get out of the car,

38:13.040 --> 38:15.680
come back like, yeah, switch that old bottle out.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.560
And then paste a picture of a different girl

38:18.560 --> 38:21.440
onto the camelback, and it's your new girlfriend now.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.280
This is my girlfriend camelback.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.480
She's very hydrated.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.000
That's what the movie Her was about.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.560
I feel like I can talk to you in a way

38:28.560 --> 38:29.920
I've never been able to talk to anybody else.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.840
Yeah, I'm dating my camelback.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.400
Yeah, that's not weird.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.440
Lots of people are doing that.

38:37.440 --> 38:49.120
I'm dating merman from email.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.600
I just wish you had a body so I could make love to you.

38:53.040 --> 38:58.480
Oh yeah, I'm touching your nozzles.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.000
At least the camelback has an orifice.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.200
That's true.

39:05.200 --> 39:09.680
That cyber lady in Her didn't have that.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.360
Have you guys read any of that Drake camelback slash fiction?

39:15.680 --> 39:20.000
I think that the fact that you bought a straw for it

39:20.000 --> 39:21.600
is a little crazy.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.200
Because I think that, is there a straw

39:25.200 --> 39:26.560
that's like an attachment for it?

39:26.560 --> 39:27.760
Or is this just like a straw?

39:27.760 --> 39:29.840
Do you know what a camelback is, Justin?

39:29.840 --> 39:32.000
Yeah, it's like a water bottle.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.200
Okay, camelback is like a bag that one like

39:35.200 --> 39:38.640
if you're bicycling or walking that you're not carrying

39:38.640 --> 39:40.480
it's attached to the thing and then there's a tube

39:40.480 --> 39:42.080
with a mouthpiece that goes in your mouth

39:42.080 --> 39:43.040
and you got a hole in your mouth.

39:43.040 --> 39:43.840
It's a backpack.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.200
It's a backpack.

39:45.200 --> 39:45.840
Wait a minute.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.480
Wait a minute.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.280
I have a question for you question asker

39:49.280 --> 39:51.120
that maybe you should confront yourself with.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.720
What are the set of circumstances

39:54.720 --> 39:57.280
that would cause a human being to say,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.600
Oh, well, I'm never drinking from this again

40:00.400 --> 40:01.680
and throw it on the ground.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.280
Now that is an accident.

40:03.280 --> 40:03.840
Here's what happened.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.680
The person was walking on the quad, right?

40:05.680 --> 40:08.640
And then they took, they were enjoying their beverage.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.640
Maybe they had some Sierra mist in there, right?

40:10.640 --> 40:12.320
Mixing it up and they take it out.

40:12.320 --> 40:16.000
And right when they take it out a hawk flying overhead shits

40:16.000 --> 40:19.040
and the shit falls directly into the tube

40:19.040 --> 40:20.880
goes directly into the camelback bag.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.040
Like he sees it go all the way deep down.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
And then he says, well, I guess this party's come to

40:28.000 --> 40:30.160
I guess we've reached the end of the road old friend.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.880
Oh, let me throw this out.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.640
The gentleman, he's walking across the quad.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.480
He's drinking it and he gets a text message

40:36.480 --> 40:38.240
from an unknown number and it says,

40:38.240 --> 40:39.600
you've been poisoned.

40:39.600 --> 40:39.920
Okay.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.640
Your camelback contains cyanide.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.160
You have 20 minutes to get the hustle.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.760
He rips off his backpack,

40:45.760 --> 40:47.840
rips off his camelback and just starts running.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.400
Five minutes later, along comes question asker.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.960
Like, Ooh, free camelback and die.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.480
You're saying that this person is probably already dead

40:54.480 --> 40:56.880
and we're giving advice to a ghost right now.

40:56.880 --> 40:57.040
Yep.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.640
Yep. I do wonder what the lag time has been

41:00.640 --> 41:02.400
between this person sending in this question

41:02.400 --> 41:04.400
us answering it because I like the image

41:04.400 --> 41:07.920
of a water bottle just sitting alone on a shelf.

41:07.920 --> 41:08.720
Like I'm going to get you.

41:08.720 --> 41:09.840
I'm going to figure this out.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.560
I'm going to crack this.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.760
What if we get an email like tomorrow?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.040
It's like, Hey guys, thanks for the help.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.320
Got trench mouth already though.

41:14.320 --> 41:18.080
So send it in two weeks ago.

41:18.080 --> 41:18.800
Could have used it then.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.680
Got this here trench mouth, but I guess.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.680
Here's another thing you need to learn

41:23.680 --> 41:24.720
about being in relationships.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.600
A lot of times you'll come into items by unscrupulous means

41:29.040 --> 41:31.200
and you've got to be better at covering your tracks.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.960
You shouldn't tell someone that you got it,

41:36.960 --> 41:39.440
that it's dirty and you got it from a dirty place.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.040
Your friend Steven gave it to you.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.240
Cause he didn't want it anymore.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.800
My friend Ricky, he's done with water.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.760
He's getting out of the water.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.440
That's why it says Ricky on the bag.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.200
You know, you've never met Ricky before,

41:51.200 --> 41:53.520
but we house sat for Ricky that one time.

41:53.520 --> 41:57.040
Remember, remember he had all that pizza you didn't like

41:57.040 --> 41:58.640
and you kind of made the yucky face.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.520
And Ricky was like, I got too many water bottles.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.680
I'm eventually going to unload some.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.080
You remember you commented on his water bottle room

42:07.280 --> 42:09.040
and there was a journal in the water bottle room.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.960
It was like, man, I can't wait to start throwing these away

42:10.960 --> 42:12.080
and handing them out to my friends.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.760
You remember, you remember, you remember it.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.640
You're just our friend, Ricky, the water bottle magnate.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.000
He's got the glass eyeball.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.040
He's got two glass, he's got two glass eyeballs,

42:25.040 --> 42:27.200
but he's always, he's never thirsty.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.120
You remember he's the moistest man.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.320
He's very damp.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.360
Ricky Nalgene, you know, come on.

42:35.360 --> 42:36.080
This is gross.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.840
I can't, I can eat.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.160
I could probably eat some food

42:42.800 --> 42:45.120
if I cut around the mouth marks, right?

42:45.840 --> 42:49.600
I think fluid is just like, it's so pervasive, you know?

42:49.600 --> 42:50.240
So wet.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.800
Well, no, like it, your shit gets in there

42:52.800 --> 42:56.080
and then it's just like, that, that CamelBak

42:56.080 --> 42:57.600
is like a fucking incubator at that point

42:57.600 --> 42:59.360
because it's just like a little closed off,

42:59.360 --> 43:00.960
water tight surface.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.640
It's like a fucking, it's like a Petri dish.

43:02.640 --> 43:03.440
It's kind of gross.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.800
Like you're not even supposed to reuse.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.640
But I feel like this is a Columbo moment

43:06.640 --> 43:08.240
where you've already said, like,

43:08.240 --> 43:10.400
if you didn't know it was gross,

43:10.400 --> 43:13.360
you wouldn't have bought a new mouthpiece and tube.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.880
Like you would admit that it's gross,

43:14.880 --> 43:17.440
but you think that you've hedged your bets on the grossness.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.600
It's kind of, it's living in a pretty cool city

43:19.600 --> 43:22.320
where you can buy just like attachments for water bottles.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.840
I don't know what story this is.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

43:26.160 --> 43:26.660
Please.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.080
Are you Ira Ray?

43:32.080 --> 43:33.120
Who wants to know?

43:33.120 --> 43:34.080
Thanks, Ira, it's by Yahoo.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.120
The American government.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.560
The American, is he like Edward Snowden?

43:39.600 --> 43:42.320
He's at least number two on the list.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.720
Oh, fuck, I'm so sorry that I evoked that.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.240
No, it's fine, let me help you with this question.

43:50.240 --> 43:53.120
Yahoo, please, I won't read the Yahoo if you don't.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.440
Please, go ahead, it's just me, Snowden.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.240
So that's by Yahoo Answers user Anna, who asks,

44:02.800 --> 44:04.800
can anyone find me an article

44:05.360 --> 44:08.000
about not smacking horses in the face?

44:10.400 --> 44:12.320
Can anyone find me an article

44:12.960 --> 44:14.960
about not smacking horses in the face?

44:14.960 --> 44:16.560
Can anyone find me an article about not smacking horses in the face?

44:16.560 --> 44:17.920
That's worded weirdly.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.200
My sister seems to think that smacking my horse in the face

44:21.200 --> 44:22.480
solves every problem,

44:22.480 --> 44:24.560
and even though I've told her a hundred times

44:24.560 --> 44:25.600
not to smack him in the face.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.720
Every problem?

44:26.720 --> 44:29.200
She says I'm being too soft and does it anyway.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.040
He's getting head shy.

44:34.320 --> 44:34.820
Sorry.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.000
Getting smacked in the head turns you head shy?

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Like, yeah, I guess it makes sense.

44:40.000 --> 44:40.500
Yeah.

44:40.800 --> 44:44.480
And I still can't convince her to just verbally tell him off.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.480
Or even smack him on the neck.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.840
Just not his face.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.720
Her and my horse are having problems deciding who is the boss.

44:51.680 --> 44:54.720
So do any of you know of an article that would say

44:54.720 --> 44:56.480
not to do that, I can send her.

44:57.040 --> 44:57.840
Additional details.

44:57.840 --> 45:01.440
My sister partially owns, quote unquote, my horse.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.920
So I can't tell her not to go near him.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.960
She is an excellent rider and is generally great with them,

45:06.960 --> 45:09.840
but her and this horse just don't get along very well.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.280
So far, all of your answers have been great.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.000
Thank you so much.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.400
Okay, there's a lot going on here.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.160
First of all, every problem?

45:17.360 --> 45:18.720
Damn this Obamacare.

45:18.720 --> 45:19.920
God damn it.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.000
I tried to use that website for a week and I can't do it.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.120
And I broke my arm and I can't.

45:23.120 --> 45:23.620
Come here.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.440
Son of a bitch.

45:26.240 --> 45:26.640
Sorry.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.480
I mean, this is for you.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.520
For to run better.

45:31.440 --> 45:34.400
Secondly, are there other circumstances in which you

45:34.400 --> 45:36.880
verbally tell off the horse and the horse goes, I know.

45:36.880 --> 45:37.680
You're right.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.040
Listen, I blew it.

45:39.040 --> 45:39.680
I fucking blew it.

45:39.680 --> 45:41.680
Listen, you're preaching the choir, okay?

45:41.680 --> 45:42.320
I know.

45:42.320 --> 45:45.920
I tried to cancer over those crossbars and I fucked it up, okay?

45:45.920 --> 45:46.640
You don't have to hit me.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.280
There's no pain you could give me that's worse than the guilt

45:49.280 --> 45:50.560
I'm feeling right now, Deborah.

45:50.560 --> 45:51.120
God damn it.

45:52.560 --> 45:55.280
I also don't think you're going to say that someone else

45:55.280 --> 45:57.520
partially owns your horse.

45:57.520 --> 46:02.000
I think that by definition makes it our horse.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.400
Or that makes it both of your horses.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.920
Look, it's God's horse.

46:06.720 --> 46:07.360
Yeah.

46:07.360 --> 46:12.000
You may be leasing this horse and subletting it to your sister,

46:12.000 --> 46:17.280
but make no mistake, it belongs to our Lord and Savior.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.880
What's the original question?

46:18.880 --> 46:19.520
What's the-

46:19.520 --> 46:22.960
Can anyone find me an article about not smacking horses in the face?

46:22.960 --> 46:29.280
I can find you a wicked lot of articles that are not about smacking horses in the face.

46:29.280 --> 46:35.280
I bet you can't find any articles about not smacking horses on the public internet.

46:35.280 --> 46:39.040
Yeah, that's right, Justin, an excellent point.

46:39.040 --> 46:39.440
You're saying-

46:39.440 --> 46:40.880
They're on the secret-

46:40.880 --> 46:42.960
Edward, you're saying that the NSA-

46:43.760 --> 46:44.240
Yes?

46:45.120 --> 46:47.680
Runs some sort of-

46:48.240 --> 46:50.000
Follow it to the end, shake it through.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.520
Runs some sort of-

46:54.400 --> 46:54.960
Add it up.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.080
All the trapeze is coming together.

47:00.080 --> 47:03.760
Some sort of website network that is-

47:03.760 --> 47:07.200
Think bigger, Benghazi.

47:07.200 --> 47:15.280
Benghazi is when two shooters were the grassing-

47:15.280 --> 47:17.840
The grassing all, actually, added up.

47:17.840 --> 47:24.640
And to the right, then hold on, I'm almost there.

47:24.640 --> 47:25.520
You're so close.

47:26.320 --> 47:32.240
The national treasure to Book of Secrets, Book of Secrets.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.720
It's the Book of Secrets.

47:34.720 --> 47:40.000
Then I think that all horses are Illuminati?

47:40.960 --> 47:42.000
Welcome to the-

47:45.520 --> 47:48.800
This is the first puzzle, I use it to test everyone.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.560
Can you find the article about not smacking horses?

47:52.560 --> 47:54.000
It's secret.

47:54.000 --> 47:54.720
Oh, man.

47:55.600 --> 47:56.640
Take it from me.

47:56.640 --> 48:00.640
Let me Google smacking horses plus-

48:00.640 --> 48:04.080
No, don't use regular Google, you must use Sheogol.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.200
Let me go into incognito mode.

48:05.200 --> 48:05.700
Sheogol.

48:06.720 --> 48:07.120
Sheogol.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.640
I'm in Sheogol.

48:08.640 --> 48:11.200
Secrets.google.hotspot.

48:11.200 --> 48:18.880
Secrets.google.hotspot.geocities, then let's search-

48:18.880 --> 48:20.160
.angelfire.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.720
.angelfire, a lot of redirects, but okay.

48:23.440 --> 48:25.360
Angelfire, and then search-

48:25.360 --> 48:26.560
.lycos.

48:26.560 --> 48:29.040
.lycos, at some point I'm gonna type Sheogol in here.

48:29.040 --> 48:34.320
.lycos, then I'll copy and paste all of that into AltaVista.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.200
Quote, horse smack, one word.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.600
Quote, WikiLeaks.

48:41.200 --> 48:46.720
You are going to be very surprised when the result is just a picture of Jimmy Hoffa's grave.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.440
Quote, stonemasons.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.520
Stonemasons, very good.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.520
All right, I think that should be good enough to-

48:55.520 --> 49:00.480
.Guys, my computer screen just went bright red.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.200
What does this mean?

49:01.920 --> 49:02.800
That is blood.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.760
You have found a secret.

49:05.760 --> 49:06.560
Did I just kill-

49:06.560 --> 49:07.840
Oh, I killed the whole internet.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.000
I can't look up this Yahoo answer anymore.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.320
That was the kill switch that I just turned-

49:12.320 --> 49:14.960
Okay, this has been a lot of fun.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.400
Don't smack a horse in the fucking face.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.440
What are you fucking-

49:17.440 --> 49:19.120
What are you fucking talking about?

49:20.240 --> 49:21.600
What are you fucking talk-

49:21.600 --> 49:24.960
Like, what are you talking about?

49:24.960 --> 49:26.720
We've considered everything about this question,

49:26.720 --> 49:29.520
except for the fact that we're talking about literally hitting a horse in the face.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.160
Our relationship-

49:30.160 --> 49:32.160
And not only that, but that she's talking to her sister,

49:32.160 --> 49:36.240
who apparently needs some written proof that that's a bad thing to do.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.360
Don't smack him in the face.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.080
Oh, prove it.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.200
Show me an article about it.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.440
No, how about I smack you in the face?

49:41.440 --> 49:42.400
Let's be honest.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.440
Our relationship with horses has always been tenuous.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.880
Our basic interaction with horses is,

49:48.880 --> 49:51.120
I don't want to run while I want you to run.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.160
Well, I don't want to.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.400
Well, I have sharp points on my shoes.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.600
So, I guess you're going to.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.040
Yeah, why don't you learn how to use metal,

49:57.040 --> 49:58.560
and then, like, come back and talk to me, I guess.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.360
I have, like, spikes on my heels.

50:01.360 --> 50:03.600
I have, like, spikes that I made out of metal that I got out of the ground,

50:03.600 --> 50:04.480
and then I smelted.

50:04.480 --> 50:05.920
Hey, do you know anything about smelting horse?

50:05.920 --> 50:08.000
Then why don't you shut your fucking huge mouth?

50:08.560 --> 50:10.000
Go eat some fucking oats.

50:11.040 --> 50:11.920
Dumb motherfucker.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.120
I invented computers.

50:13.920 --> 50:14.240
Yeah.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.520
Can you even use a computer?

50:16.080 --> 50:17.840
Do they even have Horse Google?

50:17.840 --> 50:20.640
I bet if I brought you a computer, you would just lick it.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.200
You would just probably lick it, or maybe step on it and break it.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.800
Great job, just bought that.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.640
The job that I have that you don't have,

50:26.640 --> 50:28.480
because you can't, like, make money.

50:28.480 --> 50:29.680
Probably don't even know what money works.

50:29.680 --> 50:35.600
Our being mean to horses is our right for working,

50:36.320 --> 50:37.760
because horses don't have jobs.

50:38.320 --> 50:42.160
So, their job is to get hit in the face by us to help us relieve our stress.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.720
That's just, I mean, that seems obvious to me.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.840
This bummed me out, this whole enterprise.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.480
Stop hitting horses, everybody.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.560
They're nature's most beautiful creature.

50:54.560 --> 50:54.960
Their nature's candy.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.200
You can wrestle them all you want, because that's fair.

50:57.200 --> 50:57.760
Yeah.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.120
Give me a question, Justin.

50:59.120 --> 51:02.240
I recently went out on a couple of dates with a lovely young lady.

51:02.960 --> 51:06.640
About the third time hanging out, I made a move and we did some kissing.

51:07.360 --> 51:12.640
Without telling too much, it was, sadly, among the worst kissing experiences I have had.

51:13.280 --> 51:16.880
We really enjoy hanging out together, and I anticipate more of the same.

51:16.880 --> 51:20.960
So what, if anything, can I do to make this situation better?

51:20.960 --> 51:24.240
That's from somewhat surprised in Somerville.

51:26.080 --> 51:26.880
Like, nothing.

51:26.880 --> 51:27.840
Like, basic.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.400
Here's the thing.

51:28.400 --> 51:32.960
You learn, you do get better at it, but to, you have a, I think everybody has a cap.

51:32.960 --> 51:35.760
And I think you hit that cap pretty fucking quick.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.320
Like, I think-

51:36.320 --> 51:38.160
Have you thought about filling out a comment card?

51:40.000 --> 51:42.400
Like, in an anonymous Dropbox, and you put it in, and you're like,

51:42.400 --> 51:43.520
oh, there's two cards.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.560
I wrote one.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.060
Shit.

51:45.760 --> 51:46.640
Use of tongue.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.360
Use of tongue.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.560
You give me a two out of 10.

51:49.200 --> 51:49.840
That's a two.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.120
That's pretty brutal.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.160
Lip moistness, six.

51:54.160 --> 51:54.960
So that's not bad.

51:55.760 --> 51:56.000
No.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.320
Nose placement, four.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.160
I got lip moistness, 10.

52:00.160 --> 52:04.480
And I don't know if that means that my lips are, like, too moist.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.720
They're, like, really super, super, super sloppy.

52:06.720 --> 52:10.240
There's a butter zone in which you put butter on your lips.

52:10.240 --> 52:10.480
Okay.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.680
It means you're a camelback bottle.

52:11.680 --> 52:19.920
So I think that your only way of addressing this is saying,

52:19.920 --> 52:20.800
no, wait a minute.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.200
I was gonna say something, but there's not.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.080
There's no way.

52:24.080 --> 52:25.360
There's nothing you could say.

52:25.360 --> 52:27.440
Hey, I really like you, Susan, but-

52:27.440 --> 52:31.360
Am I right in my assertion that you do get better at it?

52:31.360 --> 52:32.320
Like, you start with zero, okay?

52:32.320 --> 52:35.040
You're saying never been kissed fucking Drew Barrymore, okay?

52:36.560 --> 52:41.280
And then after you kiss, like, a few people, you're getting better at it.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.160
You have, like, one person you get especially randy with.

52:44.160 --> 52:49.200
And we're gonna get blue here, talking about red hot pecs.

52:50.640 --> 52:53.680
You reach a certain point where that's, like, that's as good as you get,

52:53.680 --> 52:54.640
and you hit it really quickly.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.480
I don't think it's, like, something that you just

52:56.480 --> 52:59.120
master over the course of your lifetime.

52:59.120 --> 53:03.120
I feel like by age, like, by age, like, 20, you're basically, like,

53:03.120 --> 53:05.120
that's just your style at that point.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.920
I mean, age is such a big thing in this question.

53:07.920 --> 53:10.160
If you're talking about, like, if you're 15, 16, like,

53:10.160 --> 53:11.360
well, yeah, that's fine.

53:12.320 --> 53:16.000
If this is, like, a 26, 27-year-old person

53:16.000 --> 53:19.520
and her kissing game is off, then, like, it's not gonna get better.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.200
Again, it may not be bad.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.560
They may not be bad at kissing.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.240
It could just be incompatible.

53:24.240 --> 53:24.800
Right, yeah.

53:25.760 --> 53:29.760
Yeah, there's certain levels of moisture that need to pair up.

53:29.760 --> 53:35.040
You can't have one person getting fully super sloppy double there

53:35.040 --> 53:36.960
and the other person just Sahara over there.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.960
Well, no, that is actually somewhere in the middle.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.800
That's actually what I prefer is to have, like,

53:40.800 --> 53:45.040
one person physical challenge and then the other person

53:45.040 --> 53:47.040
is a cat on a hot tin roof, you know?

53:47.680 --> 53:48.640
Yeah, absolutely.

53:50.080 --> 53:53.040
Is it possible it's a symptom?

53:53.040 --> 53:56.000
Because I imagine, like, if there was really, truly,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.680
like, a real connection, it would be amazing no matter what.

54:01.760 --> 54:03.280
Is that just too romantic?

54:03.280 --> 54:09.360
You can connect, like, on a deep spiritual and emotional level

54:09.360 --> 54:12.240
and then your kisses are just, like, two big mouth trains

54:12.240 --> 54:13.600
just, like, crashing into each other.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.720
That's where it should be, like, that back to the future moment

54:16.720 --> 54:18.800
of, like, I feel like kissing my brother

54:18.800 --> 54:20.560
and you're just, like, Hannah McCarty that says, like,

54:20.560 --> 54:23.920
we're friends forever now and we're only friends.

54:23.920 --> 54:28.080
It's really as tragic because maybe you just stop kissing, you know?

54:28.080 --> 54:30.320
Just like in her, you don't need to express yourself physically.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.160
You can phone fuck each other.

54:32.160 --> 54:35.600
I was going to say Death to Smoochie, but I didn't see that movie.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.280
I was going to say Pushing Daisies.

54:37.280 --> 54:37.780
Okay.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.960
All of those were pretty good except for Justin's example,

54:40.960 --> 54:43.760
which I don't really think was Jermaine except for the fact that I had Smoochie.

54:43.760 --> 54:45.280
I'm just basing it off the title.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.240
I haven't seen the film.

54:46.240 --> 54:46.740
Sure.

54:48.960 --> 54:49.840
Yeah, it's too bad, though.

54:50.880 --> 54:51.760
Really, it's a shame.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.120
This is the best we have?

54:53.120 --> 54:55.280
I mean, what can you fucking do?

54:55.280 --> 54:56.800
What, go to kiss school?

54:56.800 --> 54:58.400
Like, you can't fucking, like...

54:58.400 --> 55:02.160
Oh, bring in, like, a Jackson Galaxy-esque character.

55:02.160 --> 55:02.560
Yeah.

55:02.560 --> 55:03.040
Oh, God.

55:04.000 --> 55:04.640
Just fuck it.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.320
Just bring in Jackson Galaxy.

55:06.320 --> 55:07.120
Bring him.

55:07.120 --> 55:10.080
Let me kiss you on your weird, weird, weird, weird face.

55:10.800 --> 55:12.160
Bring that weird face over here.

55:12.160 --> 55:12.800
Come here.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.080
I'm going to kiss your beard.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.840
I'm going to kiss along the perimeter of your beard

55:15.840 --> 55:17.840
and it'll be like a little lips roller coaster.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.640
Whee!

55:18.640 --> 55:20.400
I love writing your face, Jackson.

55:21.040 --> 55:24.240
I think you're going to regret this when we start bringing on guests on the show

55:24.240 --> 55:29.360
because I feel like Jackson Galaxy is exactly in our, like,

55:29.360 --> 55:32.720
sphere of celebrity that we could conceivably get on the show.

55:32.720 --> 55:37.440
You're going to feel pretty bad about lambasting him this way.

55:37.440 --> 55:40.320
I think it's lambasting, although I would love to baste him in kisses.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.720
It's hard for me to watch that show without getting just rock hard.

55:46.160 --> 55:46.720
You know what I'm saying?

55:46.720 --> 55:47.920
Because it's got everything I need.

55:47.920 --> 55:51.040
It's got, like, a weird dude who looks like the bassist from Anthrax,

55:51.040 --> 55:53.680
uh, but also people being stern to cats.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.400
That gets my noodle going.

55:58.800 --> 56:00.080
Meow, indeed.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.120
My boner from hell.

56:05.280 --> 56:08.160
I like that we've just accepted that people on this show

56:08.160 --> 56:12.880
know that by name the host of an Animal Planet series

56:12.880 --> 56:15.680
about making your cat not be such an asshole.

56:15.680 --> 56:18.480
Oh, you know, Jackson Galaxy, the person on the show.

56:18.480 --> 56:20.400
Pretty soon we'll get to just calling him Jackson

56:20.400 --> 56:21.680
and everyone will know what we mean.

56:22.480 --> 56:23.040
Jackie.

56:23.040 --> 56:23.540
Jacob.

56:24.640 --> 56:25.200
Jacob.

56:27.280 --> 56:29.680
Do, uh, do another question, please.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.760
I share a name with a well-known actor.

56:33.760 --> 56:36.080
He's great, so it's not shameful at all,

56:36.080 --> 56:40.240
but when I meet new people, they get so excited pointing out the name connection.

56:41.520 --> 56:45.920
This includes when waiters or phone customer support people find out my name.

56:45.920 --> 56:50.720
Deep, depending on my mood, I'll joke around and riff off some of the movie references,

56:50.720 --> 56:52.960
but sometimes I'm exhausted by the topic.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.640
Uh, if in my place, how would you either quickly riff

56:57.440 --> 57:01.600
or move the conversation past the topic that I deal with on a near daily basis?

57:01.600 --> 57:02.400
And that is from Daniel Craig.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.840
And that's from Judge Reinhold.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.880
Um, God, Daniel Craig doesn't really give you a lot of, a lot of runway.

57:12.880 --> 57:13.920
You know what I mean?

57:13.920 --> 57:14.880
Not a lot of riff.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.880
If it was, if it was Judge Reinhold, then fuck.

57:16.880 --> 57:18.480
That's a deep, deep, deep, deep vein.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.000
Talking to him in the baby goose.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.160
You got, uh, the police, police academy goose.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.560
Daniel Craig, you got Bond.

57:24.560 --> 57:25.440
You got, what was he in?

57:25.440 --> 57:26.160
Trainspotting?

57:26.160 --> 57:26.800
Was he in that?

57:27.360 --> 57:27.840
No.

57:27.840 --> 57:28.480
Pound cake.

57:28.480 --> 57:28.960
Layer.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.120
He was in, he was in the cake movie.

57:31.120 --> 57:31.680
Cake boss.

57:33.360 --> 57:37.200
I think you need one pat response that just shuts the whole thing down.

57:38.240 --> 57:40.480
Uh, just say no relation.

57:40.480 --> 57:44.400
No relation, maybe, or, or maybe just like something cute.

57:44.400 --> 57:46.480
It's like, keep it down.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.920
I'm trying not to get recognized.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.600
Or like, I'm undercover.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.320
Are these people like my accents?

57:52.320 --> 57:52.560
Right.

57:52.560 --> 57:52.960
That's the thing.

57:52.960 --> 57:55.440
Like what if you're just, if you call the phone company, like,

57:55.440 --> 57:56.000
Hey, what's up?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.120
My name's Daniel Craig.

57:57.120 --> 57:58.560
I'm calling about my phone service.

57:58.560 --> 57:59.840
They're like, the Daniel Craig?

57:59.840 --> 58:01.920
Like fucking listen to me.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.080
Do you think that this is what Daniel Craig sounds like?

58:05.440 --> 58:06.880
Hi, this is Daniel Craig.

58:06.880 --> 58:09.680
I'm just calling like, do you Daniel Craig?

58:09.680 --> 58:10.960
Like, yes, obviously.

58:10.960 --> 58:15.360
I don't think he's experiencing confusion between thinking that Daniel

58:15.360 --> 58:18.480
Craig is calling PF Chang's and putting in an order.

58:18.480 --> 58:19.600
I don't think that's the problem.

58:19.600 --> 58:23.280
I think it's just like the conversation that he's being forced into like,

58:23.280 --> 58:24.480
Oh, like James Bond.

58:24.480 --> 58:25.040
Yes.

58:25.040 --> 58:25.680
Like James Bond.

58:25.680 --> 58:26.560
Yeah, James fucking Bond.

58:26.560 --> 58:29.280
What if you, what if you pretend like you lived in a one man alternate

58:29.280 --> 58:31.840
universe in which the other Daniel Craig did not exist.

58:32.560 --> 58:35.280
So when people were like, Oh, just like Daniel Craig, James Bond.

58:35.280 --> 58:36.160
I'm like, I'm sorry.

58:36.160 --> 58:36.480
What?

58:36.480 --> 58:36.800
What?

58:36.800 --> 58:38.080
I don't know that person.

58:38.080 --> 58:40.080
Is that, no, you're not Daniel Craig for the movies.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.160
Do you mean I haven't been in any movies?

58:42.160 --> 58:43.680
Do you mean Pierce Brosnan?

58:45.680 --> 58:46.240
Let me hit you.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.360
Do you mean Woody Allen?

58:48.080 --> 58:48.720
Let me hit you.

58:49.440 --> 58:50.720
Let me hit you with this.

58:50.720 --> 58:54.960
What if you live the rest of your life as Danny Craig?

58:56.320 --> 58:58.080
No, no, Justin.

58:58.080 --> 59:00.000
I'm not going to let Daniel Craig do that.

59:00.000 --> 59:00.720
Danny Craig.

59:01.360 --> 59:03.600
He's going to bow to other Daniel Craig.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.600
Like he, he gets the title.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.400
You can, you send Daniel Craig a sternly worded letter saying, listen,

59:08.400 --> 59:09.920
you handsome motherfucker.

59:09.920 --> 59:11.360
I don't know if you've seen his abs.

59:11.360 --> 59:13.760
He gets whatever title he wants.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.280
You're Dan-O from now on.

59:15.280 --> 59:15.840
Dan-O Craig.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.720
Dan-O Craig.

59:17.520 --> 59:23.040
Your best bet is that Daniel Craig keeps doing great movies and he gets knighted.

59:23.600 --> 59:24.960
And then he's Sir Daniel Craig.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.680
And then I feel like the confusion will be alleviated.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.160
Or then you can take Sir Daniel Craig.

59:30.160 --> 59:31.200
You just add it to yourself.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.680
Hi, I'm Sir Daniel Craig.

59:33.680 --> 59:35.440
I would like the General Tso's chicken.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.200
Hello, I'm Sir Daniel Craig.

59:39.200 --> 59:43.200
My HBO has been a little bit fuzzy lately and I feel like the connection's really weak.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.480
Oh, this sucks.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.080
Just call yourself Judge Reinhold.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.120
Nobody knows who that is.

59:47.120 --> 59:49.040
So like, they will confuse you.

59:49.040 --> 59:50.240
Judge, that's a weird first name.

59:50.240 --> 59:51.040
Anyway, what'd you want?

59:53.360 --> 59:53.840
Judge?

59:53.840 --> 59:54.800
Nobody's called Judge.

59:55.360 --> 59:58.480
Anyway, we're having a half off special on the Szechuan.

59:59.120 --> 59:59.520
You in?

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.640
You in, coward?

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.040
Come on.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.840
Come on, pussy.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.040
You worried it'd be too spicy?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.000
What's wrong?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Oh, you're worried we're gonna give you too much chicken?

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:10.960
God.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.200
We're gonna be too flavorful that it's gonna be too great a value?

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.120
Just give me your order, asshole.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.080
Are you worried you won't be able to fit the chicken into your baby's mouth?

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.280
Because you have a baby mouth?

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.600
Why is this P.F. Chang so hostile?

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.240
It's actually P.F. Chang's Last Resort is what it is.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.640
It's the new, they're prototyping it.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.160
It's basically a P.F. Chang's, but everyone's just like, really shitty to you.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.960
And then Judge Reinhold actually calls there one day.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.800
Like, what kind of fucking name is Judge?

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.920
He was like, I was in Two and a Half Babies.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.680
What was that, what was it we called?

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.480
Thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.920
We hope you've enjoyed yourselves.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.200
Before you complain about this episode, get a little off topic from time to time.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.160
Please remember that this is a holiday.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.560
And that's it?

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.320
And we were good enough to record an episode for you.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.080
Even with all of our big Martin Luther King Jr. plans, we were able to fit in an episode.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.800
We squeaked in an episode, so we hope you enjoyed it.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:19.200
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:26.240
Like David Fador, Tanner, Negari, Harley, Craig Lynn, Jared,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.120

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.800
You're all the best, and we really appreciate it.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.640
If you want to tweet about our show, try to remember to include a link to our sampler,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.400
bit.ly forward slash mabim bam 2013, or to our iTunes page would be fine.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.560
And tell a friend about the show this week.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.000
We would really appreciate it.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.440
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.760
It's a Departure, on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.800
Had somebody tweeted us this week that they wanted us to put the days to bed?

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.880
Had somebody tweeted us this week that they went to a Long Winters show,

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.640
and they played It's a Departure?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.680
And the person, I guess, never paid attention to whenever we said the thing I just said,

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.720
and like freaked the fuck out.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.000
They're like, holy shit, I didn't know that was you guys, which is-

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.440
They never make it to the end of an episode.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.880
I guess, I guess they hear, we want to thank you, and they're like, nope.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.960
Not thanking me, I'm out.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.440

You sound kind of Tom Waits-y.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.080
Have you been eating beer bottles again?

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.760
