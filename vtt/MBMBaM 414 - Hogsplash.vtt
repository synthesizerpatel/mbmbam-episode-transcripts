00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.680
Hello, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.240
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.240 --> 00:57.520
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. So today is the 5th of July when we're recording

00:57.520 --> 01:05.200
this, and the question on everybody's mind is, what is- it's a 5th of July tradition.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.640
What is the most beautiful firework that you saw yesterday?

01:08.640 --> 01:12.720
I love sitting around a circle with you boys and talking about all the great fireworks we saw,

01:12.720 --> 01:16.400
talking about our favorite ones. It's a favorite family tradition of mine, too.

01:16.400 --> 01:21.520
Yeah, every year. Every year. And honestly, probably the audience is sick of hearing about it,

01:21.520 --> 01:25.840
because every 5th of July episode for the last eight years, we've done this.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.120
Yeah, so I got my list, my list, like I do every year. I got it in my Excel spreadsheet,

01:31.120 --> 01:38.960
and I saw 10 sparkly white ones, I saw three big blue ones, I saw- they didn't have any purple

01:38.960 --> 01:42.480
ones this year, because I guess they have to mix the blue and the red powder, and it's kind of

01:42.480 --> 01:49.280
wasteful, but I did see- did I just say the red ones? I saw like 14 red ones, and yeah,

01:49.280 --> 01:54.560
it was a good show. They had like a whole red period going, and then they did one

01:54.560 --> 02:00.160
Spongebob one. Whoa. Yeah, they did eight. Griffin, did you see any of those where it

02:00.160 --> 02:04.960
kind of spreads out and you think, oh, that's done, but then little fireworks fire off from

02:04.960 --> 02:09.120
the ends of the one that just spread out, and it's like two fireworks in one?

02:09.120 --> 02:14.720
The double. The double, I saw only one of those, because again, times are pretty tight,

02:14.720 --> 02:18.400
but then of course at the very end of the show, I have here in my notes, it says they really just

02:18.400 --> 02:22.080
busted in a nut up there, and just really went wild. I tried to count them all, I was like,

02:22.080 --> 02:26.160
there's a red, there's a white sparkle, there's a blue, ah damn! And then, you know,

02:26.160 --> 02:28.320
my pastor got upset because I cussed right in front of him.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.920
How many did you guys see yesterday? Mine is eight.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.920
Fireworks.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.920
How many fireworks did you see? I don't want it to be a kind of a braggy thing,

02:39.920 --> 02:41.920
but I saw eight fireworks yesterday.

02:42.560 --> 02:49.280
Well, you know, here's the weird thing, Justin. I only saw one, but it was the most sustained

02:49.280 --> 02:52.880
firework I had ever seen. It was one firework that lasted for an hour.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.400
Whoa.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.440
Yeah, and you would think like, oh, a firework that just kept exploding for an hour,

02:59.440 --> 03:04.560
but actually it was like, it exploded, and then the image kind of walked around,

03:04.560 --> 03:06.960
and like, talked to people, and just kind of-

03:06.960 --> 03:07.840
Did it head talk?

03:07.840 --> 03:15.120
Yeah, it was, I honestly don't know how they did it, but it was just like an hour of sustain-

03:15.120 --> 03:19.600
And it had like, personality, and could like, answer questions, and like-

03:19.600 --> 03:24.880
So it sent questions from the audience, because a lot of fireworks are too fucking stuck up.

03:24.880 --> 03:29.040
No, this is really a firework of the people, and like, by the end of it-

03:29.040 --> 03:30.080
The people's firework.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.840
Yeah, we were like, oh, okay, that's a firework I could have a beer with. You know what I mean?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.320
It was great.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.080
I had a similar one with the Sponge Wobble, and I saw, where I saw it from the front,

03:40.080 --> 03:46.240
and it was him, you know, waving high, but apparently, I heard some reports from folks

03:46.240 --> 03:51.760
in the neighboring neighborhood, that when you looked at that firework from the back side,

03:51.760 --> 03:53.920
his butt was hanging out as a prank, I guess?

03:54.640 --> 03:55.600
Oh, okay.

03:55.600 --> 04:01.600
Yeah, so the fireworks people got sued by the city for $100, and I'm worried about them.

04:02.160 --> 04:06.800
But yeah, Juice, I'm glad you asked. I saw about 32 fireworks at the show,

04:06.800 --> 04:13.280
and then I still wanted more fireworks, and so I came home, and I sat down in my thinking chair,

04:13.280 --> 04:18.800
just sort of my imagination station, and I closed my eyes and pushed up on my eyeballs.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.920
You know how you can do that? You push up on your eyeballs,

04:21.920 --> 04:27.600
and then I made like more fireworks, like what I saw there in the darkness.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.680
You ever do that? It's fun, and you can make pretend that it's-

04:31.680 --> 04:35.840
I did that one time too hard and pushed my eyeball back into my brain for a little bit.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's where all the best fireworks are.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.240
But don't do it at home, we should say pretty clearly, don't do it.

04:42.240 --> 04:42.800
Kids.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.560
You can make pretend that there's a little fireworks guy in there shooting off his own stuff.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.680
Did I tell you guys about my favorite fireworks I saw last year?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.360
What was your favorite one last year?

04:51.360 --> 04:54.160
It was a big Calvin, and he was peeing,

04:54.160 --> 04:58.960
and they had positioned it so he was right above a Ford truck dealership.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.240
Oh, that's awesome.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.960
And it was great because it looked like he was peeing on the Ford truck dealership,

05:02.960 --> 05:06.080
and his piss set it on fire, and the whole thing burned down.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.360
Oh, badass.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.280
Yeah, it was amazing, dude.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.040
But it was heavily insured, so like-

05:11.600 --> 05:15.040
In fact, I think they might have even done it themselves.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.760
It might have been arson, now that I'm thinking about it.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.760
It might have been firework-related arson.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.000
I need to go talk to some people.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.960
Can I ask a question?

05:24.960 --> 05:25.680
Uh-huh.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.040
Why does Bill Watterson hate the Ford brand as much as he does?

05:29.040 --> 05:31.520
Well, it did him wrong, done him dirty.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.400
He bought it back.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.360
He's a Chevy man.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.000
I guess so.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.120
But he didn't used to be.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.320
He used to be a Ford man.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.080
He bought a Ford truck, and he got it home,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.680
and he looked in the back, and it was full of snakes.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.120
People always say Bill Watterson's in hiding,

05:43.120 --> 05:47.280
but for me, it's like, if I was making as much fucking coin

05:47.280 --> 05:50.240
as this dude must be of Calvin peeing stickers-

05:50.240 --> 05:50.720
Living it.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.280
Yeah, I wouldn't be working either.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.520
I'd be cashing the checks and thinking of like,

05:56.160 --> 05:59.120
call my assistant, like, I got a new one.

06:00.160 --> 06:00.960
Think about this.

06:01.760 --> 06:02.240
Sure.

06:02.240 --> 06:02.640
You ready?

06:04.160 --> 06:04.800
Instagram.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.240
It's just Instagram with Calvin peeing on it.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.880
He's like, anyway, talk to you in the next quarter.

06:10.880 --> 06:11.920
Here's the thing, Justin.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.240
Everyone thinks that Bill Watterson is just like a recluse

06:14.240 --> 06:17.120
and in hiding, but actually, it's just that his Ford truck

06:17.120 --> 06:19.600
is so unreliable, he can't drive it into town.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.040
And he's like, fuck, I wish I could go cash these checks.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.000
I can't get to the bank because my Ford truck won't start.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.040
Fuck this truck.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.320
Bill Watterson today, tragically found buried in checks.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.560
There's so many.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.400
Because it's unreliable.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.480
If only I could get into town.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.840
God, I need to express my hatred of Ford in some way.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.680
He can't even buy a new car.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.600
Can't deposit?

06:45.600 --> 06:45.840
Yeah.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.040
Yeah, his Ford truck won't start, so he can't get to the place

06:51.040 --> 06:52.480
where you buy a new one.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.520
So the only way he can communicate the displeasure he has

06:57.520 --> 07:01.520
about the car that he's been saddled with is by making more

07:01.520 --> 07:02.720
of these hilarious stickers.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.360
And you know what?

07:03.360 --> 07:06.800
Every day he's just on his knees praying that someone will come

07:06.800 --> 07:08.960
and pick him up and take him to the bank so he can deposit.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.760
He just gets down in front of the cross and he prays that he

07:11.760 --> 07:16.560
can go deposit his checks so he can buy a Chevy or a Dodge.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.520
I know what you're thinking.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.600
Can't he just write a note that says, please come rescue me?

07:21.600 --> 07:25.120
The answer is his publisher only wants Calvin stickers.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.280
So that's the only way he can communicate.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.440
There was one time where he tried to draw like Calvin peeing

07:31.440 --> 07:33.760
on a note that said, please come rescue me.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.840
But the publisher saw right through that.

07:35.840 --> 07:36.400
Yeah.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.680
Do you hear the story about how Charles Schultz who loves

07:39.680 --> 07:44.080
Coca-Cola so much did one of Charlie Brown taking a dump

07:44.080 --> 07:48.320
on the Pepsi logo and then he took a really hard look at it

07:48.320 --> 07:50.640
and he was like, I can't let anybody know about this.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.320
He threw it in the garbage, but I found it.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.400
So if you're wondering why Griffin has a signed

07:56.400 --> 07:59.920
plaque of the Smithsonian thanking him for his generosity.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.320
Gosh.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.120
And it's right next to that Charles Schultz piece.

08:03.120 --> 08:07.280
I just gotta, I begs the question, is there a brand

08:07.280 --> 08:12.720
you two boys hate so much that you want to put a sticker

08:12.720 --> 08:15.600
of a child using the bathroom on your car?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.040
Because I got some brands I'm not a big fan of

08:21.040 --> 08:25.280
and I'm hard pressed to think of one.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.640
I think it'd be really fun.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.080
And I don't know one off the top of my head,

08:28.080 --> 08:32.880
but to find like a brand of like toilets and use that brand

08:32.880 --> 08:35.120
because then it's like, well, does he hate it

08:35.120 --> 08:36.480
or is he endorsing it?

08:37.520 --> 08:40.720
That's fucked up if it's just him using a toilet

08:40.720 --> 08:41.600
on your truck, right?

08:41.600 --> 08:42.240
That's no good.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.280
Yeah, that would be messed up if the brand that you chose

08:47.280 --> 08:50.960
was American Standard because then it's Calvin peeing

08:50.960 --> 08:52.480
or you're going to erase some eyebrows,

08:52.480 --> 08:54.720
I think with this bad boy, because you're going to get

08:54.720 --> 08:57.440
Calvin peeing on the words American Standard.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.840
And I think a lot of people are going to have some issues

08:59.840 --> 09:02.080
with that they like to discuss with you in private.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.400
At this point, is that logo so recognizable

09:04.400 --> 09:07.360
that you could have Calvin peeing on Calvin peeing

09:07.360 --> 09:10.720
on Calvin peeing and like just kind of a circle

09:10.720 --> 09:13.040
of them peeing on each other and then you're like, wait,

09:13.040 --> 09:16.400
does he hate the brand of Calvin peeing?

09:16.400 --> 09:18.960
It's about the futility of anger.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.520
It's about the futility of like vindictiveness

09:21.520 --> 09:23.360
because we're all peeing on somebody

09:23.360 --> 09:25.600
and we're all getting peed on by somebody.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.960
So that's great, Trav.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.520
Yeah, it's pee all the way down if you think about it.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.200
Sure, it's all piss.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.040
It's all piss.

09:33.040 --> 09:38.400
I don't want to, I mean, the only company,

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
I don't think I'm mad enough at any company.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.680
AOL I was very mad at, but that's just a husk, right?

09:43.680 --> 09:46.160
That's not anything to get worked up about anymore.

09:46.160 --> 09:50.240
I would do Bush's beans because it's like, tell us already.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.200
Griffin, that dog just died this week.

09:53.200 --> 09:53.600
What?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.040
I didn't want to use the podcast.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.040
Are you fucking kidding me?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.120
I didn't want to tell you this on the podcast,

10:01.120 --> 10:03.680
but the Bush baked bean dog died this week.

10:03.680 --> 10:04.880
That stinks.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.600
That's not a good energy to bring to the show, Justin.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.240
But you know what?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.840
I think the thing he would want most

10:09.840 --> 10:11.520
is for people to keep talking about him.

10:11.520 --> 10:11.760
You're right.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.920
You're helping to keep his legacy going.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.440
Let's celebrate his life here and get to our first question.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.800
Do you think, like, right before,

10:20.160 --> 10:24.560
like, as his soul was going into its great eternal ward,

10:24.560 --> 10:27.040
he was just like, a bit of mayonnaise.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.240
He just, like, slipped away.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.560
He yelled it back across the rainbow bridge

10:33.200 --> 10:36.000
and flipped a bird to the mean Bush's man.

10:36.000 --> 10:36.960
God, I hate that guy.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.800
Can we do a question, though,

10:38.800 --> 10:40.480
instead of talking about a dog that passed away?

10:40.480 --> 10:43.440
I do want to talk about the Bush's baked bean man, though.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.200
I will say this, and then I'm going to let him off the hook.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.600
If you watch these commercials lately,

10:49.600 --> 10:56.720
this dude has gone through a transformation in recent years.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.360
And I just saw an ad, and I barely recognized this cat.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.160
You guys know what the Bush's baked beans man looks like, correct?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.160
We're all agreed on this.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.800
Okay, I'm going to send you his new look.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.760
And if you're at home, just, like, Google image Bush's baked bean man

11:11.760 --> 11:13.840
and you're going to find this pic.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.920
This is what this cat looks like now.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.440
We've got shaved head, full salt and pepper beard.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.480
He looks awesome.

11:20.480 --> 11:20.980
He does.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.960
Cool jeans.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.240
He looks radical.

11:24.240 --> 11:29.600
And I think that he, like, got so tired of the only people talk about

11:29.600 --> 11:31.040
is, like, asking about beans.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.520
He just want to get his look extremely on point.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.480
He looks fucking great.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.680
He's got that good bean living right there.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.640
He's got a beard that I think even Travis would be like, nice beard.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.320
That's a great beard.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.880
Is this a beard that I want to see eat baked beans all the time?

11:44.880 --> 11:45.440
Not really.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.880
No, that's the opposite.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.640
He's not getting high in his own supply.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.600
Justin, are you kidding me?

11:50.800 --> 11:51.520
Fucking kidding me?

11:51.520 --> 11:54.400
You think he just sits in his office tearing into his own beans?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.480
Getting jacked on beans again?

11:56.480 --> 11:59.360
No, he's got to get the product out there.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.120
I'm just saying he used to dress like, uh, uh, he, like,

12:03.120 --> 12:04.480
The real fire fucking dweeb.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.800
I wanted to pay him some every time he came on TV.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.520
Yeah, like a dweeb.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.920
He looks dope as hell.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.960
That's all I wanted to say.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.680
We spent a long time now talking about a dog who passed away

12:13.680 --> 12:17.760
and then a picture of an attractive man who used to look like a real dinkus.

12:17.760 --> 12:22.080
So is there any other sort of radio poison that we want to do

12:22.080 --> 12:23.920
instead of the shower?

12:23.920 --> 12:24.400
I understand.

12:24.400 --> 12:24.960
Do a question.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.560
Yeah, that's fine.

12:27.440 --> 12:27.920
He looks good.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.400
He looks good.

12:28.400 --> 12:28.960
I don't regret it.

12:28.960 --> 12:29.280
He looks good.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.960
Oh, you're going to bring it back up again?

12:30.960 --> 12:34.160
Yeah, it feels a little bit like they're trying to give Bush's baked beans

12:34.160 --> 12:36.800
sort of a hipster handmade feel.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.280
But this may just be this dude's style.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.080
I don't know.

12:40.080 --> 12:40.560
I don't know.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.720
Get at me if you're a listener.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.840
Bush's baked beans, man.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.880
I want to look cool with the people waiting online

12:46.880 --> 12:48.560
while I'm riding on a roller coaster.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.720
Any tips for how to seem cool or not scared after I get on the ride?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.920
That's pretty.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.720
That's from Zach.

12:57.680 --> 13:03.520
I think that if you can talk about as the ride is pulling out of the station

13:03.520 --> 13:06.800
about how your dad built the ride

13:06.800 --> 13:09.440
and so you know all the twists and turns that are coming up

13:09.440 --> 13:12.480
and the ride's twists and turns and corkscrews and spins

13:12.480 --> 13:14.000
are just second nature to you.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.200
I grew up on this ride.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.040
This ride, you know, molded me from the clay

13:19.040 --> 13:20.320
and I won't be scared by it.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.680
If I scream, it'll be because I just want everybody else to get hyped up.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.600
Because I love my dad so much.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.640
Because I love my dad very much

13:26.640 --> 13:28.400
and I want people to know how much I love his work.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.000
My handprints are in the base of the column

13:32.000 --> 13:35.200
on the world's tallest loop that I'm not scared of.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.080
Not scared of it.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.160
Maybe like when the attendant comes by to like do the lap bar and belt

13:40.160 --> 13:41.600
you just say, no thank you.

13:42.400 --> 13:42.960
No.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.640
And really like double down on that.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.800
They will make you.

13:46.800 --> 13:50.720
And then when they try to make you say, what, what?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.280
And like make a big sink and then get off the ride and leave

13:53.280 --> 13:55.840
and like I have never had to deal with this.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.840
Yeah, they always let me ride without being scared.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.960
Wow that guy is so cool and unafraid

14:02.960 --> 14:04.640
he didn't even need the lap bar

14:04.640 --> 14:07.200
and then when they tried to make him he was so opposed to safety.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.920
He left something like this maybe

14:09.920 --> 14:14.000
but you put your three-year-old son on your lap

14:14.000 --> 14:16.080
and you say like, he's a lap kid whatever.

14:16.080 --> 14:16.880
We don't even know.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.920
This is for children.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.960
This is a baby ride.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.120
My son, I love my beautiful son

14:21.120 --> 14:22.960
and that's how unafraid I am of this ride.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.480
This is a baby coaster.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.400
This is a baby coaster for kids.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.280
Could you, as you're pulling out, pull out

14:29.280 --> 14:32.560
and you can do this no matter like what your like situation is

14:32.560 --> 14:36.240
riding solo, going with a duo, a squad, whatever.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.440
Pull out an engagement ring in a little box

14:39.440 --> 14:41.120
and then right as the ride starts moving

14:41.120 --> 14:44.720
kind of lose your balance and kind of fumble with it

14:44.720 --> 14:47.120
and throw it back into the crowd as it pulls away

14:47.120 --> 14:50.880
and be like no and that's not gonna make you seem brave or cool

14:50.880 --> 14:52.640
but it is gonna distract them so much

14:52.640 --> 14:53.840
that they're not really gonna be thinking

14:53.840 --> 14:55.200
about how brave and cool you are.

14:56.320 --> 15:01.680
What about if you, as the ride is pulling out

15:01.680 --> 15:06.720
you whip a crossword puzzle out of your back pocket

15:06.720 --> 15:08.320
and then you put on sunglasses

15:08.960 --> 15:14.560
and then from a speaker that you have built into your heart

15:16.000 --> 15:17.680
two millionaires riding dirty.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.800
Oh that's good.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.000
And it's kind of a combo.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.080
It's a look, I mean it's an aesthetic.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.760
Light a cigarette for the ride.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.920
When the ride's about to start you pull out your laptop

15:27.920 --> 15:30.080
and you ask the attendant what the Wi-Fi password is

15:30.080 --> 15:31.760
because you need to work on your screenplay.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.920
Yeah that's very good.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.400
Pull a big hot bag of spaghetti from your jacket

15:37.280 --> 15:40.640
and dump it into a plate that you have in your back

15:41.280 --> 15:45.120
just on your back taped there like a gun and die hard

15:45.120 --> 15:47.520
and you pull that out and you drop the spaghetti

15:47.520 --> 15:49.120
and you look in the crowd with your cigarette

15:49.120 --> 15:50.560
and your sunglasses and your crossword puzzle

15:50.560 --> 15:53.920
and you say anybody got a fork as it pulls off.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.560
Yeah pretty good.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.280
I do like that.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.160
Maybe pull out like a pillow and a blankie

16:00.160 --> 16:02.560
and just like stretch out in the seat for a nap

16:02.560 --> 16:06.080
and you're like ah this is where I feel most safe.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.200
Just have a soldering iron and that you're warming up

16:09.200 --> 16:11.680
and it's like I just have some light soldering to do

16:11.680 --> 16:13.440
so I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone

16:13.440 --> 16:16.080
because that's how unafraid I am of this ride.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.640
Pull out a clipboard and like a pen

16:18.640 --> 16:20.960
and on the clipboard at the top of the piece of paper

16:20.960 --> 16:25.360
you have like printed out like a roller coaster checklist

16:25.360 --> 16:28.400
and you're just like let's see let's see how this does

16:28.400 --> 16:29.760
and everyone's like oh he must be

16:29.760 --> 16:31.840
some kind of roller coaster inspector.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.880
That's good oh yeah it could be like a

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
it could also be a list of all the roller coasters

16:36.880 --> 16:39.520
in the country and you're very afraid of them of course

16:39.520 --> 16:41.760
but you've checked off all but this one

16:41.760 --> 16:43.120
and you show it to everybody proud.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.520
This is the last one and I'll have ridden every roller coaster

16:45.520 --> 16:47.040
across these great United States.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.760
And you don't even have to ride them

16:51.760 --> 16:53.600
because what are they how are they going to check that?

16:53.600 --> 16:56.720
It's uncheckable that's a very good lie to start telling

16:56.720 --> 16:59.120
like I've ridden every roller coaster in America.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.720
Because if anybody tries to push you on it

17:00.720 --> 17:02.080
it's like tell me about this roller coaster.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.320
Well there was a part where we started to go up a hill

17:04.320 --> 17:06.080
and then we kind of sat there for like half a second

17:06.080 --> 17:07.440
we thought what's going to happen now

17:07.440 --> 17:09.840
and then we went down the hill and they're like checks out.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.280
Or more simply just like I don't

17:13.280 --> 17:15.120
I can't remember individual coasters.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.480
I've ridden every coaster in America.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.960
They all to it's my great burden

17:18.960 --> 17:22.720
that I can only enjoy roller coasters holistically.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.840
I'm cursed I can never stop walking this land.

17:25.840 --> 17:26.720
I have to.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.400
My soul can never rest.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.360
Do you think if you're the if you're a person

17:31.360 --> 17:33.440
who's ridden every roller coaster in America

17:33.440 --> 17:35.920
and you see a news story about like new roller coaster

17:35.920 --> 17:38.160
opens up you think there's a party it's like ah fuck.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.040
No.

17:39.040 --> 17:39.760
Oh great.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.440
I want to go to Duluth.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.480
Fantastic.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.200
Cool weekend.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.880
I just retired.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.520
Please no.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.720
Every time we name a town or city of any size

17:48.720 --> 17:51.040
we get lots of tweets from people who are psyched

17:51.040 --> 17:51.840
that we mentioned them.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.080
Although sometimes we say it in a tone of voice.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.360
Justin just said Duluth

17:55.360 --> 17:57.280
as if a bee had just flown into the room

17:57.280 --> 17:59.360
and he was like ah Duluth I have to deal with this.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.000
Like Duluth is probably really good.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.120
Well that's the problem Griffin.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.760
What he was saying was Duluth is too intense

18:05.760 --> 18:07.600
and like I don't know that I'm in the mood

18:07.600 --> 18:10.160
to be able to handle all that excitement and joy.

18:10.160 --> 18:10.560
Sure.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.080
Well I picked it I picked it

18:12.080 --> 18:15.520
because Duluth has the adventure zone canal park.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.320
Oh that's fine.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.840
I want to drag them a little bit.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.960
How about a yahoo?

18:18.960 --> 18:20.560
Stop stealing our shit Duluth.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.040
All right.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.600
Fuck we got you're in our sights now Duluth.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.480
You're on notice.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.680
This one was sent in by Nick.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.080
Thank you.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.280
It's yahoo answers user.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.600
They're anonymous but I'll call them Duluth asks.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.200
When I'm sitting on the toilet my testicles

18:35.760 --> 18:39.040
sometimes sometimes my penis hit the water.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.280
Is there any way to adjust the toilet's water level?

18:43.040 --> 18:46.800
If we could do this in a way that doesn't get too crass

18:46.800 --> 18:48.640
too blue I don't even know if that's possible

18:48.640 --> 18:54.320
but this person's got a problem they're they're touching

18:54.320 --> 18:57.520
and in they're doing in the I believe in the UK

18:57.520 --> 18:59.200
they call this having a hog splash

18:59.840 --> 19:03.440
and I want to be able to tell them something.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.000
Now it's possible they're having a hog splash

19:06.000 --> 19:10.320
because they got you know 10 pounds of hog in a five pound bag.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.520
It could also be that the water in their toilet

19:13.520 --> 19:15.280
fills the bowl up all the way.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.040
Do you know what I mean?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.320
Yeah that's the problem.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.640
All the way to the top of the bowl just a full

19:20.640 --> 19:22.640
which is bad environmentally speaking.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.680
I for sure.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.120
I do I like very much that this person's like first

19:27.120 --> 19:28.880
is like lower the water level where I think

19:28.880 --> 19:31.040
I would probably be over complicated at first

19:31.040 --> 19:34.320
and try to like design some kind of like sling or hammock

19:34.960 --> 19:38.480
that like would still leave room for my business.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.160
Yeah take care of my business.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.480
But also cradle my my package in such a way

19:44.480 --> 19:46.720
that just kept everything dry.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.680
Why?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.160
My brother Travis wants to poop with his pants on

19:50.160 --> 19:51.200
and I think that we all.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.720
Hold on that is not what I said.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.120
We all understand hey we all understand the dream Trav

19:55.120 --> 19:58.160
we'd all love to poop with our pants on every day.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.240
Listen if I could get that measurement right

20:00.240 --> 20:02.800
if I could figure like the right ratio out

20:02.800 --> 20:04.320
I'm not saying I wouldn't.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.400
Sure yeah Trav in similar vein an anonymous user here

20:08.400 --> 20:09.520
did not best answer.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.920
Actually nobody got any points on this one

20:11.920 --> 20:14.320
just a lot of stinkers but an anonymous user said

20:14.320 --> 20:17.120
booster seat I got sick of wet dick.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.200
Booster seat booster seat's cool.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.400
Um is it can you adjust the toilet's water level?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.920
I don't know that much about plumbing

20:25.920 --> 20:27.200
but I think it's sort of a one size fits.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.480
It has the right amount.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.000
I mean it has the proper amount that it stops filling

20:32.000 --> 20:36.240
when the the I mean bulb goes floats up

20:36.240 --> 20:37.520
and stops the water flow.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.000
The easy answer.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.920
It's got the right amount it's calibrated.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.720
Yeah fuck it up.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.400
The last thing I wanted to you know how hard it is

20:42.400 --> 20:43.440
to fix the toilet?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.040
It's not hard but for the purposes of this

20:45.040 --> 20:46.560
let's pretend it's hard to fix the toilet.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.320
You think you know how hard it is to fix the toilet?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.320
No you're gonna go break one intentionally?

20:50.320 --> 20:51.360
No thank you.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.520
I'm having a weird my brother my brother and me scenario

20:55.520 --> 20:58.560
in which I actually know how to answer this

20:59.200 --> 21:00.640
but it's not funny?

21:00.640 --> 21:01.520
Get a smaller tank?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.720
No you fill up a two liter bottle full of water

21:04.720 --> 21:06.480
you seal it up you stick it in the back there

21:07.040 --> 21:09.120
and that acts as a displacer for water

21:09.120 --> 21:11.200
so not as much water fills up in the-

21:11.200 --> 21:11.920
Incorrect.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.640
It would displace the water in the tank.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.800
So you wouldn't need to fill as much water in the tank

21:16.800 --> 21:17.600
to fill the tank?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.480
Okay let me ask you this Travis.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.200
I don't okay in case you missed it

21:23.200 --> 21:24.880
because Griffin edited it out.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.200
Travis just gave a 30 minute dissertation

21:27.200 --> 21:30.320
on why this would work and I disagreed with him

21:30.320 --> 21:32.320
on the premise that if I thought it would be funny

21:32.320 --> 21:34.320
and then it wasn't so that's why you didn't hear it

21:34.320 --> 21:36.880
but I don't think that you want to start

21:37.440 --> 21:39.600
I understand that you think that displacing the water

21:39.600 --> 21:42.000
in the toilet tank would help fix this problem

21:42.000 --> 21:43.440
maybe it would maybe it wouldn't.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.960
Do you really want to get into like the inner-

21:47.520 --> 21:49.520
at some point someone made a decision

21:49.520 --> 21:51.120
that this is how much water it needs

21:51.120 --> 21:52.400
to do the things that it does

21:53.200 --> 21:54.800
and I don't want to be in a position

21:54.800 --> 21:57.360
where I'm playing judge jury and executioner

21:58.640 --> 22:01.040
on water levels in my potty

22:01.040 --> 22:02.880
I need it to have all the water at once.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.160
You know I just feel like

22:08.160 --> 22:11.280
like maybe we all just need bidets.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.080
I don't mind getting a little water on my business

22:14.720 --> 22:15.920
on my own terms.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.920
If we could all just never talk about our genitalia again.

22:19.920 --> 22:20.960
That would be so good for me.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.800
I don't know what I was thinking including this one.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.040
It's just I think maybe I just wanted to say hog splash.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.080
I have a problem now that summer has begun.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.320
I frequently ride my bike up and down my street

22:32.320 --> 22:35.040
during the good weather for some class exercise.

22:35.920 --> 22:36.160
What?

22:36.160 --> 22:37.840
What? However, since-

22:37.840 --> 22:38.720
Wait, hold on.

22:38.720 --> 22:38.960
What?

22:39.680 --> 22:41.440
What is class exercise?

22:41.440 --> 22:43.040
Maybe it means like classy extra-

22:43.040 --> 22:44.320
class exercise.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.400
Classic?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.320
Classic exercise?

22:48.320 --> 22:51.440
Some classic good old-fashioned exercise.

22:51.440 --> 22:52.320
Okay, whatever.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.080
However, since it's nice and warm

22:54.960 --> 22:57.440
an ice cream truck frequently visits my street too.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.360
I've found that both of us

22:59.360 --> 23:00.560
me and the ice cream truck man

23:00.560 --> 23:02.160
travel in the same direction.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.400
When this happens I turn around and head home

23:04.400 --> 23:07.280
cutting my workout session a bit shorter than I'd like.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.960
I would try to pass the truck

23:08.960 --> 23:10.640
but I don't have a stamina

23:10.640 --> 23:13.040
to maintain more than five to seven miles per hour

23:13.040 --> 23:14.400
for my entire street.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.240
Approximately 3.5 miles.

23:16.240 --> 23:19.040
What should I do in the circumstance when we meet again?

23:19.040 --> 23:19.840
That's from Gmail.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.640
Please don't ask us to do long division

23:22.640 --> 23:24.880
when we're trying to do our comedy show, please.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.800
I cannot even like map this question out in my noggin.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.560
The problem is that this ice cream truck

23:30.560 --> 23:32.560
goes approximately the same speed

23:32.560 --> 23:34.960
actually maybe a little bit slower than the bike.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.400
So when you meet up with them

23:36.400 --> 23:37.840
it's one of those awkward situations

23:37.840 --> 23:38.800
where you can't get around them

23:38.800 --> 23:39.680
they can't get around you

23:39.680 --> 23:40.880
and now you're just like best friends

23:40.880 --> 23:41.760
with the ice cream truck

23:41.760 --> 23:43.920
which doesn't seem that bad to me.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.080
Like maybe what you do is you just roll with it

23:48.080 --> 23:50.400
and you get them to lower the window.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.280
You do maybe a Grey Poupon joke to break the ice.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.880
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.120
And then you find out sort of what they're all about

23:57.120 --> 23:58.640
and now all of a sudden you gotta...

23:58.640 --> 24:00.640
Ice cream truck drivers need friends too.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.600
You think that they don't

24:01.600 --> 24:06.720
because they have the coolest job on the block

24:06.720 --> 24:09.680
but like yeah dude, fuck yeah.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.720
Especially if you could finally discover for me.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.880
Let's really, I feel like you just got it and loved it

24:14.880 --> 24:15.440
but you didn't.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.120
You had the coolest job on the block, ice cream?

24:18.240 --> 24:18.720
What do you mean?

24:19.440 --> 24:22.240
There's someone on my block that has a snow code truck

24:22.800 --> 24:24.480
and it's always in the driveway

24:24.480 --> 24:26.160
and it's been a hundred fucking degrees

24:26.160 --> 24:28.080
and every time I see it I get so mad.

24:28.080 --> 24:31.280
Like get out there, do your job.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.760
What are ice cream trucks doing in like February?

24:33.760 --> 24:38.000
Are they like getting on like big like cross transatlantic

24:38.000 --> 24:40.480
like ocean liners and going to where it's still hot?

24:40.480 --> 24:41.920
Are they like migrating?

24:41.920 --> 24:43.520
This week on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

24:43.520 --> 24:47.360
Thrill is the oldest brother explaining to Miller brother

24:47.360 --> 24:48.560
about seasonal businesses.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.960
It's audio poison says.

24:54.560 --> 24:58.960
What's the ice cream truck driver doing the rest of the time?

24:58.960 --> 25:01.200
I'm selling hot chocolate.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.440
Yeah, true.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.960
Are you just, it sounds like-

25:04.960 --> 25:10.240
That's a good price.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.040
Cherry kick.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.200
A hot chocolate truck.

25:13.840 --> 25:17.840
Yeah, and in the spring he sells lukewarm apples.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.080
In the fall it's all leaves.

25:24.640 --> 25:25.840
Pretty ones that he found.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.360
Not a lot of business.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.960
That's not a good time for business

25:28.960 --> 25:31.040
because people can like pick them up anywhere.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.320
They can get anywhere but he put them in a Ziploc bag.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.920
Get your pine cones.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.520
Don't walk around all day collecting your own pine cones.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.600
I'll give you a bushel full for $5.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.840
God damn, I wish it was hot.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.380
Fuck.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.400
Global warming can't come soon enough.

25:53.040 --> 25:53.840
Give it to me.

25:53.840 --> 26:00.960
Okay, first off, let's talk about a hot chocolate truck

26:00.960 --> 26:02.160
because Travis brought it up

26:02.160 --> 26:03.840
and now we have to live here for a second.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.000
It would be hard to drive around on icy streets, Justin.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.760
Yes, drive around icy streets with a boiling hot liquid.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.920
Standing in lines is another one

26:13.920 --> 26:16.000
that you don't necessarily want to be doing

26:16.000 --> 26:17.760
in that sort of temperature.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.640
You don't want to stay in line.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.200
But the good news is there will be no demand

26:21.200 --> 26:22.480
so you could probably roll up whatever.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.120
Why?

26:23.120 --> 26:24.800
Why wouldn't you're outside playing?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.000
Oh, I'm getting a little far.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.400
Oh, hey, it's the hot chocolate truck.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.040
You know what I mean?

26:29.040 --> 26:31.760
Like I think you would do a lot of business.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.400
I'll tell you this,

26:32.400 --> 26:35.760
if it was an open sort of dumpster that they were hauling

26:35.760 --> 26:38.640
that was just chock-a-block full of this hot brown stuff

26:38.640 --> 26:40.400
and then the smell was wafting through

26:41.120 --> 26:44.960
and just there was a thick marshmallow layer floating on top

26:44.960 --> 26:46.720
and you got that in the air too,

26:46.720 --> 26:49.680
I would do anything to, man, you just couldn't.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.080
It would be a sort of speed situation though

26:52.080 --> 26:53.760
where you just couldn't brake

26:53.760 --> 26:57.840
or else the cab would be destroyed.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.160
Drenched in that beautiful brown goo.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.680
Hey, listen, that's a good option for you actually.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.120
If this truck was having to stop more for local kids,

27:07.760 --> 27:09.280
you could blow their doors.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.360
Could you put some flyers around the neighborhood?

27:13.360 --> 27:16.560
Don't put any like logos on it

27:16.560 --> 27:19.040
because big ice cream will come for you.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.560
Just like a flyer that says like,

27:20.560 --> 27:22.640
yum, ice cream coming soon.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.800
And you know what I love about that, Justin?

27:24.800 --> 27:26.320
What you love about the first third of it?

27:26.320 --> 27:27.600
I don't know, go ahead and tell me.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.880
I'll tell you in a second.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.320
I didn't have an outro.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.520
Thank you for saving me.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.880
It's mutually beneficial.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.760
Like this isn't a cruel prank you're playing

27:35.760 --> 27:37.120
on the ice cream truck man.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.360
The ice cream truck man is going to do more business.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.080
Do more business.

27:40.080 --> 27:40.640
Yeah, right?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.360
We need more answers like this

27:43.360 --> 27:45.200
where it's not like, oh, you're going to like fart

27:45.200 --> 27:46.240
in their face and run away.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.760
That it's like, here's this,

27:47.760 --> 27:50.000
how do you fix your problem and their problem?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.480
Because if they are maintaining a speed

27:52.480 --> 27:54.560
of five to seven miles per hour,

27:54.560 --> 27:57.280
they are not selling their ice cream.

27:57.280 --> 27:57.760
That's right.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.520
Yeah.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.200
I don't know much about ice cream trucks.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.240
They're wasting gasoline.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.000
It ain't a business on the go.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.920
They ain't chucking it like the paper boy.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.400
Listen, you guys help me write,

28:08.960 --> 28:11.440
I want to hear your flyers for ice cream.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.960
And remember, no brand names, no logos.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.240
We're not going to jail for this.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.560
We're just trying to gin up some interest

28:18.560 --> 28:21.600
in an ice cream truck that's coming through soon.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.640
So what would your,

28:22.640 --> 28:24.640
what would your flyer for ice cream say?

28:25.200 --> 28:28.160
Love hot chocolate trucks, but miss them in the summer.

28:28.160 --> 28:28.640
Good news.

28:28.640 --> 28:28.880
Yes.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.200
It's a great thing because you get a lot of cross promotion

28:37.200 --> 28:39.440
for your summer and winter business.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.160
Yeah, yeah.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.600
It's just the pine cones.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.440
I don't know how you gin up interest in those

28:45.440 --> 28:47.040
in the pine cone business.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.000
My flyer would be very, I mean, sex sells.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.560
So I'm talking about a hot bod like Ryan Phillippe

28:53.120 --> 28:56.400
holding the cone of, it would be soft serve,

28:56.400 --> 28:57.920
which would be probably false advertising

28:57.920 --> 28:59.760
because they probably don't have that in the truck,

28:59.760 --> 29:03.440
but you know, dripping, dripping down the nucks

29:03.440 --> 29:06.640
and just as like creamy and then an arrow

29:06.640 --> 29:08.960
to where the truck is at any given time.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.160
I don't know how that technology works, but.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.960
Yeah, in a print, in a paper, I don't know how you.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.840
Yeah, I tell you what I do,

29:17.840 --> 29:19.680
I'd be a lot more effective than a flyers.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.680
I'd probably write lyrics to the ice cream truck song

29:24.400 --> 29:27.040
that plays and just be positive.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.680
I think most of them do, do your ears hang low,

29:30.240 --> 29:32.480
but I would write sort of ice cream themed lyrics.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.040
Like, do you want ice cream?

29:35.040 --> 29:36.320
It's a creamy, creamy treat.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.600
It's so creamy soft.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.880
It's so creamy sweet.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.240
We got it's a caduzis.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.280
We got push pops to come get your ice cream.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.520
Don't go to school.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.280
Okay, well, all right.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.960
Come and get your ice cream.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.920
Eat it with your friends.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.800
When you eat ice cream, the cream never ends.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.280
Come and get all the ice cream that we have in our truck.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.720
You are gonna love it now.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.480
You're gonna love this truck.

29:59.600 --> 29:59.920
Okay.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.760
Okay, just kind of rhymes with truck.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.040
Come and buy all the ice cream.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.480
It's a dollar if you want it.

30:07.200 --> 30:07.760
What are you doing?

30:07.760 --> 30:08.640
What are you doing?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.200
What?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.800
He was like, he was remixing.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.000
He was being, you know, like hype man.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.680
Trying to like hype it and remix it.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.760
Oh yeah, you can beatbox alongside the truck too.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.240
This song.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.520
Oh, that's what the, yeah, bicyclist person.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.840
You're gonna be this ice cream truck's hype man.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.480
Yeah, you could also sing.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.480
It's really fun to make up ice cream lyrics.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.600
Have you guys ever tried to make up ice cream lyrics?

30:29.600 --> 30:29.920
No.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.640
To do your years hang low?

30:31.200 --> 30:33.280
Juice, you want to try make up ice cream lyrics?

30:34.240 --> 30:34.960
Yeah, I'd love to do that.

30:34.960 --> 30:46.640
Do an ice cream song to do your years hang low.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.920
Do you want sun cream?

30:47.920 --> 30:50.720
You said dreamy, screamy cream.

30:50.720 --> 30:56.880
And the chocolate flavor or vanilla bean or pistachio is good, but not as good as brown.

30:58.160 --> 30:58.960
Brown?

30:58.960 --> 31:01.120
That classic ice cream flavor, brown?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.760
Do you want ice cream before you even ask?

31:03.760 --> 31:06.320
Yes, they do have brown and it takes you to task.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.520
It's a tastiest flavor.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.240
It's a color.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.040
It is too.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.880
And come get your brown stuff.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.920
Come on, doodle doo.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.000
Do you have brown?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.120
Sorry, we're all sold out.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.640
No.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.840
It's the only one we mentioned by name in the ice cream song.

31:23.840 --> 31:33.440
Let's get the money down.

31:33.440 --> 31:41.440
I want to tell y'all about Stitch Fix because hot damn, I have got some nice shirts.

31:41.440 --> 31:46.640
I've got some real nice clothing from the Stitch Fix, a lot of my wardrobe now.

31:46.640 --> 31:51.360
I got, I'll tell you what, I didn't, I never really prioritize fashion in the summertime.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.720
It was more of a fall, winter, early spring thing for me.

31:54.720 --> 32:00.000
You know, I like a long pant and like a nice button down, you know, flannel or sweater,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.160
but I didn't really do it in the summertime.

32:02.160 --> 32:07.200
Stitch Fix has fixed my shit right up because they've given me the short sleeve shirts and

32:07.200 --> 32:10.720
really nice shorts and just good looks all year round.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.160
Just because a sense of style can be elusive for some doesn't mean it's impossible to attain.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.920
You can discover the style you never knew you had with a little help from Stitch Fix.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.160
You just answer some questions about your style and you're like,

32:20.160 --> 32:23.200
you just answer some questions about your sizes, your favorite styles and budget,

32:23.200 --> 32:27.200
and your personal stylist will hand select five brand new clothing items just for you.

32:27.200 --> 32:31.360
I'm on like a, like a four box streak of keeping everything.

32:31.360 --> 32:31.600
Yeah, me too.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.440
They have got my shit like dialed in.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.560
But if you don't like something-

32:34.560 --> 32:38.160
Can I tell you another thing that I really love about Stitch Fix is because of that personal

32:38.160 --> 32:43.600
stylist thing, there's a consistency to it, not just in quality, but like I just went to

32:43.600 --> 32:47.120
Louisville this past weekend and hung out with some friends and I got complimented on my outfit

32:47.120 --> 32:52.720
and I realized the shoes, the pants, the shirt and the jacket I was wearing were from four

32:52.720 --> 32:57.920
different Stitch Fix boxes and they all just work together so well.

32:59.040 --> 33:03.200
But if you ever get something you're not feeling, you can send it back and shipping is free both

33:03.200 --> 33:04.960
ways and you only pay for what you keep.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.800
You get your fix whenever you want or you can sign up to receive scheduled shipments.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.000
So hurry to stitchfix.com slash my brother to get started now.

33:12.000 --> 33:18.160
If you keep all five items you receive, you'll get 25% off your entire purchase stitchfix.com

33:18.160 --> 33:19.600
slash my brother.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.520
I also want to tell you about Audible.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.200
I am an audiobook fan.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.520
No lie, no joke, no exaggeration.

33:25.520 --> 33:29.040
I prefer them to books, to reading.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.160
And let me tell you why.

33:31.360 --> 33:37.680
In this day and age, I find it hard to find time, especially like with BB and with driving

33:37.680 --> 33:42.080
around and you know, just living my life, hard to find time to like, I'm going to sit

33:42.080 --> 33:44.320
down and find time to read.

33:44.880 --> 33:50.560
But I can put on a book while I'm driving, I can put on a book while I'm working and

33:50.560 --> 33:52.960
listen to it while I'm typing away, working on stuff.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.680
And not only that, there's something I really love about listening to authors read their

33:57.680 --> 34:01.760
own books, especially when it comes to like memoirs and like that kind of thing.

34:01.760 --> 34:06.320
And Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet will let you fill your summer

34:06.320 --> 34:11.760
with more stories like here's, I will tell you, I was on a Sarah Val kick.

34:11.760 --> 34:20.000
I highly recommend Wordy Shipmates and Strange Fishes and Lafayette and the Somewhat United

34:20.000 --> 34:20.320
States.

34:20.320 --> 34:26.000
If you enjoy like the characters from Hamilton, you will enjoy Lafayette and the Somewhat

34:26.000 --> 34:26.720
United States.

34:27.600 --> 34:34.240
And plus, Sarah Val reads the book mostly herself, but also like the quotes and stuff

34:34.240 --> 34:38.480
are the parts, you might say, is done by like other performers.

34:39.200 --> 34:42.400
So like John Hodgman makes some appearances in there.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.400
John Slattery makes some appearances in there.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.360
It's really great.

34:46.160 --> 34:51.360
Speaking of John Hodgman, Vacationland is a really good audiobook.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.880
Do you guys have any that you are thoroughly enjoying?

34:54.880 --> 35:04.240
I listened to Room to Dream, the new David Lynch memoir, which he wrote with a traditional

35:04.240 --> 35:05.600
memoirist, I guess.

35:06.960 --> 35:12.240
And then he writes like the response to the traditional memoir chapter.

35:13.440 --> 35:19.600
And so it's like you get you hear a professional memoir person say, talk about the first years

35:19.600 --> 35:22.000
of David Lynch's life as a young boy.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.840
And then you hear about David Lynch tells you a long story about when he hit a dead

35:27.840 --> 35:31.920
cow with a pitchfork and hit himself in the head because it bounced right off for about

35:31.920 --> 35:32.720
30 minutes.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.240
So it's fantastic.

35:35.040 --> 35:42.400
So go to audible.com slash my brother or text my brother to 500-500 to get started.

35:42.400 --> 35:48.080
Amazon Prime members can get Audible for just $4.95 a month for the first three months.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.480
That's like getting three months for the price of one.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.040
And after that, it's only $14.95 a month.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.600
Now, this offer ends July 31st, 2018.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.640
So do not wait.

35:56.640 --> 35:57.840
Go check it out.

35:57.840 --> 36:02.560
Go to audible.com slash my brother or text my brother to 500-500.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.600
Go check it out.

36:03.600 --> 36:07.280
Well, we got some some Jumbotrons here as well.

36:07.280 --> 36:14.720
This first one is taken credit for, F-O-R, is a new to the scene YouTube channel where

36:14.720 --> 36:20.800
four friends play video games, really dive deep into what can be considered a playable

36:20.800 --> 36:24.960
game if you care for comedy and quality content.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.000
They've got it all.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.360
That's all of it.

36:27.360 --> 36:27.840
That's all.

36:27.840 --> 36:28.560
I enjoy that.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.480
That's really great.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.760
If you like a lot.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.560
Oh, no, they don't say a lot.

36:34.560 --> 36:39.440
So if you like comedy and quality content, and they can't guarantee a lot of it, then

36:39.440 --> 36:40.160
you're great.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.680
They have all of it, though.

36:41.680 --> 36:42.880
Where is that credit for?

36:42.880 --> 36:47.520
Where is that credit for it's just search YouTube for taking credit for all one word

36:48.320 --> 36:51.040
and you can catch it.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.560
It's also on Facebook and Instagram.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.000
I don't know why Justin didn't.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.160
Justin's beefing with with the book.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.520
I'm not trying to like focus them down where this I feel like this is going to help them

36:59.520 --> 37:00.160
the most.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.280
I listen.

37:02.080 --> 37:02.800
You're right.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.160
They did say that in the ad, and I guess I should include that as well that it's on it.

37:06.160 --> 37:10.400
They're on Instagram and Facebook taking credit for all one word.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.800
Go follow and subscribe.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.080
Here's a another Jumbotron.

37:14.080 --> 37:18.480
This one's for Beth Curtin, and it's from Nicholas Bale, who says, Hello, lover.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.880
Since our no, it's good.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.480
Since our first date in a board game.

37:22.480 --> 37:26.240
Yeah, since our first date in a board game cafe, bonding over the antics of the McRoy

37:26.240 --> 37:26.800
bros.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.640
You've been an amazing part of my life for over a year now and have never failed to make

37:30.640 --> 37:31.360
me smile.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.440
You're an incredible lady and I love you.

37:33.440 --> 37:38.080
Here are some many more days spent playing video games and watching silly YouTube videos.

37:38.080 --> 37:45.440
So this is a nice sweet message and Charlie Bit My Finger is a great YouTube video.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.480
I don't know if y'all are looking for recommendations, but Charlie Bit My Finger is great.

37:48.480 --> 37:51.920
There's a kid and he gets bit and I guess he's from like a different country because

37:51.920 --> 37:55.120
his voice is different from mine.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.960
And there's also History of Dance.

37:57.520 --> 38:02.080
Have you seen the one with the cat and it's acting really weird?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.360
Like a cat doesn't normally act.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.640
No, no, I've never seen that.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.520
It's really good.

38:05.520 --> 38:10.400
I think if you just like search cat in the YouTube search, you'll find it.

38:10.400 --> 38:10.640
Sure.

38:10.640 --> 38:11.760
So he's like, Charlie.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.000
Have you seen Charlie Bit My Cat?

38:16.000 --> 38:20.880
He does a whole series of Charlie Bit My blank and it's like, Charlie bit my textbook.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.000
Charlie bit my sandwich.

38:22.000 --> 38:22.960
That one's not that good.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.520
That's just a kid eating a sandwich.

38:25.520 --> 38:29.120
They actually have a live stream now where both the kids are 30 and they just bite each

38:29.120 --> 38:34.240
other for two hours every day while playing Minecraft.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.240
Still sound like that though, just like Charlie.

38:37.280 --> 38:37.760
Charlie.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.840
Charlie bit my style.

38:39.840 --> 38:45.440
Kind of a Christopher Walken, like Charlie bit me.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.480
That's Christopher Walken.

38:47.360 --> 38:51.600
They did one where Charlie bit my bite and that was really weird and I didn't care for

38:51.600 --> 38:51.840
it.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.480
He tried to bite but he countered it with a counter bite.

38:54.480 --> 38:58.480
It's a great injustice that Charlie Bit My Finger has so many views and I can't believe

38:58.480 --> 39:00.800
you've done this, it only has like a million.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.440
True.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.400
It's just not fair.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.040
He's from somewhere else too.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.040
We got one more Jumbotron though.

39:07.040 --> 39:07.840
Is that my turn?

39:07.840 --> 39:09.040
It is, okay.

39:09.040 --> 39:13.520
This is for current Jessica from past Jessica.

39:13.520 --> 39:17.360
Hey Jessica, I know you're worried about a lot right now but it's going to be okay.

39:17.360 --> 39:21.040
Everything always turns out all right in the end if you just wait long enough.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.720
Just keep waiting and in the meantime, don't stop vibing and keeping it tight.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.400
Also, work on your thesis.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.160
That's great.

39:28.160 --> 39:32.960
Everyone should always be vibing it, keeping it tight and just getting ready for that thesis

39:32.960 --> 39:36.080
because you may not think you'll need it right now, it'll creep up on you.

39:36.080 --> 39:41.120
Oh, you'll wake up in the middle of the night, your thesis ain't done due tomorrow, you're

39:41.120 --> 39:43.200
going to have a real Bart's nightmare on your hands.

39:47.840 --> 39:55.040
Maximum Fun's new sci-fi comedy podcast Bubble is coming to San Diego Comic Con on July 21st.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.200
Tickets are required but free.

40:09.200 --> 40:14.160
Then at 5pm, the cast will participate in a panel moderated by Jesse Thorn, held at

40:14.160 --> 40:16.400
the San Diego Central Library.

40:16.400 --> 40:29.200
For more information, visit MaximumFun.org slash SDCC.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.880
So we have an exciting treat right now.

40:31.440 --> 40:36.800
If you didn't listen to our Margaritaville premiere debacle, was that fair?

40:36.800 --> 40:37.280
Calamity.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.880
Calamity, yeah.

40:38.880 --> 40:46.560
Yeah, we had an embarrassing moment with Mary Lou Henner, a beloved stage and screen actress

40:46.560 --> 40:48.080
Mary Lou Henner, an author.

40:48.080 --> 40:52.000
We'll recount the incident in full detail during our discussion with you.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.600
That's a great thing to do, actually, if you have an embarrassing moment with somebody

40:55.600 --> 40:57.680
is to recount it in full detail.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.160
We don't need to do that because Mary Lou Henner has a perfect memory.

41:00.160 --> 41:05.440
But she was nice enough to come talk to us about that experience and give advice on your

41:05.440 --> 41:08.320
questions and so much more.

41:08.320 --> 41:13.600
So without further ado, here's our discussion with a special guestpert, Mary Lou Henner.

41:15.360 --> 41:20.960
Folks, our very special guestpert for this episode is star of stage and screen.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.920
American icon, Mary Lou Henner.

41:25.920 --> 41:28.480
Mary Lou Henner, welcome to my brother, my brother and me.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.080
I love you guys so much.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.920
Well, first of all, I love family and, you know, you're just so funny.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.280
I just love your humor.

41:35.280 --> 41:40.400
And I was saying to you before we started that my son, who's 22, just graduated from

41:40.400 --> 41:43.920
Northwestern, his friends, they all listen to you guys.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.040
And it has definitely helped my street cred with his gang.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.320
So thank you for that.

41:48.320 --> 41:55.760
Mary Lou, your first exposure to our wild, fun humor sensibilities was on the Margaritaville

41:55.760 --> 42:01.920
red carpet, sorry, blue carpet, which I asked you what your favorite sea creature was.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.360
You said Ursula, a perfectly acceptable response.

42:05.360 --> 42:10.560
And then I screamed in your face for no apparent reason other than I was very, very nervous.

42:10.560 --> 42:14.720
As if you were a football game that just was very excited that his team had just gotten

42:14.720 --> 42:16.400
a big touchdown or something.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.040
Well, thank you.

42:17.040 --> 42:17.440
Thank you.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.000
I felt like, oh, was that a funny response?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.160
I was being very serious.

42:22.160 --> 42:22.640
One question.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.480
What do you think the scariest sea creature is?

42:25.840 --> 42:27.280
Ursula from Little Mermaid.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.480
Yes, that's a good answer.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.360
Yes, thank you.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.160
Thank you, Ms. Henner.

42:30.160 --> 42:30.640
You crushed it.

42:30.640 --> 42:37.040
What I think you were seeing there was Justin, like a teapot, releasing some of his pressure

42:37.680 --> 42:41.440
of like being very nervous and you giving a very good answer.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.760
And so for Justin, it was just this moment of like steam escaping, like, yes.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.880
Well, I endeared you to me forever.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.640
The day we'd had, Al Roker screamed at us.

42:52.640 --> 42:56.400
The 60 Minutes guy screamed at us, just yelled at our face.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.440
It was a very difficult, challenging day for everybody.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.320
Well, come on.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.400
You know, red carpets are crazy.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.320
I mean, everybody's screaming at everybody.

43:04.320 --> 43:07.200
And you never know if you're in somebody else's shot or, you know,

43:08.400 --> 43:10.480
tape recorder or whatever, microphone.

43:10.480 --> 43:13.280
And so what happens is you feel like, oh, I just said that answer.

43:13.280 --> 43:13.920
Did they hear it?

43:13.920 --> 43:14.640
Did they record it?

43:14.640 --> 43:16.400
Did they, you know, is that why they're calling me over?

43:16.400 --> 43:18.560
And nobody asked me about sea creatures, though.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.160
So you guys were original.

43:20.160 --> 43:20.640
So nice.

43:20.640 --> 43:21.360
Wait, no, hold on.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.560
Wait, nobody else?

43:22.560 --> 43:22.880
No.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.800
Nobody else asked you about sea creatures?

43:24.800 --> 43:25.840
No, they weren't clever.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.560
They ask the same stupid questions all the time.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.600
So you guys have to come to Getting the Band Back Together opening night,

43:31.600 --> 43:31.760
though.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.120
It's August 13th.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.400
We have to arrange that.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.600
You have to do that.

43:35.600 --> 43:40.640
Now that you've seen what we can do, like, you've got to have us.

43:40.640 --> 43:41.360
Oh, my god.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.840
Now you've seen our raw talent on the red carpet.

43:43.840 --> 43:47.120
And the show is very much like, you know, about you guys.

43:47.120 --> 43:47.760
So, yeah.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.440
The show's about, OK.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.880
Whoa, you wrote a show about us?

43:50.880 --> 43:51.680
You didn't even know.

43:51.680 --> 43:55.200
That's how fast I absorbed your, you know, sensibility.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.560
You brought up your show.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.320
Can you tell us about it real quick before we get into helping you?

43:58.320 --> 43:58.800
Sure, sure, sure.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.120
Yeah, we open August 13th at the Belasco Theater.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.480
It's called Getting the Band Back Together.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.120
It's about a guy who gets fired from Wall Street.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.720
He had this high school band.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.800
They won the battle of the bands in high school.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.720
He took off for, you know, Wall Street.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.480
He now has to come back, live with his mom.

44:12.480 --> 44:13.440
That's the part I'm playing.

44:14.080 --> 44:18.880
And she's an ex-rocker, hung out with Aerosmith and a bunch of other bands.

44:18.880 --> 44:21.120
So she's excited to have him home.

44:21.120 --> 44:26.880
They have to do another battle of the bands to beat the guy again that they beat last time.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.400
So they have to get the band together.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.480
One of the guys is a dermatologist.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.200
One's a teacher.

44:31.200 --> 44:31.840
One's a cop.

44:31.840 --> 44:32.800
One has passed away.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.160
So they've got this 16-year-old phenom.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.000
And, you know, so it's a battle.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.200
It's really fun.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.600
I thought you were going to say, so they've got a ghost.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.760
When you said one passed away, I thought, and then there's a ghost

44:43.760 --> 44:45.520
bringing up the back of the band.

44:45.520 --> 44:50.000
No, no, they have a young guy who's ridiculous.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.480
I hope he's got a long contract because they're going to, you know, he's a phenom.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.120
He is.

44:55.120 --> 45:02.720
And the lead singer of the band is, if you guys remember, Keith Stone from the Keystone ads.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.680
I was so excited to see him back in the biz.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.160
And also-

45:06.160 --> 45:07.760
Oh, he's A Rock of Ages.

45:07.760 --> 45:08.960
He was in A Rock of Ages.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.240
Oh, he was in A Rock of Ages.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.360
I didn't realize that.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.320
He's so good.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.600
Mitch Jarvis.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.400
He's amazing.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.520
He's just amazing.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.840
We should hop into the questions before we do it.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.040
Did you get some good ones?

45:19.040 --> 45:20.240
Did you get some good questions?

45:20.240 --> 45:20.640
We did.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.280
Thank you to our listeners who sent some good ones in.

45:23.280 --> 45:27.840
In the interest of full disclosure, we should mention we have spoken on the phone before also,

45:27.840 --> 45:34.640
and it took all of about four minutes before you had us talking about our actual sex lives.

45:34.640 --> 45:40.080
So I'm kind of buckled up, strapped in, ready for whatever, for wherever this goes.

45:40.080 --> 45:46.560
Okay, so we asked people for questions about memory and posing for a great photo

45:46.560 --> 45:50.960
because these are the things that we are completely wholly ignorant of.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.280
So we have a wide array of questions.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.240
I'm going to get into the first one.

45:54.960 --> 45:58.800
I have a really good memory, particularly for names and faces,

45:58.800 --> 46:00.720
which often leads to people saying,

46:00.720 --> 46:02.720
Hi, I'm so-and-so, nice to meet you.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.360
And me responded, I know, we've met before.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.680
And then recounting in detail our last meeting.

46:07.680 --> 46:11.680
People are always taken aback by how much I remember and I feel like such a jerk.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.920
Do you have any advice on how to handle this better?

46:13.920 --> 46:17.920
Is there anything I could say in response that'll make the situation less awkward?

46:17.920 --> 46:21.840
Oh, that's from weirding people out in Washington, D.C.

46:21.840 --> 46:26.560
We use handles here on the show so people don't have to reveal their shame.

46:26.560 --> 46:27.360
They really are.

46:27.360 --> 46:27.680
Okay.

46:27.680 --> 46:31.040
Well, first of all, maybe you should be tested by the people who do all the testing

46:31.040 --> 46:33.600
about highly superior autobiographical memory

46:33.600 --> 46:37.120
because it sounds like you're somebody who really has an incredible memory.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.240
Because, you know, here's the thing.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.920
Most people don't remember anything.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.640
They remember eight to 11 events within any given year,

46:42.640 --> 46:47.520
which is really kind of sad when you think about how many days there are in a year and a leap year.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.840
That feels like so many events to me.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.800
I can't remember eight to 11 events a year.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.480
Mary Lou, I really live in the moment.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.120
You know what I mean?

46:55.120 --> 46:55.760
That's it.

46:55.760 --> 46:58.880
I mean, you hope you're living in the moment, but you can still record.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.400
It can still be recorded.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.360
We've just gotten really lazy about recording.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.960
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.000
I'm so lazy.

47:07.600 --> 47:09.840
Well, this is what I think.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.680
First of all, you should celebrate the fact that you remember.

47:11.680 --> 47:12.800
And I think it's your tone.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.920
If you're very like me, me, me, me, me, me about the person like,

47:15.920 --> 47:18.400
oh, you know, Europe, can we can we swear on this?

47:21.600 --> 47:23.520
So if you're like, fuck you, I remember you.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.640
You don't remember me.

47:24.640 --> 47:25.680
That's not good.

47:25.680 --> 47:29.440
You know, what you should probably do is you should probably just be like,

47:29.440 --> 47:32.560
oh, no, remember this and and try to prompt their memory.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.840
Because here's the thing.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.960
Everything anybody's been through is on their emotional hard drive,

47:36.960 --> 47:39.360
and they would will remember with a little prompting.

47:39.360 --> 47:43.040
So what you have to do is prompt them and sort of do a little memory,

47:43.040 --> 47:45.360
you know, trip together.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.080
You know what I mean?

47:46.080 --> 47:50.000
It's like really fun when you get somebody going with their memory

47:50.000 --> 47:52.720
rather than taking like a superior position.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.320
So let me get this straight, Mary Lou.

47:54.320 --> 47:57.360
You say we take the person, we look in the person's eyes,

47:57.360 --> 48:00.800
we take their hand and we say, I know you think I'm a stranger to you,

48:00.800 --> 48:03.040
but I'm going to take you on a memory journey with me.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.280
Get in the back seat.

48:05.280 --> 48:06.800
We're going together.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
Philadelphia, 1987.

48:08.800 --> 48:09.840
Do you smell these?

48:09.840 --> 48:11.040
These are French fries.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.480
What is this to remind you of?

48:12.480 --> 48:15.920
Right. Or you just, you know, you kind of have fun with them and stuff.

48:16.480 --> 48:17.600
I love doing this.

48:17.600 --> 48:22.080
People always, until I was on 60 Minutes talking about having an unusual memory,

48:22.080 --> 48:25.120
people always thought like, man, I must be really special to her.

48:25.120 --> 48:27.120
You know, but everybody's special to everybody.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.880
We just don't always remember that.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.960
So I think you should celebrate it.

48:31.600 --> 48:36.240
Get them involved in the remembering and don't pick up on their, you know,

48:36.240 --> 48:37.600
don't insult them.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.320
And then you won't pick up like you're being insulted.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.040
Do you know what I mean?

48:41.040 --> 48:45.120
Yeah, don't don't insult them as a pretty good general rule for other stuff, too.

48:45.120 --> 48:51.520
I've I found you mentioned getting tested for the like super autobiographical memory.

48:51.520 --> 48:56.320
And I was curious, is there a sort of Hogwarts like procedure where if you find out that you

48:56.320 --> 49:02.560
do possess this superpower, you get to go to like a special academy and hang out with other

49:02.560 --> 49:04.640
like super memorable people?

49:04.640 --> 49:05.760
Well, there aren't that many.

49:05.760 --> 49:07.200
There aren't that many people who have it.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.640
And we've only gotten a few of us have only gotten together once.

49:10.640 --> 49:15.840
But it's funny you say Hogwarts because you remember every second of that meeting, the

49:15.840 --> 49:18.080
most remembered meeting ever.

49:18.080 --> 49:18.800
Yeah, it's fun.

49:19.360 --> 49:25.440
You know, if you if it's something you're born with, you sort of celebrate it anyway.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.520
But it's not like you go to Hogwarts.

49:27.520 --> 49:33.200
It's just that they do wire you put you through an MRI and take 300 measurements of your brain.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.880
And they also put you they see how the neural pathways fire up.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.840
And it's pretty crazy.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.480
You feel and then when you see the MRIs, they're pretty nuts.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.040
That's actually what the sorting hat is doing.

49:43.040 --> 49:46.480
It is actually it is actually giving you an MRI.

49:46.480 --> 49:46.640
Yeah.

49:47.440 --> 49:48.400
I have a question for you.

49:48.400 --> 49:48.720
Sure.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.200
And if you can't answer this, I understand.

49:51.200 --> 49:56.800
But once your memory thing became public and came to light, how often have you been approached

49:56.800 --> 50:00.000
by intelligence organizations trying to recruit you as a spy?

50:00.000 --> 50:01.120
Oh, that happened.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.200
Have you done any spying for America?

50:03.200 --> 50:07.440
No, I wish I wish I wish somebody would like that part of my brain.

50:07.440 --> 50:11.360
But you know, they have me memorizing lines instead and singing.

50:13.440 --> 50:16.560
You definitely you definitely couldn't tell us even if you were.

50:16.560 --> 50:20.000
Yeah, that's definitely the answer you would give even if you were.

50:20.000 --> 50:20.480
Yeah.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.440
Here's another question.

50:21.440 --> 50:21.760
Okay.

50:22.800 --> 50:27.280
They say, Hello, I just had to get my photo taken for the author's jacket flap on my first

50:27.280 --> 50:28.240
published book.

50:28.240 --> 50:30.560
I never get I never get my photo taken.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.960
Any advice on how you look so great in your pics?

50:32.960 --> 50:34.400
And that's from LCO.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.800
Okay, here's my theory on taking your picture.

50:36.800 --> 50:41.040
Do it a lot so that you're not freaked out when you only see it once.

50:41.040 --> 50:45.600
There are times when the lighting is bad, you're it's the wrong camera angle.

50:45.600 --> 50:49.600
You don't you know, you hate the photographer, the photographer shoots late.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.760
So you're coming down from an expression.

50:51.760 --> 50:57.120
I mean, probably the best advice I ever got about taking a picture was from Burt Reynolds,

50:57.120 --> 51:01.120
who told us all the first day of Evening Shade that we all took pictures together.

51:01.120 --> 51:06.000
He said, when you take a photograph, you look into the camera lens, and you feel like you

51:06.000 --> 51:07.840
want to fuck the photographer.

51:07.840 --> 51:13.040
And because if you know, because if you do, or I guess he's there were little kids.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.760
So he said, you want to, you know, you love the photographer.

51:15.760 --> 51:19.760
If you want to hug the photographer, I bet he still said fuck.

51:23.440 --> 51:28.640
But it's like your eyes soften, you look like, you know, your your face is relaxed,

51:28.640 --> 51:31.280
you feel like you're playing to the camera.

51:31.280 --> 51:36.480
So it really is important every time you look at the photographer and you feel like I want

51:36.480 --> 51:38.320
to how often do you get your photo taken?

51:38.320 --> 51:44.320
Oh, like how many times a day should we do probably yesterday, at least 5060 times?

51:44.320 --> 51:47.120
Wow, oh my god, I'm so far behind.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.720
You know what you have to do, you have to do it a lot.

51:48.720 --> 51:49.840
And here's the thing.

51:49.840 --> 51:54.480
Think of like the middle of the photograph as something that you turn into.

51:54.480 --> 52:00.880
So if you're on the outside, let's say you're on the right side of the frame, the camera,

52:00.880 --> 52:06.400
you know, this the cameras pointing at you and your it and your right hand is, you know,

52:06.400 --> 52:11.440
you're on the far right of that photograph camera left, but no, yeah, camera left, but

52:11.440 --> 52:13.680
you know, okay, I'm holding my camera up.

52:13.680 --> 52:14.000
You got it.

52:14.000 --> 52:14.640
You got it.

52:14.640 --> 52:15.200
All right.

52:15.200 --> 52:19.920
Always tilt your body sort of toward the center, because that's going to be better than if you

52:19.920 --> 52:20.720
turn away.

52:20.720 --> 52:24.160
I learned that from going on The Tonight Show and things like that.

52:24.160 --> 52:28.400
You always cross the leg toward the host because that's the center.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.640
You know, so I'm posing in Skype, is it sort of like this and kind of across arms?

52:33.360 --> 52:34.400
First of all, you're by yourself.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.840
So it's a little different.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.600
But and also you should face the light.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.520
I don't know how to get another person here.

52:39.520 --> 52:40.560
I got my cat.

52:40.560 --> 52:41.200
Okay, I see.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.160
I see what you're doing.

52:42.160 --> 52:42.400
Okay.

52:42.400 --> 52:42.800
Yeah.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.040
Okay.

52:43.040 --> 52:46.960
So let's say, yeah, what you do is you you sort of move toward the center.

52:46.960 --> 52:50.000
You angle your body toward the center, I guess, for me.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.800
But you can't see my biceps that I'm flexing there.

52:52.800 --> 52:54.960
If I turn, I lose the biceps.

52:54.960 --> 53:00.720
No, no, no, put your body but put your biceps like square off your biceps to the camera.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.320
But put your tilt your body.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.040
No, you do the exact opposite.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.560
I'm covering my face very low.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.000
This is good radio.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.400
I will say I feel very much like the listeners right now.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.480
I'm getting a wonderful audio experience.

53:10.480 --> 53:11.200
Here's my advice.

53:11.200 --> 53:14.640
Stop using filters because you're going to be so fooled by them.

53:14.640 --> 53:19.120
What you have to do is you have to just find the right kind of light and experiment with

53:19.120 --> 53:24.640
what your better side is, your better lighting is because and try to stay on the inside of

53:24.640 --> 53:26.000
the picture rather than the outside.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.280
The people further out are always going to look distorted.

53:29.280 --> 53:33.040
Just a follow up vis a vis looking like you want to fuck the photographer.

53:34.400 --> 53:39.120
For this specific example of getting your photo taken for a book sleeve or book cover,

53:40.400 --> 53:44.000
is that going to be troubling to the people who purchase the book and open it up and say,

53:44.000 --> 53:45.280
let's learn about the author.

53:45.280 --> 53:49.360
Wow, they really look like they want to have sex with me, the person who's reading their

53:49.360 --> 53:52.320
book because that carries over to every other person who sees the photo.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.120
Yes, doesn't everybody want to feel like they're wanted?

53:55.120 --> 53:55.840
Of course.

53:55.840 --> 54:00.400
I mean, you know, you don't have to use the foul language, but you want somebody who's

54:00.400 --> 54:04.320
inviting to you and someone who looks like they like you and someone who feels like they're

54:04.320 --> 54:05.840
comfortable and their eyes are soft.

54:05.840 --> 54:06.720
Come on.

54:06.720 --> 54:11.680
You're going to start looking at all photographs and saying, did that person feel comfortable

54:11.680 --> 54:12.960
with the photographer?

54:12.960 --> 54:16.080
Are they sending something to the camera?

54:16.080 --> 54:16.320
All right.

54:16.320 --> 54:19.360
You know how there's this thing on Twitter right now called BDE?

54:19.360 --> 54:19.760
Do you know?

54:19.760 --> 54:20.240
Yes.

54:20.240 --> 54:20.800
OK.

54:20.800 --> 54:24.320
Let's get into it.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.800
I'm completely ignorant of it, Mary Lunar.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.760
What is BDE?

54:28.800 --> 54:29.440
This bugs me.

54:29.440 --> 54:29.600
All right.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.320
Let me just tell you.

54:30.320 --> 54:35.200
So there's this whole thing about people who have, you know, big dick energy and they're

54:35.200 --> 54:37.200
talking about, oh, but women can have it, too.

54:37.200 --> 54:37.440
All right.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.280
First of all, why don't we call it something else?

54:39.280 --> 54:43.680
So for years in my family, because I have two brothers, I grew up with two brothers,

54:43.680 --> 54:47.520
three sisters, we have always called it PF.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.120
It's PF.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.440
That's what we call it because it can be male or female.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.160
PF.

54:52.160 --> 54:57.360
PF measures the sexual quotient of somebody and it doesn't matter what they look like.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.200
It doesn't matter what their age is.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.400
It doesn't matter anything.

55:00.400 --> 55:05.920
It's like what radiates from them that makes you feel like, wow, that person really has

55:05.920 --> 55:06.400
it.

55:06.400 --> 55:10.480
And you can talk about it in a movie sense like, oh, those two had no PF together or

55:10.480 --> 55:11.120
a restaurant.

55:11.120 --> 55:15.520
Wow, that restaurant devoid of PF or wow, there was so much PF in that room.

55:15.520 --> 55:15.760
OK.

55:15.760 --> 55:18.160
And what PF stands for, not BDE.

55:18.160 --> 55:18.800
Yes, please.

55:18.800 --> 55:19.760
Oh, oh.

55:19.760 --> 55:20.720
Can you guess?

55:20.720 --> 55:21.200
I won't.

55:21.200 --> 55:22.320
I shan't.

55:22.320 --> 55:22.960
I shan't.

55:23.520 --> 55:25.440
Can I say things on this show?

55:25.440 --> 55:27.680
Say all things are permitted.

55:27.680 --> 55:30.400
So I'll tell you the F is for factor.

55:30.400 --> 55:30.960
Popcorn.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.480
I think I need to know what it is.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.760
Was it popcorn?

55:33.760 --> 55:34.720
Was it popcorn?

55:34.720 --> 55:34.960
No.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.960
It's penis factor or pussy factor.

55:36.960 --> 55:37.520
OK.

55:37.520 --> 55:37.760
Yeah.

55:39.040 --> 55:40.400
And now you have to never say it again.

55:41.440 --> 55:41.840
OK.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.200
Or pumpkin factor.

55:43.200 --> 55:47.600
Because I get a latte at Starbucks sometimes and I'm going to think, I wish this had some

55:47.600 --> 55:48.720
PF in it.

55:48.720 --> 55:51.120
And that's just the pumpkin factor that they add.

55:51.120 --> 55:54.160
What about just pubic, just pubic factor.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.280
Pubic factor.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.320
That would apply to everyone.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.520
Well, it's not as attractive a word as the other two, I think.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.920
No, listen, it's definitely not.

56:01.920 --> 56:02.160
Yeah.

56:02.160 --> 56:07.760
Well, to certain people, I bet, like Burt Reynolds, I bet would be a huge, for whatever

56:07.760 --> 56:10.720
reason, it just resonates with me that he would find that very cool.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.440
He knows about PF.

56:13.440 --> 56:13.920
He knows about PF.

56:13.920 --> 56:16.640
Listen, there's kids around, so I'm going to say pubic factor.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.000
I have another question about memory here.

56:18.000 --> 56:18.320
OK.

56:18.320 --> 56:21.280
And this is, I would love the answer to this one if you have it.

56:21.280 --> 56:25.600
How do you stop remembering the most embarrassing moments of your life?

56:25.600 --> 56:28.080
That's from lasting middle school memories from Los Angeles.

56:28.080 --> 56:28.480
OK.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.400
We got a lot of questions to this effect.

56:30.400 --> 56:30.800
OK.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.040
Here.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.160
Here's the thing.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.400
Memory is tied to adrenaline.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.800
So you always remember the highs and the lows.

56:36.800 --> 56:40.480
You always remember the good, great things that happened to you, whether like the birth

56:40.480 --> 56:46.480
of a baby or a marriage or the first kiss or a hot date or an award or promotion, things

56:46.480 --> 56:46.960
like that.

56:47.520 --> 56:52.320
And you're also going to remember all those low things, a bad breakup, anything bad that

56:52.320 --> 56:57.200
happens to you, being embarrassed, whatever, a death in the family, all the bad stuff,

56:57.200 --> 56:58.160
all the good stuff.

56:58.160 --> 57:03.600
It's when you really develop your autobiographical memory, you get to bring back all of those

57:03.600 --> 57:07.760
middle of the road memories that aren't really super tied to adrenaline.

57:08.320 --> 57:14.320
So that's why it's so good to develop that other part of you, the middle stuff, your

57:14.320 --> 57:15.920
autobiographical memory.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.520
And so here's the thing.

57:17.520 --> 57:21.120
You're going to remember those things, but what you have to do is don't back away from

57:21.120 --> 57:21.680
them.

57:21.680 --> 57:26.240
You know, it's like if the more you see a scary movie, the more you understand, like,

57:26.240 --> 57:28.800
OK, I know right around the corner this is going to happen.

57:28.800 --> 57:33.040
And the less scary it becomes, people like back off from those memories and they don't

57:33.040 --> 57:34.000
want to look at them.

57:34.000 --> 57:37.760
But ignoring them is like saying, hey, I'm reading this book.

57:37.760 --> 57:42.400
Something bad happens to somebody in Chapter 10, so I'm not going to read Chapter 10.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.240
It really informs the rest of the book.

57:44.240 --> 57:47.680
Did you have to work on your memory, Mary Lou, or did you just realize like, whoa, I

57:47.680 --> 57:49.520
remember a lot more than most people?

57:49.520 --> 57:54.320
Well, at six years old, I used to fall asleep saying, OK, what did I do a year ago in kindergarten?

57:54.320 --> 57:56.800
What did I do when I was in my little brother Lauren's age?

57:56.800 --> 58:01.440
You know, and I just it was so easy for me that I just kind of had fun with it and would

58:01.440 --> 58:02.880
do time travel.

58:02.880 --> 58:05.280
And I still kind of do that with my life.

58:05.280 --> 58:09.040
You know, if I'm having trouble falling asleep, I'll go through, you know, where was I in

58:09.040 --> 58:11.040
my second marriage?

58:11.040 --> 58:12.160
I'm in my third marriage.

58:12.160 --> 58:14.800
Where was I in my second marriage on this very same day?

58:14.800 --> 58:19.440
You know, or what was I doing when I was exactly to the day as old as my son or, you know,

58:19.440 --> 58:20.240
either of my sons?

58:20.880 --> 58:23.680
So, yeah, it was something that I had fun with.

58:23.680 --> 58:25.040
It wasn't like I had to work on it.

58:25.040 --> 58:30.080
Wait, if memory is tied to adrenaline, Mary Lou Henner, are you just like jacked on adrenaline

58:30.080 --> 58:31.040
24-7?

58:31.040 --> 58:32.800
Like, anytime we see you, is that the deal?

58:32.800 --> 58:34.880
Are you just like pumping out?

58:34.880 --> 58:36.960
Are you like skydiving constantly?

58:36.960 --> 58:41.520
Sort of a Jason Statham crank scenario where you're just constantly stoked.

58:41.520 --> 58:43.040
I, you know, maybe.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.880
When I was a little girl, my mother took me to the doctor's and say, her clothes keep

58:46.880 --> 58:47.920
breaking at the seams.

58:47.920 --> 58:48.640
What's going on?

58:48.640 --> 58:50.640
And he said, she just has a lot of energy.

58:50.640 --> 58:52.000
Her energy fields.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.440
She just, you know, breaks up clothes.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.200
Her BDE is just off the charts.

58:55.200 --> 58:55.700
Yeah, right.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.920
I have a question here.

58:59.920 --> 59:01.760
Let's wrap up with this one.

59:01.760 --> 59:09.440
Andrew asked, and this may be not great, but Andrew asked, what happened on April 25th,

59:09.440 --> 59:12.240
1983?

59:12.240 --> 59:13.920
Why is he asking about that date?

59:13.920 --> 59:15.280
That must be when he was born.

59:15.280 --> 59:16.400
That must be when he was born.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.000
Yes, that's what I think.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.680
Yeah, yeah, probably.

59:19.680 --> 59:24.800
Okay, first of all, it was a Monday, April 25th, 1983, right?

59:24.800 --> 59:25.840
Yeah, it was a Monday.

59:25.840 --> 59:30.480
And I was shooting the movie, The Man Who Loved Women in Los Angeles.

59:31.280 --> 59:34.960
Taxi had just ended and I was doing my first project with Burt Reynolds.

59:34.960 --> 59:36.400
His name came up again.

59:36.400 --> 59:41.280
It was directed by Blake Edwards and I played one of a group of women that was involved

59:41.280 --> 59:42.000
with him in the film.

59:43.040 --> 59:44.560
So that must be his birthday.

59:44.560 --> 59:45.760
Must be a special day.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.800
How about this one also?

59:48.800 --> 59:50.480
Because that one was a shorty.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.600
Juice, you have the question list up, right?

59:54.240 --> 59:54.800
Yes, I do.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.200
It was a Monday.

59:57.200 --> 59:58.080
Holy crap.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.680
Oh, no, you can't stump me.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.120
I was on a radio show and they were trying to give tickets away.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.840
And after 22 calls, you know, try to stump me.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.240
I'd say, just give away the damn tickets.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.440
My friends are going to be married and want me to officiate.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.720
Do you have advice for remembering a ceremony?

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.400
That's for memorizing minister.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.080
So that's like a little harder, like groups of work, like a big chunk of text, which I

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.720
guess is not unlike, you know, a monologue or a soliloquy or whatever.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.880
Well, first of all, write it from the heart and write it in bullet points first so that

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.800
you remember the really important points.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.920
And then when you write it all out, you'll have the connective tissue.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.480
And also one of the easiest ways to remember anything is to like concentrate on the verbs

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.720
because the verbs really tell the story.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.520
And so if you, you know, like lines or anything like that, it was always easy for me, but

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.280
I always gave this advice to other people.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.120
Write it out in your handwriting.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.800
Danny DeVito did this all the time.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.880
You'd find his Louis lines like all over the set, not because he needed to look at them,

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.800
but because he would write them out and they would become part of him.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.560
He always felt like having them, you know, putting them through his body and using his

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.200
handwriting, they would become part of him.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.960
So write it out in your own handwriting.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.440
Don't just put it on, you know, if you really want to remember and concentrate mainly on

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.240
the verbs.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.520
But maybe you should really give them my three theories of marriage.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.240
You want to hear them?

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:16.720
Okay.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:16.960
Okay.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.000
Yes, obviously.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.600
These are my three theories of marriage.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.560
The first one is marriage is like making waffles.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.240
You throw the first one out.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.800
Okay.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.280
That's bad.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.960
Okay.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.680
All three of us here are on our first marriages.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.160
Go on.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.360
Then you have something to look forward to.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:31.840
Okay.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:45.280
Number two is marriage is finding that special, certain someone you just know you'd love to

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.600
aggravate the rest of your life because it's a little like, you know what I mean?

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.760
It's like you like spar with that person when you have a really good marriage.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.480
And then the third theory of marriage, Saint-Exupéry wrote it, but I added something to it.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.080
You know, the guy who wrote The Little Prince.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.600
So this is what he wrote.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.040
You'll have a happy marriage when you realize marriage isn't two people gazing longingly

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.560
into each other's eyes, but rather looking out over the mountain in the same direction

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.520
with their hands on each other's genitals.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.480
That's the part I added.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.160
Okay, I'm going to guess.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:18.800
Yeah, okay.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.360
I did guess that.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.120
It's got to be vision and heat.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.680
Vision and heat.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:29.920
Mary Lou Henner is getting the band back together, which opens August 13th at the

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.840
Velasque. We start previewing, though, July 19th, and there are great ticket sales and

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.240
everything else.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:38.480
You know, tickets are not only on sale, but they have like great deals going on for

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.520
previews, especially.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.440
And get in the bandbacktogether.com.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.000
You can see that.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.880
There's great music videos and clips and you should hear of the show.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.240
All the clips that I've seen have been very fun, and I hope I get to see it very soon.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.480
But Mary Lou Henner, thank you for joining us.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.400
We appreciate you being on the show.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.600
This was super fun.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.240
Thanks, Mary Lou.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.120
Bye, bye, you guys.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:57.840
Thank you, bye.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.960
Bye.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.400
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.400
Thank you again to Mary Lou Henner, our friend and-

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.640
An amazing person.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.040
An all-around amazing person.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.160
Go see her show, Get in the Band Back Together.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.320
Opens August 13th, I believe, but you can get tickets now.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.400
And you should, because it has a great cast and a great-

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.240
You can see music videos and stuff on the website, and I'm sure Mary Lou Henner is

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:26.720
great in it.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.200
We haven't seen it, but I'm sure she is.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.720
I want to tell real quick.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.560
So the graphic novel is coming out in like a week, I think.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.040
Oh my god.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.600
Fuck me.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.800
Everybody likes it.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.880
Theadventurezonecomic.com.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.160
If you haven't pre-ordered it, you can pre-order it now.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.840
I wouldn't wait too much longer.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.640
So get that.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.360
And we're doing a book tour.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:57.760
So first, let me say, the Cincinnati show is, I believe, July 18th, and that's the one,

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.840
I think, where we can still use some more people to come check that out.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.920
It's a fun way of putting it.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.160
Yeah.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.560
I like thinking about it like we're waiting for volunteers.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.200
And it's like, we still need to interview more people in that one.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:17.040
So if you want to come, the cost of the ticket also includes a book, a copy of the book.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.680
Specifically our book, not just some general book.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.520
And we're going to have some surprise guests at the show to help us with the reading.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.880
So it's going to be super fun.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.920
It'll be like a Q&A reading style discussion.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.280
Not like our traditional sort of live shows for The Adventure Zone, but mostly focused on the book.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.320
And you can get tickets for that at mcroyshows.com slash tours also.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.280
So we are doing one of the book tour stops is at San Diego Comic Con.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.040
And the venue that we got, you know, because it's Comic Con and we didn't have a ton of options,

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.480
unfortunately, the venue we got to be able to get as many people in as possible as standing room only,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.880
which is admittedly a bummer.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.280
But what we've done is we've set apart, it's in kind of three sections, three different levels.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.400
The bottom level, the ground level that's closest to the stage is going to be designated as like a sitting area.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.640
So people can sit on the ground if they so choose.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.120
If that would be more comfortable for them.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.120
So if you want to bring like something soft to sit on, do.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.520
But remember that it's first come first serve.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.080
So we can't guarantee that everyone's going to be able to sit there.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.080
But we wanted to have at least some room.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.000
We would also say like, if you're totally cool standing, then don't worry about it.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.840
Take one of the other two sections and leave room for people that need to sit.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:41.600
And we know that it's not ideal, but we really wanted to be able to get as many people in at San Diego as possible.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.960
So this is where we're at.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.120
So if you got tickets, it'll be nice.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.240
Yeah, it'll be intimate.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.160
It'll be like a fucking December's concert.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.960
You'll be like sitting there on the floor just like, how, how like kinky.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.240
And also there is ADA seating.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.960
So if, if you need, if you need that, that's also first come first serve,

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.720
but you can call ahead to the venue to make sure and like work with them and make sure that there's room for you.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.160
So that is also available.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.280
We realized we are narrow casting pretty hard right now.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.080
But this is the first time we've kind of run into this situation.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.000
So we're trying to get the, get the word out.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.360
Yeah, we just want to make sure everybody has the best time that they can.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.640
We're trying to look out for you and thank you for coming to the show.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.400
I should also say that we really appreciate it.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.280
It's going to be super fun.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.360
The San Diego show, all of them are going to be fun.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.120
I'm really, really excited about it.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:34.240
Oh, and also along those same lines, we're also doing a bunch of different like book signing events at local places,

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.520
like here around Cincinnati, around Huntington, around Austin.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.640
Carrie is doing one up in New York.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.240
You can find those two on macroshows.com slash tours.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:44.720
Yeah.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.120
Also, we are doing some live shows with Bim Bam.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.760
Tickets are still available in Orlando and Atlanta.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.080
That's all at macroshows.com slash tours.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:58.560
And Travis doing a bunch of con appearances also at SDCC and Gen Con and Dragon Con, a bunch of places.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.800
I'll post all the schedule for that all on macroshows.com too.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.240
And also we got a merch store if you've never been to it or haven't been to it lately.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.040
We're updating it.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.760
We got a monthly pin that we're sort of rotating in and out.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.400
The one for July.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.520
What is the one for July?

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.800
The cool baby pin.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.480
It's the cool baby pin.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.440
Very cute.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.560
It's very cool.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.760
