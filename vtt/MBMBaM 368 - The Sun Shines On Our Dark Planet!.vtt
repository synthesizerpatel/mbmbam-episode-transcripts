00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:44.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Teelon McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I am your babiest brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And I'm your Uncle Dane.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
Uncle Dane, welcome to the show for your, wow, is this your 300th episode with us?

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
It's my 300th episode, and my brother's children, I'm so happy to be here with both of you today in the studio space.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Such an exciting place to be with you, my nephews.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
So I guess everybody was able to celebrate today, the brief time at which our son was uncovered.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Happened around two o'clock my time, we got to just see sunlight for once every hundred years.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Now, I missed it because a bunch of mean school kids locked me in a closet.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, it was a real fart in the face, but 2024.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Those kids at Bradbury High are so fucking cold.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
They're such ding-dongs.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
And you're a teacher there, Uncle Dane, you shouldn't let the kids treat you like that.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I know, but my body's so small.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
So I heard a thing on news that said that when the sun came out, there was a weird sort of radio interference.

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
And everybody pretty much across the world was hearing what they call podcasts,

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
which sounds like our data orbs, you know, how we like projected the show out on a data orb.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
We were receiving a lot of podcasts and they suggested, like I heard this thing called Radio Lab.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
And then this one podcast called Cereal, but not like the food stuff.

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
And they suggested that ours might also be projected out through the sun using the sun as some sort of weird conduit.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Did President Jerry O'Connell make a statement about this?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Did he have anything to say about it?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
He's our go-to science expert.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, and he did a lot of Slider's references, and I thought that that might be a fun vein for us to tap into as well.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
I thought it was a little bit weird that he used Twogger to just put it out there.

03:09.000 --> 03:21.000
Broken up into, I guess it was about 38 Twogs, it's weird that he's not taking to a stage or something more formal rather than using social media.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
Frankly, it's weird seeing anybody use Twogger for anything other than just like complimenting each other and being like really, really nice to each other,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
which is, of course, in this world.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
And I don't know why I said in this world, but in this world, just sort of the way that everyone uses Twogger.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
To be fair though, President O'Connell has never been a traditional president.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I mean, after he broke the country up into eight different countries.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
At that point, using Twogger to make announcements isn't really that big a deal if you think about it.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
So, boys, the question on everybody's mind is, how did you spend the sun period?

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Locked in a closet by bully children. I literally just said it.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
Okay, obviously Uncle Dane is on one of his cantankerous rants, Dane's drops that he does.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Dane's veins.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Listen, I'll be the first one to go against the grain here.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
This is one of Dane's grains where I'm going against it and sort of rubbing up against.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Because I know everybody's always saying how great millennials are.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I'll be the first one to say that I think there's some issues here.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And I'll be the first one to highlight those.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Whoa, from downtown Dane.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
I can't even get on board with you, Dane, because think about all the things that millennials have saved.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
They've saved the napkin industry, they've saved the housing industry, they've saved the magazine industry, they've saved everything.

04:49.000 --> 04:59.000
This might be a weird thing to say, because we're literally just saying things that happened today on this very special day where the sun came out.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
And we're just saying the truth, right?

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
For some reason, I feel this thing in my gut where this bit isn't working.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Which is weird, because we're just saying the truth. We're just literally talking about what our day was like.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Wait, but did you guys see Better Off Ted last night?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
It was so good.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Every season gets better and better and better.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Every season gets better and better.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
They've been going for so many seasons now.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
And you would think up against Firefly, they'd never be able to stay on air, but the two of them work together.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Really, that's the thing.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Interestingly, I love the crossover episodes between Better Off Ted and Firefly.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Right.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
And I remember the first time they did a crossover episode.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
I think it was the first of 20 at this point.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
And it was like, what? This is ridiculous.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
But once you explain the matter transference technology that they had developed, I was like, oh yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Okay, totally get it.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
All right.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Listen, we've talked about banal things that are very commonplace for us long enough.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
I feel like we didn't really hit on an intro topic, though.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Should we do a watch?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
We could talk about the Pushing Daisies movie that's coming out.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah, we're all very excited about that.

06:08.000 --> 06:19.000
Travis, all of our intro bits have always been so great every time that it seems like one clunker is not really going to upset the orange cart, I would say.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
I would love to talk to you all about this new tentacle moistener I've been using for my tentacles.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
I actually kind of like my tentacles scaly and dry, frankly, but different strokes.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
My friend and I were hanging out one day and I asked her for the time.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
She said, oh, it's almost seven in the afternoon.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
I was confused and said, oh, you mean seven in the evening?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
She said, no, it's seven in the afternoon.

06:47.000 --> 06:57.000
She even said that her friends also call it seven in the afternoon and prove that after 7 p.m. it's technically always afternoon.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, after 12 p.m. is what the question says.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
After 12 p.m. it's technically always afternoon until 12 a.m.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Am I in the wrong or is she?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
That's from Stuck in Time in California.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
Now, this is very interesting because for me, without the sun, it becomes very hard.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I don't put a lot of value in this one.

07:17.000 --> 07:28.000
There's something wrong with our categorization of time chunks because it goes morning and that can go from fucking 12.01 a.m. to like 11.59 a.m.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That's literally half the day.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
Then it's noon for one minute and then I guess it's afternoon until like, what, five?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Then it's evening and then it's night.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
It's not efficient enough, I don't think.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
There are some periods.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
See, I would argue that 12 a.m. is not morning.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
That is not morning.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
That is not the morning.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The morning is, I would argue, at five a.m.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
Now, if you talk about three to five, that period, I think, could go either way.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
If you're still up, it's the evening.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
But if you have a really early gig, it's the morning.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
So that's very confusing.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
I think what we need to do is we need to start designating that time as a zero.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
That is a nothing time.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
That is a time during which nothing should occur.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Three a.m. to five a.m. should be left blank.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah, shouldn't exist.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
That is like, if you see that, there's an episode of Twilight Zone where they somehow got out of time

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
and they could see the people building the next minute.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
That's what three to five a.m. is.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Three to five a.m. is the time at which nature reverts back to nothing to build the new day.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You shouldn't be there.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
Have you ever noticed at three a.m. to five a.m. if you see like a raccoon or a deer, they give you this look like,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Can we not? Yeah, this is ours.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
Can we just, right now, can we have a second, please?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Let me hit you with this.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Breakfast time, lunch time, dinner time, sleep time.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Those are the new categorizations.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
I just wish that science would have broken time down by now into like smaller chunks,

09:13.000 --> 09:22.000
like 24 chunks that you could much clearer say the time rather than just having to say afternoon or even.

09:22.000 --> 09:31.000
Like if only we had some sort of system that everybody pretty much universally understood that we could use that was very specific.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
And even within maybe those chunks, you had even smaller chunks that allowed us to know what time it is.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
We do have those.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
We do have those, and they did say it in the question, and so I'm confused.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
No, no, I know.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Sorry, that was not an alternate joke.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
That was sarcasm.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
See, I got confused because I thought it was an alternate.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
And I don't know why we say alternate because it's our truth or reality.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah, no, no, no.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I think we've edited the past two minutes out anyway, so I think that we're fine.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I've been developing a new skill set called sarcasm.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It's never been used before.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I've just developed it.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Sounds really funny.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
That was great.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
How about a yahoo?

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Do you know how everyone here is sincere all the time and just says what they mean and is very direct?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
What do you mean by here?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's confusing.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
Here, like, you know how everybody says what they mean all the time?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
What if they didn't?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I call it lying.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
Here's a yahoo from the really successful and widely respected Yahoo Answers service.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
It was sent in by a few people.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
The first one to send it in, I think, was Aaron Palmer.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Thank you, Aaron.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Bill who asks,

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Could the police still arrest me if I had plans to get a pizza delivered to me?

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
If the police show up at my door and arrest me for a crime, I did.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
But at the same time, I was waiting for a pizza that I ordered that didn't come yet, what will happen?

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
What if I tell the police that I need to wait for my pizza to be delivered and if I had plans for someone to come over?

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Would the police still be able to wait for me before arresting me?

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
What if I really need time to do something important on the day I am getting arrested?

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Anytime you've ever seen someone run from the cops, they're usually running to pizza.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
If they have got a pizza in the oven, they don't want their perfect Pizza Hut record.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
You know how Pizza Hut keeps a record of everybody whether or not they come to get their pizzas.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
They have the streak board up where it's like,

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
Justin has picked up his pizza when he said he was going to every single time for the past 20 visits.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
You just don't want to lose your pizza streak, so you're running to go get the pizza.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Not necessarily away from the cops.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Sir, you are under arrest.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
No, I'm sorry. My boy Dylan's coming over.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Just ordered a pizza. We were going to play Mortal Kombat.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Sounds like a chill hang, sir.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Sorry, we didn't realize. We'll just come back tomorrow.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
You have the right to have a chill hang and play with Sub-Zero and Scorpion and all their friends.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Everyone knows if you are standing on a pizza, you have personal pain and diplomatic immunity.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
And that's just straight up.

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
First of all, you have to ruin a pizza to do it, or at least two footprint-shaped parts of the pizza are going to be no good after that.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
You could eat around the footfalls.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
But yeah, if you're standing on a pizza, you're untouchable.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Can't do it. Can't do it. That's in the Constitution.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
That's why the New York police were never able to arrest the Ninja Turtles.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You know what I mean? They always tried to.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
They're like, oh, we have to get these vigilantes.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Oh, damn it.

12:44.000 --> 12:52.000
Hey, they did do a lot of vigilante justice and probably ran afoul of some statutes.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
They murdered a lot.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
Could they arrest the Turtles even without their personal pain and diplomatic immunity?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
First of all, they'd need big wrist cuffs.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Big, big handcuffs, as some people call them.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
They would need big, big wrist cuffs to get around their big, meaty wrists and hands and palms and stuff.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
They would also have to be very fast, Griffin, because you go for the wrist and they're inside the shell.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You know what I mean?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Like, get those arms back out here.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
In a recent live show, we talked about my realization that you cannot arrest a dog for a crime,

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
and therefore furries are just running Grif's 24-Sev, right?

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
I think the Turtles are on a very similar vein, because it's like, you have the right to—

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Wait, that's a Turtle.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Jerry, we can't arrest a fucking Turtle.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
What are we talking about here?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
What will we put on the paperwork?

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Gorillas are so smart, and the thing you've got to be careful about when we're teaching them sign language,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
which I love, and is adorable.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I loved watching that gorilla sign about how sad it was that its cat died.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Oh, yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
If you guys saw it.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
It's so good.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It's a classic.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
How tripped out would you be if one time, like, you were signing with the gorilla and just going over the basics of human society,

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
and the girl was like, so, can I get arrested for stuff?

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
And the person signed, no, I guess not, you're a gorilla.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
And the gorilla's like, I'll be right back.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Peace.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Because you can't arrest a gorilla.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
It's ridiculous.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
But Big Turtle gets arrested for nunchuck crimes.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Maybe they go to zoo.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Okay.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
All right.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Well, that is more, yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I think zoo is animal jail.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Maybe.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm just still working on this.

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
Can police still arrest me if I had plans to get a pizza delivered to me?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Hands up.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Here's my badge.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I'm showing you my badge.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
She'll let you know.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And it's like, okay, here's my Domino's pizza tracker.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Fucking chill for a minute.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Can you chill for a minute?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Well, that's the trick, Griffin.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
You can do this.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
But to pull this off, you have to time it so that you call for the pizza, then commit the crime.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Like, you can't commit the crime first.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Double jeopardy.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah, because then clearly, like, no, we get to arrest you first.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
But if the pizza was already in the works and then you committed the crime,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
you can't be arrested until the pizza consumption is complete.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
See?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
And that's how you get them.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Because they're like, all right, your pizza's here.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Fucking yummy down.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And let's go to the pokey.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
And you're like, okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Ah.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Little bite.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Ooh, it's so hot.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Ooh, got to blow on the cheese.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Got to blow on the cheese.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And then all of a sudden, you're at your fucking, you know, your daughter's wedding,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
and you're still holding the slice with a detective right behind you,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
and you're still blowing on that cheese and that old stinky pizza.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And then the detective's like, oh, you're done.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And you're like, oh, no, still got the crust.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
The Domino's Pizza Tractor used to say who was making your pizza.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
And for a period of about three years, back when the service first debuted,

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
every time we got Domino's, and I was younger then,

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
so it was a lot of times, every time we got Domino's, it was made by Daniel.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Pizza Daniel.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Pizza Daniel.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Thank you.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yes, Pizza Daniel.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
And we got pretty obsessed with the idea that this guy, Daniel,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
is working there all the time and making all the pizzas pretty much.

16:14.000 --> 16:23.000
And then recently, like fairly recently, I got a Domino's pizza order,

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
and knock, knock, knock, opened the door.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Who was it delivering the pizza, but a man named Daniel.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
How did you get that data?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Hi, here's your pizza.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Cool.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
What's your name, partner?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
He had a name tag on.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, he had a name tag on.

16:38.000 --> 16:48.000
And I was so sort of like, I couldn't tell if it had been a promotion or a demotion.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
It doesn't seem like a good resource to take him out the oven, right?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
But maybe riding the oven is like being a desk jockey for cops,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
like not really in the field unless you're getting out there slinging crust.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Daniel, you know what I mean?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Daniel, you're so good at delivering pizza.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
You got it here so fast.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Why haven't you been doing this the whole time?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I shot a kid.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Okay.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
First of all, you shouldn't be allowed to be in public.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
You should be in zoo, I think, because you did a really bad job.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't think that pizza delivery people, this isn't fucking snow crash.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
You shouldn't have a fucking samurai sword.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
What are you talking about, pizza Daniel?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I'm a junior in college, and recently while in a math class,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I was talking with some fellow students about some political news.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Mistake.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Mistake.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
This is when things get real wild.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
The girl sitting a few desks over turned to us and said,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
no spoilers, I haven't watched the news yet.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Oh, man.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
After recovering from uncontrollable laughter,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
I tried to explain to her that there aren't spoilers in real world events.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
All evidence to the contrary, I will say.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
A lot of spoilers out there.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
But she said she would just put in headphones until class started

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
so we could continue talking,

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
and she could still be surprised by the news later that day.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Am I good?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Is she good?

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Have I been having the wrong attitude towards news all my life,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
or should I try to explain to this person that discussing actual political events

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
doesn't qualify as a spoiler?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Please help.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
That's from politically perplexed in the Pacific Northwest.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I am, I do not know what's wilder,

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
that this person thinks that people can spoil the news for her before she watches it,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
or that she willingly sits down and says,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I'm going to ingest some news now.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
The news has got to fucking find me.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The news has got to track me.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Whoops, news.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Oops, news.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
You got me again, news.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Oops all news.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
This person's a sentient Portlandia sketch, I think.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
There's no such thing as news spoilers.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
If somebody is talking about current events near you,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
and you hear it and receive it, it's just more news.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
That's news.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That's what news is.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I would like to acknowledge and then move away from the possibility

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
that this person just didn't want to hear you talk about politics,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and this was like they're out of like,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
oh, oh, oh, oh, well.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah, we need to always-

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I guess I'll put on, skip over that.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
We always need to be cognizant of the fact

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
that somebody might just be very funny.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Let me tell you why you are both wrong.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Oh.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
And I'm going to connect it very simply.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
You wouldn't find this weird if this was a big sports game.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
No, but I'm not affected in any way.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
That's a real life event, Griffin.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
If there's a real life event that people don't want spoiled for them,

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
that's only two steps away from a new bill getting signed.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
Yeah, but I'm not affected by the Buffalo Bills scored a cool touchdown

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
as much as I am by the fact that fucking Steve Bannon unzipped his skin suit

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
and revealed he was a fucking toilet literally the whole time,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
a toilet with arms and legs.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That actually did happen, Griffin,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
and we didn't really delve into that in the introduction.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
That was strange.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Did you arrest a toilet?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I think this person is just very funny.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I think this was a very funny joke, right?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
This seems like a very fun.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
This seems like a person you should probably try to hang with either way.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Especially if you are being literal about your uncontrollable laughter.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
If you laughed uncontrollably in this person's face

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
and they still continue to be like,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
well, better put my headphones in so I don't find out

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
about what happened this morning on CNN,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
like that's a very funny person, I think.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Yeah.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
How about another Yahoo?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Hit me.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
This one was sent in by Nick Potter.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Thank Nick.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
It's Yahoo Answers.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Thank Nick.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Yeah.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Oscar Smith,

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
and Oscar Smith says,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
My neighbor is cooking some pancakes next door.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
The aroma is overwhelmingly wonderful.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Would it be rude to knock on her door and ask her for one?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Okay, first I want to acknowledge something,

21:09.000 --> 21:18.000
and that is the sheer bravery of using what is potentially your real name.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
Either that or you're so clever that you have used a nom de plume

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
that sounds like a real name.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
A nom de pancake.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
These are amazing.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
There was actually recently, I saw a commercial on the Hulu

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
that was like the Pancake Sunday is how apartment 4B makes friends,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
and it's just like someone putting flyers up in their apartment building

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
like stop on by our apartment for pancakes on Sunday.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
No chance.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
No, that's a trap.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
No way.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, that's a trap.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
It's literally the most perfect bait for me.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
Like literally, if I smell pancakes and I walked along that stink line

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
through the air, you know at the end of it,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
there's going to be a fucking cage held up with a stick,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
and I'm going to knock down the stick, and all of a sudden I'm in zoo,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and I don't want that.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
There's a moment in this commercial in which an adorable little girl

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
carries a plate of pancakes, sits them on a welcome mat of an apartment

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
of a man who has not attended Pancake Sunday yet,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
and that is what pushes him over the edge to go attend.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
If I opened my door to find an uncovered, unwrapped,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
completely unsealed plate of pancakes, I'd call the cops.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I'd call the police.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I'm the victim of something,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
and I need you to get down here and help me figure out what.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
This is an unspecified threat.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
We've talked about neighbor anxiety for a while.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
I kind of know my neighbors,

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
but the chasm between where I'm at

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
vis-a-vis my relationship with my neighbors,

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
where it's basically a rear window situation,

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
where like one of my neighbors had like three U-Haul trucks parked outside,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
and then the next day the U-Haul trucks were gone, but they didn't move.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And I'm like, what happened?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I have to know fucking everything.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
The chasm between where I'm at now, rear window style,

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
to knock, knock, knock, let me get one of those good flapjacks I'm sniffing,

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
is so wide that I cannot believe that me and this person are like

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
members of the same society, that we are the same like species.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It is wild to me.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
I would actually be very relieved if this happened.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
I would never take the initiative to go ask for flapjacks.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
But if someone did open up the door and say,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
well, let's hope they didn't open up my door.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Let's say they knocked.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
You want the flapjacks?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Whoa!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Flapjacks!

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Oh, God.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
It's me, Flapjack Nicholsack.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I'm going door to door.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Ask the people for flapjacks.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
So if Flapjack Nicholsack knocked on my door and was like,

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
hey, you got pancakes?

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
Because I would love to get into one of those bad boys.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
I don't think I've ever made exactly the right number of pancakes.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
That's bad.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
You always have a couple of crusty boys that sit out on the plate,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
and then maybe around two in the afternoon, you're like,

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
well, you're still here, huh?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Let's see what you got.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
And then you're like, ah, this was a mistake, and I'll throw these away.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh, everybody loves room-temperature cold pancakes.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Mm-mm.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
But Mom used to make the kind that had apples and cinnamon in them,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
and those were extremely edible.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And they got a good and powerful stink to them,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and you're going to smell those and need them.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I need these.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
The problem that I would have if someone did this would be this.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I would say, okay, yeah, no problem.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I'll go get some pancakes for you.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
And then I would think like, okay, so do I put them in a Ziploc bag,

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
or do I wrap them in a paper towel, or should I syrup them?

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Just toss them loose in a grocery bag?

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
Should I syrup them on a paper plate, and then do I have to give them paper?

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
If I give them glass and plate and silverware,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
are they going to stay on my porch and eat them?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I would be paralyzed.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
They would have to come in, and I would just say,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I'm going to lock myself in the closet.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Take whatever you need.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Take whatever, my fucking plasma screen, my laptop.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Just do whatever you need.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I think what everyone should start doing is,

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
much like if you're going to throw a big, loud party,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
and you go around your neighbors, and you're like,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
hey, I'm going to have a big, loud party, feel free to stop by.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
If we get too loud, please give me a call before you call.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I think you should do that with everything.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Like, hey, I'm going to make some pancakes.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Feel free to stop by.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
If it smells too loud, please don't call the police.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And like, hey, I'm going to be playing some Overwatch.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
You'll hear me yelling because I got fucking frozen again.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
And please don't call the police about my freezing.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
But if you want to come over, and you want to do some LAN, that's fine.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
What if there's an alternate reality to our own,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
where somebody knocks on their door and is like,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
can you please turn down the smell of those pancakes?

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
My family and I are just trying to watch our veggie tales,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and we're having a really hard time doing so,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
because the stink is just so powerful.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
My cheat day is tomorrow, and you're killing me.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
I have a true life neighbor anxiety tale,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
a horrifying true story, if you guys want to hear it.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Yeah.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
We've never talked about our anxieties before on this show,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
so this will be an exciting segment maybe.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
My neighbor who lives across the street is a very pleasant older woman

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
who seems to always be on her porch smoking.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
She comes over and knocks on the door at 8 p.m. a few nights ago,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
and says that her phone has stopped working

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
because she shares it with her family,

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
and she needs to make a call to Nate to ask him to recharge her boost mobile phone.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
This is exactly how she puts it to me, by the way.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
And here is where it gets terrifying.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I say, sure, fine, that's no problem,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
but my daughter has just gone to sleep,

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
and the front door is about four feet from her bedroom.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
So if I hand this woman my phone and close the door,

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
then she will have to take some baby waking action

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
to alert me that her audio transaction with Nate

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
and the refilling of the boost has taken place.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
So without even thinking, I hand her my phone and then realize

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
I am trapped on the front porch standing here

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
while this woman talks to Nate and tries to explain the boost mobile situation.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
And she is repeatedly telling Nate that it's telling her

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
she needs to find a place to charge her boost mobile phone

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
and download this app that tells her where the boost mobile hotspots are

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
to recharge the phone.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
And this is all far, far beyond this blessed woman's capabilities,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
technologically speaking.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
This is all Greek to her,

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
and I'm just standing here for the whole conversation

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
while she talks to Nate.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
And I was sitting there trying to think like,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
what do people do?

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
What do people do when they just stand in a place

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
and listen to a conversation?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
What have I ever done? I've never done this before.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
I should get on my, oh God, she has my phone.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I can't even look at my phone.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I started like looking at the plants.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah, I was about to say you started gardening.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
I did. I started like, these have some holes.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I'm a gardener now.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I'm so uncomfortable that I became a gardener.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I take care of these plants.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
This got so bad, guys, that I actually like opened the door

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
and grabbed the first thing that I could reach

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
because I didn't want to risk her ending the conversation

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
and yelling because she doesn't give a shit.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
She'll wake a baby up.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And I grabbed the first thing I could,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
which was one of Sydney's medical journals.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Oh my God, Justin.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
I just stood there on the porch perusing like cool new rations

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
that people have just found out about

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
while this woman tries to explain the situation to Nate.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And eventually she thanked me profusely

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and went back to her home.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
But it was probably the most terrifying

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
two and a half minutes of my life.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
This Nate sounds like a real techno wizard.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I would love to get him over here to look at my printer.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It's been acting up lately.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Your new printer?

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Yeah, I can't download any pictures of my nieces and nephews anymore

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
because I ran out of space.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
That's so weird because all printers always work

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
and are great.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
So it's so strange to hear about somebody having problems

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
with a printer.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And their print juice is so cheap.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
So cheap to get the print juice.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
McDonald's doesn't exist.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Hey, should we go to the money zone?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I mean in our world money doesn't...

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
We're going to need some more clamshells and shiny stones

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
to pay for things.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Yeah, clamshells and shiny stones.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Let's go to the bartering post.

29:53.000 --> 30:05.000
I would like you boys to imagine

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
a box.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And this box glows.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And you can put different pictures

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
in this box.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
And then other people can go to these pictures

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
and using some kind of controller

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
they can access these pictures

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and actually do things with them.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I've just now invented this

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
and I'm calling it a website.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Okay.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Now imagine you want to make your own website.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Right?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I mean I just learned that this thing existed.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Can you give me time to process this concept

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
before I jump into it?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
No.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
What I'm thinking is they're all connected to each other

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
like a big web.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
But there are no spiders

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
in this scenario.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Where's the fucking web come from, genius?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
You are the spider.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Oh, I hate it.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So I'm Spider-Man?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
You're Spider-Man.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Oh, that's a good idea.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Somebody write that down.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Spider-Man.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
We'll circle back to that.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But so all of these websites are connected.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And I know what you're thinking.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's got to be hard to make my own.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
No, no, no.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I'm going to partner.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I'm going to take pictures

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and they tell you to poke them a bunch.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I think, and it's called Squarespace

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
because that's the shape of the store.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
It's just a Squarespace.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I'm going to talk with them

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
about taking their pictures

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
and putting them in these websites.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
And I think they'll be able to provide

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
award-winning 24-7 customer support.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
There's never going to be anything

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
to install, patch, or upgrade.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And I don't know what that means.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
But they already have award-winning templates

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
and they have that one platform that you stand on

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that's an all-in-one platform.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
And I think it's going to offer

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
a unique domain experience.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That's what we're going to call the name

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
you call your website.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It's fully transparent, easy to set up.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
And so I'm going to talk with them

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
about making a deal that's a free trial

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
and 10% off your first purchase

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
by visiting squarespace.com.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
And.com is going to be...

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah, what's.com?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
So I'm calling the box a com box.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I'm calling the box a com box.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Oh, okay.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Because you communicate to each other with it.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
So squarespace.com

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
slash my brother.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
So once we get that up and running,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
free trial, 10% off your first purchase,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
squarespace.com slash my brother.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
This electric web

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
sounds like a really efficient way

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
to send and receive pornography.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Exactly. You won't have to go

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
and buy it at the corner store anymore.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
At your old mom and pop pornography store.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Where they

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
send them in data globes.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Now, you guys

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
know I love

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
eating rocks.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Any type of rock, sandstone,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
slurry,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
limestone, pie, all kinds

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
of rocks. Well, you're only sloomin'.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Yeah, well,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
imagine a world where agriculture

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
was possible.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
If the sun shone, this is silly,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
we're getting into some

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Twilight Zone territory, but

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
imagine a world in which the sun shone

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
most of the day.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And agriculture was possible.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Well, we don't burn off the face of the earth.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah, I don't understand if the sun

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
doesn't make any sense.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
This would be so exciting,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
how exciting would it be to just eat

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
as many beans as I wanted to?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Just all day beans.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Instead of just one bean every 100 years.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Well, in this reality,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
our skin wouldn't be translucent.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And our eyes would not be

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
18 inches in diameter.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
How would we examine our own organs to make sure

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
we're healthy?

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Listen, it's just a fantasy, Travis. You don't have to pick everything apart.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Okay?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
So, in this world,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
imagine you could just send the

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
vegetables and I guess there would be

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
creatures that would eat the vegetables

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
that we could kill for fuel.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And to feel alive.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And to feel alive and horny.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And we could put all those parts

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
and let's call them

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
vegetables and stuff

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
into a box and send it to people.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And that's what this imaginary service

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
that I just invented called Blue Apron.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
And it would cost less than $10,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
which is roughly 30 clamshells

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
per person, per meal.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
And Blue Apron would deliver seasonal recipes.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I have no

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
reference for that.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Along with pre-proportioned ingredients

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
to make delicious, home-cooked meals.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Justin, can I ask you a quick question?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
What is blue?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
There's a lot.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
There's actually too much lore,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
so let me just kind of get through

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
the main thing.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And there's like a codex you can go and check out

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
on a Combox if you want to.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I'm just going to imagine some foods

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
right now.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I'm spitballing here.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I'm spitting on here.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Um...

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Garvalax

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
with

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
flown flame.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
No, that's nothing.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Grimbulon with

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
uh...

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Pumsel juice.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Is there rocks in all these, though?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Because that's what confuses me now.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
There's no rocks, because we wouldn't need rocks.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Basil pesto chicken. That sounds good.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
That sounds like a real thing.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Vegetable panzanella.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Salted shrimp.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Salted shrimp and green beans

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
with globe tomatoes, spinach,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
and orzo pasta.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Again, there is

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
going to be sort of a novella

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
prelude to this

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
story that will explain a lot of the concepts.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
But you can see,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
if you want to see...

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I've set up an ARG for this

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
thing if you want to check out this fantasy story.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
An actual reality game, of course.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
An actual reality game.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Three meals for free with free shipping

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
by going to blueapron.com

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
slash my brother.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And you will love how good to read

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
about it feels and tastes

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
to create incredible home-cooked meals

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
with Blue Apron. So don't wait.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
That's blueapron.com

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
slash my brother.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Rocks not included.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Box not included.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Blue Apron is a better way to cook.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Um, I just went

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
to the corner shop and I got myself

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
a Combox and I plugged it into

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
my Vision Cube

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
so I can receive and send messages

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
and I did grab just a few

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
pornographies from the store also.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
But you have to. At those prices?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And so here's some

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
messages that have come through. Here's one

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
for Joe and it's from Emily who says

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Grab a glass of your finest

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
whiskey. Cheers to our 17 year

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
friendship and the podcast

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
that has kept us in touch for the last six.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Podcast. Podcast.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
This may not be for us. Remember in 2010

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
when the McElroys advised you

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
to give your girlfriend half

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
a dog? Glad it ended with a

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
marriage to your beautiful wife, Jenny.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Here is to making more

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
memories. Bim bam or otherwise.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
That's terrible advice.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Yeah, I don't know.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I don't remember saying that.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Which is the weird thing, but I guess 2010 was

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
a long time ago. We've all been through a lot

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
since then.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And we haven't existed for 17 years.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
What are they talking about?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Now that's a weird thing to say.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Can you back that up?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
No. Here's another message that I

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
just got in the Vision Cube. Oh, God.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Fuck. It's so hot. It burned

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
all my tentacles real bad on it. But that's

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
what happens when the messages come through. Here's one

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
for Bess. My totally kick

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
a little sister.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Although I read it at first as my totally

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
kick a little sister. I don't

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
want. No. It's from

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Tori, the bestiest

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
big sister ever, who says

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I wanted to get our favorite

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
brothers to send you a non-celebration

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
related greeting. Also, to publicly

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
point out that yes,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
I could have blocked, but

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
when I have no lightsaber training

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
and you went to

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
college, maybe you

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
should not start with a slash to my face.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Wait, what happened?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I could have blocked, but when

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I have no lightsaber training and you

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
went to in college,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
maybe you should not start with a slash to my face.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And yes, most

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
still beautiful even with my roguish

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
cauterized wound.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Okay, so it sounds like they were

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
just having a fun lightsaber fight as

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
we all do from time to time.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Maybe things got a little

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
bit too real. They weren't using the training

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
sabers. And

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
this can happen. This is such a common

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
thing. I wish people would exercise a little bit

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
more caution when they're sparring.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Mugs, shirts,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
stickers, patches, tanks, and

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
more are yours for the purchasing at

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
MaxFunStore.com. Hey,

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
you already love the podcasts, so why not

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
take this to the next level and

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
outfit your home and bod with our

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
merch? MaxFunStore.com.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Because if you have to wear a shirt,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
it should be one of ours.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Recently, I have been

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
smoking pot with my dad. Totally normal.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
We shared some kick-ass

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
times together, but I became too

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
greedy. I would sneak out

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
to enjoy a joint every couple days, but he

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
started to notice. Now he

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
smokes alone. Oh, man.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
And the cat's in the cradle in the

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
silver spoon. That's a beautiful

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
song, Travis. I know, I just made it up.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Yeah, you should make up the rest of it.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Little boy blue with the man

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
and the moon. Now, I don't know what a moon

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
is. Yeah.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Or blue animal. When you coming

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
home, Dad, I'm Spider-Man.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I'm just trying to work him in.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Kind of a transmedia character. I love to

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
eat non-rock food.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
This is getting very

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
dark side of the moon. There's a lot of fantasy

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
elements. Now, what's the

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
moon and why does it have a bright side and a dark

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
side? I don't understand.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
How does Dylan

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
make it up to their dad?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Well, weed is

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
everywhere. Yeah.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
You can go get weed at the corner store.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Now, I'm just sad.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
This is...

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't understand why this would hurt your

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
daddy's feelings. You just had a couple

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
little sneaky

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
doobers.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
As a bonding activity,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
that's the only way I could read it.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It's like, aw, doobers are our

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
thing. You can't do doobers by

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
yourself. Maybe, Dane,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
maybe

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Pops has been buying all the

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
doobers. Oh, no.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
This is like, we'll

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
doober together, but I don't want you

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
doobering by yourself. I will doober together

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
because I'm a responsible

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
dad. Then, you got

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
greedy and you snuck some doobers. I was like,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
now you're grounded from doobers.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Yeah. If you blaze it

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
once with your dad, I think

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
that would put a lot of this behind you.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
When I doob up, the last

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
thing I want to do is hold any

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
grudges. I just want to bliss out

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and listen to

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Greg Matthew's band.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
You just need some social

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
doobercant that's going to smooth

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
everything right over.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I mean, you could

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
there's so many ways to make things

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
up to a dad, isn't there?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Making a

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
sweet post on Facebook with a picture

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
of the two of you. What now?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Posting a sweet picture

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
on the front of your house

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
of the two of you. Just like, I love

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
this dad. Then, people

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
will come by and see it. I think he'd really appreciate

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
that. Maybe

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
get him a nice Squall Lark card

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
that says, number one dad,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
best to doob with, 24-7,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
420, blaze it. Nice.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
What if he's one of those

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
grudge dads, though, where you buy a big

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
bag of pot for you to share. You're halfway

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
through. You're just ripping through it.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
It just takes a huge

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
rip. He's like,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
this changes nothing.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
It's like, well, great.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Now, this is just perfect.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I haven't fixed anything, and all my good

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
pot is gone.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Hmm. Maybe

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
one free back rub.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Back rub coupons. Very

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
smart. I wish I had

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
more here.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I don't know what to say.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Maybe just apologize?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Apologizing's good.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
That's good.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I don't know why we didn't think about that

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
first, because everybody always

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
says so directly how they're feeling.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
You know what I mean?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Hey, dad. I'm sorry I snuck doobers

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
when doobers are supposed to be our thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
You know, I'm

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
impulsive, and I'm

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
so sorry. Let's doober together.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
What if you got a new thing

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
with your dad, and you started doing

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
huge lines of coke? No,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
stop. It's no longer the thing

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
you do with your dad. The thing you do with your dad

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
is coke. Or, like, most dangerous

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
game. Okay,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
you hunt people for sport?

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
That's your thing with your dad? Yeah, with your dad.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
You know, just dad stuff.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Just dad

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
stuff! You know, you laugh,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
but we already do that

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
with Fish.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
So, you know.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
To be fair, in many ways,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Fish are the least dangerous game.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Not piranhas. Hey,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
you can take a couple tickets,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
get a couple hot dogs

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
and take them to a game

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
of our national...

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
rock dogs, and then you take them to

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
our national pastime

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Um...

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Hey, I've got a

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Yahoo here. It's sent in by Seth

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Carlson, the delivery man. Thank you,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Seth. It's a Yahoo Answers

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
user, Robby

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Raffel, who says,

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
on IMDB,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
why was Kevin James' height changed

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
from five foot eight to five foot

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
nine and a half?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
He got taller.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
He got taller.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
He had a growth spurt.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I don't know what to tell you.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I mean, I'm confused by this because

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
obviously Kevin James is six foot eleven.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Yeah.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
The premier rock ball player.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Let's just pretend, though,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
just for a laugh, that

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
this is all legit.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It's kind of alternate.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Give me percentage odds

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
that this was

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Kevin, who stepped in and said,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I can fix this.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Let me fix this. I gotta boost this.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
People are fucking telling tales

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
out of school about my size,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
and I'm the only one who can do something about this.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm five foot nine and one half

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
of one inch.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
We all know

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
that Kevin James is the most

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
powerful man on our dark

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
planet. Yeah.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm pretty sure that if he wanted to,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
he could just change how much

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
an inch is.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
You know what I mean?

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Now it's 1.1 inches.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
You know? Or like

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
.8 inches. Whatever the math works out to.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I don't know. I didn't go to math school.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Then suddenly

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
he is taller.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Just because of how an inch works.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
This is nice.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I think this would be neat if

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Kevin would do this for all of us.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Because then we'd all be just a little

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
bit taller. That's true.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
You know, if I

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
convince a bunch of rich people who had

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
presumably seen Paul Blart Mall Cop 1

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
to make Paul Blart Mall Cop 2,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I would probably stand a little taller myself.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And 3 and 4 and 5

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
and 6. And 6.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And Hitch 1 through 15.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And Paul Blart Mall Cop

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Nights. And Paul Blart Mall Cop Origins.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And the animated series.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
And the Blart the Furious.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
And the Blart Files with his daughter.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
All of them. And here comes the boom.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And there went the boom.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
The sequel that I loved so much.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Has anyone seen the boom?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I got the boom. Was the new one.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Which way did the boom go?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
The new boom kid. Which was about

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
his daughter from Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
getting into MMA. Which is weird.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
The death of the boom which was

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
many thought the end of the series.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
But then the boom comes again.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Which in many ways I thought

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
was even better than the original.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
And boom for 2 where he cloned himself.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I thought that one was a new high point.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Guy Ritchie really outdid himself.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Here's another question.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I'm in high school and a lot of kids at my school

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
don't lock their lockers when they leave to go to class.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
There hasn't been an issue

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
before but recently someone's been going through people's lockers

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
and stealing an item or two.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
This happened to me and I decided to go to the school office

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
to check the lost and found.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I asked if they had seen an iPod to which as if on cue

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
my school principal came around the corner

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
very dramatically and handed it to me and said

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
next time lock your locker.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
What?

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Excuse me? What?

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
From the clues I could gather I think the principal

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
was trying to teach the kids a lesson?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
How do I tell him that he's making an issue

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
that isn't there? Is it okay for him to do so?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Nora from Victoria.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
That's wild.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
That's a criminal

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
crime maybe?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Do principals have immunity?

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Can they just steal and steal

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
and steal and it's like it's cool

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I'm the president of school?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I don't think that's

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
how it works at all.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
That's definitely bonkers.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Call me old but it's also

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
weird to me that you're keeping

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
things. If I just had books

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
in my locker I don't think I'd worry about it.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
If you're keeping electronics and

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
personal stuff in your locker

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
why aren't you locking it?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
You know what? I went to high school

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
in the early 2000s

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I locked my locker then

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
and are you under the

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
impression that things have gotten better everybody?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Are we under the impression

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
that it's way better to leave

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
your locker unlocked now?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Let's stop shitting because

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
obviously this is some sort of

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
utopian society

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
where theft doesn't exist

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
and so this principal

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
is trying to introduce the concept

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
of theft to this

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
society. It's wild to me.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That's so

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
the next time. And he just steals

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
and he opens it and he steals.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
He's like a reverse Robin Hood.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Do you think he dresses like a teen?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
This would be my big question

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
is if he's gonna go in for this

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
is he gonna like put on

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Justin remind yourself later

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
go find out what teens wear

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and then edit it into your file before you send it to

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Griffin. And

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
he's wearing

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
and then

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
he's trying to hide his identity

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
so the kids are like I don't know I saw

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
a really normal looking teenager

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
open the locker and run away with

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
your iPod and he definitely wasn't the principal.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
All I know is like

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
how is there not one

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
bully who's just like

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
alright cool and just like

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
walks the halls just like

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
how

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
statistically is there not

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
just one kid who's like cool

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
you got it. There is and they call

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
him Mr. Jeremiah the principal

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
of the school

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
because all bullies have to grow up

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
and go somewhere. He did not

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
he did not track this question

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
ask her down. He did not track Nora down

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
and say hey got your iPod.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
He is just hoarding

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
this stuff until they notice it's gone.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
There is no way he is going

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
to return all these items to their proper owners.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Not going to happen. And

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
although it would be a pretty

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
amazing end of your assembly

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
where if he was like alright

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Victoria pull back the curtain

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
and she opens the curtain and is like look

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
this is my it's the greatest crime

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
of the century.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
You open a closet in Mr. Jeremiah's

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
office and just a wave of

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
fidget spinners comes pouring out.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Why do you leave your

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
iPod in your. Just sitting on a throne of

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Pokemon cards.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Why do you leave your iPod in your locker I want to

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
know it's to listen to the good

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
portable entertainment device.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Do you not have backpacks?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
How is your iPod the thing that's weighing you down

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
like oh I just can't stand to have

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
this six ounces in here.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I can't remember high school. You guys

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I honestly just had

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
the thought did I have a backpack in high school

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and did I carry it to classrooms or did I

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
put it in my locker? Where did my lunch go?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I'll never I don't remember

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
in high school. I do remember middle school because

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I had a the Wiz. Guys remember the

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Wiz? Yeah I had a leather

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
passenger bag because I had

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
so many friends.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
The weirdest thing about

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
the fact that I had the Wiz

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
is that I don't anymore.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
So that means there was

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
a period at which I was like

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
this backpack is a locker

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and I don't need it.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I cannot imagine that happening in my day to day life.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I'm sorry I must have been confused

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
because you kept saying the Wiz and I

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
thought you meant the musical.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
No I just googled what the Wiz was

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
and that's a good backpack

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
juice. It looks very spacious and

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
rectangular. It was a

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
rectangular backpack that had a

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
built in shelf and was basically

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
a portable locker that you carried

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
on your back.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Oh shit. Yeah I know.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
It was the Wiz locker backpack

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and I had one of those and I don't

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
anymore and that's very strange to me.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I'm looking at the Wiz on my

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
cube right now my com box

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
and this one just is

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
pitch black and across

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
one of the surfaces it just says

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Batman on it.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Which is very cool.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Would love one

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
of these. Now I'm looking at one that

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
has Wiz Khalifa on it

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
and that's just funny.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That's pretty good.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
You think this is a real grab bag situation if everybody

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
goes to the principal and is like

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I lost my keys

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
to a Hyundai Sonata

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
and he's like alright here it is

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and like tight I got a Hyundai Sonata

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
now. That would be

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
a really epic rewards program

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
if it's like oh you got straight A's

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
you can come into my theft closet

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
and choose any one thing.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
This is how they inspire

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
students to sell candy

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
bars.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Sell the most candy bars and you can have

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
his shoes.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Alright. Well that's gonna

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
do it for us folks.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Thank you so much for enjoying our program

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
today. Presumably you enjoyed it.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I hope you made it this far enjoying it.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Everyone has always

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
loved our show. We've never done a bad one.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
We've never done a bad show.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
That's a great point Travis.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I hope everyone made the most of the sun time.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
know I got out there and got a base tan

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
for 50 years from now when it happens

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
again I'm pretty excited about.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Thank you to John

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Roderick and the short winners for the

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
use of our theme song. It's a departure off the

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
album Putting the Days to Sleep

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
and

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
it's a good song and I hope you enjoyed it at the beginning

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
and end of our program. We also

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
want to say thank you to minimumfun.org

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
for

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
all their

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
shows are bad and you shouldn't

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
listen to them. Now it's

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
kind of getting a little bizarre.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's hard to parse that

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
one. Ah fuck.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I just fucking realized

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
because I was locked in the closet

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
by those awful children that

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I didn't have time to charge my

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
calculator.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
And now my calculator is

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I can't do any math for 50

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
years. Ah fuck.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Ah beans

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
whatever those are.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
We're going to be doing

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
some shows in the near

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
future. We

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
October

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
20th through the 22nd we're going

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
to be in Atlanta and Nashville

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
and there are still some seats for those

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
because they're very large venues

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
and we hope you'll come out and join us

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
for those shows and then November

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
18th and 19th we're going to be

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
in Minneapolis and Milwaukee.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Minneapolis is almost sold out.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Milwaukee is not anywhere close

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
so we're not very popular in Milwaukee but

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
please. It's because somebody

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
tweeted us it's because the Packers are playing a home game that day

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
and.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
It's not my fucking fault.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Well no it's Jordan Rodgers beautiful arms fault

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
but

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
maybe we can just skip the show and go.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Maybe we can take a rain check

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
and just go to the big football game.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Also hey everyone.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
There's a chance Aaron Rodgers

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
will be at our show.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
You can't say that.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Well I mean there's a chance anything will happen Griffin.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
But legally I think FCC is going to get us there.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
He could be on a scavenger hunt

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
that leads to our show.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
He could have accidentally skateboarded the wrong way

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
instead of skateboarding to the arena.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
By the way

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
when I said Packers I was of course

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
referring to the Card Packers

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
the Yu-Gi-Oh! team.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Thank you.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Also if you are going to be

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
at our upcoming shows in September

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
be sure to send in questions

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
whatever any of that jargon means.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I think that's it.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Yeah.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Here's a final Yahoo!

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
sent in by Seth Carlson and The Deliver Man.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Thank you for the new delivery.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Yahoo! answers user CuteCuriosity

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
who says this was not really funny

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
as much as it is eye-opening.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And the website crashed.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
This is weird. It's the first time the website crashed.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
It's usually such a good fucking website.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
If Buzz Lightyear

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
truly believed he was not a toy

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
then why does he freeze

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
when humans are around?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
My name is Justin McElroy.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I'm Uncle Dane.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Keep it silly, y'all.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

55:41.000 --> 55:59.000
You kissed your dad square on the cheek.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Do you want to learn weird new facts?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Do you like hearing successful, creative women

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
talk about their poop?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Do you want the scoop on Martha Stewart's pony?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
If you answered yes to any of these questions

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
our show is for you.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
We interview people like Paul F. Tompkins,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Kristen Schaal, Michael Che, and more.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
So check us out on Maximum Fun.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
And let us mess up your brain.

56:31.000 --> 56:41.000
We know everything.
