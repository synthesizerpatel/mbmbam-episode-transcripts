WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
It's better it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
Better it's better

01:10.820 --> 01:14.580
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother

01:14.580 --> 01:21.680
And me and if I show for the modern era, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middles brother Travis

01:22.100 --> 01:26.180
executing program a big dog a wolf wolf McElroy and

01:26.820 --> 01:33.560
Hey, what's up? This is Griffin. Oh, oh, sorry guys. My butt cheeks servos just became desynchronized. Oh, no

01:34.180 --> 01:36.820
It's that time of year though, isn't it? It is. Oh

01:37.580 --> 01:40.880
Well, welcome to our podcast for cyber Monday

01:40.880 --> 01:47.120
Sorry, I transformed my hand into a can opener which

01:47.680 --> 01:51.160
Monday, I feel like I could have done. I should have spent more crads on my deck

01:52.480 --> 01:57.800
Yeah, I'm regretting it also kind of sound like you weren't in control of the transformation like it kind of happened

01:58.520 --> 02:02.960
Yeah, you gotta get that looked at also. I thought you had a fucking thermoblade on there. Yeah

02:04.040 --> 02:05.480
combo it's a

02:05.480 --> 02:10.960
Thermoblade combo can opener so it opens cans with the thermoblade is what you're telling me

02:11.120 --> 02:14.800
It's basically a thermoblade which I learned I can open cans with yeah

02:14.800 --> 02:19.000
I'm sorry guys is just tough to get comfortable with my butt cheeks moving in opposite directions

02:19.040 --> 02:24.240
Why did you do that? Well, cuz he wanted to be able to clap them. Yeah well without standing up

02:24.480 --> 02:27.720
Yeah, so when I did my stand up you guys remember back in 30

02:28.360 --> 02:32.180
31 and you know, nobody really liked it

02:32.180 --> 02:36.320
But then I was like I could become the guy who could literally make his butt cheeks. Oh fuck. Sorry guys

02:37.680 --> 02:39.760
This sucks. I gotta go get these tuned up

02:39.840 --> 02:45.680
So this is our cyber Monday episode where we're talking about all the different ice that we're gonna be cracking through

02:46.480 --> 02:49.680
And the the different decks that we're using. Hey Trev. Yeah

02:50.560 --> 02:52.560
Tell me about your deck. Oh

02:52.560 --> 02:57.240
That's a very personal question Justin. No, don't come on don't get sloppy

02:57.240 --> 03:02.280
I just want to know about your deck that you used to break through the ice Mike for cyber Monday Mike tank

03:02.280 --> 03:04.280
And I used to break through the ice

03:04.760 --> 03:09.840
Yes, I feel like this is a reference when you're chipping when you're chipping in. Yeah, okay

03:09.840 --> 03:13.120
Yeah, and you're gonna you're gonna do battle with the corpos. Uh-huh

03:13.920 --> 03:20.000
Tell me about your deck you fucking nasty boy. Oh, I see this is about like a hacker thing

03:20.520 --> 03:23.480
It's cyber Monday, baby. This is the day that we celebrate

03:23.480 --> 03:28.840
All all of us deck heads get together and and celebrate just netrunner culture

03:28.840 --> 03:32.320
Well, this is this is actually kind of embarrassing quiz. I'm actually one of the corpos

03:34.640 --> 03:38.560
Shit I kind of bought into the whole big big business thing a while ago

03:39.720 --> 03:44.760
And I've been I've been selling microchips a huge markup

03:45.200 --> 03:49.320
We just started working on I probably shouldn't share this but we just started working on macro chips

03:49.320 --> 03:54.680
Which are like microchips, but they're way bigger and they're more expensive to build

03:54.680 --> 03:57.920
But they're a lot easier to work on because you can like see the things

03:58.560 --> 04:04.040
So that's like that. That's just a big set. Hey if you're interested Griffin, I could get you a position here

04:05.440 --> 04:10.200
At chippies Inc. This is big. Yeah, that's good Griffin get your corner office

04:10.200 --> 04:18.880
Do something I'm starting to think Travis maybe has never experienced the new wave or the next wave dream dream life or cyberpunk

04:19.160 --> 04:21.160
Any of the ways? Well, I do

04:22.000 --> 04:26.800
I'd rather be zeroed that becomes some sort of nitpick Corpo. Yeah for sure

04:26.800 --> 04:29.840
I got a new car and it flies which is pretty cool

04:30.720 --> 04:32.720
Do you guys have a flying car?

04:32.720 --> 04:39.920
No, I traded in all my kibble cards for a few spare eddies so I could upgrade my my

04:41.360 --> 04:43.760
Input. Well, they just gave me a 402 K

04:46.320 --> 04:50.320
That sounds pretty good though, it is I would like some money to tune up my

04:51.000 --> 04:54.200
Wheelies and your but your wheelies, but they come out of my feet

04:55.400 --> 04:58.240
My actual heels. They actually that's actually an included benefit

04:58.240 --> 05:02.680
At should be bank is they just like give you they tune up your wheelies

05:02.680 --> 05:07.280
That sounds good because they keep the wheelies guy when he installs them right into my heels. Yeah

05:07.720 --> 05:10.800
He's like now remember Griffin. I don't want to have to keep telling you this

05:11.640 --> 05:17.960
But you can't use these on the beach and I'm like, yeah, dude, whatever as I smoke my cool future cigarette

05:17.960 --> 05:23.560
Oh, you don't have I have the wheelies with like the extra wide tread so you can use them on the beach

05:24.280 --> 05:26.280
I'm about to skunk you Corpo

05:26.280 --> 05:27.800
I

05:27.800 --> 05:32.280
I'm sorry. What what's that mean? Exactly? Is that good thing? It means it means Corpo pig

05:32.280 --> 05:35.920
Fuck, you know, I got that but the but the sky are you gonna kill me?

05:36.360 --> 05:40.800
Why have you never done a futuristic adventure zone? We're so good at this

05:41.440 --> 05:45.560
Well me and you are about to scuzz this Corpo. I'm sorry

05:45.560 --> 05:52.480
But why do you assume that a hacker a criminal will be the hero in the story where I'm making microchips that people need

05:52.480 --> 05:59.960
For business. Why am I the bad guy dude, dude, you used up all the fresh water and now we have to drink salt water

05:59.960 --> 06:02.720
That's not true. I didn't not me

06:02.720 --> 06:08.680
I'm trying I'm making microchips and macro chips so that we can build new water processing unit

06:08.680 --> 06:12.920
I'm about to fucking skank this Corp pig fuck but like

06:14.200 --> 06:19.800
Provides 90% of the macro chips for water processing so we can get our clean water back. Why are you hacking us?

06:19.800 --> 06:26.360
I'm gonna scuzz this money bag fuck. I don't think you guys are the good guys. I think I'm the good guy

06:28.560 --> 06:30.640
Eat virus scuzz bag

06:30.640 --> 06:36.560
We give back in a lot of ways we we provide a lot of funds to the local food banks

06:37.060 --> 06:44.440
Yeah, right. We know we do making us all eat fucking algae for every meal everybody eats algae. It's all we've got

06:44.440 --> 06:50.880
Yeah, and whose fault is that because you desalinated all the water, but that was 200 years ago. It's not my fault

06:51.040 --> 06:53.820
I'm about to shrimp this fucking pork bag

06:54.840 --> 07:00.600
Yeah, I'm all dwarfed out right now. Do it right now. Hey, hey, I feel like can I just say and I know that maybe

07:00.600 --> 07:04.020
I'm a corporate but kind of feels like you guys are making up a lot of this slang as you go

07:04.360 --> 07:11.400
No, this is all this is okay. Well, then just real quick. Hey, we grew up in this we're fucking we grew up in the street

07:11.400 --> 07:14.760
I'm your brother and I know that's not true. And I grew up in the Metro

07:14.760 --> 07:19.240
I'm gonna count down three two one go and I want you and Griffin to at the same time

07:19.240 --> 07:21.240
Tell me what Dorf means

07:22.440 --> 07:24.440
Okay, three two one go

07:25.480 --> 07:31.160
Synthetic endorsement. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. No, I agree. No, I agree with you

07:31.160 --> 07:35.480
I knew Justin was gonna say that because we're cyberlinked through the netwave. Yes

07:36.040 --> 07:40.640
And this is embarrassing. I was like we did not want to tell you this because we knew that you would get jealous

07:40.640 --> 07:43.320
But now that you're a scuzzy Corpo pig fuck, uh-huh

07:43.320 --> 07:49.040
It's we can't let you in on like our attacks that we're gonna do on your ice. Well, that's actually okay

07:49.040 --> 07:53.800
Yeah, no, I get my eyes after us. Yeah, we don't want any console samurais trying to fucking scuzz us

07:55.120 --> 07:57.120
How do you guys know about the samurais?

07:58.640 --> 08:03.620
Because we're not fucking that pig Corpo Jerko dirt brain dead shrimp

08:04.760 --> 08:06.200
idiots

08:06.200 --> 08:08.200
idiots

08:08.200 --> 08:11.880
My work is recently found an alligator in our parking lot

08:13.680 --> 08:15.680
We named her Georgie

08:17.120 --> 08:21.440
She's currently stuck in a clogged storm drain you have dealt with the situation

08:22.800 --> 08:25.320
Poorly already, right? Like no

08:26.440 --> 08:33.680
Nature has dealt with it. It doesn't sound like anybody put Georgie in the clog star drain. Nobody puts Georgie in the store

08:33.680 --> 08:37.960
My boss who is not a native Floridian is

08:38.360 --> 08:42.720
Determined to become the next Florida man by sticking his hands in the great to release the poor swamp cat

08:43.400 --> 08:48.120
Is that a thing so Florida man? It's like, you know, and it's a new story. It's like Florida man

08:48.680 --> 08:53.600
Eats, you know right case of Red Bull or whatever and then jump, you know

08:53.600 --> 08:58.440
I don't know through a plate glass window to eat a donut, you know stuff like that and a swamp cat is

08:58.440 --> 09:04.600
A gator, I guess I guess it's you can use context clues here. Yeah, let's go with that

09:04.600 --> 09:10.120
Yeah, I doubt that there is a gator and a swamp cat in this story late other kitty. Yeah

09:11.680 --> 09:15.880
Well that right there there's gator swamp cat they's always getting into scrapes

09:16.520 --> 09:22.160
How do I respectfully tell him not to be a dumbass, especially since he's the only one Georgie hisses at

09:22.560 --> 09:25.440
And that's from please don't pet or feed the swamp cats

09:25.440 --> 09:30.740
So apparently this Florida thing is like is being osmosis. Is that the deal? Is it being?

09:31.500 --> 09:35.980
It seeps in through the water or something that turns people into Florida man. Well, yes, obviously

09:37.060 --> 09:42.740
but I would say at this point when a human being says I'm gonna reach in there and

09:43.460 --> 09:45.540
grab that alligator I

09:46.180 --> 09:50.980
Think that they have momentarily forfeited their right to respect

09:50.980 --> 09:57.740
Yeah, and you can just say don't like I don't think you need to choose your words carefully at that point

09:57.740 --> 10:02.620
I think that you can just say like hey, wait, wait, stop stop stop stop stop. That's dumb

10:02.620 --> 10:07.280
I don't do that and I hate to play this card, but there is something

10:08.420 --> 10:09.980
like

10:09.980 --> 10:15.380
Extremely Darwinian about this or it's like if anybody ever has the thought that crosses their mind of yeah

10:15.380 --> 10:20.940
I'm gonna reach in that storm train that has a gator in it. I feel like they there's a lesson like

10:21.740 --> 10:27.020
You may talk them out of this one. But the next time they're like, oh that blimp is crashing

10:27.020 --> 10:31.360
Well, I'll just fly over there in a big kite and try and stop it and they will die

10:31.360 --> 10:32.980
They will die in that accident instead

10:32.980 --> 10:37.120
Like they need they need a little bit of encouragement to be to not do

10:37.560 --> 10:43.500
Terrible ideas like this because there's there's like animal control, but I'm also betting in Florida like

10:43.500 --> 10:45.020
private

10:45.020 --> 10:49.940
Businesses that handle this exact kind of thing. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, and

10:50.620 --> 10:56.980
I doubt that this is very much like a like well, listen, here's the secret anybody can do it

10:57.300 --> 11:04.180
Yeah, why pay 90 bucks to gator getters when you can just get the gator yourself because oh here

11:04.180 --> 11:08.720
Okay, ask your boss this let's say you reach in there and you get the gator

11:09.460 --> 11:10.980
Then what?

11:10.980 --> 11:14.980
Yeah, they're just gonna go right back in there. They found a hot dog, but they've been there's only one

11:14.980 --> 11:20.260
There's only one thing that happens next and that is you see your boss throw an alligator

11:20.260 --> 11:24.260
Yeah, I mean you're gonna see a man throw an alligator is what's gonna happen

11:24.500 --> 11:29.020
That's the best-case scenario Justin you are assuming that they will be able to fetch this gator

11:29.100 --> 11:34.580
No best-case scenario best-case scenario your boss fishes said gator out

11:34.940 --> 11:39.260
They lock eyes a forever bond is made. I love that

11:39.260 --> 11:44.260
Yeah, the gator. Yeah, like he's up onto its shoulder. Yeah, right on his shoulder

11:44.260 --> 11:50.300
I mean like a like Guapo in the new far cry now you got yourself a little gator companion

11:50.300 --> 11:54.220
Oh who's hanging out with you about the branded content Griffin? I told him

11:55.620 --> 12:01.940
Like they paid us to talk about them once a year and I just I wanted to knock it out here at the end

12:01.940 --> 12:07.220
You know what? I mean? I wish Sarah Davis was here. She would she would know what to do. Yeah. Yeah, Sarah Davis

12:07.220 --> 12:12.460
All right. Yeah, this is our social media manager. She's a native Floridian. I wonder what her her

12:12.500 --> 12:14.700
Let me see if I can channel her don't

12:15.340 --> 12:18.360
Yeah, this does this feel like one that

12:19.300 --> 12:25.580
People who know more about Florida and alligators are going to be mad at us for like it has that vibe doesn't it?

12:25.580 --> 12:31.900
Right where there's like a oh actually step-by-step every kid knows like this is what like we're taught this in second grade

12:31.900 --> 12:34.780
if you see a gator in the drain like this is what you do and

12:34.780 --> 12:37.840
And we're like whiffing it so hard. I

12:38.620 --> 12:42.300
Remember one trip to Florida when we were younger and we were staying with our nanny

12:43.020 --> 12:47.260
And she lived right next to this big golf course and just by like serendipity

12:47.980 --> 12:49.980
Earlier like in the trip

12:49.980 --> 12:50.980
She was like yet

12:50.980 --> 12:56.820
Don't fuck with gators because they can run up to 35 miles an hour on land and then like a few days later

12:56.820 --> 12:59.660
It looks crazy. It looks so fucking wild and then

12:59.660 --> 13:04.540
It looks like a snake that has suddenly sprung legs out of its body and I was like, I don't know how these work

13:04.540 --> 13:08.360
But here let's do this. He's excited and he like

13:09.380 --> 13:14.620
Dipped his snoot in some trucker speed earlier and he's trying to get away from his own new scary legs

13:14.860 --> 13:19.960
Yeah, but then we were walking on a golf course later in the trip and saw a gator like by

13:20.340 --> 13:25.260
You know a water hazard and we were like a decent distance from it and then I was like, oh, right

13:25.820 --> 13:27.540
Those things can run

13:27.540 --> 13:30.860
Three times faster than I can I am out of here. I turned walked away

13:30.860 --> 13:35.460
Can you imagine if I had not received that warning from my nanny and I was like, let's see how close we can get

13:35.460 --> 13:42.380
I wonder what it feels like or if you hadn't looked up from your Gameboy color at that very second to see the alligator

13:42.380 --> 13:44.380
You know what? I mean? Yeah. Yeah

13:44.380 --> 13:50.220
Do you ever think about it's weird if if Nani was like Griffin what piece of advice have I given you in your life?

13:50.220 --> 13:57.060
That's stuck with you the best in your entire life. What has been the most useful. Yeah wisdom. I've shared with you

13:57.060 --> 13:59.420
I mean, it was great when she taught me how to count cards

14:00.900 --> 14:04.780
But I would be dead if it weren't for the alligator warning the big end

14:04.780 --> 14:10.620
And plus counting cards has actually gotten you in a lot of trouble in Old Vegas. You know what I mean? Yeah, man

14:10.620 --> 14:11.860
I mean

14:11.860 --> 14:14.060
There are I mean a couple triad

14:14.820 --> 14:21.820
Communities that I am not welcome to anymore. Yeah, not even the quadrats want him at this point quadras don't want it

14:21.820 --> 14:29.460
Um, but yeah, I mean I did rack up several million dollars Nani one time when she wasn't prepared for our arrival one morning

14:29.460 --> 14:34.140
Taught us about our tummies don't know what time it is, which is when she gave us hot dogs for breakfast

14:34.140 --> 14:39.340
Yeah, I didn't even know you could have hot dogs for breakfast. Yeah, she opened her eyes to a lot of like dope shit

14:39.340 --> 14:41.540
I remember one time she took us on a weird

14:41.820 --> 14:47.460
Like kind of day trip around the area and a part of that involves going to like Bob Evans farm Evans farm

14:47.460 --> 14:54.380
It was great. But another part was just going to look at some dams and locks with like that was awesome. No execution plan though

14:54.380 --> 14:56.380
So it's just like here's a dam in a lock

14:56.460 --> 14:58.460
You wanted to see an execution

14:58.940 --> 15:00.980
Very dramatic setting for you. All right

15:02.380 --> 15:06.140
Sarah says the hottest take is to let them learn the hard way

15:06.260 --> 15:09.540
Thank you. If someone is determined to play with a gator then they go with God

15:10.020 --> 15:13.140
But there are better ways to become the Florida man for the day

15:13.140 --> 15:17.180
but this day has passed and we I actually on this one I

15:18.620 --> 15:23.500
Desperately. Yeah need a resolution on this. Please send a follow-up email. I need to know

15:24.140 --> 15:30.580
How this how this one all shook out only if it's not terrible, right? We won't read it if it's terrible

15:30.620 --> 15:33.460
Let's say well, I mean if something if something happened to the gator, right?

15:34.900 --> 15:38.580
Gators fine. Okay, because the gators just being the gator the gator

15:38.580 --> 15:45.220
This is the scorpion here and or yes, the gators the scorpion and your boss is the frog who's like

15:45.220 --> 15:46.340
I'll swim you across the water

15:46.340 --> 15:50.260
I'll fish you out of the drain if you promise not to bite me in the game like oh, yeah

15:50.260 --> 15:52.860
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you got it. You got it. You got it. You got it

15:54.340 --> 15:57.020
Hey, can we approach though the wizard and

15:58.020 --> 16:00.020
Is the wizard a gator?

16:00.580 --> 16:02.580
Let me check. Nah

16:03.420 --> 16:05.500
He's he's mostly human

16:05.500 --> 16:11.100
oh, and he's a lot he is actually and when I say cloud I am talking about the digital cloud because he is like

16:11.100 --> 16:16.800
It's like a daemon a daemon that exists sort of in the cyber oasis

16:16.860 --> 16:21.500
Yeah that we like to party yet and have like cool digi raves and stuff. We're

16:22.540 --> 16:27.140
We look at animated gifs that get you fucked up and everybody's just like ASL ASL

16:28.740 --> 16:32.140
But the side the wizard one a cyber one a cyber Monday

16:32.140 --> 16:37.740
Um, yeah, that's the only day you're legally allowed to make digital love at the oasis

16:38.380 --> 16:41.020
This one is sent in by Hannah. Thank you, Hannah

16:41.020 --> 16:45.660
It is a wiki how article that is titled how to react to to an ugly, baby

16:45.660 --> 16:51.020
Oh, no, you've just seen a picture of your friend's new baby. And well, they aren't the cutest baby you've ever seen

16:51.460 --> 16:55.340
Just say like stand by your convictions. They're they are not a good baby

16:56.060 --> 17:00.820
Now you have to figure out what to do and say to the new parents start by controlling your reaction and find something about

17:00.820 --> 17:06.300
The baby you can't compliment. Okay, you say oh, is that the new iPhone? Oh, boom. You're out of there, right?

17:06.300 --> 17:13.060
Yeah, about that iPhone and all the megapixels. Yeah, that's a that's a really good way to do the whole thing on one sort of

17:13.060 --> 17:18.780
Jump, but I would love to get a little bit more granular one. Don't say anything at all. Awesome

17:19.420 --> 17:21.420
What do you think of little?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.940
When you say nothing

17:24.460 --> 17:26.460
smile on my baby's face

17:26.460 --> 17:33.340
Face ain't appealing but at least it's not his little heart that you're stealing

17:34.060 --> 17:37.460
the truth is he has 14 eyes and

17:38.500 --> 17:40.500
17 years

17:41.700 --> 17:43.700
Say it best

17:44.620 --> 17:46.620
Is it oh, okay

17:46.620 --> 17:57.020
It's a bold. It's a bold both of this the recommendation of the song and wiki. How are a bold sort of no

17:57.020 --> 18:01.460
Say nothing. What do you think of little Douglas's beautiful face? Yeah, I can say

18:02.460 --> 18:06.420
It's not great for a podcast. Okay. What do you think of my baby?

18:06.420 --> 18:11.940
What's that a groan of satisfaction

18:13.940 --> 18:18.500
Okay, next step have a small talk ready. Hey, this is little Douglas. What do you think of his amazing face?

18:19.740 --> 18:21.740
Did you guys see?

18:21.940 --> 18:24.940
Kevin Hart last night on

18:25.980 --> 18:27.980
the television screen

18:28.500 --> 18:30.980
Yeah, but what do you think about little Douglas? He did a joke

18:30.980 --> 18:35.880
about his wild kitty cat

18:38.020 --> 18:41.860
What about just focus on the parents awesome, what do you think of little Douglas

18:42.420 --> 18:47.820
Wow, did you just get a haircut? I mean, what do you think about little Douglas that necklace is so chunky and beautiful

18:47.820 --> 18:50.780
I think you took a great photo. What about that? Oh

18:51.140 --> 18:54.620
Man, did you study photo composition in college?

18:54.620 --> 18:57.540
I think you took a great photo, what about that?

18:57.540 --> 19:01.300
Oh man, did you study photo composition in college?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.140
Oh, that's great.

19:02.140 --> 19:02.980
This is so good.

19:02.980 --> 19:05.860
Oh, rule of thirds, man, nice, nice, nice.

19:05.860 --> 19:09.220
Well, you could go with this, like, so thoughtful.

19:09.220 --> 19:10.060
Oh.

19:10.060 --> 19:10.880
Look at that.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.720
He's got a lot on his mind.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.200
That's an old soul.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.040
Yeah.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.300
Yeah, that's an old soul.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.140
It is.

19:16.140 --> 19:20.180
It was just not loudly announced.

19:20.180 --> 19:22.260
It's so cool they're making another Benjamin.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.580
Hey, what do you think of this baby?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.380
That baby's seen some shit.

19:26.380 --> 19:27.560
Oh, yeah.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.940
Look at, oh, haunted.

19:28.940 --> 19:30.580
That baby's haunted, I love it.

19:30.580 --> 19:33.060
Oh, no country for old babies, am I right?

19:34.420 --> 19:35.740
Put yourself in their shoes.

19:35.740 --> 19:36.580
Yeah, that's not fun.

19:36.580 --> 19:37.780
No, I don't want to do that.

19:37.780 --> 19:38.620
Oh, no good.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.140
Remember, not everyone has the same tastes.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.340
I mean, yeah, some people, I guess,

19:43.340 --> 19:47.060
love some Gargamel ass looking babies.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.180
There's probably a community for that out there.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.020
What about this?

19:50.020 --> 19:55.020
What about an acknowledgement that sounds like a positive?

19:55.700 --> 19:56.540
Okay.

19:56.540 --> 19:57.360
Like this.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.820
Check out this, check out a little bit of this.

19:58.820 --> 20:01.180
Oh, yeah, that's a baby right there.

20:01.180 --> 20:02.000
Oh, yeah.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.140
Oh, for sure.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.820
That's definitely not a baby.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.500
Baby, huh, am I right?

20:06.500 --> 20:07.340
Baby.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.700
Let's go on to method two,

20:09.700 --> 20:11.700
which is complimenting the baby.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.540
Step one.

20:12.540 --> 20:13.980
So lying.

20:13.980 --> 20:14.940
No, listen.

20:14.940 --> 20:15.780
Oh, no.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.700
Compliment the baby's expression.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.980
One thing you can compliment is the expressions

20:19.980 --> 20:20.820
the baby makes.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.380
Maybe the baby's especially bubbly

20:22.380 --> 20:24.140
or they look very serious and thoughtful.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.420
Either way, use that information

20:25.420 --> 20:26.260
to compliment the baby.

20:26.260 --> 20:30.020
Oh my God, I just pre-cogged a wiki out.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.860
He looks, wow, what a stern.

20:31.860 --> 20:32.740
What do you think, little Douglas?

20:32.740 --> 20:34.100
So stern.

20:34.100 --> 20:34.940
Wow.

20:34.940 --> 20:35.780
Stern.

20:35.780 --> 20:39.020
That's a commanding baby right there.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.820
Oh, God pity the poor criminal

20:42.820 --> 20:45.500
who stands before Judge Baby, am I right?

20:45.500 --> 20:47.060
Wow.

20:47.060 --> 20:49.180
Pick something cute about the baby.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.580
What do you think, little Douglas?

20:50.580 --> 20:52.620
Great diaper.

20:52.620 --> 20:53.740
What brand is that?

20:53.740 --> 20:55.660
It's so playful.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.280
Very playful diaper on Douglas.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.620
Sydney taught me about this thing

21:01.620 --> 21:03.940
called reaction formation.

21:03.940 --> 21:04.820
You guys know about this?

21:04.820 --> 21:05.660
No.

21:05.660 --> 21:06.820
Reaction formation is,

21:06.820 --> 21:08.780
I'm gonna read you the scientific thing,

21:08.780 --> 21:12.380
is a fixation in consciousness of an idea

21:12.380 --> 21:14.520
where one's own rejected tendencies

21:14.520 --> 21:16.140
and reaction formation turn,

21:16.140 --> 21:17.740
okay, this is too complicated.

21:17.740 --> 21:18.580
Yes.

21:18.580 --> 21:19.400
But basically it is,

21:19.400 --> 21:21.100
a reaction formation is a defense mechanism

21:21.100 --> 21:24.440
where you have an emotion or impulse

21:24.440 --> 21:28.040
that is very anxiety producing or unacceptable,

21:28.040 --> 21:32.580
and you deal with it in the instant

21:32.580 --> 21:37.100
by an exaggeration of a directly opposing tendency.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.520
By which I mean, you see the bad baby

21:41.520 --> 21:44.260
and you say, ah, an extremely good,

21:44.260 --> 21:45.580
best baby I've ever seen.

21:45.580 --> 21:46.500
Sure.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.340
And now I've become very paranoid

21:48.340 --> 21:50.020
about not doing that.

21:50.020 --> 21:52.060
And now if people are very positive

21:52.060 --> 21:53.860
about something that I have done

21:53.860 --> 21:56.580
or a hair kind of thing that I'm doing,

21:56.580 --> 21:59.420
I will often wonder, is this reaction formation?

21:59.420 --> 22:00.940
Because they're being very,

22:00.940 --> 22:02.500
they're praising me a lot.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.460
I wonder if this is a reaction formation.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.860
Well, you can't assume, Justin,

22:05.860 --> 22:10.860
that every other human being shares your anxiety.

22:10.860 --> 22:15.860
So it's possible that they do like the thing you're doing.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.020
What are the odds?

22:17.020 --> 22:17.860
What are the odds though, Travis?

22:17.860 --> 22:18.700
What are the odds?

22:18.700 --> 22:23.340
This is why, is there a slightly positive thing

22:23.340 --> 22:24.180
you could say that,

22:24.180 --> 22:26.500
where you see it and you're like, oh, cool baby.

22:26.500 --> 22:30.780
And it's like, well, if they were trying to sell me a line,

22:30.780 --> 22:32.340
they would have pushed it harder.

22:32.340 --> 22:35.820
But it sounds like that's the realest shit, right?

22:35.820 --> 22:36.660
Yeah.

22:36.660 --> 22:37.480
Yeah.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.320
Because if someone's like,

22:38.320 --> 22:40.800
what do you think of my Douglas' little face?

22:40.800 --> 22:43.460
And you go, fuck yeah, Douglas.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.220
Yeah, Douglas, looking good, baby.

22:46.220 --> 22:47.060
Yum, yum.

22:48.140 --> 22:50.860
Compliment the baby's outfit.

22:50.860 --> 22:52.640
That one's a dead giveaway.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.780
What do you think of my Douglas?

22:54.780 --> 22:59.240
His shorts, get a seal of approval from me.

23:00.060 --> 23:01.860
That's especially bad if they show you the picture

23:01.860 --> 23:03.580
and that's what you're prepared to do.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.340
And then the baby's just in a diaper.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.820
And you're like, sick diaper, bro.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.720
Yeah.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.060
Say something nice about the baby's temperament.

23:11.060 --> 23:12.540
What do you think of my Douglas?

23:12.540 --> 23:14.020
He's so loud.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.340
It's great.

23:15.340 --> 23:18.820
Based off that picture, I can tell he's really cool-headed.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.780
Great in a crisis.

23:20.780 --> 23:22.180
Even keeled.

23:23.220 --> 23:25.400
That's definitely, that's the baby I want on my team

23:25.400 --> 23:27.300
when I go urban exploring.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.140
Yeah.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.700
He looks like he's really working on himself.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.640
You know what I mean?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.020
Very introspective, baby.

23:33.020 --> 23:33.900
You can see it.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.900
There's a lot going on behind the eyes.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.520
This is a baby?

23:40.060 --> 23:40.900
This is a baby?

23:40.900 --> 23:44.780
Is this your baby or is this kind of like a sample?

23:44.780 --> 23:46.060
Oh, is this one of those, like,

23:46.060 --> 23:47.980
what would they look like if you had a baby

23:47.980 --> 23:49.500
like that you and your partner did?

23:49.500 --> 23:52.220
And that's why it looks like the way it does?

23:52.220 --> 23:55.380
Is that, no, this is your, oh, this is a baby.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.740
Oh, what about, this is my Douglas.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.020
That's your Douglas?

24:00.620 --> 24:03.860
This isn't some sort of famous Douglas that you downloaded?

24:03.860 --> 24:07.460
I thought that was the platonic ideal of Douglas.

24:09.300 --> 24:13.300
I thought this was some sort of fake, fake Douglas,

24:13.300 --> 24:14.740
sort of a...

24:14.740 --> 24:16.820
You fed all the Douglas's into an AI

24:16.820 --> 24:19.020
and this is what it produced.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.180
This is an algorithmically produced Douglas.

24:21.180 --> 24:22.380
Surely, surely.

24:22.380 --> 24:25.260
This is just the perfect example

24:25.260 --> 24:27.980
of what a Douglas could be, right?

24:27.980 --> 24:28.980
That there's a Douglas.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.820
That's definitely a Douglas.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.140
Hey, you nailed it on the naming.

24:32.140 --> 24:32.980
I look at that.

24:32.980 --> 24:34.220
You can just tell he's a Douglas.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.060
Look at that.

24:35.060 --> 24:37.140
That's a Douglas face right there, my friend.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.740
I want you to meet my son, Douglas.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.100
Fuck yeah, dude.

24:40.100 --> 24:41.740
Basic instinct.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.180
Wall Street.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.180
Get it, dude.

24:44.180 --> 24:45.020
Yeah.

24:45.020 --> 24:45.860
Oh, sorry.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.260
Wall Street two, money never sleeps.

24:48.260 --> 24:49.500
Good shit.

24:50.940 --> 24:52.660
His wife's in Zorro.

24:52.660 --> 24:53.500
Fuck.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.340
Yeah, dude.

24:54.340 --> 24:55.180
Yeah.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.100
Some community Q&A here.

24:56.100 --> 24:56.940
This one's pretty wild.

24:56.940 --> 24:58.820
What if the parents think the baby's ugly too?

24:58.820 --> 25:00.140
You can laugh with the parents,

25:00.140 --> 25:02.700
but this behavior should stop as the child grows.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.540
Pretty cool.

25:03.540 --> 25:05.820
Parents, these are, I love these parents.

25:05.820 --> 25:06.660
What if, okay, hey.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.020
Yeah, we didn't get it quite right.

25:08.020 --> 25:08.860
Wookie there.

25:08.860 --> 25:09.700
Look at my baby.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.540
Oh, can you imagine?

25:10.540 --> 25:11.380
Look at this baby.

25:11.380 --> 25:13.140
And you're ready for your friend to be like,

25:13.140 --> 25:14.180
yeah, that's an ugly baby.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.220
And your friend's like, oh, beautiful.

25:16.220 --> 25:18.980
And now you're thinking, oh God, I'm the worst.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.580
Oh God, is there something wrong with me?

25:20.580 --> 25:22.740
What if the child thinks I'm ugly?

25:22.740 --> 25:23.580
That's okay.

25:23.580 --> 25:24.700
Kids can be very loud and opinionated.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.540
Don't let it bother you.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.060
If the child's repeatedly making rude comments

25:27.060 --> 25:29.380
about your parents, talk to the parents about it.

25:29.380 --> 25:32.460
That's pretty, that's delicious though, isn't it?

25:32.460 --> 25:34.980
If you're like, hmm, little Douglas, I've seen better.

25:34.980 --> 25:36.060
And then in the future they're like,

25:36.060 --> 25:38.500
you're a fucked up skunk face, my man.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.460
You stink and you suck.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.660
Little Douglas is saying this to me?

25:42.660 --> 25:43.500
Yeah.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.900
I deserve it probably at that point.

25:44.900 --> 25:45.740
You definitely do.

25:45.740 --> 25:46.580
If I said to little Douglas,

25:46.580 --> 25:47.820
you got a real Douglas face.

25:47.820 --> 25:49.380
And then he's like, you got Douglas face.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.540
I'm like, whoa, words hurt, man.

25:50.540 --> 25:51.460
Whoa, shit.

25:51.460 --> 25:52.780
Oh, look at the baby and be like,

25:52.780 --> 25:54.940
I bet he has a great sense of humor.

25:54.940 --> 25:57.500
Well, you could also just make a joke and move on.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.340
It's like, this is my baby.

25:58.340 --> 26:00.180
You can be like, very nice.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.820
Nailed it.

26:02.820 --> 26:04.780
Yeah, he's great success.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.060
Yeah, he's crawling now.

26:07.060 --> 26:10.660
Oh, how are you, how are you, my wife?

26:10.660 --> 26:13.660
God, it's so, why does only he get to be Borat?

26:13.660 --> 26:14.500
It's not fair at all.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.540
It doesn't seem like he does, Justin.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.700
It seems like everybody gets their 15 minutes of Borat.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.780
I know, but I want more.

26:24.860 --> 26:28.300
Can I put on a one man stage show called Borap?

26:28.300 --> 26:31.740
And it's a different guy, but he's pretty similar.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.660
And also he does some pretty cool raps.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.740
Yeah, he does, he's got some good raps.

26:37.740 --> 26:38.580
That's it.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.820
We need to do something else now

26:39.820 --> 26:42.340
because we haven't done enough show yet.

26:42.340 --> 26:44.180
Okay, well, how about another question?

26:44.180 --> 26:46.100
I've put together some great ones this week.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.100
I would love it.

26:47.100 --> 26:47.940
I don't want to brag.

26:47.940 --> 26:48.780
Okay.

26:48.780 --> 26:50.180
You clearly do.

26:50.180 --> 26:51.420
There's a person in my job

26:51.420 --> 26:54.020
who I see every day painting minifigurines

26:54.020 --> 26:57.020
or in the parlance, minifigs.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.780
His setup has the whole deal.

26:59.780 --> 27:03.340
A briefcase with the figures, paint, brushes,

27:03.340 --> 27:04.940
the whole nine yards.

27:04.940 --> 27:06.220
And I'm wildly intrigued.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.340
I got to say, question asker,

27:08.340 --> 27:10.740
those are the components I would have guessed going in.

27:10.740 --> 27:12.540
Maybe not the briefcase, to be fair.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.540
Yeah, that's awesome.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.900
What, you're just going to carry him in a tote bag, Justin?

27:16.900 --> 27:20.380
Just a loose Walmart bag.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.200
I want to ask him about it.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.900
However, I don't know how.

27:23.900 --> 27:27.500
Most people we work with would just ask him in a judgy way.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.700
How do I ask him about his beautiful minis

27:29.700 --> 27:32.120
without sounding like I'm trying to shame him?

27:32.120 --> 27:34.220
That's from what you play in there in Wisconsin.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.900
There's an aspect of this question, by the way,

27:35.900 --> 27:38.300
hearing it out loud that I had not considered,

27:38.300 --> 27:42.080
which is, is your coworker just like doing this

27:42.080 --> 27:44.180
at his desk in the middle of the workday,

27:44.180 --> 27:45.940
just pulling out some favorite, I'm like-

27:45.940 --> 27:46.780
And it's kind of wild, isn't it?

27:46.780 --> 27:47.820
Yeah, isn't it?

27:47.820 --> 27:51.780
Like the boss is going to come by and want to say something,

27:51.780 --> 27:55.780
but it will be so mind boggling that this isn't just like,

27:55.780 --> 27:58.420
oh, I was playing peggle on my phone or whatever.

27:58.420 --> 28:02.460
That it's just like, oh, you have a whole thing set up.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.500
It's fucking awesome though.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.220
I'm imagining this person, like the boss comes out

28:06.220 --> 28:08.660
and is like, okay, everybody, 30 minutes lunch break.

28:08.660 --> 28:11.780
And this guy just like horks down a, you know,

28:11.780 --> 28:13.860
chicken salad sandwich in like two bites.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.600
And then so he can pop off his briefcase

28:15.600 --> 28:19.080
and have 29 minutes to really do some painting.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.060
I like that.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.360
I like that lifestyle.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.500
That's good for me.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.420
I think you can't ask questions.

28:24.420 --> 28:27.260
You have to just do a compliment like,

28:27.260 --> 28:30.180
oh, great detail work on the angel wings.

28:30.180 --> 28:33.660
I don't know what figures these are, but like-

28:33.660 --> 28:37.100
Yeah, I mean, I imagine it's like, you know,

28:37.100 --> 28:39.620
D&D or Warhammer, right?

28:39.620 --> 28:40.460
Yeah, stuff like that.

28:40.460 --> 28:43.280
I mean, it could be like little soldiers.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.120
It could be.

28:44.120 --> 28:44.960
Yeah, I guess it could be little souls.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.780
Thank you, Travis.

28:45.780 --> 28:46.620
What other little things are there?

28:46.620 --> 28:47.460
Tiny angels.

28:47.460 --> 28:48.300
Okay, yeah, well-

28:48.300 --> 28:49.740
Tiny angels is true.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.260
You know, I think that there's a misconception that like,

28:52.260 --> 28:55.120
if you've made it to this point in your adult life,

28:55.120 --> 28:57.620
and you've probably heard, I would say,

28:57.620 --> 29:00.340
all the things that people know to say

29:00.340 --> 29:02.460
about you painting tiny figures at your desk

29:02.460 --> 29:03.840
while you're supposed to be working,

29:03.840 --> 29:06.140
I think that you've probably made your peace with it, right?

29:06.140 --> 29:07.460
You're doing it because you enjoy it,

29:07.460 --> 29:08.900
not because you think, like,

29:08.900 --> 29:13.620
nobody is going to, like, shame you at this point.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.220
You are unshamable, right?

29:15.220 --> 29:16.540
You've gotten this far.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.020
I don't think you should be afraid of that.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.020
I think they probably would just like to

29:20.020 --> 29:21.340
maybe talk about the figures.

29:21.340 --> 29:22.180
Yeah, I think if you-

29:22.180 --> 29:24.100
Like, that seems like an open invitation, right?

29:24.100 --> 29:25.820
If they were ashamed of it,

29:25.820 --> 29:28.500
they probably wouldn't be, like, doing it

29:28.500 --> 29:30.700
while they're supposed to be flying the plane

29:30.700 --> 29:32.340
or whatever, you know, it is.

29:32.340 --> 29:33.780
Heart surgery.

29:33.780 --> 29:34.620
Yeah, right.

29:34.620 --> 29:36.780
Now, I will say, there is also the possibility

29:36.780 --> 29:37.780
that this person's like,

29:37.780 --> 29:40.240
oh, thank God, a chance to work on my figurines.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.900
And you're like, tell me about it!

29:41.900 --> 29:45.300
And they're like, I have 45 minutes to finish,

29:45.300 --> 29:48.780
so please don't ask me questions about my figurine.

29:48.780 --> 29:50.820
This is why I hid it in the supply closet.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.100
Why do you come in here every day, too?

29:53.100 --> 29:53.940
Fuck.

29:53.940 --> 29:54.780
Can I tell you what I think?

29:54.780 --> 29:55.600
I want to give you, I don't know,

29:55.600 --> 29:56.700
can I tell you what I think?

29:56.700 --> 29:57.520
What?

29:57.520 --> 29:58.360
Can I tell you guys what I think?

29:58.360 --> 29:59.200
Yeah.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.820
I think, if I'm, I'm not,

30:01.820 --> 30:03.520
now, I might be projecting, I might be off,

30:03.520 --> 30:05.540
but I'm going to guess on something here.

30:05.540 --> 30:08.500
I think that this question asker's hesitancy,

30:08.500 --> 30:10.780
if you were to, like, dig down deep,

30:10.780 --> 30:12.220
because I feel this way, too,

30:12.220 --> 30:13.540
and tell me if I'm wrong, let's just say this,

30:13.540 --> 30:16.940
but I feel like their hesitancy has less to do

30:16.940 --> 30:21.340
with the fact that they are worried

30:21.340 --> 30:24.180
that this person doesn't want to talk about their figs.

30:24.180 --> 30:26.620
And I think it's because maybe this person

30:26.620 --> 30:31.100
doesn't know a lot about the figs, the figs,

30:31.100 --> 30:33.880
and they're afraid of seeming kind of stupid about it.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.940
Because, like, that would be me, is like,

30:35.940 --> 30:38.100
I would see, like, that is definitely

30:38.100 --> 30:40.060
within the Venn diagram, right?

30:40.060 --> 30:42.940
That's in the atmosphere of things that I would like,

30:42.940 --> 30:44.460
and I would be curious about,

30:44.460 --> 30:48.140
but I wouldn't want to say, like, some stupid shit.

30:48.140 --> 30:51.380
Like, do you use Sharpies, or whatever?

30:51.380 --> 30:53.140
I don't even know what a dumb question is.

30:53.140 --> 30:55.140
Is thems from Monopoly?

30:55.140 --> 30:57.720
There's a 90% chance that no matter how much

30:57.720 --> 30:59.020
you, like, practice in your head,

30:59.020 --> 31:00.420
I think that you're going to walk up

31:00.420 --> 31:01.440
and you're going to open your mouth,

31:01.440 --> 31:04.460
and the phrase, so, painting figs, is going to come out.

31:04.460 --> 31:05.860
And you're like, God damn.

31:05.860 --> 31:07.220
You can write a whole monologue

31:07.220 --> 31:09.780
and still accidentally deliver that one.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.060
It's a thing where, like,

31:11.060 --> 31:13.980
I think some people misread sometimes,

31:13.980 --> 31:18.780
or are afraid that ignorance will be misread as judgment.

31:18.780 --> 31:21.580
Like, if I valued this,

31:21.580 --> 31:24.460
I probably would have learned about it by now.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.380
By this point, I would have taken some time

31:26.380 --> 31:27.220
to educate myself.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.700
At best, you might come across as, like,

31:28.700 --> 31:30.700
condescending small talk.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.820
You're like, oh, so figurines, huh?

31:32.820 --> 31:35.260
So you have to, you got to ameliorate yourself

31:35.260 --> 31:36.460
with this individual.

31:36.460 --> 31:37.900
I tell you what I would do,

31:37.900 --> 31:39.980
is I would go into the bathroom,

31:39.980 --> 31:42.660
would change clothes, I would throw on

31:42.660 --> 31:46.340
a big baggy denim overalls,

31:46.340 --> 31:48.940
and let one of the straps hang down.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.420
And I would walk up there with, like,

31:50.420 --> 31:54.080
a old matted up paintbrush, and just be like,

31:54.980 --> 31:56.180
you need any help?

31:56.180 --> 32:01.020
Hey, hey, Tom, need help painting that fence?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.100
I don't, hey, listen, I don't like working either.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.900
Can I help you? Can I please help?

32:04.900 --> 32:06.140
You have a perfect scam here,

32:06.140 --> 32:07.420
and I don't know how you're pulling it off,

32:07.420 --> 32:09.140
and I want to cut.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.220
Oh, get on the phone, right?

32:11.220 --> 32:13.340
Or you can probably fake this phone call,

32:13.340 --> 32:15.220
and just be like, yeah, sis, yeah, no,

32:15.220 --> 32:17.700
I do want to get into painting figurines.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.340
You know I've talked about this for years,

32:20.340 --> 32:22.180
but I don't even know where to start.

32:22.180 --> 32:25.100
Like, really loudly, but not so loudly

32:25.100 --> 32:27.180
that it seems like a bit.

32:27.180 --> 32:29.340
That's, no, it is a bit, though, it's just a bit.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.660
I mean, I know, listen,

32:30.660 --> 32:33.540
but why have you been taking those acting classes for years

32:33.540 --> 32:35.940
if not for this moment, question asker?

32:35.940 --> 32:38.500
I'm tired, I'm tired of you supplicating yourself

32:38.500 --> 32:39.580
to this stranger.

32:39.580 --> 32:42.940
Listen, I need you to take bigger figs.

32:42.940 --> 32:44.460
Oh, awesome.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.020
Like a Barbie?

32:46.020 --> 32:48.220
Like big figs, yeah, like a Barbie,

32:48.220 --> 32:49.420
like an action man.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.140
Like fig figs, you know.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.300
Just big figs.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.380
Big figs for big boys.

32:54.380 --> 32:58.180
Centurions, or descendants, or like big figs.

32:58.180 --> 33:02.140
Get a full-size, get a six-foot statue, a marble statue.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.500
Get a marble statue and go in there and paint a big fig,

33:04.500 --> 33:06.100
and be like, oh, nice little fig.

33:06.100 --> 33:10.140
Oh, I see, I see you're still at the starting point

33:10.140 --> 33:10.980
with the little ones.

33:10.980 --> 33:13.260
You'll work your way up to the big ones someday.

33:13.260 --> 33:15.900
I remember when I used to paint little figs

33:15.900 --> 33:17.380
when I was a little boy.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.980
When I was a little person, I painted little figs,

33:19.980 --> 33:21.940
but now I'm a big person, and I paint big figs.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.820
And I've put such frivolous things away,

33:23.820 --> 33:26.220
and now it's only big figs and big work for me,

33:26.220 --> 33:28.940
because I got big responsibilities.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.180
Would it be helpful to bring some of the figs-

33:30.180 --> 33:31.620
People rely on me.

33:31.620 --> 33:33.900
I don't have time for individual little figs.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.380
I gotta get these big figs done

33:35.380 --> 33:37.820
so I can pay taxes and feed my family.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.220
Would it be helpful

33:40.220 --> 33:43.460
if you brought some of the heat off of this person,

33:43.460 --> 33:45.540
and whenever they were painting their figs,

33:45.540 --> 33:48.100
you went over to your cubicle

33:48.100 --> 33:50.660
and put on a big puffy white hat

33:50.660 --> 33:53.620
and started to throw pizza dough in the air,

33:53.620 --> 33:54.460
just going like,

33:54.460 --> 33:56.780
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da.

33:56.780 --> 33:59.420
And the boss would be like, what are you doing?

33:59.420 --> 34:01.500
And you'd be like, my passion?

34:01.500 --> 34:03.180
My passion and my hobby?

34:03.180 --> 34:04.500
I thought this was my time.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.780
Break time is my time, is what you said.

34:06.780 --> 34:07.620
And they'll be like,

34:07.620 --> 34:10.460
you don't have any pizza sauce, a cooking surface.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.900
And you're like, no, it's just the dough.

34:12.900 --> 34:15.820
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.260
You want me to start with the sauce?

34:17.260 --> 34:19.900
Then what would I put it on, genius?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.220
And if the boss is like,

34:21.220 --> 34:23.580
you're gonna be written up for this.

34:23.580 --> 34:24.620
I'm gonna go eat now.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.460
And they walk away,

34:25.460 --> 34:27.980
and you stand up and look at the figs guy

34:27.980 --> 34:30.300
and just nod your head knowingly.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.100
And then you're in, baby.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.500
What, along those same lines,

34:35.500 --> 34:37.140
you could just go to their desk and be like,

34:37.140 --> 34:39.860
listen, Peterson, if you don't have all my figs painted,

34:39.860 --> 34:41.780
by the end of the day, it's your job.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.260
I don't know if you have the ability to fire this.

34:43.260 --> 34:44.100
That's cool.

34:44.100 --> 34:45.540
Or you could just be like, come on, Jefferson,

34:45.540 --> 34:47.780
the client is waiting on those figs.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.900
Okay, this one's really funny.

34:52.900 --> 34:53.820
You ready?

34:53.820 --> 34:54.860
Go over to him.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.020
Wait, I wasn't ready.

34:56.020 --> 34:57.180
Hold on.

34:57.180 --> 34:58.420
Okay, get ready.

34:58.420 --> 34:59.260
Okay.

35:00.180 --> 35:01.940
Go over to him and be like,

35:01.940 --> 35:05.420
hey, that seems cool.

35:05.420 --> 35:06.660
I don't know anything about it.

35:06.660 --> 35:07.980
Would you mind telling me about it?

35:07.980 --> 35:10.860
I wasn't ready.

35:10.860 --> 35:11.700
I know.

35:11.700 --> 35:14.700
And if you do that, maybe you could be.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.540
I know.

35:17.100 --> 35:18.340
That would work on me.

35:18.340 --> 35:19.180
Yeah.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.020
You know?

35:20.020 --> 35:22.180
If I was like doing a wood thing at work,

35:22.180 --> 35:26.260
maybe like carving one of my famous little fellas.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.380
You ever see Justin McElroy's Little Fellows

35:28.380 --> 35:29.220
on Etsy?

35:29.220 --> 35:30.060
Yeah.

35:30.060 --> 35:30.900
That's you?

35:30.900 --> 35:31.740
That's me.

35:31.740 --> 35:34.180
That's the Justin McElroy of Justin McElroy's Little Fellows.

35:34.180 --> 35:36.100
I thought it was the Canadian Justin McElroy

35:36.100 --> 35:37.340
that was really in the Little Fellas.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.300
No, no.

35:38.300 --> 35:41.060
CBC Justin McElroy is not the guy who,

35:41.060 --> 35:43.740
he paints the Little Fellas for me.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.820
That's why, if you ever look at the apostrophe

35:45.820 --> 35:48.380
after Justin McElroy's Little Fellas,

35:48.380 --> 35:50.060
the apostrophe is actually after the S.

35:50.060 --> 35:50.900
Oh, it's right.

35:50.900 --> 35:51.740
McElroy's is.

35:51.740 --> 35:52.580
Okay, got it.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.260
Justin McElroy's Little Fellas.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.100
Got it, got it.

35:55.100 --> 35:55.940
It makes a lot more sense.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.780
And it's L-I-L apostrophe.

35:57.780 --> 35:58.860
Right.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.620
F-E-L-L-A-Z.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.740
Justin McElroy's Little Fellas.

36:03.740 --> 36:04.580
Right.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.860
And they are just little people toys,

36:06.860 --> 36:08.340
but they're just the boy ones

36:08.340 --> 36:10.380
and the other Justin McElroy paints over them.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.980
But you buy them in the first place.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.980
No, I car, no, I whittle them.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.060
Oh, okay.

36:15.060 --> 36:16.500
I whittle them from wood.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.020
That's the wood part that I'm doing.

36:18.020 --> 36:18.860
Right.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.900
And then Canadian Justin McElroy,

36:20.900 --> 36:25.900
or Justin McElroy, he paints the Little Fellas.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.460
Now, I happen to need to ask you, Justin,

36:27.460 --> 36:29.020
now that I know that that's you,

36:29.020 --> 36:32.020
why do you make them all look like Griffin?

36:32.020 --> 36:33.380
Yeah, that's a weird thing, man.

36:33.380 --> 36:35.380
When I think fisherman,

36:35.380 --> 36:38.100
which all the Little Fellas are fishermen,

36:38.100 --> 36:40.180
when I think fishermen, I think Griffin.

36:40.180 --> 36:41.220
Okay, yeah, I get that.

36:41.220 --> 36:44.180
You do make a lot where a big fish is jumping up

36:44.180 --> 36:46.460
and trying to pull down the back of my pants

36:46.460 --> 36:47.900
so that my little hiney shows.

36:47.900 --> 36:48.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.020
And different poses, too.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.060
Like you sell- Like 75% of them.

36:53.060 --> 36:56.020
I made one of those for a special promotion

36:56.020 --> 36:57.580
for the March of Dimes.

36:57.580 --> 37:00.060
And they sold so well that they actually became

37:00.060 --> 37:01.340
sort of the default Little Fellas.

37:01.340 --> 37:03.220
Oh, it became like the look.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.060
Griffin's hiney.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.020
That became like the quintessential.

37:06.020 --> 37:11.020
If you ever see them pop up on Auntie's Rude Show,

37:11.060 --> 37:14.180
you'll see those referred to as like retro Little Fellas

37:14.180 --> 37:15.780
if they don't have the fish jumping up

37:15.780 --> 37:17.620
and pulling down Griffin's pants.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.980
Now- You can see his tiny wooden hide.

37:19.980 --> 37:22.500
Just one more thing there, because like, I think-

37:22.500 --> 37:25.020
I wish Justin, other Justin would paint the butts.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.140
Because they're just perfect alabaster butts.

37:27.140 --> 37:29.020
He says it's the same-

37:29.020 --> 37:31.540
To be fair, that does match Griffin's hiney.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.580
But I also, I think-

37:34.580 --> 37:37.540
Yeah, no, I like the fact that you didn't give Griffin

37:37.540 --> 37:39.300
like a cutesy facial expression about that.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.980
It's abject horror at a fish, but like, yeah.

37:42.980 --> 37:44.340
And it's like not a gim.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.460
Yeah, right, right, right.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.420
That this is like, that each individual figurine

37:49.420 --> 37:51.580
is a separate occasion of this happening.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.420
Yeah.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.500
That Griffin has had to live through.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.340
It's fucked up also that you used

37:56.340 --> 37:59.300
a sort of photorealistic rendition

37:59.300 --> 38:04.300
of my gnarled, eroded 34-year-old face on all of them.

38:04.660 --> 38:05.500
Yeah.

38:06.540 --> 38:09.900
It is, I mean, it's incredible work and detail that you do,

38:09.900 --> 38:12.300
but it does sort of make the pose a little bit-

38:12.300 --> 38:14.580
I thought it was 3D printed, frankly.

38:14.580 --> 38:16.220
Yeah, people say that a lot.

38:16.220 --> 38:20.700
This is actually gonna kind of mess up my rep,

38:20.700 --> 38:24.100
but I'm actually not making enough off the Little Fellas

38:24.100 --> 38:24.940
to support my-

38:24.940 --> 38:26.900
It's a labor of love.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.700
Yeah, it's more of a labor of love.

38:28.700 --> 38:32.100
The Little Fellas are a loss leader for the Big Fellas.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.940
If I can say it's my ministry.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.460
Yeah, it's my ministry.

38:36.660 --> 38:37.500
Really.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.860
So as a result, I would like you guys

38:39.860 --> 38:41.100
to follow me to the Monday Sun.

38:41.100 --> 38:41.940
Okay.

38:45.940 --> 38:48.780
It's better, it's better with you.

38:50.940 --> 38:51.980
Stamps.

38:51.980 --> 38:53.940
I love them, you love them.

38:53.940 --> 38:54.820
Fuck yeah.

38:54.820 --> 38:59.820
They're stickers that carry your words and things to places.

39:00.540 --> 39:04.660
Think about that for just one second.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.260
You're getting pretty hype about these stamps, Trav.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.220
I just, if you really think about a stamp, Griffin,

39:09.220 --> 39:10.060
it's bonkers.

39:10.060 --> 39:10.900
It's fucked up, yeah.

39:10.900 --> 39:11.740
It's fucked up.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.900
These stickers, like the stickers I collect

39:13.900 --> 39:17.140
that have like cool dolphins and shit on them,

39:17.140 --> 39:20.380
they transmit my thoughts around the fucking globe.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.220
Think about that.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.060
And that's messed up.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.020
Like two seconds, you guys.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.780
And then think about being able to do that

39:25.780 --> 39:29.380
without having to go anywhere.

39:29.380 --> 39:30.500
Well, I'm not God.

39:30.500 --> 39:33.060
So I don't think I can create my own stamps.

39:33.060 --> 39:33.900
Oh, but you know who is God?

39:33.900 --> 39:35.140
Stamps.com is God.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.140
Oh, all right.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.380
Our stamps are some awesome stamps.

39:38.380 --> 39:41.460
They're stickers, but not having dolphins.

39:41.460 --> 39:42.580
That's my song I wrote about stamps.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.420
I love it.

39:43.420 --> 39:45.580
As far as I know, there is no dolphin-shaped stamps.

39:45.580 --> 39:46.660
Not yet.

Hey, you remember that commercial for Orbit gum?

40:42.140 --> 40:42.980
Oh yeah.

40:42.980 --> 40:44.500
Where the people are arguing and the woman's like,

40:44.500 --> 40:47.620
who are you calling a cootie queen, you lint licker?

40:47.620 --> 40:50.980
Griffin, I just re-watched that on YouTube

40:50.980 --> 40:52.460
like three days ago.

40:52.460 --> 40:53.300
That's wild.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.980
And it's like dirty mouth.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.500
So I guess anyway, do you have a dirty mouth?

40:58.540 --> 40:59.380
Me?

40:59.380 --> 41:01.260
That's a, man, outside of the context

41:01.260 --> 41:03.500
of us doing a Quip commercial,

41:03.500 --> 41:05.500
if I ever genuinely asked anybody,

41:05.500 --> 41:07.300
hey, do you have a dirty mouth?

41:07.300 --> 41:10.580
They would get, I would be removed from the premises

41:10.580 --> 41:12.060
of whatever building I was in.

41:12.060 --> 41:16.020
You also just kind of name dropped a different gum brand

41:16.020 --> 41:16.860
in there too.

41:16.860 --> 41:18.220
I'm pretty sure they're dead and gone.

41:18.220 --> 41:19.100
I'm pretty sure.

41:19.100 --> 41:19.940
Orbits?

41:21.020 --> 41:21.980
Yeah, the gum?

41:23.220 --> 41:24.060
Hold on, let me Google,

41:24.060 --> 41:26.300
because you're right, that would get us in trouble.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.540
The brand was discontinued after the war ended.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.580
What the fuck?

41:29.580 --> 41:30.420
Where am I?

41:30.420 --> 41:31.420
Wait, what?

41:34.540 --> 41:36.420
Orbit was launched in 1890.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.900
Orbit was launched in, sorry Quip,

41:37.900 --> 41:39.180
we're gonna start your commercial over here

41:39.180 --> 41:40.020
in just a second.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.860
Orbit was started in 1899?

41:45.060 --> 41:46.820
Okay, yeah, I guess Orbit's still out there.

41:46.820 --> 41:49.220
Anyway, that's the end of the free Orbit commercial.

41:49.220 --> 41:50.820
Hey, Quip is excellent.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.940
They have the better gum that cleans your teeth.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.060
It's better in every way.

41:57.060 --> 41:58.260
And that's just me saying that,

41:58.260 --> 41:59.540
that it's not in the copy for,

41:59.540 --> 42:01.020
oh fuck, I'm sweating now.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.300
Listen, it's the holidays

42:06.300 --> 42:09.500
and your mouth is putting in work right now, isn't it?

42:09.500 --> 42:12.660
Eating, drinking up eggnog,

42:12.660 --> 42:15.460
that stuff gets on your teeth and lives there for a while.

42:15.460 --> 42:16.740
So don't worry about that though,

42:16.740 --> 42:19.020
cause you got better oral care with Quip,

42:19.020 --> 42:21.460
the company with the best gum.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.300
They have this built-in two minute timer

42:23.300 --> 42:26.260
that pulses every 30 seconds in the toothbrush,

42:26.260 --> 42:28.140
not in the gum,

42:28.140 --> 42:30.060
cause that would be pretty fucked up

42:30.060 --> 42:32.260
if your gum started to pulsate

42:32.260 --> 42:35.140
and it helps you clean your mouth the right way.

42:35.140 --> 42:39.380
They have a cover that your toothbrush like lives in

42:39.380 --> 42:40.660
and then you can sort of pop it off

42:40.660 --> 42:42.300
and put it right on top of the toothbrush

42:42.300 --> 42:45.340
and it turns it into a little protective armor

42:45.340 --> 42:47.460
so you can pack up your Quip on the go.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.740
And they also can deliver fresh floss, toothpaste,

42:49.740 --> 42:52.220
mouthwash and the best fucking gum in the business

42:52.220 --> 42:54.700
every three months from up to $5.

42:54.700 --> 42:55.980
Shipping is free, so you can save money

42:55.980 --> 42:57.340
and skip the hustle and bustle of shopping

42:57.340 --> 42:59.300
and store during the holidays and into the new year

42:59.300 --> 43:00.940
or for the rest of your life.

43:00.940 --> 43:04.020
Cause it just comes to you and right in your hour of need.

43:04.020 --> 43:06.380
So go to getquip.com slash my brother right now

43:06.380 --> 43:07.740

43:17.380 --> 43:19.140
Quip, the good habits company.

43:19.140 --> 43:21.780
Please do not tell on me for this commercial.

43:26.740 --> 43:29.980
Hello, I'm Pee Wee Herman.

43:29.980 --> 43:31.860
You might know me from TV,

43:31.860 --> 43:34.380
but I really want to be a DJ.

43:34.380 --> 43:35.980
It took some convincing,

43:35.980 --> 43:40.820
but KCRW finally agreed to give me an hour on the radio

43:40.820 --> 43:43.460
to play you some music with my friends.

43:44.340 --> 43:47.380
Anyway, tune in for one hour of the bestest,

43:47.380 --> 43:50.260
most funnest time you'll ever have

43:50.260 --> 43:52.900
on the Pee Wee Herman radio hour.

43:52.900 --> 43:54.700
I am personally inviting you

43:54.700 --> 43:57.620
to tune your transistor radio in to hear me

43:57.620 --> 44:01.860
or go to kcrw.com, duh.

44:01.860 --> 44:03.580
It'll be available for the whole week

44:03.580 --> 44:06.140
from November 26th to December 3rd.

44:06.140 --> 44:09.980
So you can listen to it again and again and again

44:09.980 --> 44:12.100
and again and again.

44:14.380 --> 44:18.020
The Pee Wee Herman radio hour was produced by Maximum Fun

44:18.020 --> 44:22.420
and can be streamed on kcrw.com until December 3rd.

44:26.940 --> 44:28.220
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

44:28.220 --> 44:29.060
Yeah.

44:29.060 --> 44:29.900
Oh.

44:29.900 --> 44:30.740
Wait.

44:30.740 --> 44:34.140
Digi-digi-digi-digi-digi-digi.

44:34.140 --> 44:36.500
Digi-digi-digi-digi-digi-digi-digi.

44:36.500 --> 44:37.340
That was bad.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.180
Okay.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.460
I want to munch.

44:39.460 --> 44:40.300
Squad?

44:40.300 --> 44:41.140
How is it possible?

44:41.140 --> 44:43.340
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

44:43.340 --> 44:44.740
I want to munch.

44:44.740 --> 44:45.580
Okay, squad.

44:45.580 --> 44:46.420
Squad.

44:46.420 --> 44:48.020
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

44:48.020 --> 44:49.660
It is almost December.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.420
Hello.

44:51.420 --> 44:52.260
Yeah.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.820
I'm here whenever there are donuts to discuss.

44:54.820 --> 44:55.660
Okay.

44:55.660 --> 44:56.660
This is not a Halloween,

44:56.660 --> 44:58.460
I am not a Halloween creation

44:58.460 --> 45:00.780
and I am not who you think I am.

45:00.780 --> 45:01.620
Okay.

45:01.620 --> 45:02.860
Who do you believe me to be?

45:04.060 --> 45:06.140
I mean, I feels like a trick question

45:06.140 --> 45:08.060
because I really believe in my heart and soul

45:08.060 --> 45:09.340
that you are Count Donut.

45:10.660 --> 45:12.180
Yes, I get that a lot.

45:12.180 --> 45:13.060
Okay.

45:13.060 --> 45:15.580
I am Count Donuts Jr.

45:15.580 --> 45:16.420
What?

45:16.420 --> 45:18.820
But please call me Rick.

45:18.820 --> 45:20.540
Rick Donut?

45:20.540 --> 45:21.380
This show does not-

45:21.380 --> 45:23.300
Yes, Count Donut is my dad.

45:23.300 --> 45:24.140
Right.

45:24.140 --> 45:25.820
He covers donuts, me?

45:25.820 --> 45:28.460
I cover donut holes.

45:28.460 --> 45:29.500
Okay.

45:29.500 --> 45:32.500
We did not need more characters

45:32.500 --> 45:35.020
or Count Donut lore on this show.

45:35.020 --> 45:36.340
You said characters were-

45:36.340 --> 45:37.220
No, we didn't.

45:39.060 --> 45:39.900
Okay.

45:39.900 --> 45:43.740
So you're here with some cool holes for us, Rick.

45:44.580 --> 45:45.420
Yes.

45:45.420 --> 45:48.100
Can we call you Rick Holes instead?

45:48.100 --> 45:49.100
I prefer you didn't.

45:49.100 --> 45:51.380
I prefer you didn't call me Rick.

45:51.380 --> 45:52.740
Rick Holes is good though.

45:52.740 --> 45:54.860
Mr. Donut Jr. would be fine.

45:54.860 --> 45:56.220
Okay, fine.

45:56.220 --> 45:58.740
So I sound like my father, I realize this,

45:58.740 --> 46:00.540
but try to-

46:00.540 --> 46:01.380
We sound like dad, it's fine.

46:01.380 --> 46:04.340
I think you'll tell the difference very quickly.

46:04.340 --> 46:05.300
Dudes.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.140
Oh!

46:06.140 --> 46:06.980
Awesome.

46:06.980 --> 46:08.860
Oh, fuck yeah, now I'm on board, dude.

46:10.700 --> 46:12.260
Yes, come with me.

46:12.260 --> 46:15.780
Why don't you dap on over to this story here

46:15.780 --> 46:17.380
that I have for you?

46:18.420 --> 46:23.420
Tim Hortons has teamed up with Justin Bieber.

46:23.420 --> 46:25.380
Awesome.

46:25.380 --> 46:27.940
Yes, it is awesome, Griffin.

46:27.940 --> 46:28.780
Thank you.

46:28.780 --> 46:32.100
He's teamed up with Justin Bieber to make-

46:32.100 --> 46:33.860
Bieber bites, please.

46:33.860 --> 46:36.020
No, this is a good guess, Travis.

46:40.820 --> 46:41.660
Beeb holes?

46:41.660 --> 46:42.500
Come on.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.340
Beeb holes.

46:43.340 --> 46:44.900
Come on, sweetheart, you can get one up.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.980
Beeb holes?

46:47.100 --> 46:50.460
Sorry, you think it might be beeb holes?

46:50.460 --> 46:51.660
Not now.

46:51.660 --> 46:54.300
Not now that I've said it.

46:54.300 --> 46:57.420
Yes, my tongue gave it away.

46:57.420 --> 47:00.020
No, no, they're Tim Beebs.

47:01.700 --> 47:05.940
So you know that the Timbit is the tiny version

47:05.940 --> 47:07.540
of a Tim Hortons donut,

47:07.540 --> 47:12.620
the sweet succulent nut from the middle of the dough.

47:12.620 --> 47:16.260
The true nut of the donut, ironically.

47:16.260 --> 47:19.180
So that's what they call the Timbit,

47:19.180 --> 47:22.900
but now, make way for Tim Beebs.

47:25.380 --> 47:26.380
And I don't have to move,

47:26.380 --> 47:28.340
I don't actually have to move that far

47:28.340 --> 47:29.740
to make way for Tim Beebs.

47:29.740 --> 47:31.820
It's like a little nudge to the left.

47:31.820 --> 47:33.220
It's like an inch and a half,

47:33.220 --> 47:38.220
or, you know, in Canada, 15 centimeters.

47:39.420 --> 47:41.260
I do not think that that good version-

47:41.260 --> 47:42.300
It doesn't feel right.

47:42.300 --> 47:43.700
It doesn't at all.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.860
I don't think that's right at all.

47:45.860 --> 47:48.260
It doesn't feel right to say.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.340
Let's see, 15 centimeters to inches

47:50.340 --> 47:52.620
is almost six inches, so-

47:52.620 --> 47:56.500
That would be a hell of a Tim Beeb.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.300
Yes, this is the thing about Tim Beebs,

47:58.300 --> 47:59.380
he's gigantic.

48:01.980 --> 48:03.220
He was compensating.

48:03.220 --> 48:05.340
He started with baby, baby, baby donuts,

48:05.340 --> 48:07.100
big donut, big donut, big donut.

48:07.100 --> 48:08.820
No, it's Tim Beebs, it's small.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.100
Tim Hortons has teamed up

48:11.100 --> 48:13.460
with pop superstar Justin Bieber.

48:13.460 --> 48:15.020
This was sent to us by Daniel,

48:15.020 --> 48:17.020
and the story is on CBC.

48:17.020 --> 48:18.740
All right.

48:18.740 --> 48:20.100
Home of dragons.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.580
And other Justin McElroy, I think.

48:22.580 --> 48:24.060
And other Justin McElroy.

48:24.060 --> 48:26.260
Yes, if only this had been written

48:26.260 --> 48:28.940
by my friend, Justin McElroy.

48:28.940 --> 48:30.420
Oh, you guys are close?

48:30.420 --> 48:31.700
I would never kill him.

48:31.700 --> 48:32.540
Oh.

48:32.540 --> 48:34.700
Not in the way that I killed Justin regularly.

48:34.700 --> 48:37.540
Listen, this is my first time in this body.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.260
I forgot my rich fiction.

48:39.260 --> 48:43.260
Tim Hortons teamed up with Tim Beebs

48:43.260 --> 48:45.860
for co-branded merchandise.

48:45.860 --> 48:47.740
The celebrity endorsement deal

48:47.740 --> 48:50.060
marks a departure from the coffee

48:50.060 --> 48:52.540
and donut chain's usual lineup

48:52.540 --> 48:55.140
of professional hockey players.

48:55.140 --> 48:57.700
A marketing strategy that could help attract

48:57.700 --> 48:59.260
a different demographic.

48:59.260 --> 49:03.380
Yes, CBC, I think that there is not a ton of overlap

49:03.380 --> 49:06.580
between Beeb heads and a hockey fan.

49:06.580 --> 49:10.020
Hey, how do you know that, Count Donut Junior?

49:10.020 --> 49:11.060
That's very judgmental.

49:11.060 --> 49:11.980
This is my thing.

49:11.980 --> 49:14.540
I make snap judgments about subcultures

49:14.540 --> 49:15.620
I don't understand.

49:15.620 --> 49:16.820
Okay.

49:16.820 --> 49:17.940
That's Rick.

49:17.940 --> 49:19.620
That's Rick, baby.

49:19.620 --> 49:22.620
That's Rick, baby.

49:22.620 --> 49:25.500
The partnership aligns with the Canadian singer's

49:25.500 --> 49:28.940
frequent social media posts about the restaurant,

49:28.940 --> 49:30.620
which have ranged from snapshots

49:30.620 --> 49:32.980
of a holiday-themed Tim's cup

49:32.980 --> 49:34.980
to complaints about the new lid.

49:34.980 --> 49:36.660
Oh, okay.

49:36.660 --> 49:37.500
All right.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.900
Doing a Tim Hortons,

49:38.900 --> 49:40.740
hold on, let me do my Beeb voice.

49:41.820 --> 49:43.580
Doing a Tim Hortons collab

49:43.580 --> 49:45.500
has always been a dream of mine.

49:45.500 --> 49:47.340
Bieber said in a statement,

49:47.340 --> 49:49.140
I grew up on Tim Hortons.

49:49.140 --> 49:51.620
It's always been something close to my heart.

49:52.660 --> 49:56.660
Hope Bagozi, Chief Marketing Officer for Tim Hortons,

49:56.660 --> 50:00.340
said Bieber's genuine lifelong love of the brand

50:00.340 --> 50:02.260
made the collaboration authentic.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.980
Indeed, this threat for the Ontario-raised performer

50:05.980 --> 50:09.180
has shared posts as far back as a decade ago

50:09.180 --> 50:12.380
about missing Tim Hortons while traveling outside Canada.

50:12.380 --> 50:17.380
Justin is so fervent in how much he loves Tim's.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.260
Bagozi said in an interview,

50:22.300 --> 50:25.460
that is the perfect recipe for a collaboration.

50:25.460 --> 50:26.380
Oh.

50:26.380 --> 50:28.260
It's not forced.

50:29.500 --> 50:33.940
Hope Bagozi assures you, it's not forced.

50:33.940 --> 50:38.940
While hockey, Hope says, will always be part of our DNA.

50:39.420 --> 50:41.460
She said the celebrity partnership with Bieber

50:41.460 --> 50:43.220
will help reach new customers.

50:43.220 --> 50:46.340
It opens us up to a different audience

50:46.340 --> 50:50.980
and a different conversation beyond just hockey.

50:50.980 --> 50:53.060
It sounds like they're doing a bunch of damage control

50:53.060 --> 50:55.020
because Justin Bieber's last album was called

50:55.020 --> 50:57.180
Fuck Hockey and everyone who likes it.

50:58.740 --> 51:00.100
Justin has wide appeal,

51:00.100 --> 51:03.220
but definitely does appeal to younger guests.

51:03.220 --> 51:06.740
Nabbing Bieber is a major coup for the chain.

51:06.740 --> 51:09.140
The genesis of the collaboration

51:09.140 --> 51:11.900
can be traced back to 2019

51:11.900 --> 51:14.940
when the superstar waded into a heated debate

51:14.940 --> 51:17.780
about Tim Hortons lid redesign

51:17.780 --> 51:20.780
by launching a poll on his Instagram account.

51:20.780 --> 51:23.300
Now I'm going to read you this verbatim.

51:23.300 --> 51:26.820
This is Justin Bieber took some time out of his day

51:26.820 --> 51:28.060
to write this text.

51:29.300 --> 51:31.420
I know they could leak,

51:31.420 --> 51:34.260
but it was easier to drink out of.

51:34.260 --> 51:37.220
The coffee would come out better.

51:37.220 --> 51:41.060
These new lids are uncomfortable on the mouth.

51:41.060 --> 51:41.900
And you get.

51:41.900 --> 51:46.900
You guys remember when Justin Bieber

51:48.140 --> 51:53.300
let fucking Larry David take over his insta-frenate?

51:53.300 --> 51:55.860
You get very little liquid each drink.

51:55.860 --> 51:59.020
It's a damn outrage and it needs to be changed back.

51:59.020 --> 52:01.380
It's a damn outrage?

52:01.380 --> 52:05.780
Tibi H, Tibi H, it shouldn't be plastic.

52:05.780 --> 52:08.500
Find a way to be recyclable.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.660
Let's change the world one lid at a time.

52:10.660 --> 52:13.340
Bieber, I love you.

52:13.340 --> 52:15.860
That was the start of a conversation

52:15.860 --> 52:20.300
because he said he was quite keen to do something with us.

52:20.300 --> 52:23.300
So it's been almost two years in the making.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.620
To do donut hauls.

52:25.660 --> 52:29.260
Giving 10 bits are one of his favorite menu items.

52:29.260 --> 52:33.780
The idea of coming up with new flavors was a natural fit.

52:33.780 --> 52:38.780
He was super excited because that's his go-to item.

52:39.260 --> 52:43.260
Because, he said, we probably started out

52:43.260 --> 52:46.540
with about 100 possibilities.

52:46.540 --> 52:49.020
We would send him samples to try.

52:49.020 --> 52:53.660
And he was very specific on what he liked and didn't like.

52:53.660 --> 52:58.500
It was months in the making to land on these three flavors.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.860
I feel like I'm sensing a bit of frustration

53:01.860 --> 53:03.980
from Hope Bagozi.

53:03.980 --> 53:07.740
They look, I will say, delicious.

53:07.740 --> 53:09.780
What do the flavors count, Junior?

53:11.300 --> 53:12.580
Here it comes, are you ready?

53:12.580 --> 53:13.420
Yeah.

53:14.340 --> 53:15.180
You know what?

53:15.180 --> 53:16.860
I'm going to play the advertisement.

53:16.860 --> 53:17.860
Okay.

53:17.860 --> 53:19.500
Because I don't know if it's good or not,

53:19.500 --> 53:23.220
but I will play it and if it's bad, we'll cut it out.

53:23.220 --> 53:25.220
Does it seem- Sure, sure.

53:25.220 --> 53:27.740
Have a seat, we have some coffee for you.

53:27.740 --> 53:29.300
I'm just gonna take you through it.

53:29.300 --> 53:32.540
So, Justin, I know you've always loved Tim's.

53:32.540 --> 53:33.380
Obsessed.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.420
Which is why we're so excited to partner with you

53:35.420 --> 53:37.140
to create brand new Timbit flavors.

53:37.140 --> 53:38.220
Let's go. Let's go.

53:38.220 --> 53:39.620
Brainstorming, brainstorming.

53:39.620 --> 53:40.460
He's juggling Timbits.

53:40.460 --> 53:44.700
Can you imagine if we did a birthday cake waffle Timbit?

53:44.700 --> 53:46.820
Oh my, yes, yes.

53:46.820 --> 53:48.860
I can't even read my writing, it's so good.

53:48.860 --> 53:49.980
Think, think.

53:49.980 --> 53:50.820
Apple, banana.

53:50.820 --> 53:51.660
Apple.

53:51.660 --> 53:52.500
No.

53:53.380 --> 53:54.820
Thinking cap, put on the thinking cap.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.100
Apricot, latte.

53:56.100 --> 53:57.180
Yes. No, that's weird.

53:57.180 --> 53:58.500
Sorry. Think, Justin.

53:58.500 --> 53:59.540
Think. Yeah, get it out.

53:59.540 --> 54:00.740
Sour cream, chocolate chip.

54:00.740 --> 54:02.300
Yes, yes, yes.

54:02.300 --> 54:05.020
What if we do a chocolate white fudge?

54:05.020 --> 54:06.220
There it is.

54:06.220 --> 54:08.020
Yeah, now all we need is a name.

54:08.020 --> 54:10.060
Timbits by Justin Bieber.

54:10.060 --> 54:12.060
No, Justin Bieber's Timbits.

54:12.060 --> 54:13.300
I got it.

54:13.300 --> 54:14.660
Timbiebs.

54:16.100 --> 54:17.500
It's perfect.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.100
Introducing my new Timbiebs.

54:19.100 --> 54:21.780
Birthday cake waffle, sour cream, chocolate chip,

54:21.780 --> 54:23.140
and chocolate white fudge.

54:23.140 --> 54:24.060
Only at Tim's.

54:25.460 --> 54:26.620
This is my balls.

54:26.620 --> 54:30.100
If you eat my balls, I'm Timbiebs.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.100
I changed my name.

54:32.100 --> 54:36.900
These are better than me, so I'm changing my name to Timbiebs.

54:36.900 --> 54:38.340
That was a great commercial.

54:38.340 --> 54:39.660
I'm so excited about these three players.

54:39.660 --> 54:41.380
I'm excited to have my brother back.

54:41.380 --> 54:44.020
Yeah, I'm excited that Cat Donut walked into the sunlight.

54:44.020 --> 54:45.500
It brought me back, it revived me.

54:45.500 --> 54:48.900
He left, and he said, the last thing he said was,

54:48.900 --> 54:51.180
I've got to go play Fortnite.

54:51.180 --> 54:52.580
And then he flew out the window.

54:52.580 --> 54:53.420
Ah, what a cool youth.

54:53.420 --> 54:54.540
God, what a fucking cool dude.

54:54.540 --> 54:55.380
It's cool, yeah.

54:55.380 --> 54:56.220
I miss him, frankly.

54:56.220 --> 54:57.060
I'd rather it was still done.

54:57.060 --> 55:00.500
Exclusively in Canada and in the United States

55:00.500 --> 55:02.900
on November 29th.

55:02.900 --> 55:06.780
So like, I think I gotta get to Tim's, right?

55:06.780 --> 55:09.260
Like, I feel like I'm gonna have to get to Tim's.

55:09.260 --> 55:10.100
Yeah.

55:10.100 --> 55:12.180
They've got Tim's in Seattle?

55:12.180 --> 55:13.020
They got Tim's up there?

55:13.020 --> 55:14.620
Surely.

55:14.620 --> 55:16.020
Surely, right?

55:16.020 --> 55:18.020
It's not all Starbucks.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.460
Yeah, I would like that.

55:19.460 --> 55:21.620
Hey, thanks so much for listening to our podcast.

55:21.620 --> 55:22.460
Yeah.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.100
We had such a fun time.

55:24.100 --> 55:27.420
I'm sorry that I used the whole second half of the show.

55:27.420 --> 55:28.260
It was a good one.

55:28.260 --> 55:29.260
I mean, it was a good one.

55:29.260 --> 55:30.100
It's fun.

55:30.100 --> 55:30.940
It's a fun one.

55:30.940 --> 55:32.380
It's exciting, and I'm so,

55:32.380 --> 55:33.980
guys, if you could see these motherfuckers,

55:33.980 --> 55:34.820
I'm so hungry.

55:34.820 --> 55:35.660
They do sound good.

55:36.780 --> 55:37.620
I love, I even love.

55:37.620 --> 55:39.780
I don't know that I've ever heard

55:39.780 --> 55:41.620
a donut hole described and thought like,

55:41.620 --> 55:42.780
that sounds like shit.

55:42.780 --> 55:45.980
Timbits, Timbits ready donut holes

55:45.980 --> 55:48.180
are like the perfect amount of donut, right?

55:48.180 --> 55:50.340
It's like, oh, just a little donut for me, thank you.

55:50.340 --> 55:52.420
Well, it's hard to throw a regular sized donut up

55:52.420 --> 55:54.460
in the air and catch it in your mouth.

55:54.460 --> 55:56.660
I can't believe we haven't talked about this before,

55:56.660 --> 55:59.820
but we're doing another virtual Candle Nights special.

55:59.820 --> 56:02.220
Did one last year, loved it so much.

56:02.220 --> 56:06.420
Doing it this year, December 18th, 9 p.m. Eastern time.

56:06.420 --> 56:08.700
It's a pre-taped video spectacular

56:08.700 --> 56:09.940
that benefits Harmony House

56:09.940 --> 56:11.980

56:20.940 --> 56:23.060

56:23.060 --> 56:26.100

56:26.100 --> 56:29.060
We're gonna have segments from My Brother, My Brother, Me,

56:29.060 --> 56:32.540
Sawbones, Schmaners, Wonderful, Still Buffering, and Neat,

56:32.540 --> 56:34.420
as well as some amazing guests.

56:34.420 --> 56:37.300
And I don't know if I should spoil any of them,

56:37.300 --> 56:38.940
but they're really, really good.

56:38.940 --> 56:43.940
Trust me, we've outdone ourselves, but having cool friends.

56:44.820 --> 56:45.660
So check that out.

56:45.660 --> 56:46.820
That's a good way of saying

56:46.820 --> 56:49.580
the friends we had last year aren't-

56:49.580 --> 56:54.140
They were lame ducks compared to these cool friends.

56:54.140 --> 56:56.620
Bit.ly slash Candle Nights 2021.

56:56.620 --> 56:59.220

57:31.340 --> 57:32.740
The Candle Nights mug.

57:32.740 --> 57:34.980

57:59.340 --> 58:02.220
there's a new episode of Till Death Doors Blart up right now.

58:02.220 --> 58:03.220
So go check that out.

58:03.220 --> 58:04.060
Yes.

58:04.980 --> 58:06.140
I think I will, Travis.

58:06.140 --> 58:06.980
Well, no, not you.

58:06.980 --> 58:08.460
We still have to finish the show, Justin.

58:08.460 --> 58:10.300
So like, don't do that.

58:10.300 --> 58:12.380
But we do want to thank Montaigne

58:12.380 --> 58:14.060
for our intro and outro music,

58:14.060 --> 58:16.980
My Life is Better with You, which is available now

58:16.980 --> 58:19.580
wherever good music is found.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.300
If you haven't watched the music video for that,

58:21.300 --> 58:22.260
it's on our YouTube too.

58:22.260 --> 58:24.740
And I think it's a very cute.

58:24.740 --> 58:28.660
I think it's a real cutie patootie of a music video,

58:28.660 --> 58:29.500
if you will.

58:30.260 --> 58:32.220
Now, Trav, Griffin had to step away

58:32.220 --> 58:36.340
for what I can only imagine is a bathroom emergency.

58:36.340 --> 58:39.580
But he did send me the text for his final Yahoo.

58:39.580 --> 58:40.420
So I'll just forward this to you.

58:40.420 --> 58:42.220
Oh, thank you.

58:42.220 --> 58:43.700
Yeah, you should see it there.

58:43.700 --> 58:45.300
Huh, why is it?

58:46.140 --> 58:46.980
That's weird.

58:46.980 --> 58:50.020
It's like in a Google doc, right?

58:50.020 --> 58:53.380
But like the handwriting is smudged somehow.

58:53.380 --> 58:55.100
Yeah, that's weird.

58:55.100 --> 58:56.220
You can't make it out?

58:57.420 --> 58:58.260
Let me see.

58:58.260 --> 58:59.100
Let me see if I can.

58:59.100 --> 59:00.100
Okay, okay.

59:00.100 --> 59:02.460
Let me see what is written here.

59:02.460 --> 59:03.300
Okay.

59:03.300 --> 59:06.140
Just read the, it's still very legible.

59:06.140 --> 59:07.100
Okay.

59:07.100 --> 59:09.020
Maybe your screen is smudged.

59:09.020 --> 59:11.420
Might be.

59:11.420 --> 59:14.620
Okay, this is sent to us by Punxsutawney Phil.

59:16.020 --> 59:17.860
The, sorry, the-

59:17.860 --> 59:19.340
It doesn't say.

59:20.380 --> 59:21.660
Okay, so it could be any Phil.

59:21.660 --> 59:23.980
It could be any, yeah.

59:23.980 --> 59:26.140
I mean, I think we're led to believe,

59:26.140 --> 59:29.140
but it could be sent to us by Punxsutawney Phil,

59:29.140 --> 59:34.140
but it's written, it's written by-

59:36.100 --> 59:36.940
Go on.

59:36.940 --> 59:40.660
It's written by Michelangelo.

59:42.460 --> 59:45.260
Sorry, art or turtle?

59:45.260 --> 59:47.100
It's written by Michelangelo here.

59:48.340 --> 59:49.980
Art or turtle?

59:49.980 --> 59:52.940
I don't see a difference between those two, frankly.

59:52.940 --> 59:54.620
Because martial arts is an art

59:54.620 --> 59:56.700
when you think about it, Justin.

59:56.700 --> 59:57.940
Fair, yes.

59:57.940 --> 01:00:01.040
It says here, aw, ding, dang it.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.460
I done went and got pizza inside my shell again.

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.060
And that's going to make it hard for me

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.140
to paint the Sistine Chapel.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.580
So if anybody knows how to clean pizza

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.140
out of a turtle shell and paint brushes,

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.980
please let me know.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.180
Totally tubular, a-ree-va-der-chee, Michelangelo.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.420
But it was just-

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.140
I'm Travis Zacharroi.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.940
And I'm Griffin Zacharroi.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.780
There he is.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.660
This has been my brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad,

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.180
Square on the Lips.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:01:06.180
It's better with you.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.180
It's better with you.
