WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 01:17.260
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin

01:17.900 --> 01:22.120
I'm your middle brother Travis big dog whoo-hoo for McElroy

01:25.980 --> 01:27.700
This is baby brother Griffin back

01:27.700 --> 01:32.940
I just I just learned what you all were talking about that we should do for the intro and it's like I've fallen down

01:32.940 --> 01:36.060
Oh, well a delicious pizza, right? Yeah

01:37.980 --> 01:40.100
You guys heard about this Papa John guy

01:40.100 --> 01:46.780
Okay, so let's start Justin why don't you start us off on a good foot I just

01:47.780 --> 01:50.100
It is it is weird

01:50.780 --> 01:56.060
It is weird. Uh-huh that my brother my brother me a comedy advice show

01:56.540 --> 02:01.980
Has like a super villain, you know what I mean? It's yeah, it's weird

02:02.380 --> 02:05.420
It's weird that we have a Sinestro. Yeah

02:05.420 --> 02:09.420
Yeah, like yeah our energy with his own energy

02:10.220 --> 02:15.820
Papa John schnatter who probably still calls himself that I don't think it's just I don't think it's schnatter

02:16.100 --> 02:20.100
But I do like her it's it's natter. It's not on schnatter

02:20.780 --> 02:22.780
schnatter

02:24.260 --> 02:27.860
Papa John schnatter needs a schnatter Papa John need a schnack

02:28.500 --> 02:35.140
He's still obsessed with Papa John's cuz he's Papa John or was Papa John until they stripped him of his title

02:35.140 --> 02:42.500
Papa John the the pizza chain that includes ratty old banana peppers and garlic grease in every pizza

02:44.580 --> 02:49.940
It has always seemed like they just spilled some banana peppers in the box they weren't too lazy to clean it

02:49.940 --> 02:54.260
I can't get these out of here. I can't get these banana peppers out of here. So this dude

02:55.300 --> 02:58.140
This dude did an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek

02:58.140 --> 03:04.620
And this is the like and I credit to them big ups to Devin Leonard and the whole team over there

03:04.620 --> 03:08.060
because the very first quote of this piece is

03:09.180 --> 03:11.060
If you don't know about Papa John by the way

03:11.060 --> 03:17.220
He was ousted from the company Papa John's that he found it for being an absolute shitbird right in a story

03:17.740 --> 03:19.740
It was a crucifixion

03:20.380 --> 03:27.240
Says John schnatter sure it was unethical. It was immoral. It was evil

03:27.460 --> 03:29.300
Yes, yes folks

03:29.300 --> 03:31.940
They crucified Papa John

03:31.940 --> 03:39.540
He calls it an unethical crucifixion as opposed to you know, all those ethical crucifixions going around

03:39.540 --> 03:42.840
All those chill crucifixions that you've read about in your fairy tales

03:44.940 --> 03:51.920
Progressive elite left wouldn't let me say the n-word while I made pepperoni pizza and it was a crucifixion

03:52.820 --> 03:59.060
Okay, the one thing that struck me as soon as I saw the title of the piece of Papa John is still obsessed with Papa John's

03:59.060 --> 04:04.240
That's the one thing about Papa John schnatter that I thought yeah

04:04.580 --> 04:09.320
Yeah, I get that if there was a restaurant out there that I started called Travis McElroy's and then

04:09.860 --> 04:13.060
Kicked me out. I'd still think of Travis McElroy's from time to time

04:13.060 --> 04:18.580
Yeah, would you refer to yourself as being unethically crucified? No, no

04:19.140 --> 04:24.420
I think maybe I might say like I was justifiably crucified. I get it. Yeah. Yeah

04:24.420 --> 04:29.900
Absolutely, he blames it on the upper elite left progressive and I don't know about me being upper elite

04:29.900 --> 04:35.820
but I'm certainly a left progressive and I have fucked around with Papa John's pizza and his garlic dip homes from time to time in

04:35.820 --> 04:39.380
My youth not so much these days and even then when I heard the news

04:39.660 --> 04:46.140
The big news about Papa John schnatter saying the bad word on a call and then getting immediately fired

04:46.140 --> 04:48.660
My response was pretty fucking cool. Yeah

04:48.660 --> 04:54.620
You know, you don't have to be elite or progressive to look at this man and say I'm glad he got it. I

04:55.580 --> 04:56.780
mean

04:56.780 --> 04:57.980
the

04:57.980 --> 05:04.140
This whole thing. So like here's the timeline on this dude in December 2017

05:05.100 --> 05:12.460
Papa John was complaining that their shareholders were being harmed by the NFL because they didn't punish black players for protesting racism

05:12.460 --> 05:19.120
Yeah, immediately after that. He was like, okay. Well, I have thought about it and I'm retiring as the CEO

05:19.460 --> 05:23.420
And you would think that might be the end of it, but nope just here

05:24.420 --> 05:26.300
Just a year later

05:26.300 --> 05:32.420
Sorry, seven months. He word leaked about the the fact that he had used a

05:33.140 --> 05:38.060
Racial slur pretty much on one of the real bumming. They're all pretty bad. But he is the n-word

05:38.100 --> 05:41.740
He said on a conference call bad bad job

05:41.740 --> 05:43.220
there

05:43.220 --> 05:48.100
John and he had to leave as the CEO of the chairman. Yeah, and

05:48.980 --> 05:50.980
This was on a call

05:54.640 --> 06:00.820
Their ad agency had been working with Papa John on a strategy to counter the perception that he's racist

06:00.820 --> 06:07.980
you know that I've never had to do and Steve Buscemi has never had to do and Tom Hanks has never had to do and

06:07.980 --> 06:11.700
Roman Morris has never had to do and you know, I can name almost anybody

06:11.700 --> 06:16.460
There's never had to come up with a PR strategy to counter the perception that we're racist

06:16.460 --> 06:21.820
And then and then during said strategy session during such a session

06:22.500 --> 06:25.620
This is quite efforts. I wish I hadn't said the word

06:26.820 --> 06:32.320
Okay, cool. He had been attributing it to someone else during the call. Okay

06:32.320 --> 06:37.620
and they and he says he accuses the ad agency people of

06:38.200 --> 06:39.280
craftily

06:39.280 --> 06:41.800
Provoking him into doing so. Mmm. Yes

06:42.200 --> 06:46.160
There are different machinations finally tricked me into saying the n-word

06:46.160 --> 06:46.480
Yes

06:46.480 --> 06:51.720
the people that you were paying to make you look good whose job it was to make you look good and they were getting a lot

06:51.720 --> 06:57.200
Of money from you to do so wanted to make you look bad. He came after a colonel Sanders

06:57.720 --> 06:59.720
Saying like he was racist

06:59.720 --> 07:05.280
Yeah, but us in the same camp and it's like I mean probably his grandkids say no

07:05.280 --> 07:06.920
He wasn't he was great

07:06.920 --> 07:12.760
But you know in the in the big fast-food industry who can tell but he was like so what colonel Sanders did is worse

07:12.760 --> 07:14.760
Come in back, baby Papa John

07:15.840 --> 07:20.920
Parallels, here's an interesting one from Jonathan Mays editor-in-chief of the trade magazine restaurant business

07:21.080 --> 07:27.160
Who said the crisis was comparable to the one subway faced in 2015 when Jared Fogel its chief

07:27.160 --> 07:33.880
Smokesperson pleaded guilty to just receiving and distributing child pornography and to engaging in commercial sex with minors

07:34.120 --> 07:36.920
Yet there was a difference. There's a slight difference with those

07:39.640 --> 07:42.500
Fogel thing came down subway could dismiss him

07:42.520 --> 07:49.960
Yes, try to start fixing things and and frankly the name of the restaurant wasn't Jared the Fogel place Fogel

07:50.720 --> 07:51.880
Yeah

07:51.880 --> 07:58.720
Jared's kids club. It's not it's not that it's not that it's not about Jared and Jared's different things

07:58.920 --> 08:00.800
just a quick reminder to

08:00.800 --> 08:02.040
regarding

08:02.040 --> 08:08.840
Mr. Papa is that I during all of this and him talk about his let me check. Yes crucifixion

08:08.840 --> 08:15.040
He did also drop a tick-tock a video in which he took people on a tour of his giant

08:15.040 --> 08:22.120
Mansion, yeah, they involved what appears to be like a 12 foot tall statue of two Eagles fucking in flight

08:22.120 --> 08:26.720
This is brand now his brand is opulence. Yeah, right

08:26.720 --> 08:31.200
That's his brand now is the opulence of Papa John. Is he going to commission?

08:33.000 --> 08:36.660
Commission an 18 foot tall painting of him as the Christ

08:37.160 --> 08:43.360
upon the cross with garlic dip dripping out of his as Shaq looks on as Shaq looks on

08:43.360 --> 08:47.120
This to me Shaq you betray you are my protege Shaq and now

08:47.760 --> 08:52.200
They so they had to remove his face from pizza boxes. Yeah scrub

08:53.760 --> 08:56.320
Scrub all references to him from its website

08:57.000 --> 09:03.680
Pictures of Schnatter on the walls of its Louisville headquarters had to go to yeah last September Papa John's

09:03.680 --> 09:11.440
Last September Papa John's announced it was relocating many corporate functions to Atlanta physically distancing itself from its namesake

09:11.440 --> 09:15.880
Do you know how wild things have to be for them to be like we have to move away from Papa John

09:15.880 --> 09:19.480
I can still smell him. He's must be in the air. He still drives by every day

09:21.480 --> 09:23.880
It's real slow and creepy too I hate it

09:24.880 --> 09:31.640
He got half a billion dollars in stock when he cat when he cashed out you could start another pizza chain

09:31.640 --> 09:36.600
You could start another pizza chain John if you really want to win us over. I

09:38.240 --> 09:40.240
Mean no, there is no way no

09:41.240 --> 09:46.040
Okay, better pizza better pizza does not forgive your mini trespasses John

09:46.800 --> 09:51.580
Better pizza better ingredients still races still Papa John's too

09:52.440 --> 09:58.560
Can we just talk about just for a minute just for a minute? Everyone just for a minute. There's definitely been a

09:58.560 --> 10:01.880
a conversation that went nowhere within

10:02.320 --> 10:07.480
Papa John's HQ where they were like should we change our name and they're like no

10:07.480 --> 10:13.520
he's just changed his name and like because this has been going on for a while and Papa John's the

10:13.920 --> 10:15.920
corporate entity has

10:16.200 --> 10:24.160
Definitely made the conscious decision at some point to continue to be Papa John's and at first

10:24.160 --> 10:27.800
there's one of two ways I feel about this either that's like why are you still or

10:27.800 --> 10:32.320
It's really really spiteful towards John Schnatter to be like

10:33.160 --> 10:36.480
We're still Papa John's. We're Papa John. You're not Papa John

10:37.320 --> 10:41.880
Here's a here's a here's a call. God. We have so many quotes about this gentle this guy

10:41.880 --> 10:48.400
He just don't stop and this is actually I think it's like actually very instructive in your life

10:48.600 --> 10:54.460
You may feel like your goal is to have so much money that you never have to think about money again

10:54.460 --> 10:59.300
I think that's a it's a very American idea, right? But John Schnatter is like

11:00.620 --> 11:06.660
Definitely proof that you can have as much money as you want and you might still be mad that someone says you can't be

11:06.660 --> 11:12.280
A pizza anymore, right? What's that? He can't be this is what he said to OA and in this is a bunch of

11:12.660 --> 11:17.700
It's one of the oh, that's the one America News Network does it? Yeah, that's just the one America News Network

11:18.860 --> 11:20.860
the woke

11:20.860 --> 11:22.860
It's already bad

11:22.940 --> 11:30.700
Mob doesn't want you to have children's books. What as displayed by the cancellation of dr. Seuss earlier this year

11:30.700 --> 11:32.700
I don't think that's what that meant now

11:33.900 --> 11:36.780
They're apparently coming for your pizza. No dog

11:37.780 --> 11:45.460
So much better pizza my friend and better ingredients. I would argue that Papa John's came for your pizza. Mr

11:45.460 --> 11:51.020
Schnatter, yeah, we came for your pizza. You you don't have the pizza anymore. We saw her over here

11:51.020 --> 11:56.740
Enjoy more macaroni and cheese and no one's out there on the fucking Ides of March stabbing little Caesars

11:56.740 --> 12:01.920
Everybody's like yeah, the hot and ready sucks, but it's $5. Go for it. It's fine during your tenure

12:02.420 --> 12:06.060
Jonathan your shit got overtaken by fucking

12:06.700 --> 12:14.380
Dominoes. Yeah, how does that feel Jonathan Domino's got better than Papa John's you've lost your way sir

12:14.380 --> 12:20.540
You have a statue of eagles. You don't know what people want in pizza. When was the last time?

12:20.980 --> 12:24.180
John you ate a pizza and didn't do a racist

12:24.180 --> 12:29.060
I mean I ate 800 of his own pizzas in what four months or something. That was famously

12:30.140 --> 12:34.900
Famously reported. Yeah, that's a lot of pizza. This is really good

12:34.980 --> 12:41.380
He's kept the this article talks about how he's cashed out the half billion in stock and he's like just out here

12:41.380 --> 12:46.260
It says he's out there jetting in his Dassault Falcon between homes in Kentucky, Florida and Utah

12:46.860 --> 12:51.420
Posting highlights and motivational bromides on tick-tock. He's protecting his best life

12:51.860 --> 12:57.540
Except his best life is the one he no longer has the one where he's still running Papa John's. Yeah

12:59.140 --> 13:04.820
Devastating his fucking black suits and his dyed jet black hair like he's fucking Johnny trash

13:04.820 --> 13:09.300
I just want to point out this this motherfucker has

13:09.300 --> 13:13.140
500 million dollars and three homes

13:13.140 --> 13:20.180
It sounds like and a jet to take him betwixt them and he's still complaining. It's about legacy Travis

13:20.180 --> 13:22.180
It's about legacy. You should know legacy

13:23.020 --> 13:28.020
Wait, why should I know that most of all Griffin? This shows our this shows our legacy it is

13:28.020 --> 13:30.620
Oh, man, we should start taking a little bit more seriously

13:30.620 --> 13:33.900
Well, yeah a good name for the Papa Joe and we will move on eventually folks. Don't worry

13:33.900 --> 13:39.020
This is not a grandpa situation if we did have to rename the Papa John's restaurant

13:39.020 --> 13:40.100
Yeah

13:40.100 --> 13:46.540
My mind went to Papa Pizza. Papa Pizza is pretty good. And then it went to Mama Mia. Papa Pizza come

13:47.780 --> 13:49.780
Come and get some diarrhea, which is

13:52.900 --> 13:57.020
What about pop-pop John's pop-pop or just pop-pops

13:59.980 --> 14:03.980
About Papa Papa Roni and then you only serve pepperoni pizzas

14:05.500 --> 14:07.500
Roni pizza for dogs

14:07.500 --> 14:08.660
Oh

14:08.660 --> 14:10.660
We're getting a little too. That's like yeah

14:10.660 --> 14:14.340
You know what? I say lean into it just called Papa Shax just oh

14:15.020 --> 14:19.580
The new thing Papa Shax would be who'd be good

14:19.580 --> 14:24.280
I would eat and we truly powerful and and also the most powerful fart in the face

14:24.280 --> 14:29.780
One could deliver to Papa John's would be to keep the Papa part and just change the John part

14:29.780 --> 14:38.220
Yeah, it's like no, this is Papa Shax. He's my new dad. This is my new pizza dad Papa Shax. I love him

14:39.020 --> 14:41.020
He lets me do whatever I want

14:41.780 --> 14:47.820
He makes me very happy Papa Shax. This is a I'm just continuing to he

14:48.460 --> 14:53.920
Originally when people were reporting about him trivializing the protests of black players in the NFL

14:54.300 --> 14:58.060
His their PR firm at the time Edelman said that he needed to

14:58.060 --> 15:01.280
Not acknowledge it and keep quiet and let it blow over

15:02.180 --> 15:04.180
Y'all are in denial. Shall

15:04.460 --> 15:09.780
Schnatter remembers replied. I'm Papa John. This is not going to blow over

15:14.700 --> 15:16.700
Enduring credit

15:17.660 --> 15:19.460
In this regard

15:19.460 --> 15:24.980
He was correct. Yeah real Nostradamus that guy he was right about that

15:24.980 --> 15:29.180
Correct. Good job. Maybe not right in the way. He thought he was right

15:30.020 --> 15:33.060
Right. He was correct. His thoughts were wrong

15:33.100 --> 15:36.900
But his truth in that matter was was kind of on point

15:36.900 --> 15:42.060
It did not blow over even a little bit as evidenced by the fact that we've been talking about this gentleman for 15 minutes

15:42.060 --> 15:44.060
It's real piece of shit

15:44.780 --> 15:51.980
All right, let's let's let's start I can't I could actually talk about Papa John all day because I it's just like he's our nemesis

15:51.980 --> 15:57.580
But the problem is and this is the real problem is it's making me hungry for Papa

15:58.700 --> 16:01.620
Sucks. It's really infuriating. I would love one of those

16:05.340 --> 16:08.540
Find a local place a local Papa John's no

16:11.020 --> 16:14.900
Although now that he's cashed out it doesn't mean nothing you can

16:15.460 --> 16:18.220
Now with confidence my local Papa John's

16:18.220 --> 16:25.980
They're the sign they have outside has not changed to update with specials for 18 months

16:25.980 --> 16:28.860
It has said independently own. Yep

16:29.900 --> 16:35.260
That's the only thing I need to know. Yeah, I just give me a to give me a double chacarroni

16:35.620 --> 16:37.740
All right, let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do the show. Please. I

16:38.020 --> 16:42.820
Can't we'll do the show. It's an advice show folks. What folks? This is an advice show

16:42.820 --> 16:46.860
It is and Justin doesn't have the question list. No, I'm pulling it up

16:46.860 --> 16:51.500
I get so many emails anymore. I feel like yeah, but the show doesn't sneak up on you

16:51.500 --> 16:55.860
I feel like Google's letting a lot of space busy read what I'm getting the same thing

16:55.860 --> 17:00.340
Very you're getting a lot of spam on Google, right? Yeah, it's wild. It's wild. Come on Google. I

17:00.980 --> 17:06.980
Was going through the drive-thru of fast food. Oh my shit. Wait. Hey Justin what happy birthday

17:08.080 --> 17:11.300
What? Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Happy birthday. Oh, man

17:11.380 --> 17:16.180
We could have talked about that for the intro, but John stole that from us John my birthday

17:16.180 --> 17:19.800
I think we can all agree. This is the worst thing he's ever done

17:25.780 --> 17:31.260
I was just going it's it's oh, it's just nice to have one that you know, you know what I mean?

17:31.260 --> 17:33.660
Yeah, you're not gonna get the rug pulled out from under you

17:34.180 --> 17:37.700
Right, like when you find out Guy Fieri is secretly a pretty good dude

17:37.700 --> 17:42.260
I'm not gonna get the rope pulled out from under me, right? Yeah, and this one we're not getting any tweets

17:42.260 --> 17:46.100
Like I think you guys were kind of unfair too hard on Papa John. No, he sucks

17:47.300 --> 17:49.300
Guy fear I'd love to have you on the show

17:50.100 --> 17:56.180
Please if you're there, I'd love to hear there. I was just going through the drive-thru of a fast-food chain restaurant

17:56.540 --> 18:01.780
Just say shacks place. Yeah, where I ordered and received an ice cream code. Okay, that's not shacks

18:01.980 --> 18:04.900
It is to my delight very tall and yummy

18:05.580 --> 18:10.540
However, as I was pulling out of the drive-thru, I got a little fender bender on another car

18:10.540 --> 18:17.060
I need to get out a car or call the police at exchange insurance details, but I'm holding this ice cream code

18:18.660 --> 18:26.460
So fucking awesome should I just keep licking my ice cream cone while I speak with the person I just rear-end it

18:28.300 --> 18:30.300
Should I stay in my car until after

18:33.700 --> 18:37.380
They don't say this but presumably should I write an email to you guys

18:37.380 --> 18:44.500
Okay, I'm sure this already happened and there they want to check to see if they did the right right this is extremely awkward

18:44.500 --> 18:47.660
But I don't want to miss out on my ice cream code. It's delicious

18:49.100 --> 18:54.520
Wait, hello, that's from awkward ice cream in Atlanta. So maybe there's a varsity maybe

18:55.380 --> 19:03.300
What is amazing about this is that there's a secret third option, right one and two is you stay in your car just fucking

19:03.300 --> 19:09.740
Cold staring at this person while you lick your ice cream. He'd given them like one minute one minute, please

19:12.300 --> 19:18.660
It's creamy and sweet, so I'll be out in a minute or you hop out there you're like, oh my god, I'm so so sorry

19:21.060 --> 19:23.540
Oh gosh, yeah, I just actually got this

19:24.620 --> 19:30.620
Repainted. Oh god. Okay. I'm so the third option is you step out of the car really concerned

19:30.620 --> 19:35.140
And you look at the damage to your car and look at their car and then they walk up and like hey, are you okay?

19:35.140 --> 19:36.500
and you

19:36.500 --> 19:40.460
Take your ice cream cone and realizing that there's no good way to eat it while talking

19:40.580 --> 19:45.300
You throw it to the fucking ground and smash it so that it's not in the way anymore

19:45.540 --> 19:49.780
that's even that might be the worst of the situation if you do that though, you could be like

19:50.700 --> 19:54.340
Maybe we shouldn't involve insurance in this because we've both lost a lot, right?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.060
Yeah, sure. We both like we've both suffered. Yeah

19:57.060 --> 20:00.540
Oh, the back of your car is fucked up in the front of my car is fucked up

20:00.540 --> 20:04.220
But I also lost an ice cream cone in the exchange. So who's the fourth option?

20:04.220 --> 20:07.580
Oh, wow, they get out of the car you direct eye contact

20:08.140 --> 20:13.820
Eat the ice cream cone in like one big bite and keep a straight face

20:14.220 --> 20:19.900
Maintain icon no brain freeze face. Nothing. This is an intimidation play you've engaged in

20:19.940 --> 20:25.840
They're going to watch you how how how like you're gonna Pac-man that ice cream and then say

20:25.840 --> 20:28.100
Do we really need to get insurance involved, right?

20:28.700 --> 20:34.320
Just an asterisk asterisk on that option. It is only possible for Travis and Travis like

20:34.900 --> 20:39.580
Humans to pull that one off. I've been training right all my life for this

20:40.380 --> 20:46.500
Could you fifth option step out of the car and be like, oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. I really fucked up

20:46.540 --> 20:48.640
Here you go, and you give them the ice cream

20:49.220 --> 20:53.020
And then you get your you get your drive away. Yep. We're good

20:53.020 --> 20:58.740
Just stop stop stop stop come back here. No, no, I gave you the ice cream cone. We're good. Bye

20:59.620 --> 21:01.980
Did you not want the ice cream cones? I'll take it back

21:01.980 --> 21:05.940
But I do want it on the record that I was willing to give it to you

21:06.860 --> 21:13.460
Sixth option. Holy shit. There's so many before they see you after the big accident smash that ice cream cone on your face

21:13.860 --> 21:20.460
You walk outside and you gotta be crying covering your creamy face and you're like ice creams

21:20.460 --> 21:24.940
And they will not they'll be like don't okay, you're crying. Don't worry about it. Let's just drive

21:24.940 --> 21:28.100
Let's can we're saying you poor seventh option around seven

21:28.100 --> 21:28.620
Yeah

21:28.620 --> 21:33.800
quickly before they see you scoot over to the passenger seat and put the ice cream cone in the driver's seat and make it look

21:33.800 --> 21:35.800
Like it's the ice cream's fault

21:36.020 --> 21:38.400
What he was you didn't see him stop

21:39.660 --> 21:41.660
Sorry about this eighth option

21:42.260 --> 21:46.460
Do what Travis said but instead of putting the ice cream cone in the driver's seat

21:46.460 --> 21:51.180
Smash it on the windshield in front of the driver's seat and just start screaming inconsolably

21:56.620 --> 21:59.660
Is the ice cream cone your dad it was in fact my dad

22:00.540 --> 22:02.540
He was my dad

22:03.020 --> 22:07.380
I'm in one of those movies where my dad dies and then becomes an inanimate object

22:07.380 --> 22:12.740
But it's now animate and it was that ice cream. Go to do is delicious not ninth option

22:12.740 --> 22:16.220
Can you just slowly hand it to them and say here? I'm really sorry

22:16.220 --> 22:20.500
I got this for you cuz I figured I would probably hit you and I'm sorry. Yeah, this is for you

22:20.500 --> 22:23.140
Oh, I got like a prank show now. We're square

22:23.140 --> 22:27.820
I wasn't gonna get anything at this Dairy Queen, but then I saw you in front of me

22:27.820 --> 22:32.020
And I was like, I'm gonna ram that fucking idiot. So I bought you the ice cream cone in

22:34.820 --> 22:40.220
Good conversation starter cuz I wanted to meet you and maybe I got us two spoons

22:40.220 --> 22:46.300
Let's do this. You hit me really hard. Yeah. Yeah, it's a new car. I was excited getting used to yeah

22:46.380 --> 22:49.740
Hey, are you feeling this you feel this vibe vibing, right?

22:51.380 --> 22:56.140
Sharing an ice cream. Hey, hey officer. Does it seem like we're vibing the two of us

22:56.820 --> 23:03.260
These handcuffs so that I can hold their hand, please. Wait. No, just watch the ice cream, please. Please please you do

23:03.380 --> 23:08.180
Please do not finish it until the police arrive. Yeah, they have to see you. Yeah

23:08.180 --> 23:16.260
Yeah, they know you're not intimidating admittedly that if you're still eating ice cream when they arrive that might remove any doubt of whose fault

23:16.260 --> 23:20.780
This was yes, right if one person is just like well, sorry, I can't put this thing down

23:21.500 --> 23:26.100
Sorry, I was very clearly driving one-handed. No question

23:26.540 --> 23:31.380
Actually, if you look down you'll see my special necklace that holds the ice cream cone for me so I can eat

23:32.220 --> 23:34.220
Is prescription?

23:35.020 --> 23:36.660
Necklace, thank you

23:36.660 --> 23:40.080
Hey, can I do a quick wizard? Yeah, we visit the quick wizard

23:40.080 --> 23:44.020
He's the wizard of the clouds brother, but he's much faster, but not the wizard

23:44.020 --> 23:46.020
That sounds like something Travis would do. Yeah, of course

23:46.220 --> 23:48.580
Okay, this one's coming in a little bit late

23:48.580 --> 23:54.780
But you know lock it's good to learn this shit and remember it for one year because this one's about how to avoid taking off

23:54.780 --> 23:56.780
The actors in a haunted house. Oh

23:57.420 --> 24:01.460
I actually have inside and I've worked many a haunted house and I don't want to hear any of it

24:01.460 --> 24:06.140
Cuz you don't hear about when I fell asleep in a coffin. No, no, I only want to hear what the wizard has to say

24:06.140 --> 24:08.820
I love you Travis, but you are not the wizard or the quick wizard

24:08.820 --> 24:13.040
I got by a child once we know all the stories you've told all the stories

24:13.040 --> 24:16.760
It's time for the wizard to share his insights. This was sent in by Laura. Thank you, Laura

24:17.740 --> 24:23.260
Step one going through the house, but avoid pretending not to be afraid if you don't want to be targeted

24:23.860 --> 24:27.220
What acting tough or saying I'm not quintuple negative

24:27.220 --> 24:33.780
I know acting tough for saying I'm not scared indicates to the actors that you actually are which will likely try

24:33.780 --> 24:39.380
They will likely try even harder to frighten you or and this is a phrase they use a lot in this article pick on you

24:39.740 --> 24:45.300
Yeah, now what's great too is the the opposite is true if you walk through the house going like

24:48.380 --> 24:54.020
Then the actors are like look at that brave right so brave you can't show strength or weakness

24:54.780 --> 24:59.180
Some they they the quotes that they use here is what not to say at a haunted house

24:59.180 --> 25:04.300
Are they even trying to make this scary that blood is obviously fake if I worked at a haunted house

25:04.300 --> 25:06.420
And I heard someone are they even trying to make this scary?

25:06.420 --> 25:12.980
I would jump out at that person be like I'm gonna fucking kill you Greg just to boost it up way too far way too far

25:12.980 --> 25:19.060
Yeah, do not kill you and everyone you love right? Yeah, you'll go a little too fast walk in the middle of your group

25:19.060 --> 25:23.060
So the friends get scared first as a diagram. They've showed a

25:23.060 --> 25:29.140
Five on like a six-sided die and pointed at the middle dot and it says you so that's good

25:29.140 --> 25:33.820
If someone's hard, that's hard to or you need to practice that out in the parking lot first

25:34.020 --> 25:38.940
Yeah, like you can't start doing that once you're in the house. Yeah, kind of kind of fucked up

25:39.460 --> 25:46.460
If you're like, oh here comes a mummy with Dracula teeth get them Tommy and you push towards them if you have four

25:46.460 --> 25:53.140
Big brave friends. I get it. You know, yeah, you're kind of the Scooby-doo of the group

25:53.140 --> 25:59.980
Yeah, I get it. They could be like get away from Ralphie. He's really scared right now. He's going through a rough time in his job

26:01.460 --> 26:02.900
Cheer him up

26:02.900 --> 26:04.900
Refrain from scaring other house goers

26:05.540 --> 26:12.260
Which frustrates the actors that sucks boo Tommy got you and chainsaw man's like you fucking stepped on my line

26:12.260 --> 26:14.260
My line was blue. I got you

26:14.420 --> 26:15.620
shit

26:15.620 --> 26:19.980
Pretend not to see an impending scare. So you don't annoy the actors that that would be the worst

26:19.980 --> 26:25.180
That would be the worst. You're just up like a mummy with Dracula fangs and someone points like here comes a mummy with Dracula fangs

26:26.660 --> 26:32.060
I've been scared at all about this now, but you can then give some constructive criticism

26:32.060 --> 26:37.660
Yeah, like after everyone else has walked up like hey mummy with the vampire fangs. I could see you ahead of time

26:37.660 --> 26:40.900
So you might want to just take like one quick step back. Oh, yeah right there. That's great

26:40.900 --> 26:48.320
Oh, yeah, and maybe stop saying with your regular voice here comes a mummy with vampire fangs because it really gives away

26:48.820 --> 26:51.140
The scare a little bit. Let me recommend

26:51.420 --> 26:57.160
Let me recommend there's no mummy with vampire fangs over here and that will hold them into a false sense of security

26:57.540 --> 27:01.300
So the next one is move at a quick pace. So the actors have less time to prepare scare

27:01.300 --> 27:02.860
I love this you're at the front door

27:02.860 --> 27:08.180
The ticket taker is like prepare to enter the house of a million mummies with vampire fangs. You're like, haha. See you soon

27:08.180 --> 27:12.320
Just fucking full-blown sprint

27:14.260 --> 27:15.780
Slow down

27:15.780 --> 27:18.420
Hey careful, man, there's steps. There's steps in here

27:20.220 --> 27:25.420
Interacting with the actors avoid asking the actors not to scare you don't scare me mummy with vampire

27:27.340 --> 27:31.900
Wait, why not it says here in like a sub note which should be a main note

27:31.900 --> 27:36.700
Keep in mind that usually if an actor notices someone is genuinely upset or very frightened. They'll back off

27:36.700 --> 27:40.900
I don't know why they don't say that in like the first step of just like act

27:41.740 --> 27:47.160
Genuinely pretty fucked up like you're having a real episode right now

27:49.020 --> 27:51.400
From experience a group and I know you don't want to hear this but

27:51.980 --> 27:57.300
It can often be just a little note from me a former haunted house actor

27:57.620 --> 28:01.220
Just as scary if a terrifying scarecrow tries to comfort you

28:01.220 --> 28:08.140
Because the the difference between scaring and comforting when you're in a scary scarecrow mask, it's a pretty thin line

28:13.660 --> 28:15.660
Yeah, that's great

28:17.060 --> 28:19.780
Not it does it just just don't

28:20.580 --> 28:25.860
Don't push them. Yeah, don't try to scare the actors. I think though if you do if you are

28:25.860 --> 28:31.540
The you know a vampire mummy and yeah a house goer comes up on you and is like boom

28:31.540 --> 28:36.420
I'm the scary one and you get scared. You have to quit. Yeah, you have to actually switch places

28:36.860 --> 28:43.020
That's the only way to be free from working on a haunted house. Let's jump over to dressing appropriately. Awesome

28:45.660 --> 28:47.660
We're dark colored clothes

28:48.380 --> 28:53.260
Oh, that's annoying. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, don't do that. No, it says do do that

28:53.260 --> 28:56.420
We're dark colored clothes so that you're harder to see that's awesome

28:56.420 --> 29:01.180
If I do you hiding from the people that are trying to scare. Why did you go? Why did you go?

29:01.180 --> 29:03.180
Why did you stay home?

29:05.780 --> 29:08.780
Trying to look brave for a partner or potential partner

29:08.820 --> 29:13.860
We've all been there you got a crush and you want to scare the mummy vampire before it can scare you

29:13.860 --> 29:19.740
So then your crush is like damn I want an engaging consensual goings-ons with this person, right?

29:19.740 --> 29:26.260
Okay, these next two tips are I don't want to blow it out of proportion, but some real fucking all-timers

29:26.940 --> 29:31.420
Okay, cover up with a long-sleeve shirt and pants to hide your goosebumps

29:32.420 --> 29:34.420
Yeah

29:34.580 --> 29:35.740
Yeah

29:35.740 --> 29:38.060
You get goosebumps goosebumps when you're scared

29:38.060 --> 29:42.120
So those tiny dots all over your arms and legs are a dead giveaway to actors how?

29:42.780 --> 29:47.840
Brightly lit is this fucking hot house. Even if excuse me

29:47.840 --> 29:53.940
I don't mean to be rude, but I can see your fear. It's are you okay? Do you need a glass of water?

29:53.940 --> 29:57.700
I feel like if somebody's like I see your goosebumps

29:57.700 --> 30:01.940
You should be allowed to like light a flare in that room and call timeout timeout

30:02.340 --> 30:07.220
This guy's really fucking creepy in a real non haunted way

30:07.220 --> 30:15.460
And then the next one which is also very good choose a large puffy coat to look more intimidating

30:15.460 --> 30:22.460
Hell yes. Yeah get that starter jacket my dude. Yeah blue. I'm going to get oh shit. You're huge. Good bye

30:22.460 --> 30:24.460
Wave your arms in the air

30:26.460 --> 30:30.940
Yeah, I don't know if you saw this guy while we were you know hiding and being spooky vampire mummies

30:30.940 --> 30:33.940
This one dude came in and I was like, I'm gonna fucking get him

30:33.940 --> 30:40.260
But then I saw the side the size of this lad this absolute unit. I was like, I can't he might hurt

30:40.820 --> 30:43.940
In fact, he should play football. I'm thinking about like

30:44.620 --> 30:51.580
Managing him to try to get him into a pro baller career his head hands legs and feet all look pretty small

30:51.900 --> 30:54.780
But this dude's core was a gargantuan

30:55.340 --> 30:59.460
And then finally leave the masks at home. I don't it's like Disney World rules

30:59.460 --> 31:06.020
you can't show up being a you know, being a a chainsaw, you know, mommy and

31:06.020 --> 31:10.340
Then if somebody comes in and it's like also a chainsaw mommy, that would be confusing

31:10.980 --> 31:15.940
Mm-hmm. I once scared the shit out of Jonah Hill. I just wanted to throw that out. Just doesn't seem particularly difficult

31:16.540 --> 31:22.060
Yeah, he's from his films. He seems like he's jumpy. He would be all skittish. Yeah some Q&A

31:22.060 --> 31:27.100
What if I already did one of these things? Oh, you're going to jail try to avoid doing it again

31:27.100 --> 31:33.740
Honestly, the actors will probably understand if you slip up and do something silly look push punch kick. Oh, it's okay

31:33.740 --> 31:37.820
This is your first time first time. It's my fault. I'm a pretty scary vampire mummy

31:37.820 --> 31:44.220
I get why your instinct would be to hit me. And honestly, I saw your goosebumps and got a little overeager

31:44.220 --> 31:50.140
So, um, it's it we both can share the blame. And hey, here's another important haunted house fact

31:50.700 --> 31:54.740
One out of every hundred vampire mummies is a real vampire

31:54.740 --> 32:00.580
Mummy, so like I understand like it's not wanting to push and hit someone who is attacking you

32:00.580 --> 32:07.180
Not a bad impulse in any other circumstance. Yeah, I'm sorry guys. There's so many good Q&A's in here

32:07.180 --> 32:11.820
What do I do if you have medication but no medicines or prescriptions are allowed in the house?

32:11.820 --> 32:16.340
What welcome to the house of a billion murders no medicine

32:17.340 --> 32:19.340
Is that an inhaler?

32:19.340 --> 32:21.340
Put it in the bucket

32:21.340 --> 32:29.540
Put it in the bucket. Can I get it back at the end? No, one of our chainsaw mummies is very allergic to medicine

32:32.180 --> 32:38.460
One of the scariest things we can think of is a disbelief in science leave your medicine at the door medicine at home

32:38.460 --> 32:42.000
This is an awesome one to the actors like to scare homosexual people

32:42.000 --> 32:50.360
Huh? Whoa again back room after a hard day of scaring. Somebody's like, yeah, I saw his goosebumps. You know what that means

32:51.320 --> 32:54.320
Hey, hey, Bobby, how many do you get today?

32:54.320 --> 32:59.800
How many at least 12 at least 12 of them 12 and a half cuz one of them was bisexual

32:59.800 --> 33:04.460
So yeah, one what if an actor knows me and breaks character to stop and chat for a bit?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.480
Oh shit Daryl, what's up, bud?

33:09.480 --> 33:15.960
What? Think how cool that would look to your crush if your crush is like, huh Daryl knows vampire mummy

33:15.960 --> 33:21.760
Ooh la la he's really connected. Another cool one. What if someone scares me get the fuck out of the

33:22.320 --> 33:24.320
Don't go in the fucking building

33:27.920 --> 33:29.920
Can't get over the medicine

33:31.400 --> 33:34.400
We feed all the pills we get to the creature with a black look

33:34.400 --> 33:41.280
He just gobbles up any pill he sees right and you slip into one of the zombies but the zombies for texture for their makeup

33:41.280 --> 33:46.520
Was using peanut butter. Where's my epipen? You couldn't bring it in. No, I'm dying

33:46.520 --> 33:49.200
I know that's the ultimate spooky scare

33:49.880 --> 33:56.120
Pretty scary. Admit you're scared. We'll use your skeleton for the haunted house. Thank you very much

33:56.120 --> 34:01.720
Thank you. That's where skeletons come from. Where else are you supposed to get them? Just lock that in for one year folks

34:01.720 --> 34:08.400
Yep, sorry that it's a week late. Yeah, let's Travis everyone. I'm sure you'll remember everyone at home bless Travis

34:09.000 --> 34:12.040
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And also with you

34:12.520 --> 34:15.560
Let's take a quick break and we'll head on over the money zone

34:24.680 --> 34:26.760
Can't tell you guys before we start the money zone

34:26.760 --> 34:30.240
um after last week's episode I

34:30.640 --> 34:35.880
Realized that I had to at least for a while leave the website. I had built bad

34:36.560 --> 34:42.800
Because if I fixed it after the episode Thursday, and then people went to look at it Monday, and it was really good

34:42.800 --> 34:46.240
Yeah, and people would be like what are Justin and Griffin talking about this one? So it's great

34:46.800 --> 34:51.520
So you guys are welcome. I left it up so that you guys wouldn't look like assholes. Yeah

34:51.720 --> 34:54.300
Hey, can I talk about pretty much the only kind of socks I own?

34:54.300 --> 34:56.300
Yeah, yeah

34:56.560 --> 34:59.080
That's a bad setup because that sounds like it's gonna be pretty boring

34:59.080 --> 35:02.800
Like if anybody else came up to you on the street and was like, let me tell you about all the socks I own

35:03.600 --> 35:09.200
Let me start. It's pretty much just socks from the closed down trampoline park. Yes

35:09.640 --> 35:12.840
That's pretty much all I wear. Yeah, sometimes I know those trampolines

35:12.840 --> 35:15.140
They static them up and they just shoot right up into the air

35:15.480 --> 35:16.120
But no

35:16.120 --> 35:21.320
I want to talk about Bombas because Bombas his mission is simple make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal

35:21.320 --> 35:25.640
Item donated this holiday when you give Bombas to someone on your list. You're also giving them to someone in need

35:25.640 --> 35:30.100
It's a give-give. I just want to throw out. Hey Bombas if you're listening, that's a great mission

35:30.100 --> 35:33.220
It's a wonderful mission and I feel like you've done a lot to achieve it

35:33.220 --> 35:38.660
And now I think you should add like a second part to the mission. Yeah, it's like do that and also

35:39.740 --> 35:43.820
We're gonna find life on other planets or something. Whatever you want it to be

35:43.940 --> 35:49.100
You've got the first thing on lock like it's right now dream bigger Bombas isn't just socks anymore

35:49.100 --> 35:54.820
By the way guys it's shirts and underwear too and they designed all of it socks shirts and underwear to be the clothes

35:54.820 --> 36:00.260
You can't wait to put on every day. Everything they make is soft seamless tagless and has a luxuriously cozy feel

36:00.260 --> 36:05.780
I've been wearing these Bombas like I forget the name of them. They're not like no show

36:05.860 --> 36:09.080
They're just like the step above that because I'm not that brave

36:09.540 --> 36:14.840
Little show little show and I not not a joke pretty much all I wear is these Bombas socks

36:14.840 --> 36:21.380
Uh, they are cozy, but mostly like they fit so fucking right that it's I have that problem

36:21.380 --> 36:25.300
It sucks too big doesn't feel good socks too small. I hate it. Bombas is just right

36:25.820 --> 36:30.420
They make for great gifts. I have genuinely given Bombas as gifts before

36:31.460 --> 36:35.060
Because you know, they're really they're really good and everybody really likes them

36:35.820 --> 36:42.040
Hey promise another idea if you're listening because it's starting to get a little chillier now. What about socks, right?

36:42.040 --> 36:48.000
Yeah for your hands and they even have little places for like your fingers to go

36:48.000 --> 36:51.240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no because that would make them just like everybody else

36:51.760 --> 36:55.520
They're just socks that go right on your hands

36:55.520 --> 37:00.600

You guys know this adult moment where you're like, when's the last time I watched the sheets?

37:30.080 --> 37:35.720
You know this thought and you have the thought you can immediately picture a timeframe and that's when you're like

37:35.720 --> 37:38.560
I got to wash the sheets. When I wash the sheets though, you know what I did?

37:38.560 --> 37:42.880
Did I get a different pair of sheets from the from the closet? No, sure didn't

37:42.880 --> 37:48.520
I washed my Brooklyn in sheets and then put them back on the bed afterwards. Nothing weird about that.

37:48.680 --> 37:54.380
Are the only, it isn't, they're the only sheets I use. Should I buy a second pair? Probably.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.400
That's what I do when I have my favorite outfit

37:56.400 --> 37:59.480
I just take it off and then I stand a nude in front of the washer

37:59.880 --> 38:03.800
Until that's done and then I stand nude in front of the dryer. How do you know when it's done?

40:16.520 --> 40:23.200
So Taco Bell was worried about always worried about people getting enough rest

40:24.880 --> 40:31.360
And so they're trying to make it so that you remember they have breakfast which is I mean if you've ever

40:31.360 --> 40:37.560
Woke up disliking yourself rather than waiting until 2 a.m. To dislike yourself like a sane person

40:37.560 --> 40:40.740
You can go straight to Taco Bell to get the breakfast that you crave

40:41.080 --> 40:45.600
It's just Taco Bell food, but they say that it's for breakfast now. They put eggs in it

40:46.200 --> 40:48.040
You can get

40:48.040 --> 40:52.600
They're doing a lot of stuff to help remind people about it. They've got

40:52.600 --> 41:00.240
On October 21st, this is passed but they offered a a wake-up call. Oh by texting wake up to 1

41:01.000 --> 41:05.680

41:24.440 --> 41:26.480

It couldn't Justin if you're telling me if Benedict Cumberbatch could call you and be like Justin

I just want to talk to my baby. It's I remind you that your free toasted burrito is ready for you

41:45.680 --> 41:53.320
The most important thing that they did and the thing that brings us here today is and the reason I wanted to bring the tone

41:53.320 --> 41:56.060
down a little bit is that they also released a

41:57.200 --> 42:00.200
Bedtime story for adults to help you go to something like sexy

42:01.120 --> 42:06.320
Yeah, that nice. Wait Travis has a good point. Is it a sexy? It's not sexy

42:06.880 --> 42:09.440
But I am gonna read the entire thing. What makes it at all?

42:10.640 --> 42:14.240
Well, it's it's not for kids. I mean, I don't know. It's just listen

42:22.080 --> 42:24.580
Sleep tight get that bite. No author credited

42:25.840 --> 42:27.840
Some nights you just can't close your eyes

42:27.840 --> 42:33.600
But a restless night means waking up past sunrise see waking up after breakfast means you've gotten up too late

42:34.080 --> 42:38.600
You can miss your hot and toasty breakfast burrito date. See which we'd hate

Staying up late is always rad, but getting shut-eye. That's the new fad. So if you want to snag a toasty breakfast burrito

42:46.200 --> 42:48.840
Follow these simple sleepy secrets. Let me go

42:50.040 --> 42:55.240

42:55.720 --> 42:58.360
Your first spicy secret to a good night's sleep

42:58.920 --> 43:05.000
Winding down with a Baja bedtime nightcap forget the sheep. Sorry. I just need to clarify something real quick

43:05.000 --> 43:09.880
Taco Bell, do you think it's a good idea to slam a Baja blast before bed?

43:10.920 --> 43:15.160
Let me check mountain dew Baja blast a very caffeinated

43:15.880 --> 43:22.680

Roll yourself up into a burrito like so melt into a cheesy state of mind. Let go

Your little nosey

43:46.840 --> 43:52.680

Let's try out some auditory bliss. No, wait, go back to the park

43:56.600 --> 43:58.840
Taco Bell knows I think about death every night

43:58.840 --> 44:05.240
I imagine sizzling bacon while you close your eyes breakfast salsa awaits on the other side and that's all

44:07.080 --> 44:08.360
You heard me

44:08.360 --> 44:15.160
Still here. Okay. Well by which we've been alive one last chance time to count some burritos while they dance

44:15.640 --> 44:18.440
Repeat after me like you're back in grade school

44:19.000 --> 44:21.240
Get it because you're acting like a child

44:22.680 --> 44:25.960

44:44.040 --> 44:45.720
When you rise

44:45.720 --> 44:47.720
Wipe that sleep from your eyes

44:47.800 --> 44:51.000
Hear your stomach rumbling. It's ready for a surprise

44:51.880 --> 44:54.440
Taco Bell burritos await don't you fret?

44:54.440 --> 44:57.100
Breakfast is served 7 to 11 a.m

44:58.140 --> 45:05.660
Get ready to jet now. Kiss me passionately hard on my taco lips. That's right. The narrator has been

45:06.140 --> 45:07.340
a

45:07.340 --> 45:10.140
Taco this whole time and now we're gonna bang

45:11.100 --> 45:13.100
I really wish uh

45:13.340 --> 45:16.860
I really hadn't heard that. No. No, I'm glad I read the story because it was like cool and

45:17.900 --> 45:19.900
A good poem. It was hard because I fell asleep

45:19.900 --> 45:25.260
Yeah, so restful rachel is like a good poet and knows a lot about poetry

45:25.260 --> 45:26.140
I wish I could you know

45:26.140 --> 45:31.260
Just sort of bounce bounce that off of her and see if it like would do good in a school of poetry

45:31.340 --> 45:33.180
She'll probably tweet about it

45:33.180 --> 45:36.460
Um, that was the that was a that was an absolute trip

45:36.620 --> 45:40.380
It went into the deep dark corners of my psyche and where there were

45:41.180 --> 45:42.860
voids that

45:42.860 --> 45:48.860
My sort of mortal mind couldn't possibly fill they filled it up with salsa and cheese and rice

45:48.860 --> 45:51.980
Yeah, it's better now. It's better in my head calmer now

45:52.540 --> 45:59.260
The one thing that's still kind of uh, the one thing that's kind of freaking my bean is I can't decide if an endless

46:00.300 --> 46:05.520
Uh, just like salsa filled plane is supposed to be heaven or hell or purgatory

46:06.380 --> 46:09.260
It's but it's all it's all of all people. Yeah. Yeah

46:09.500 --> 46:13.660
Am I like a chunk in it or am I still travis? Isn't that the question?

46:13.660 --> 46:19.820
I mean we can all aspire to that can't wait. Yeah, but now it's just replaced my other existential dread with now just

46:20.460 --> 46:26.940
Literally burning salsa a picante existential. Yeah. Yeah, which is fine. Which is good. That's better

46:27.020 --> 46:30.460
I would rather think about salsa frankly. Sure. Sure. Yeah, um

46:31.020 --> 46:36.300
The let's uh, let's ask another question or no. No, I mean we ask and answer the questions here

46:36.300 --> 46:38.300
So we'll do both in one

46:38.700 --> 46:41.020
And yes, I did lose the questions again. Okay, here we go

46:41.020 --> 46:45.660
So I recently moved to a new city with only the contents of my car

46:46.060 --> 46:48.540
And in the course of making friends here, I made some

46:49.640 --> 46:51.180
friends

46:51.180 --> 46:53.420
You know, I do not wink

46:54.540 --> 46:55.900
wink

46:55.900 --> 47:01.020
Actually, i'm 40 and I don't know a little you're 41 now justin

47:01.740 --> 47:06.860
Oh, fuck you. Thank you in the context of the conversation. We just had love being reminded

47:06.860 --> 47:10.220
Yeah, i'm a 41 one year closer to salsa

47:16.300 --> 47:18.300
Okay, man, I know one of those

47:18.840 --> 47:21.660
friends told me that they're shopping for a

47:22.540 --> 47:27.180
New mattress that part's not in quotes. That's not a euphemism. Would it be

47:27.900 --> 47:29.900
weird to ask them if they would

47:30.460 --> 47:33.500
Sell me there. I'm just you made it very confusing

47:33.500 --> 47:39.660
Would it be weird to ask them if they would sell me their old mattress? It was very comfortable

47:39.820 --> 47:41.820
That was from sleepless

47:41.980 --> 47:44.540
In chicope. Where's chicope? Why would they know how?

47:45.580 --> 47:53.820
Their mattress feels because they're oh because they're uh, winky winky friends wink friends like friends because they booed

47:54.940 --> 47:59.660
You know like um, you know like in they do it in minnesota, which is where chicope is

47:59.660 --> 48:05.020
They they engaged in consensual coitus gets cold gets cold up there. Yeah, so

48:06.060 --> 48:08.060
would it

48:08.060 --> 48:14.780
Be oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry now that I understand what friends in quotes means I have a very clear answer, uh, which is

48:15.180 --> 48:17.100
Yes, it's fucking weird

48:17.100 --> 48:19.100
Why is it weird if you go to pork city?

48:19.420 --> 48:23.980
And you're like damn this bed is is that memory foam how much?

48:23.980 --> 48:30.060
That's strange. I don't think that's what's happening griffin. It's not like you're not buying it mid mid

48:30.620 --> 48:32.860
That was a great test drive. I'll take it

48:33.820 --> 48:36.860
This is this is when they're like, oh, yeah, i'm gonna buy a new mattress

48:36.940 --> 48:41.580
There's nothing weird about saying like what are you doing with the old one? I need a mattress. Can I buy it?

48:42.300 --> 48:45.340
That that's it's that makes like oh man, it hits

48:45.980 --> 48:47.260
Why?

48:47.260 --> 48:49.500
Thank you. Justin. I gotta clarify. Hold on

48:49.500 --> 48:55.340
Um, okay. Do you know what it is? Yeah, I might be wrong, but i'm trying to figure out in myself why it hits weird

48:55.980 --> 48:57.980
I think

48:57.980 --> 49:01.020
that on some level maybe it could

49:02.540 --> 49:04.540
Feel like

49:04.700 --> 49:06.700
I was very happy in that bed

49:07.180 --> 49:09.340
And that's a treasured time in my life

49:09.580 --> 49:12.480
And I would love to keep that bed as a memento

49:13.180 --> 49:15.180
of the time when I went to

49:15.180 --> 49:19.580
Adult city. Well, yeah. No. Hey definitely don't say it that way

49:20.140 --> 49:26.700
No one would say it that way. I said it that way for emphasis on a comedy show, but they're no you don't necessarily I mean

49:28.300 --> 49:32.220
Oh man, it's weird. I don't think it does. I think that this is one of those things where

49:32.940 --> 49:34.940
It like, you know how much skin

49:36.060 --> 49:38.620
Do you know how much skin is in a bed?

49:38.620 --> 49:44.460
It's mostly skin and maybe that's the problem. Oh, no. Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen

49:45.340 --> 49:47.980
I'm not saying i'm wild about the idea

49:48.380 --> 49:53.500
But if this is your option as far as like affordability goes and it's a comfortable bed

49:54.220 --> 49:57.820
I like what the other things are going to do is throw it away, right like

49:59.260 --> 50:04.700
Okay, let me ask this let me get your gut check on this wait, what is the it also but okay

50:04.700 --> 50:10.620
Wait, wait, let me ask you this travis, but I was gonna ask you let me ask you. Okay, doesn't it kind of feel like

50:12.460 --> 50:16.140
Well, why are you getting rid of it like you didn't even start to ask that you know

50:16.140 --> 50:19.820
I mean that would be like oh i'm sorry to hear you broke up with your boyfriend. I need a boyfriend

50:19.900 --> 50:24.300
I'll date him. That is so different and you know, that's not different. It's not different

50:24.460 --> 50:28.620
I don't think that's that different now, but here's what I was going to ask. Does it hit different?

50:28.940 --> 50:31.980
How do you feel of can I buy it versus?

50:31.980 --> 50:33.980
Can I have it?

50:34.220 --> 50:41.180
Much worse for the can I have it part? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because then it does sound like uh, i've taken you

50:41.740 --> 50:43.820
And now I will take this as a trophy

50:44.460 --> 50:48.940
That's not what it sounds like at all. Yeah, one thing that I think is bad

50:48.940 --> 50:54.780
If you're having a just sort of like a fun sex time is at the end of it be like can I have this as a trophy?

50:54.780 --> 50:56.780
That is not what's happening

50:56.780 --> 51:00.860
Travis, I don't know why travis is endorsing that. I don't know either. You shouldn't listen to my brother

51:00.860 --> 51:07.900
You shouldn't claim that you two are so socially awkward that can I buy your old mattress has

51:08.360 --> 51:14.380
Transitioned in your mind too. I shall take this to remember the time when we parked

51:14.940 --> 51:20.620
Can I buy the seat? Can I buy our our pork zone? That's not what it is

51:21.820 --> 51:23.820
Can I buy our sex area?

51:24.220 --> 51:26.380
Yeah, that's so wild

51:26.380 --> 51:33.340
So to you to you on some level this person realized it too or they wouldn't have asked the question

51:33.740 --> 51:36.060
If you have to ask if it is weird

51:36.140 --> 51:40.780
It probably could hit weird because it has already hit you a little bit weird

51:41.180 --> 51:44.860
So yes, 100 you're running the risk that the other person will think it's weird

51:45.900 --> 51:47.100
Yes

51:47.100 --> 51:48.700
but

51:48.700 --> 51:51.980
How comfortable is the mattress? Is it worth a little bit of weird?

51:51.980 --> 51:57.660
That you're gonna get a discount comfortable mattress and all you had was the stuff in your car

51:57.740 --> 51:59.740
I don't know what you're sleeping on right now

52:00.140 --> 52:04.560
Right, but it might be a little weird, but maybe it's a lot comfortable

52:06.060 --> 52:10.300
I like I like this idea of somebody who has just moved to a new place

52:10.700 --> 52:16.860
And rather than buy a mattress, they just decide to make love to different people who already have mattresses

52:17.820 --> 52:19.580
This is there

52:19.580 --> 52:22.060
You could say i've been sleeping around

52:22.860 --> 52:24.860
Wait, you didn't wink. Yeah. No. Yeah. No

52:25.500 --> 52:30.300
I've I meant literally and if any of and listen, hey i'm doing it for the right reasons

52:30.700 --> 52:33.420
But also an additional right reason

52:33.980 --> 52:39.340
That uh the bed's comfortable. I'm tired. I'm sleepy. I'm sleepy. I'm sleepy and so I sleep on the mattress

52:40.220 --> 52:46.300
Everybody's enjoying it. Hey, i'd love to make love to you tonight, but what about some of that afternoon delight tomorrow?

52:46.700 --> 52:48.700
After a nice long rest

52:48.700 --> 52:55.100
Great comfortable bed. Also once we're done. Could I have it as a trophy conquest?

52:55.820 --> 52:57.820
Damn it. I wasn't supposed to say that part out loud

52:58.220 --> 53:02.460
One of my favorite podcasters travis backer said you should try to claim trophies from people

53:03.500 --> 53:09.980
That is not what i'm advocating have any of you ever sold a mattress before a used mattress that you have used

53:10.780 --> 53:13.660
No, I I did when I moved to austin

53:13.660 --> 53:19.660
uh, I brought a mattress with me for some reason from chicago and then I

53:19.900 --> 53:23.580
Slept on a little bit and I was like, this is not going to do uh anymore

53:23.660 --> 53:27.980
This is a bad bed. And so I was going crazy like anybody want to buy my mattress for cheap

53:28.460 --> 53:34.460
And a woman came and explained that she was going through a divorce and needed a needed a mattress for that

53:34.620 --> 53:35.420
And I was like, oh, okay

53:35.420 --> 53:37.980
And she's like have can I take the price off a little bit?

53:37.980 --> 53:38.860
And I was like, yeah, of course

53:38.860 --> 53:40.860
You can have it for a little bit less than I asked

53:40.860 --> 53:44.140
She was like, thanks and as she walked it out of the house, I was like

53:45.100 --> 53:46.300
Enjoy

53:46.300 --> 53:52.540
Dummy, i've been riding that bed and putting it down wet for fucking 15 years dog. Are you kidding me?

53:53.740 --> 53:59.820
There is so much of me in that bed that you could stick a knife in it and my voice would say ow from the bed

54:00.940 --> 54:02.060
so, uh

54:02.060 --> 54:05.260
Yeah, 100 well spent enjoy

54:06.140 --> 54:08.140
Are you sure?

54:08.140 --> 54:15.660
Are you sure? I was a teen in that bed. Are you sure?

54:19.900 --> 54:26.860
There are things that matters is a scene that only god knows about and god said bad no bad

54:27.420 --> 54:29.020
But good luck
