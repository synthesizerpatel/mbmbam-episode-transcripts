00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.600
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

00:47.600 --> 00:52.400
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother,

00:52.400 --> 00:58.160
Travis Patrick McElroy. And I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30-30-30, I'm Griffin McElroy.

00:58.160 --> 01:05.040
A lot of busy lives. It's been a busy couple of weeks in the interim of when we've spoken to you

01:05.040 --> 01:12.480
directly. An exciting time ahead of a sect of me. And I want to say, then came up here to Cincinnati

01:13.280 --> 01:18.720
to the Great Wolf Lodge, including the water park, and I watched that fool in a wave pool,

01:19.280 --> 01:22.960
and I don't know that I've ever seen a more unhappy human being.

01:22.960 --> 01:30.080
Oh, okay. I was, there was a displeasure. I experienced a displeasure.

01:30.800 --> 01:37.680
Is it maybe because you chose a pool to swim in that kind of goes for your zone?

01:37.680 --> 01:42.400
And more than a regular pool won't sort of come at your zone like a wave pool will.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.840
I didn't choose it, my daughter did, and I wanted to be a great dad.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.280
And I don't know how much you, I do want to talk about one vasectomy-related thing,

01:51.280 --> 01:57.440
but we've got an exciting new feature here on the show where we're going to let you,

01:57.440 --> 02:03.040
the listener, vote live as we record on sort of like what you want to talk about.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.400
So my vasectomy is one of the options. Trav, what do you got?

02:07.120 --> 02:15.920
Well, I went to London for several days, and I came back with this new accent that I just

02:15.920 --> 02:19.440
can't shake. Oh, I want to hear it so bad.

02:19.440 --> 02:24.560
Two things about that is that the what, let me take, if I could, excuse me,

02:24.560 --> 02:29.200
if I could do two things. One, we've done that exact thing before.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.520
And two, you've already talked without the accent.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.560
So I feel like even the cafe of the bits.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.440
It comes and goes.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.480
Also, I did realize, other thing we could talk about.

02:44.480 --> 02:48.560
No, no, no, no, no. We all get one. Quit trying to fucking stuff the ballot box.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.920
Speaking of Cafe B, I went to wrestling last night.

02:51.920 --> 02:58.080
I went to Heck in a Sec down in San Antonio, and it was pretty good.

02:59.040 --> 03:05.840
It ended with a big title match between just famed big man, Braun Strowman,

03:05.840 --> 03:09.680
and other big man Roman Reigns. And the fight was going very bad.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.200
And then the third big man, Brock Lesnar, came in and broke the sec,

03:15.200 --> 03:18.880
kicked the sec door right in, and hurt them both. And that was the end of it.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.560
So I was thinking I could do a funny bit about how if this episode doesn't start,

03:22.560 --> 03:25.760
it just starts sort of flagging, then I could have Brock Lesnar come in

03:25.760 --> 03:29.760
and beat all our asses, and then they would just stop the show.

03:29.760 --> 03:37.520
Now I have a suggestion. This is a little radical, but maybe I could do my accent

03:37.520 --> 03:43.600
while we talk about how bad it would be if Brock Lesnar attacked Justin's nuts right now.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we need to vote on though,

03:47.440 --> 03:51.280
maybe it seems a little shock jock radio to refer to the…

03:52.080 --> 03:54.240
Would it be better if we said testicles?

03:54.240 --> 03:57.600
No, Strap, because I knew that you were going to say something that would also be bad

03:57.600 --> 04:00.800
that you would enjoy. That would be like a fun sort of,

04:00.800 --> 04:03.840
like a way that an old prospector would refer to the…

04:03.840 --> 04:08.320
Oh, my testicles! That's my new London accent, by the way.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.400
I hope you all enjoyed it.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.560
That's good. It also kind of sounds like how Goofy would say the word,

04:14.560 --> 04:16.640
which I actually am very, very into.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.960
Gorsh! Gorsh, mate! My testicles!

04:18.960 --> 04:19.840
My testicles!

04:21.680 --> 04:23.120
None of this is usable.

04:23.120 --> 04:28.240
All the votes are in, and I'm just going to talk about my vicinity real quick.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.240
I understand some people are uncomfortable with surgery talk,

04:32.240 --> 04:35.360
so if you want to skip ahead 23 to 27 minutes…

04:35.360 --> 04:42.800
No, please don't get clinical about it. Just tell us what happened in the wave pool.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.520
So they told me that for $80, I could have gas

04:47.520 --> 04:50.240
that would make me all silly for the whole time if I gave $80.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.160
So I do want to start off by saying thank you so much, Max Fund donors.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.640
You should know that I did spend a little bit of your money

04:56.640 --> 04:59.040
getting high for my testicle surgery.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.400
Hold on. That's a weird upsell moment of like,

05:02.400 --> 05:06.560
hey, you've come in here for a vasectomy and you're going to be here

05:06.560 --> 05:08.720
and very present for every second of it,

05:08.720 --> 05:12.960
unless you want to give us 75, no, $80.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.320
$80 and then we'll take you to Sillytown.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.720
You want us to Scotchguard those bad boys?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.040
Give you the undercoating?

05:23.200 --> 05:23.840
You want it bigger?

05:27.120 --> 05:28.880
Okay, so I went in, I had the gas.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.120
I had the gas once before when I had wisdom teeth surgery,

05:31.120 --> 05:33.520
and my memory of it was count backwards from one to 10.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.200
10, nine, oh my God, it's done.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.880
And I wake up at right, and it's like I had gone completely out.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.880
And I thought that's what I was in for, for the surgery.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.800
So they give me the tube with the gas in it and tell me to hold it.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.200
And they said, are you a nose breather?

05:47.200 --> 05:50.320
Which is a wild, like I can.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.680
I do both, yeah.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.440
I do both, like all humans.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.120
She said, well, the times when you wake up

05:57.120 --> 05:59.200
are when you let go of the tube

05:59.200 --> 06:01.680
or when you breathe through your nose.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.440
So don't do either of those.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.040
Cool, right?

06:05.040 --> 06:08.320
So I'm doing this and I realized like after a while,

06:08.320 --> 06:11.600
I'm really huffing on this good stuff.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.320
And I realized like I'm not blacking out.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.960
So in my head, what I thought was it's not working.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.760
Oh my God, I'm going to be awake for my testicle surgery.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.080
Oh, please don't let this be the case.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.040
But I guess this kind of anesthesia is patient led

06:29.040 --> 06:30.880
where they don't want you to go too deep.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.600
They want you to be in sort of like a twilight state.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.520
Interesting.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.040
Yes, so I basically spent the entire time high.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.400
And when you're high like this,

06:40.400 --> 06:43.600
what you want is a nice drug sherpa who's not high

06:43.600 --> 06:48.320
but is going to make a pleasurable drug experience for you.

06:49.120 --> 06:54.160
I was in the literal opposite of a good place

06:54.160 --> 06:58.320
to have a drug experience.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.840
Here are two things that I heard

07:05.040 --> 07:08.800
while I was in this weird twilight state.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.200
The first one was this.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.680
I don't know how the vas deferens ends up like this,

07:15.680 --> 07:19.360
but some are just gnarled and impossible to cut through.

07:19.360 --> 07:26.240
Whoa, like tree bark this guy's deferences.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.600
Hey, hold on.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.120
I don't know how some of them-

07:30.000 --> 07:32.720
Is that a real thing that was said or just something that you-

07:32.720 --> 07:35.040
That was a real thing that was said.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.880
Okay, that was a real thing that was said.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.840
The second real thing that was said was I started giggling

07:41.840 --> 07:43.280
because I was on laughing gas.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.480
So it struck me as funny that I was awake

07:46.480 --> 07:47.280
while somebody was like,

07:47.280 --> 07:49.600
I would realize like how bad it was for me, right?

07:49.600 --> 07:51.920
So I got kind of tickled that I was awake

07:51.920 --> 07:56.320
for my testicle surgery and I was just like high on this stuff

07:56.320 --> 07:57.920
and it was very funny to me in the moment.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.600
So I started giggling a little bit

07:59.600 --> 08:01.920
and I heard one of the nurses ask the doctor,

08:01.920 --> 08:04.960
have you ever had anyone laughed during a vasectomy?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.160
And he said, no.

08:08.080 --> 08:08.880
Oh, no.

08:09.680 --> 08:10.320
Good.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.600
So just to be clear, this incredibly routine surgery,

08:13.600 --> 08:15.600
we're in uncharted waters, huh?

08:15.600 --> 08:21.440
What was your iron deference and your jovial constitution?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.440
Holy shit, Juicer.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.160
I was still extremely high.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.440
I cannot, I mean,

08:27.440 --> 08:30.160
cause the whole time I thought I should black out.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.200
So I was huffing this good, good stuff even harder

08:33.760 --> 08:36.560
and just huffing and huffing trying to black out

08:36.560 --> 08:38.800
because I didn't want to be so present

08:38.800 --> 08:40.640
for my penis surgery as I was.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.960
And I real huffed it.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.480
So when I got done with the surgery,

08:44.480 --> 08:46.240
I was still extremely high.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.640
And the first thing that my doctor says to me is,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.280
now remember, you're still fertile.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.480
What?

08:54.480 --> 08:58.000
And I was like, then what the fuck are we doing here?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.680
How could you say that to me, a high person?

09:02.480 --> 09:06.560
And he said, well, and he didn't clarify.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.240
Of course, what he means is like,

09:08.240 --> 09:12.560
it takes a while before everything's like

09:12.560 --> 09:14.960
all the little spermies are dead or whatever.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.840
And then clear the pipes.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.320
Is that what he said, is it spermies?

09:18.320 --> 09:22.080
And then he said, your vas deferens is very knotted

09:22.080 --> 09:23.520
and hard to cut through.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.960
And I was like, I'm high.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.480
I don't know how to process what you're telling me.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.880
So he said, there's a lot of torsion down there.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.040
And what I said to him in the moment was,

09:33.040 --> 09:35.440
my wife and I don't do weird stuff,

09:36.560 --> 09:39.520
but that's fine for people that do.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.800
And he looked at me like I was a moon man.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.960
Like an astronaut moon man.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.560
I can't imagine why.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.200
I love that you were still sex positive in your-

09:49.200 --> 09:50.400
Oh yeah, for sure.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.320
I didn't want, I mean, I have firm beliefs

09:54.320 --> 09:58.320
that I need everybody to get down with.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.880
The, after, then after that,

10:02.880 --> 10:05.200
they sent me home with 30 per cassette.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.840
So I don't know why we have such a problem.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.520
That's the end of this segment.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.480
I'm recovering well.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.080
I'm in a decent amount of pain.

10:16.080 --> 10:20.400
I'm still wearing a jockstrap, which I may never stop

10:20.400 --> 10:22.400
because it is really nice.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.520
I'm always ready for sports too, which is great for me.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.000
Well, we got a racquetball at noon.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.480
So let's get rolling on the advice.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.240
Here's our first question this week on the show.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.880
My waitress reached her hand out to take my plate,

10:38.880 --> 10:41.040
but I thought she was trying to shake hands.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.920
So I shook her hand instead of giving her my plate.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.560
Should I dine and dash now before she brings the check

10:46.560 --> 10:47.680
and have to face her again?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.840
That's from I Fucked Up in Texas.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.880
Why did you think contextually in that moment

10:55.440 --> 11:00.160
that your server needed to congratulate or meet you?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.720
Was your plate so clean?

11:02.720 --> 11:06.400
It's so I've never seen one this clean before.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.360
It started off as a black plate and now it's a white plate.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.400
How did you do that?

11:10.400 --> 11:13.920
You dang licked the decorations right off this fancy plate.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.840
Oh man, I don't think that dining and dashing

11:19.840 --> 11:21.760
means you have done two terrible things

11:21.760 --> 11:24.640
to this other sentient living human being today.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.840
And I think you gotta try and with your second act

11:27.840 --> 11:30.720
try and counter the very bad first thing you did.

11:30.720 --> 11:35.440
I think paying double for the meal or tipping 500%

11:35.440 --> 11:37.920
or something, because if you dine and dash

11:37.920 --> 11:41.040
it's just gonna ruin their day even more than it already,

11:41.040 --> 11:43.280
it has just already ruined quite badly.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.080
And I wanna drive that home, you did fuck up pretty bad.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.520
Because here's the thing that I have to point out.

11:50.080 --> 11:54.160
Someone reaching for a plate versus reaching for a handshake,

11:54.960 --> 11:59.360
they are not instantly going to transition their mind to,

11:59.360 --> 12:01.600
oh, it's a handshake now.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.360
So there had to be at least a second of like,

12:05.360 --> 12:08.160
as if you were trying to dock a space shuttle

12:08.720 --> 12:12.480
like with the space station and it turned at the last second.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.840
You're like, well, here we are.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.440
Like there had to be a moment of like, what is this?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.600
That's what you've gotta unpack.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.320
Before you do anything else, you need to look in that mirror

12:22.320 --> 12:25.360
and you need to take stock of your own shit.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.920
Because I am guaranteeing there is no way

12:27.920 --> 12:30.400
the trajectory of the plate reach is the same

12:30.400 --> 12:34.240
as the trajectory for that a handshake attempt would have been.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.040
They were reaching downward towards a table

12:37.040 --> 12:39.840
to pick up a plate or a tray or whatever the fuck.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.520
That is not the same as a hand coming at you like eye level

12:43.520 --> 12:45.680
straight towards you as if to say handshake.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.040
You saw this hand reaching for a plate

12:47.040 --> 12:50.240
and you wanted it to be a handshake very, very badly.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.960
I'm trying so hard to picture it.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.440
Like I need like a whiteboard.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.080
I need some dry erase markers.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.080
I have to diagram it.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.320
It's funny, you know, I think when tipping was created,

13:05.360 --> 13:08.720
it was obviously to reward good service.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.120
I wish, I have found myself wishing multiple times recently

13:13.760 --> 13:19.200
that I could tip at the beginning just so they knew

13:19.200 --> 13:23.360
that like if you say I'm gonna tip generously,

13:23.360 --> 13:27.600
you should know that upfront, then maybe they would see you

13:27.600 --> 13:33.360
as some sort of like good-hearted, bumble brain eccentric.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.840
And like all these things would just kind of go away

13:35.840 --> 13:38.160
because they know at the end that they would be getting

13:38.160 --> 13:41.680
a good tip, but you can't actually say like I'm going

13:41.680 --> 13:43.440
to be tipping well at the end.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.360
No one does that, you can't do that.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.240
So you have to tip at the beginning.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.080
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.840
Assholes do that, I bet.

13:49.840 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, but I wouldn't be doing it for like asshole reasons.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I would be trying to buy myself just like,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.240
I know I'm gonna fuck up some things here.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.320
Listen, I know I'm gonna make, I had, okay,

14:00.320 --> 14:01.520
I'll give you a good example.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.840
We were in a Great Wolf Lodge this past weekend

14:03.840 --> 14:06.880
and we had friends there and we had like eight people

14:06.880 --> 14:08.320
and then four of her other friends decided

14:08.320 --> 14:09.920
they wanted to join us for dinner.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.880
And I was like, we're gonna have to drag another table over.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.880
How could that possible?

14:14.880 --> 14:17.200
This place was empty other than us.

14:17.200 --> 14:22.000
And in my head, I could not see a way to get four more seats

14:22.000 --> 14:23.840
that adjoined to our seats.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.720
And I was so terrified to ask, somebody else had to ask.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.720
And I tried to will the server to know like,

14:29.680 --> 14:31.840
I'll give you a good tip, please don't be mad at me.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.160
Please, I know that this isn't good.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.360
I'm sorry, I'm doing my best here in a bad situation.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.600
I just wish that I could communicate to people

14:39.600 --> 14:41.120
that I'm not an asshole.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.800
I really am not a monster, I promise.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.680
That's why I think, here's my new plan.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.520
This is what I suggest to everyone, tip very well, one,

14:50.400 --> 14:54.960
but also do so in like all 50 cent pieces.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.840
So then they're like, oh, not only did they tip very well,

14:57.840 --> 15:01.760
they're clearly an eccentric, bumble brained kind of person.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.160
And it's like, oh, so this is both a good tip and fun

15:06.160 --> 15:09.760
and lets me know like, okay, that's why they shook my hand

15:09.760 --> 15:11.920
when they were reaching because like,

15:11.920 --> 15:14.240
they're the type of person who tips in 50 cent pieces.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.160
So if it's a big, but if it's a big table,

15:16.160 --> 15:18.320
you're kind of envisioning them carrying home

15:19.360 --> 15:24.000
15 pounds worth of coinage as sort of a reward

15:24.000 --> 15:25.360
for a job well done.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.760
Yes, now that is true because like, say it's like,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.480
oh, I don't know, a large party, it's like $500 meal

15:30.480 --> 15:34.400
and you tip, let's say 30%, right?

15:34.400 --> 15:41.120
You have just tipped $150 in 50 cent pieces.

15:41.120 --> 15:45.520
So yes, you have just also granted them probably

15:45.520 --> 15:47.200
at least some muscle soreness,

15:47.760 --> 15:50.240
if not like a dislocated shoulder.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.280
Another good option is when they reach back their hand

15:53.280 --> 15:57.520
from the just really inexplicable strange handshake

15:57.520 --> 15:58.240
you've given them.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.040
They look down in it and there's a single egg in their hand

16:03.040 --> 16:05.200
and then they look back up at you and you say,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.160
nanu nanu because you're a space person.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.520
And it's the only, and they'll say, oh, you shook my hand

16:11.520 --> 16:13.600
because you're a space person.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.160
And now I understand because of the egg

16:16.160 --> 16:19.120
and that it's a whole mork thing and I love it.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.160
No tip required.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.320
I love your mork thing.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.040
How about a Yahoo?

16:23.600 --> 16:24.160
Shazbot.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.480
Shazbot indeed.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.000
This one was sent in by Emma Roden.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.640
Thank you, Emma.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.880
It's Yahoo Answers user Cassie who asks,

16:32.640 --> 16:34.400
stepdad playing with black magic.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.280
Oh no, that's rough.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.880
Yesterday my stepdad was in the bathroom

16:38.880 --> 16:40.000
and the lights were turned off

16:40.000 --> 16:42.720
and only a couple lit candles.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.280
There was weird spiritual music going off

16:45.280 --> 16:47.600
and he was whispering something over and over again.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.960
I don't know if he was doing black magic

16:48.960 --> 16:52.480
or just relaxing by back, by back.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.320
I'm kind of freaked that he believes

16:56.320 --> 17:00.080
and diabolical shit, I guess, four asterisks.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.120
What do I do?

17:01.120 --> 17:01.840
Wait, hold on.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.480
So within the question, the question poser says,

17:06.480 --> 17:12.000
it's either black magic or he was just relaxing.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.920
Or it was Terry's special time

17:14.480 --> 17:16.160
and he had an audio book going

17:16.160 --> 17:17.680
and he had the scented candles going.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.600
He was either listening to a nice audio book

17:21.600 --> 17:24.320
or speaking with Baphomet.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.280
So what do I do?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.160
It's one of the two.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.440
It was either listening to the new Dan Brown novel

17:31.440 --> 17:36.880
on audio cassette or it was Baphomet.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.920
It might be both.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.200
True, multitasking is huge.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.480
It's 2018.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.080
Yeah, and you know, in Dan Brown,

17:44.080 --> 17:47.280
there is a whole book called Angels and Demons.

17:49.040 --> 17:49.840
In the Outfield.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.440
In the Outfield.

17:52.000 --> 17:52.960
Oh, that's a good one.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.000
Why haven't we seen a Demons in the Outfield movie?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.760
Demons in the Outfield waging war for our souls.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.400
Oh, yes, a remake of Angels in the Outfield

18:02.400 --> 18:04.480
that's about like a literal holy war

18:05.200 --> 18:08.240
between angels and demons and the demons support,

18:08.800 --> 18:10.560
I don't know, the Baltimore Orioles.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.400
It's just the first theme that came to mind.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.600
And they're probably led by Lil' Nicky.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.320
Wouldn't you think?

18:18.320 --> 18:20.400
Lil' Nicky's probably the leader.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.320
Oh, it's time.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.360
It's time to bring out Lil' Nicky.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.840
Holly Weird, get Abby for Lil' Nicky too.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.680
Angels and the Demons in the Outfield.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.920
Demons in the Dugout.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.440
Demons in the Dugout, Travis,

18:33.440 --> 18:35.520
with the slam dunk pitch, green lit.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.080
What do you do, though?

18:38.720 --> 18:42.080
What do you do when your stepdad talks to Baphomet

18:42.080 --> 18:43.360
in the bathroom?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.120
Oh, you know what I would do?

18:45.120 --> 18:45.920
Tattle to mommy?

18:46.480 --> 18:48.400
Well, yes, but I would also,

18:48.400 --> 18:50.320
like before stepdad went in there,

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
I would get like a dry erase marker

18:53.200 --> 18:56.000
and like draw like a smiley face on the mirror.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.240
And so that way, when he tries to like look in the mirror

18:58.240 --> 19:00.400
to talk to the devil, he sees that smiley face

19:00.400 --> 19:02.080
and he's like, oh, you know what?

19:02.080 --> 19:02.960
Maybe not today.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.800
Maybe it's just a day.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.000
Maybe it's a day I'm just gonna go outside and smile.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.880
So it's just a situation where he was going to commune

19:10.880 --> 19:15.040
with some sort of elder God or whatever.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.920
But then he saw a picture of a smiley face

19:17.920 --> 19:20.080
like you might've seen on a t-shirt in the 70s.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.160
And he said, nevermind.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.640
Well, my only other suggestion

19:24.640 --> 19:27.840
was to make a real stinky poop in there before him

19:27.840 --> 19:29.840
so then the devil won't show up.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.720
Yeah, or he does.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.520
And he's like, oh, Terry, you've completed the right.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.320
Oh, Terry.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.360
Oh, Terry.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.240
Oh, Terry.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.520
Oh, Terry, no.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.800
He's just, has he ever done anything good?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.880
It's just like always just,

19:42.880 --> 19:44.000
whenever you hear about him,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.400
it's always bad stuff most of the time.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.720
I don't know, Griffin.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.000
I'm off two minds, you know?

19:50.640 --> 19:51.360
Oh, no.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.200
Because the devil, he seems bad.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.040
And don't get me wrong, he is.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.080
But without the devil,

19:57.360 --> 19:59.840
would we really appreciate the angels?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.440
Because if everybody was good and angelic, Griffin.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.200
Yes, yes, thank you, yes.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.360
Then maybe nobody is.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.120
There's a user named Leviticus on here,

20:13.120 --> 20:14.160
which is already great.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.960
Who says, if your stepdad wants to play silly games

20:18.960 --> 20:20.640
in the bathroom, then leave him to it.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.840
Which really should be the motto for 2019, I think, maybe.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.600
Like 2018 was Collaborate Teen,

20:25.600 --> 20:27.280
and I don't know that we've been especially good stewards

20:27.280 --> 20:29.520
of that, but I do think that 2019,

20:29.520 --> 20:31.840
if your stepdad wants to play silly games in the bathroom,

20:31.840 --> 20:32.960
then leave him to it is something

20:32.960 --> 20:35.600
we could actually honor pretty easily.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.560
Just let your stepdad do whatever he wants in the bathroom.

20:38.560 --> 20:42.720
Just the silly games, it's fine by me, Griffin McElroy.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.840
Here's what's hard for me.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.880
I'm trying to walk the right path.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.280
Sure.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.200
Trying to be good to my fellow man,

20:49.200 --> 20:52.160
trying to tithe 10%, trying to worship,

20:53.360 --> 20:56.400
trying to keep the Sabbath holy, all of it.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.120
Yeah.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.040
And then I feel this little creeping presence

20:59.840 --> 21:01.360
sneak up from behind and say,

21:01.360 --> 21:02.800
Justin, I'm sure you shouldn't go down

21:02.800 --> 21:05.120
to the betting parlor or what have you.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.840
Put some bets on the ponies,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.840
steal your brother's big screen TV.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.640
Steal that big basketball from the dick sporting goods

21:14.640 --> 21:15.680
you've always wanted.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.400
Yeah.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.520
You know, you could never afford the big basketball

21:19.520 --> 21:21.520
that they say is just a picture of a basketball

21:21.520 --> 21:22.960
they hung up at the basketball section,

21:22.960 --> 21:25.600
but you know it's a real fully formed basketball

21:25.600 --> 21:28.480
that would be so fun to play with.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.480
And the devil is the one who's always telling me

21:30.480 --> 21:31.520
to do these bad things.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.280
And I just want to try to live a righteous life.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.280
How about another question?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.080
Yep.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.520
I like to take my family fishing,

21:37.520 --> 21:39.440
but we haven't been fishing for very long,

21:39.440 --> 21:40.960
so we're not very good at it yet.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.120
When we go fishing, we feel like people are watching us.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.880
They're watching us be bad at fishing.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.240
We want to keep fishing,

21:46.240 --> 21:48.320
but we don't want to endure the withering gaze

21:48.320 --> 21:50.400
of more seasoned fishermen.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.680
How do we go fishing without other people looking at us?

21:53.680 --> 21:56.640
That's from Self Conscious 6 in Salt Lake.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.800
PS, we haven't caught a single fish yet.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.040
I think it is,

22:04.640 --> 22:07.680
I think the hardest pill to swallow

22:07.680 --> 22:09.920
in this sort of situation that you've ginned up

22:09.920 --> 22:13.600
is that there are people for whom watching people

22:13.600 --> 22:16.560
not catch fish is a very good thing to watch.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.880
Like one of the things, like we have phones and stuff.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.080
Like definitely, probably they're not going to watch

22:22.080 --> 22:24.240
some people not catch fish, I think.

22:24.240 --> 22:24.720
Sure.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.480
There are TV shows I could watch

22:27.120 --> 22:31.200
where very good fish catchers catch fish like nonstop.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.480
And I'm talking about big fat fish of all shapes and sizes.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.800
And I don't even want to watch that, you know?

22:36.800 --> 22:39.520
Well, and there are whole TV shows you could watch

22:39.520 --> 22:41.040
where people aren't catching fish.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.840
Like there are whole episodes of Law & Order SVU

22:43.840 --> 22:45.760
where no one catches a fish.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.160
Yeah, there's so many shows where no fish are caught.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.520
I love Tara's House, but there's only been like one

22:51.520 --> 22:53.120
or two episodes where they catch fish.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.920
I feel like I wouldn't, I mean, I feel you

22:57.920 --> 23:01.440
because I would not know where to start with this.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.160
I definitely could buy a rod

23:05.120 --> 23:08.400
and I think I could find a place around here that sells worms.

23:08.400 --> 23:13.440
That's as far, yeah, that's as far as I could get.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.680
Do I go early in the day?

23:15.680 --> 23:16.560
Do I go late?

23:17.200 --> 23:20.960
I understand this sort of anxiety this person's experiencing

23:20.960 --> 23:23.280
because I feel like it's such a narrow window

23:23.280 --> 23:25.440
in which you could catch a fish anyway

23:25.440 --> 23:26.640
that there's a real good chance

23:26.640 --> 23:27.840
someone would see you fishing out there

23:27.840 --> 23:28.960
and just know that like,

23:30.080 --> 23:31.680
it's definitely not going to work for you.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.280
Maybe this is like an expectation thing

23:35.280 --> 23:38.480
where like when you get to the lake,

23:39.280 --> 23:40.720
I assume, question mark,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.480
you like loudly announce like,

23:42.480 --> 23:44.240
I hope I don't catch any fish today.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.400
Loudly, loudly I know won't work.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.040
I do know, okay, here, let me chime back in.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.880
Loudly won't work for fishing.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.400
I know that because they hate that.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.240
They hate the sound.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.600
They hate our human noises.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.200
They love their own fish noises

23:57.200 --> 23:58.240
because I watched Fish Tales

23:58.240 --> 24:00.800
and they were always singing and dancing around in that flick,

24:00.800 --> 24:02.640
but they hate our human sounds.

24:02.640 --> 24:06.640
And maybe like a sign like hanging on your boat.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.720
It's like not trying to catch fish.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.080
Like, I know how this looks.

24:10.640 --> 24:14.240
It looks like I'm just trying to soak these worms.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.520
I feel pretty confident.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.040
You're just soaking the worms.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.960
Let's get these wormies wet.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.920
I'm just trying to rehydrate my worm friends.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.680
I feel pretty confident of one thing

24:27.680 --> 24:29.520
because I've eaten fish.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.800
If I were to somehow luck into catching a fish, right?

24:34.800 --> 24:37.440
So I get the fish on the hook.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.640
I zoom him up into my boat and I have him there.

24:41.520 --> 24:46.480
I do feel pretty confident that the look you lose

24:46.480 --> 24:52.560
would then be treated to me bewildered watching a fish die.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.120
I think that is the next thing that would happen

24:55.120 --> 24:57.600
is I would watch a flapping fish

24:57.600 --> 25:00.880
look around in panic, hoping against hope

25:00.880 --> 25:03.440
that an adult would rise from the sea

25:03.440 --> 25:06.080
to deal with the situation for me.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.200
The best I could come up with,

25:07.200 --> 25:08.480
I'm thinking in the moment,

25:08.480 --> 25:11.600
I think I would probably drop it back into the water

25:11.600 --> 25:13.440
until I came up with a plan.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.200
I think this is the best that I would be able

25:15.200 --> 25:16.400
to chin up in the moment.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.680
Okay, hang out here.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.640
I'll be right back.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.160
I just like de-fish him.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.280
I think would be the best that I could probably do

25:23.280 --> 25:24.640
is like return him to the ocean

25:24.640 --> 25:27.520
and hopefully he found a way to like free himself.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.040
That's the best I could come up with.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.960
And that's monstrous what I've just said.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.080
I would most likely throw the rod in after the fish.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.880
This is yours now.

25:36.880 --> 25:42.400
Yeah, I tell you my great fear is that it would be,

25:42.400 --> 25:44.960
I would go out on the boat and I would start fishing

25:44.960 --> 25:46.560
and I would fall in the water

25:46.560 --> 25:48.400
and become an incredible Mr. Limpet

25:49.280 --> 25:51.520
because the fear for me there

25:51.520 --> 25:53.840
is not obviously like the trials and tribulations

25:53.840 --> 25:56.960
that he went through as a sea creature in that movie

25:56.960 --> 25:59.360
is that I am happily married

25:59.360 --> 26:01.600
and the father of a beautiful son.

26:01.600 --> 26:05.680
And in that movie, the Mr. Limpet

26:05.680 --> 26:07.920
also has a similar like life situation

26:07.920 --> 26:09.200
where he falls in the water, becomes a fish

26:09.200 --> 26:12.000
and instantly falls in love with a lady fish

26:12.800 --> 26:14.400
who I think he calls Lady Fish.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.840
And I don't know, I guess I'm scared

26:17.840 --> 26:19.920
of sort of like the infidelity

26:19.920 --> 26:24.560
that I think I guess goes along with being a fish guy.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.240
So I never ever get out there on the water

26:28.240 --> 26:31.520
because I don't want to be tempted.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.200
I don't want to be unfaithful, I guess,

26:33.200 --> 26:35.840
like Mr. Limpet was, do you know what I mean?

26:35.840 --> 26:36.800
Because here's the thing,

26:36.800 --> 26:39.280
there are plenty of fish in the sea and that's scary.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.040
And that scares me, that scares me, that scares me.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.680
Because I would never, I'm not tempted in my human form.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.320
You give me a fish brain and it's all instinct.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.080
I don't know, I don't know.

26:48.080 --> 26:48.880
Sure.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.240
It's instant, he falls in the water.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.120
He's like, oh no.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.560
And I guess he sings a song or something

26:52.560 --> 26:53.440
and then there's a lady fish.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.040
He's like, hello.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.880
And it's like, there's a lot of ethical questions

26:56.880 --> 26:58.560
about that, Mr. Limpet.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.600
Hey, just quick question

26:59.600 --> 27:02.240
because I think this marks the 100th time

27:02.240 --> 27:04.400
we've referenced Mr. Limpet.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.880
When was the last time any of us watched it?

27:06.880 --> 27:08.480
Oh, never is my answer.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.680
Okay, because it's a solid at least two decades for me.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.680
I've been waiting because Jim Carrey

27:15.680 --> 27:17.440
was supposed to remake it.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.120
And I just keep hoping that that's gonna

27:19.120 --> 27:20.800
come together eventually.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.200
So I guess he joins the Navy in his fish form

27:23.200 --> 27:25.280
and fights Nazi U-boats.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.440
Yeah, I remember him said it.

27:27.440 --> 27:32.400
I think he sets off like ocean sea mines.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.000
I think is a thing that he does.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.120
All right, yeah, he forms like a fish Navy.

27:38.480 --> 27:41.440
It's like the glorious, Finn glorious bastards.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.000
Oh no, I guess two Navy officers reach out

27:44.000 --> 27:45.920
to Mr. Limpet in the sea and offer him a commission

27:45.920 --> 27:47.280
in the United States Navy.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.040
It's unknown what becomes of the conversation

27:49.040 --> 27:51.120
for the movie ends with a question mark.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.200
That's pretty fucking cool way to end the flick.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.760
That's kind of like the Brock Lesnar coming out

27:55.760 --> 27:59.440
and beating the shit out of Mr. Limpet ending of the flick.

27:59.440 --> 27:59.760
And I'm very into that.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.960
I would watch that movie.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.480
Yeah, sure.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.080
What do you do when you catch a fish?

28:04.080 --> 28:06.400
You get Brock Lesnar to come punch you a bunch.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.400
He doesn't paint with punches.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.440
That's not really on his palette.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.560
Is he more of a kick man?

28:12.560 --> 28:13.440
He's more of a throw man.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.120
Oh, I see.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.400
All right folks, this has all been great

28:16.400 --> 28:29.840
but we need to take a quick sojourn in the money zone.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.440
Blue Apron.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.280
Two words.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.480
Seems so simple, don't they?

28:35.360 --> 28:36.000
They are.

28:36.000 --> 28:36.640
Because Blue Apron is simple.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.640
This is the danger, folks, if you start talking

28:38.640 --> 28:40.640
before you really decide what words

28:40.640 --> 28:43.280
you want to kind of string together into ideas.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.680
Listen, I've only got the one method, Justin.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.680
I don't know what you want from me.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.760
Sometimes when you're building the plane underneath you

28:49.760 --> 28:52.080
as you fly it, you add in like,

28:53.440 --> 28:55.840
I'm going to add in some big, big speakers

28:55.840 --> 28:58.080
and then I'm going to make sure that the paint color is blue.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.320
And you realize you have not put in wings or a chassis or a-

29:02.320 --> 29:04.480
Yeah, and you're making a Jeep, that kind of thing.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.200
Yeah, you're making a Jeep.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.400
Yeah, it happens.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.360
So Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.200
Make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.320
And they do.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.640
They do it by delivering farm fresh ingredients

29:18.640 --> 29:20.960
and step-by-step recipes to your door.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.720
I'm a big fan of Blue Apron.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.240
It makes me feel, well, when I started doing it,

29:26.240 --> 29:27.600
I felt like I could cook.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.280
And now having done it for a couple of years,

29:29.280 --> 29:32.960
I will say it has actually improved my cooking abilities.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.440
And Blue Apron is dedicated to supporting

29:35.440 --> 29:37.120
a more sustainable food system,

29:37.120 --> 29:38.800
setting the highest standards for ingredients

29:38.800 --> 29:40.880
and building a community of home chefs.

29:40.880 --> 29:46.480
They just did a Bob's Burgers partnership.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.160
I thought you were going to get kicked out of that.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.760
I loved it so much.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.960
And I got to make the Bob's Burgers.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.240
Check out this week's menu

29:54.240 --> 29:56.080
and get your first three meals free

29:56.080 --> 29:58.560

29:58.560 --> 30:01.120
That's blueapron.com slash my brother

30:01.120 --> 30:03.440
to get your first three meals free.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.160
Can I tell you all about Quip?

30:08.160 --> 30:08.480
Yeah.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.400
I hate Quip.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.600
Did you know it's opposite day?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.120
Did you know it's opposite day?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.640
Oh, whoa.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.720
I think that could be a really fun way

30:16.720 --> 30:18.160
to start doing these ads.

30:19.040 --> 30:19.760
Do you know what I mean?

30:19.760 --> 30:20.640
Do opposite ads.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.440
Hating them?

30:21.440 --> 30:21.680
Yeah.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.520
It'd be like, oh, it doesn't brush my teeth really good

30:23.520 --> 30:25.760
and make my teeth look white and beautiful.

30:25.760 --> 30:26.960
Just, it's opposite day.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.360
So you have to keep saying that over and over again.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.360
Why don't you do an opposite day for this one

30:31.360 --> 30:32.720
and see if they still give us money?

30:33.360 --> 30:33.920
Okay.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.200
Good toast run.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.560
And I'm also, I'm worried, Griffin,

30:36.560 --> 30:40.000
that if you say it's opposite day on opposite day,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.600
doesn't that mean it's not opposite day?

30:41.600 --> 30:43.200
Ah, shit, birds.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.080
Okay, anyway, it's not opposite day anymore.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.120
I love Quip.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.160
And it's because I was brushing my teeth wrong

30:50.160 --> 30:51.680
because I was using the wrong toothbrush

30:51.680 --> 30:52.960
and now I'm using a Quip toothbrush.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.160
It's sleek and stylish.

30:54.160 --> 30:54.960
It's modern.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.800
It is discreet.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.960
And it is an electric-

31:00.960 --> 31:02.400
It'll keep its mouth shut.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.240
It's a new, it'll keep my mouth shut

31:04.240 --> 31:06.240
while I'm brushing it in and out in there

31:06.240 --> 31:07.360
and it's an electric toothbrush,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.600
so it's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes

31:09.600 --> 31:11.440
and it packs premium vibrations

31:11.440 --> 31:12.800
for a perfect two-minute clean.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.680
Plus their guiding pulses remind you when to switch sides

31:15.680 --> 31:17.040
and they'll deliver new brush heads

31:17.040 --> 31:18.720
on a dentist-recommended schedule

31:18.720 --> 31:20.560
every three months for just $5,

31:20.560 --> 31:22.640
including free shipping worldwide.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.200
It's great.

31:23.200 --> 31:23.920
I have one.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.360
It sticks to my bathroom mirror.

31:25.360 --> 31:28.080
I pop it in, brush it, pop it back out,

31:28.080 --> 31:29.520
and then I can travel with it.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.160
It's super easy.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.160
Anyway, Quip starts at just $25.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.560
And if you go to getquip.com,

31:34.560 --> 31:38.320
that's getquip.com slash my brother right now,

31:38.320 --> 31:40.160
you'll get your first refill pack free

31:40.160 --> 31:41.760
with a Quip electric toothbrush,

31:41.760 --> 31:45.600
spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.800
I got a Jumbotron here.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.640
I want to tell you,

31:48.640 --> 31:52.720
hey, do you like people playing video games with a twist?

31:52.720 --> 31:54.240
Check out this YouTube channel,

31:54.240 --> 31:56.560
Espresso Steampunk.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.280
There are no Xs in the word espresso, by the way.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.400
As you can tell by the way I say it, espresso.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.520
He plays scary games while recording his pulse

32:05.520 --> 32:08.160
and pupil dilation, kind of like Blade Runner.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.120
He plays dating sims while giving comedic dating advice

32:11.120 --> 32:12.240
with his girlfriend.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.560
He just wants to entertain you while he chills out.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.440
What could be better?

32:15.440 --> 32:19.280
So once again, that's youtube.com slash Espresso Steampunk.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.000
It's been too long since I've seen Blade Runner.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.600
I don't remember Harrison Ford playing Fortnite,

32:28.800 --> 32:29.840
but maybe that happened.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.480
Did that happen?

32:31.200 --> 32:34.400
Did Harrison Ford do a lot of live streaming in Blade Runner?

32:34.400 --> 32:38.880
Yeah, and he gets his ass completely wracked by these fucking androids

32:38.880 --> 32:41.600
because they have hands that are keyboards

32:41.600 --> 32:43.600
and they use all the cheat codes.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.640
Oh, they have like the turbo button.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.120
They have turbo buttons built into their freaking,

32:49.680 --> 32:52.000
you know, fingers and thumbs and elbows.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.320
And they always do the odd job.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.160
And the only game I can beat them at is Dance Central

32:56.160 --> 32:57.680
because they got no rhythm, but I do.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.360
Can't teach a robot rhythm.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.400
I always say that.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.040
I have a message for Chris and it's from Ana.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.880
And it says, sub handsome.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.720
I can't believe we've been together for 10 years already.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.960
I'm not very romantic, but I figured if I got our favorite brothers

33:08.960 --> 33:11.600
to read this message to you, my love would come through.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.640
Am I good?

33:12.640 --> 33:14.800
Looking forward to many more years of eating chatinos,

33:14.800 --> 33:18.560
hanging out with our cat, Sam, and watching dumb internet videos.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.040
Much love, Ana.

33:21.040 --> 33:27.280
And this is for, on or after January 22nd, 2018.

33:27.280 --> 33:32.240
So wowza, did, whoo, woof.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.920
That is bracing.

33:33.920 --> 33:38.240
That is a bracing amount by which to miss this happy occasion.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.680
So thank you so much.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.120
It's been basically 11 years.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.280
So let's go back and fix it.

33:43.280 --> 33:43.520
Okay.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.040
Hi, I'm Biz.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.920
And I'm Teresa.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.480
Uh, yahoo?

34:25.040 --> 34:26.080
Sure, yeah, it sounds great.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.680
So this one was sent in by Matt Brown.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.160
Thanks, Matt.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.720
Yahoo answers user star five who asks,

34:32.720 --> 34:36.240
if you were Bigfoot, would you reveal yourself to humans?

34:37.120 --> 34:37.920
Like a flasher?

34:38.880 --> 34:39.680
Probably not a flasher.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.560
Probably like a, you know, an announcement.

34:42.560 --> 34:43.760
Hey, I'm Bigfoot.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.200
It's, it is me.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.720
Let's do this thing.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.760
Me and you together.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.840
Humanity, let's fucking, let's roll.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.120
If I was going to, you'd have to pick the right moment

34:53.120 --> 34:54.880
to make maximum impact.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.400
Right, so it'd have to be...

34:58.400 --> 34:59.840
2020 election.

34:59.840 --> 35:03.200
Yeah, and like announce yourself as like a candidate.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.760
Oh, I think it's just the Bigfoot endorsement.

35:05.760 --> 35:06.880
Oh, okay.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.960
See, but that's the thing is like,

35:08.960 --> 35:10.800
I would want to do it just when I felt like

35:11.600 --> 35:14.160
people stopped believing in Bigfoot,

35:14.160 --> 35:16.640
and that's when it's going to make the biggest impact.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.720
Because if everybody already believes you're there,

35:18.720 --> 35:19.600
big deal, right?

35:19.600 --> 35:20.560
Then you're like, I'm Bigfoot,

35:20.560 --> 35:22.240
and everyone's like, yeah, we fucking know.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.800
But it just feels like if you could wait until

35:24.800 --> 35:26.800
like the tipping point where most people are like,

35:26.800 --> 35:28.080
yeah, you know what?

35:28.080 --> 35:28.960
There's no Bigfoot.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.360
And then you're just like, boom, I'm Bigfoot.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.240
That weird guy at the grocery store was right.

35:35.040 --> 35:35.680
That would be good.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.040
I'll tell you the problem.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.080
I'll tell you why I probably would,

35:38.080 --> 35:40.320
this would be a firm no for me if I was the Bigfoot,

35:40.960 --> 35:42.800
is I would step up and I'd be like,

35:42.800 --> 35:44.480
hey, I do a press conference.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.000
Hey, Bigfoot, big and hairy, and I live in the woods,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.720
and I just want to chill.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.240
So I just wanted to say, hey,

35:52.240 --> 35:54.400
because I know y'all have a lot of internet fights about me.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.600
I want to put that to bed.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.560
It's me, the Bigfoot.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.880
Jack Links, don't appreciate your whole thing.

36:00.240 --> 36:00.880
I'm pretty chill.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.200
So Harry and the Hendershins is the best,

36:03.200 --> 36:04.880
is a great movie, best movie ever made.

36:05.760 --> 36:08.000
They actually got it the closest to right.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.400
So well done.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.000
So anyway, I'm going to go back to the woods.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.400
And there'll be a lot of people who watch-

36:14.400 --> 36:15.920
Also, Jill Stein 2020.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.400
Okay.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.200
Jill Stein 2020.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.320
Just wanted to get that out there.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.680
To get ahead of it.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.560
Don't have a bunch of debates about sort of who I'm going to support,

36:22.560 --> 36:24.000
because Jill Stein 2020, bye.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.800
2020, bye.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.520
There'll be a lot of people who watch that press conference

36:27.520 --> 36:29.360
who didn't have particularly strong feelings

36:29.360 --> 36:30.400
about the existence of Bigfoot,

36:30.400 --> 36:32.640
who would then see it and then say,

36:33.840 --> 36:36.800
wow, I want to eat that thing.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.320
Oh, yeah.

36:38.320 --> 36:38.800
Do you know what I mean?

36:40.320 --> 36:42.480
There'll be people who don't particularly have feelings about it.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.320
They would see the Bigfoot do the press conference

36:44.320 --> 36:46.160
and say, hey, I'm Bigfoot, I'm real.

36:46.160 --> 36:49.120
Jill Stein 2020, legalize it.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.800
And then wander back off in the woods.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.400
And there would be people who would say like,

36:52.400 --> 36:56.000
I wonder what the meat and flesh of that animal would taste like.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.960
Do you know what I'm talking about?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.480
I want to wear him like a jacket.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.440
I want to wear him like a jacket.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.240
There's only one of them.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.480
And I'm sure the meat is maybe tough and gamey,

37:02.480 --> 37:04.240
but it would be the only way to ever have it.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.240
And there'll be lots and lots and lots and lots of people.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.920
We could not satisfy.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.640
We'd have, unless we did like a real Okja situation,

37:10.640 --> 37:14.480
like we would not be able to fully satisfy the hunger

37:14.480 --> 37:17.360
for this being's flesh and meat.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.480
Griffin, who do you think is the most famous person

37:20.480 --> 37:22.160
who would want to eat Bigfoot?

37:24.160 --> 37:26.000
How famous is Ted Nugent?

37:26.000 --> 37:27.920
Cause that's a hundred percent guaranteed.

37:27.920 --> 37:28.160
Yes.

37:29.520 --> 37:32.880
I bet maybe Gordon Ramsey would want to eat Bigfoot.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.040
Oh, the entire, the chef community would be,

37:36.320 --> 37:38.560
I mean, certainly there are chefs who would be like

37:38.560 --> 37:42.080
more into like sustainable sources of meat,

37:42.080 --> 37:45.280
but then there would be like Wolfgang Puck

37:45.280 --> 37:51.120
would like format it like a militia to get the Bigfoot.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.320
I have a think piece for you.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.520
I have a think piece for you here

37:55.520 --> 37:57.120
that I'd like to craft in this moment.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.840
I was looking up a study and right now,

38:00.880 --> 38:02.400
according to the best research that I could find,

38:02.400 --> 38:06.640
most recent research, around 20% of Americans,

38:06.640 --> 38:10.080
one in five, believe that Bigfoot is real.

38:10.080 --> 38:10.400
Okay?

38:10.400 --> 38:10.720
Okay.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.200
One in five.

38:11.200 --> 38:16.560
Okay. If Bigfoot goes on TV and does a press conference

38:17.200 --> 38:18.480
about how he is real,

38:19.040 --> 38:23.040
that is broadcast across all the major news stations,

38:24.320 --> 38:28.320
the next morning, what percentage of Americans

38:28.320 --> 38:29.840
believe Bigfoot is real?

38:29.840 --> 38:32.720
This is like, what I'd like to posit is,

38:32.720 --> 38:35.440
has it changed at all to see that?

38:35.440 --> 38:38.400
Is it less or do fewer at that point?

38:38.400 --> 38:40.560
How many people would watch Bigfoot talk on TV

38:40.560 --> 38:42.240
and say, hi, it's me, Bigfoot.

38:42.240 --> 38:42.880
I'm real.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.520
Jill Stein, 2020, legalize it.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.440
How many people after that press conference,

38:47.440 --> 38:50.720
the next morning wake up and then believe Bigfoot is real?

38:50.720 --> 38:52.000
This is an excellent point, Justin,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.080
because there are many people in the world

38:54.080 --> 38:55.920
that I know are real,

38:55.920 --> 38:58.640
but at any given moment when I'm not looking at them,

38:58.640 --> 39:00.240
I don't believe they exist.

39:00.240 --> 39:00.880
What's the number?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.200
I think-

39:04.320 --> 39:07.760
Bigfoot goes on TV, does a press conference.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.120
Before this press conference, one in five Americans

39:11.120 --> 39:13.040
believe Bigfoot is real.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.680
What is that number after the press conference?

39:16.480 --> 39:19.120
Well, fuck, Justin, there was a hologram of Tupac

39:19.120 --> 39:21.440
who just like performed at a thing

39:21.440 --> 39:24.080
and they've got the green screens and the CGI's.

39:24.080 --> 39:27.920
Boy, you are really working so hard to dodge these-

39:27.920 --> 39:28.800
15%.

39:28.800 --> 39:29.600
What?

39:29.600 --> 39:30.400
I think it drops.

39:30.400 --> 39:30.800
That's about-

39:30.800 --> 39:31.440
Oh, interesting.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.720
That's actually where I was.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.520
Because I feel like there's a percentage,

39:35.520 --> 39:39.760
there is a not insignificant percentage of the Bigfoot crowd

39:39.760 --> 39:42.800
for whom seeing Bigfoot give a press conference

39:42.800 --> 39:48.480
on the national media would probably lower their chance

39:48.480 --> 39:49.840
of believing in Bigfoot.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.280
I believe that there is a percentage

39:51.280 --> 39:52.880
of the human population.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.800
There would definitely be someone who would see it

39:54.800 --> 39:56.960
and be like, oh no, that's not Bigfoot.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.000
Yes, right.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.200
That's just a large talking ape man,

40:01.200 --> 40:02.800
but that's not Bigfoot.

40:02.800 --> 40:06.160
I mean, if the last- I have drawn Bigfoot and he looks like this

40:06.160 --> 40:10.800
and he has ripped pecs and he has just like a 12 pack

40:11.360 --> 40:14.320
and he kisses real good and that's not him.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.240
I mean, if the last few years have been any indication,

40:16.240 --> 40:17.360
if it does appear on the news,

40:17.360 --> 40:20.800
there will be people instantly on Facebook like,

40:20.800 --> 40:22.400
if they don't look that big to me.

40:25.040 --> 40:25.540
Anyway.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.440
I would want to eat him.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.600
Yeah, I think we'd all want to sliver that-

40:29.600 --> 40:30.960
But not all of them.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.560
No, no, no, no.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.560
Just enough.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.600
See, now I'm picturing some kind of a movie,

40:37.600 --> 40:40.640
a buddy comedy of Bigfoot comes out,

40:40.640 --> 40:43.120
announces himself, then the whole world wants to eat him

40:43.120 --> 40:47.280
and it leads to this worldwide hunt for Bigfoot

40:47.280 --> 40:51.280
and he has one friend who helps him

40:51.280 --> 40:54.240
and it's Guy Fieri and they team up

40:54.240 --> 40:56.400
and Guy Fieri has to protect him

40:56.400 --> 40:58.880
from all the other chefs in the world

40:59.680 --> 41:01.840
and they just go on adventures together.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.360
Maybe it's more of a sitcom,

41:03.360 --> 41:06.000
maybe it's like an hour long,

41:07.200 --> 41:09.920
not really sitcom, so much as a humorous drama.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.920
Yeah, and at the end,

41:11.920 --> 41:14.480
you're envisioning sort of a departed style ending

41:14.480 --> 41:16.080
for this one because really Guy Fieri

41:16.080 --> 41:18.800
is just trying to find a deep fryer big enough

41:18.800 --> 41:21.120
to get the entire Bigfoot in it at once.

41:22.720 --> 41:27.280
At the end, Bigfoot dies of a heart attack

41:27.280 --> 41:29.360
but as he's dying, tells Guy Fieri,

41:29.360 --> 41:30.320
you're the only one who deserves-

41:30.320 --> 41:31.920
It's okay.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.000
Yes, please do it and Guy Fieri's like,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.880
I don't want to, so Bigfoot climbs inside of his mouth

41:36.880 --> 41:39.440
and makes him chew him up and it's really touching.

41:39.440 --> 41:43.120
Do it, Guy Fieri, oh, no, no, no.

41:43.120 --> 41:47.680
He jams his huge hairy fist into Guy Fieri's huge hairy mouth

41:47.680 --> 41:49.280
and just makes with his other hand,

41:49.280 --> 41:51.760
just kind of forces Guy Fieri's jaw

41:51.760 --> 41:54.160
to go up and down and up and down.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.560
As Guy Fieri cries donkey sauce.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.440
Yeah, yeah, he cries donkey sauce directly into the mouth

41:59.440 --> 42:02.400
to add the flavorings and take it straight to flavor town.

42:02.400 --> 42:05.680
It's basically like the arm cutting scene in 127 hours.

42:05.680 --> 42:08.480
It is long and it is brutal and you see all of it

42:08.480 --> 42:10.000
but it's pathetic.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.320
If anybody can get Bigfoot and Guy Fieri to commit

42:14.320 --> 42:15.440
and we know which one of those

42:15.440 --> 42:16.640
is gonna be the most difficult,

42:17.440 --> 42:19.360
then I will kickstart that project.

42:19.360 --> 42:23.280
And then after credit scene, Guy's hosting the Triple G,

42:23.280 --> 42:25.840
Guy's grocery games and one of the contestants

42:25.840 --> 42:27.920
runs back down the aisle and he's like,

42:27.920 --> 42:28.960
all right, what'd you get?

42:28.960 --> 42:31.040
And he's like, well, I got some Tabasco sauce,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.800
I got some Panko bread crumbs

42:34.800 --> 42:37.200
and I got one pound of Bigfoot meat

42:37.200 --> 42:39.520
and then it cuts to Guy Fieri's shocked face

42:39.520 --> 42:41.040
and he's like, where did you?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.200
Into a question mark?

42:46.400 --> 42:46.640
Okay.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.880
Got a haunted doll watch.

42:50.880 --> 42:51.280
Okay.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.320
It's a brief one.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.920
But this is kind of a unique approach

42:53.920 --> 42:55.360
that I had not seen before.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.480
So I wanted to highlight this haunted doll named Goldie

42:58.480 --> 43:05.000
Who I will say Goldie does not look all that creepy kind of a sweet doll if I'm being honest kind of just like a

43:06.000 --> 43:08.420
Just looks like kind of a sweet doll to me

43:09.400 --> 43:12.880
I'm gonna send you all the link so you can enjoy Goldie

43:12.880 --> 43:18.360
You're not gonna be able to find Goldie when you're in this episode because Goldie's only on sale for another 26 minutes zero bids on

43:18.360 --> 43:21.780
Goldie currently starting bid is $38 which is

43:22.400 --> 43:27.420
Kind of a buck wild starting bid amount just kind of seems like you snap that one out of midair, but anyway

43:27.420 --> 43:31.020
This is oh my god, Justin. What?

43:31.700 --> 43:34.440
Just the this supplemental images

43:36.180 --> 43:38.180
Kind of sweet doll, that's all

43:39.220 --> 43:41.180
It's just kind of sweet doll

43:41.180 --> 43:43.180
Anywho, this is Goldilocks

43:43.660 --> 43:49.860
This is quote Goldilocks quote. I've been working with her for a while now and discovered. She died a

43:50.700 --> 43:53.380
Horrible death I took pictures of the response

43:53.380 --> 44:00.140
I got when asking her several questions about when she died and who killed her other things that came up were quote violence

44:00.460 --> 44:05.140
Hand hell and copper I can send you pictures of these words on my device

44:05.140 --> 44:08.100
If you like I was limited by the number of pictures I can post

44:09.340 --> 44:11.780
What's the describe the device Justin it is?

44:14.700 --> 44:16.700
It looks like

44:17.900 --> 44:19.780
Okay

44:19.780 --> 44:21.780
It's a phone

44:21.780 --> 44:23.780
Definitely, it's a phone and

44:24.700 --> 44:30.620
It looks like there's like meters and stuff at the top and then below it. There's like

44:31.460 --> 44:33.460
the NES font

44:34.180 --> 44:36.540
basic like Mega Man NES font

44:38.100 --> 44:40.100
Describing I

44:40.260 --> 44:46.040
Guess what the doll is trying to communicate. I don't know if this is a program or what but it is amazing

44:46.420 --> 44:49.460
Here are the images like the text on these images is

44:49.460 --> 44:50.780
inside

44:50.780 --> 44:52.300
you

44:52.300 --> 44:54.180
That's the first one and it's the best one

44:54.180 --> 44:57.420
I wish you had started with another one because it's the best one what possible what?

44:57.500 --> 45:03.000
Possible question could you have posted this hounded doll that the response inside you would be an acceptable

45:03.740 --> 45:05.740
next seven

45:06.260 --> 45:08.260
followed by light and

45:08.900 --> 45:10.900
then believe him

45:10.900 --> 45:17.100
Oh my God, okay, wait over. These are all discrete images gorging

45:19.140 --> 45:20.980
Maniac

45:20.980 --> 45:25.260
Not brave if only there was a word that meant not brave

45:25.820 --> 45:29.060
Afraid is the next image Griffin afraid

45:30.180 --> 45:32.180
Not brave not brave

45:32.860 --> 45:37.060
I know there's one. That's like easier. Hey you have a limited number of images

45:37.060 --> 45:42.060
You can share and you're going to do both not brave and afraid last one is cremate by the way

45:42.060 --> 45:47.580
So you do have that going for you. I don't know what I'm putting out a bounty on this fucking program

45:47.580 --> 45:52.220
Please someone tell me what it is. It looks like an iPhone app, and I need it desperately

45:52.820 --> 45:58.880
So here's the lesson it says right here Justin if you have any questions, please feel free to ask yeah

45:59.060 --> 46:05.420
What app is that please I do I want to say that this is this is the reason?

46:05.420 --> 46:08.620
I'm I'm reading this and not discuss this these great great

46:09.620 --> 46:12.380
ghost communication app that apparently exists

46:13.260 --> 46:14.180
the

46:14.180 --> 46:22.040
After all this at the end this question this Lister says I also ask that you place her in a room you use

46:22.100 --> 46:23.100
most

46:23.100 --> 46:25.100
So you can connect?

46:25.220 --> 46:29.980
Spirits take time and the more time you spend with her the more she will show herself to you

46:30.340 --> 46:32.660
Please be patient. She is an amazing fine

46:32.660 --> 46:36.740
So it's not just like I'm going to get one of these as like a novelty

46:37.020 --> 46:43.380
It's like I'm going to put this doll in my home in a high traffic zone

46:43.700 --> 46:46.660
So I can really get comfortable with the ghost that's in this doll

46:46.660 --> 46:51.940
I wanted to be somewhere where companies going to see it. I wanted to be somewhere very prominent. I've never seen

46:52.780 --> 46:54.780
that that sort of

46:55.020 --> 46:59.340
requirement on a ebay listing I mean it's word of mouth marketing in that

46:59.340 --> 47:05.140
Please talk about the doll to all your friends to give them the web address of my ebay shop of

47:05.940 --> 47:09.700
Haunted items this person's this person's on some some next-level

47:10.500 --> 47:15.020
Multi-level marketing shit. I do want to warn you that as you connect with her more and more

47:15.020 --> 47:19.220
She will start to send you that inside you message more and more

47:19.740 --> 47:21.740
It's time to sell her

47:22.740 --> 47:26.660
Folks that's going to do it for us this week. Thank you so much for

47:26.660 --> 47:28.660
listening to our program

47:29.140 --> 47:34.980
I want to say real quick. I got a new podcast. It's a meditative show about cereal

47:35.540 --> 47:41.820
I made it for anxiety sufferers and people who like cereal and people who fit into both categories

47:41.820 --> 47:47.980
I made it with the creator of a cereal blog called serial asleep named Dan Kuber and Dan

47:47.980 --> 47:53.700
And I record this very relaxing show that you could find at bowl dot rest

47:53.700 --> 47:59.420
It's just an opportunity to zone out you can also go to bowl dot rest to support the show

48:00.020 --> 48:02.860
And I'll proceeds from the show will go to half

48:02.860 --> 48:06.620
We'll go to keep the lights on over at seal is seriously and the other half will go to

48:07.260 --> 48:12.620
Food pantry in the Huntington West Virginia area, so you're helping support two great things

48:12.620 --> 48:15.140
And I hope you get a lot out of it

48:15.140 --> 48:18.580
And I hope it'll help you to relax I use podcasts a lot to relax

48:18.820 --> 48:22.540
When my anxiety is at its peak, and I hope that this can be the same for you

48:22.540 --> 48:28.420
So that's the empty bowl bowl dot rest is where you can find that and hope you check it out

48:29.420 --> 48:36.660
Justin how many times now have you told people about this and had to clarify like breakfast cereal not like the podcast

48:36.660 --> 48:42.180
This is the reason that I don't have cereal in the title Travis, so I would not have to repeatedly have that conversation
