00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.680
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era. We have a

00:49.680 --> 00:59.680
very serious message to begin this week's show. On November 6th, you have what is perhaps your

00:59.680 --> 01:09.040
most important responsibility as a citizen. On November 6th, if you use standard two-day

01:09.040 --> 01:16.480
shipping on Amazon, that's the day you're going to need to order your birthday presents for Travis

01:16.480 --> 01:22.800
and I to get here by November 8th on our birthday. Because, I kid you not, anything that arrives on

01:22.800 --> 01:28.080
November 9th or later goes right in the trash. Just throw it away. You might as well get them

01:28.080 --> 01:32.880
kindling, because that's all that it's going to turn into. If you send me a Kindle, I will burn it.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.040
Try to get that Kindle in by the 8th. Try to get that one in under the wire.

01:37.680 --> 01:45.440
If the Kindle's in on the 9th, it's kindling. Otherwise, just send them a bunch of rolled up

01:47.200 --> 01:54.880
phonebook pages. Something to fuel the flame. Justin McElroy, P.O. Box, 54, Huntington,

01:54.880 --> 02:03.360
West Virginia, 25706. You got to get those gifts in early, folks. I want to go to the post office,

02:03.360 --> 02:08.320
and when I go to retrieve my mail, I want it to be like, ugh, this guy.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.840
Oh, and like the old time, they pull out a bag of fan mail, you know, and just slap it down on the

02:13.840 --> 02:19.360
counter. Big Miracle on 34th Street style sacks of mail of people who believe in me.

02:19.360 --> 02:27.280
I believe in Justin. I actually don't send, like, postcards. I have no use for that. That has no

02:27.280 --> 02:31.920
resale value. How are you going to get these gifts that are sent to our Huntington-based mailboxer,

02:31.920 --> 02:38.640
Travis, who also shares your birthday? Well, I'll get them to him on the holiday.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.000
Oh, you'll get them on the Christmas tip. Get them on the Christmas tip. Maybe a little

02:42.000 --> 02:45.120
re-gifto. I will try to restrain myself from burning them.

02:45.120 --> 02:51.520
Man, I wish my birthday was the same year as your guys.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.560
That would be sweet, if it was like a my brother, my brother, me birthday

02:54.560 --> 02:58.480
spectacular. I mean, it basically is. Haven't we talked about legally changing that before?

02:58.480 --> 03:01.120
You've got to be able to, like, legally change your birthday, right?

03:01.120 --> 03:06.720
Yeah, I mean, legally, you can get in a time machine, and then when my parents were about

03:06.720 --> 03:09.440
to bone down on... Hold up, hold up, hold up.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.120
Let me do the math real quick. July? It would have been, like, July 17th, right?

03:13.120 --> 03:19.360
Then I would kick in the door and be like, can you guys please chill on this, please,

03:19.360 --> 03:24.320
for seven months? Can you chill on this for seven months? Pick whatever day you fuck to

03:24.320 --> 03:25.920
make Justin and Travis... Keep the fire alive.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.920
Keep the fire alive till then. It's February. It's like around...

03:29.920 --> 03:30.960
I don't want to think about this. It's Valentine's Day.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.960
It's Valentine's Day. I don't want to think about this.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.320
I'm just saying there's a very special basket involved.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.280
Like anything else, I want to think about anything else. Let's talk about...

03:43.280 --> 03:46.800
It's important, though. Hey, you guys, it is important. Get out there. Get out to vote.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.360
Rock the vote. Get out to vote. And when you're out there,

03:49.360 --> 03:52.720
vote for Obama. It doesn't matter who you vote for,

03:52.720 --> 03:55.200
as long as you vote for Obama. You've got to vote for Obama.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.800
The other guy is just the worst. He's just the pits.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.080
That guy seems kind of like the pits. How do you not get this by now?

04:02.800 --> 04:04.640
Watch a TV. Anything.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.760
Anything. I don't want to get political here,

04:07.760 --> 04:10.880
but it seems like you should probably vote for Obama.

04:10.880 --> 04:15.680
The line is clearly drawn in the sand. One is the good guy,

04:15.680 --> 04:18.320
and the other guy is the fucking smoke monster from Lost.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.680
Like, you know the score. You know the score.

04:21.680 --> 04:28.240
I saw a video on the internet of Romney supporters at an Ohio rally,

04:28.240 --> 04:32.080
and every one of them was lighting garbage cans of trash on fire

04:32.080 --> 04:36.400
and then dumping it on kids. That's every person.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.160
Straight talk. Heard this come up on the local radio station.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.360
Mitt Romney coming to, I think it was Columbus,

04:46.240 --> 04:49.200
and performing with him on stage, Marshall Tucker Band.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.720
Then Obama coming to Cleveland, performing with him,

04:52.720 --> 04:56.640
Jay-Z and Bruce Springsteen. How you got to fucking vote for Romney?

04:56.640 --> 04:59.200
Pretty good. Did you guys see the clip where

04:59.200 --> 05:02.800
Mitt Romney was, he didn't know he was being filmed, and he was at the beach,

05:02.800 --> 05:06.240
and he unbuttoned his shirt, and then in his stomach,

05:06.240 --> 05:09.680
there was a little glass window. There's a little glass cage

05:09.680 --> 05:13.680
with a talking brain in it, and Mitt Romney is crying.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.960
As it turns out, Mitt Romney is crying. Did you guys know that Mitt Romney,

05:16.960 --> 05:19.200
did you see the clip? It was Huffington Post.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.840
It was the front page, just in big red letters. It said,

05:21.840 --> 05:24.320
Crang? With a question mark, and then there's a picture

05:24.880 --> 05:27.120
of Mitt Romney's windowed torso.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.320
Listen, that's just the liberal media, you know,

05:30.320 --> 05:34.320
trying to sell him as a robot body with a brain in his tummy.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.160
Yeah. No, he does have that,

05:36.160 --> 05:39.760
but he insists he's not crying. He'll own up to the fact that

05:39.760 --> 05:42.640
there is a brain inside his stomach. Everyone with a brain inside their

05:42.640 --> 05:45.520
stomach isn't Crang. That's kind of bigoted for you to say.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.680
I'm actually surprised to hear you say that.

05:48.960 --> 05:52.960
Travis, is it just abysmal for you right now,

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
trying to watch TV, trying to get your TV on?

05:54.960 --> 05:59.600
Do you mean because I have to deal with the fact that there are current events

05:59.600 --> 06:02.240
going on around me at all times? Well, no, because you're in a swing-

06:02.240 --> 06:04.720
You're in the swingin' estate.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.000
The swingin' estate, yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.040
It is bad. Here's the only thing that makes it better.

06:09.040 --> 06:11.680
The only thing that makes it great is listening to the ads where they've

06:11.680 --> 06:15.840
tried to capture real people who are like, you know, as a mother.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.680
But even better, they'll try to act like they just plopped a microphone down

06:19.680 --> 06:22.880
in the middle of the kitchen table, and you're just over here being like,

06:22.880 --> 06:27.280
yeah, I don't know about this Romney guy saying he's gonna cut spending for kids

06:27.280 --> 06:30.720
and stuff. I mean, I guess as a mom, I hate that.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.640
There's literally one where it's like, well, let me look it up real quick.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.440
And you hear her typing on the keyboard and saying like,

06:37.440 --> 06:42.400
Mitt Romney, federal spending for education.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.480
Oh, oh, no.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.920
This is hardly ideal.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.240
I don't like this at all as a mother. Well, let me-

06:48.240 --> 06:51.200
Hold on. Obama financial aid.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.120
Click, click, click, click. For students.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.280
Oh yeah, I like this. Oh, a video clip.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.280
And then you play it and you hear Obama talk.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.560
It's like the best because someone out there is listening to it going,

07:00.560 --> 07:02.080
how did they get this audio?

07:02.080 --> 07:04.720
How did they make a radio of internet?

07:04.720 --> 07:07.520
That's why not just say, go to our internet and it's going to be,

07:07.520 --> 07:09.040
you're going to have all your questions answered.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.880
Travis, do you feel a sense of superiority over Justin and I,

07:12.880 --> 07:18.320
because your vote is technically worth two of Justin's votes and roughly 18 of my votes?

07:18.320 --> 07:19.600
Yes, indeed. I do.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.800
I want you guys to know this.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.560
It's like you have like dodeca suffrage.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.880
Like it's so much, so much doper than mine.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.000
So much liberty. Griffin, which way is Texas going?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.680
No, no, no. Texas, are you kidding?

07:33.680 --> 07:35.680
This place is the hotbed.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.040
Texas can't make up its mind not only between Dems and Repubs,

07:39.040 --> 07:40.400
they want the Greens.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.160
They want the, they want the Libbers.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.000
Are they going to go for Gary Johnson?

07:45.040 --> 07:47.600
Everyone. They don't know who to vote for.

07:47.600 --> 07:52.800
I don't like that. It would be so great if the entire country, 49 states,

07:52.800 --> 07:56.880
you know, are split between Romney and Obama,

07:56.880 --> 08:01.840
and Texas just is 100% every single vote for Gary Johnson.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.920
Yeah, why not? It could happen.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.360
Keep Texas weird, because all of Texas is like Austin, right?

08:07.360 --> 08:08.240
Please, right?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.080
Let's get to the questions.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.200
I'm ready to help people.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.640
I'm in like a helpful mood now.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.240
I told people how to vote.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.680
Now I want to tell them how to live.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.960
We didn't actually tell them how to vote.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.320
We just said, go do that thing.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.480
I hate to tell you guys this, but if you're not regged yet,

08:22.480 --> 08:24.880
you're probably in a big old heap of trouble.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.120
Just lie to your friends and say that you did do it,

08:27.120 --> 08:31.280
because that's probably what 80% of the youth of our nation are going to do.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.680
I spend a lot of time working out of a coffee shop.

08:35.680 --> 08:40.480
I'll go there, work for several hours, often getting at least one refill.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.000
I tip well in the first cup and then normally end up paying exact change

08:44.000 --> 08:47.200
or something close to that for the refills.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.640
Is this an okay thing to do or should I be tipping every time,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.800
especially considering how much time I spend there?

08:53.440 --> 08:55.280
That's from Confused in Oh God,

08:55.280 --> 08:57.600
the barista is right behind me reading over my shoulder.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.600
Oh, man.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.600
I have such good insight on this.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.240
Yeah, because Travis has been royally screwed by people.

09:08.240 --> 09:13.680
I think the fact that you're tipping at all makes you saint-like.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.720
Yeah, you're way above.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.400
This is the deciding factor on this question.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.160
When you say coffee shop, do you mean like a Starbucks?

09:22.720 --> 09:26.960
Or do you mean like your local tiny eight table coffee shop

09:27.520 --> 09:29.360
on like the second floor of a building?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.800
Because the difference is at a Starbucks,

09:34.560 --> 09:36.960
you're not stealing real estate from someone.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.240
If this is like a restaurant coffee shop where they do food all day

09:40.240 --> 09:41.360
and this is the only thing they do

09:41.360 --> 09:45.360
and you're taking up a whole table to yourself while you work

09:45.360 --> 09:46.880
on your spreadsheets or whatever,

09:47.600 --> 09:50.160
then you're taking business away from the coffee shop.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.400
You should be tipping every time.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.720
There's a cafe like that and a Starbucks like that

09:57.520 --> 09:59.360
like a block and a half from my house.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.200
I like to get out of the house because I work from home,

10:03.200 --> 10:08.160
but I can't spend more than like a half hour there before I feel like

10:08.160 --> 10:11.520
this is not my beautiful house, you know?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.840
It's people wheezing the Wi-Fi.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.520
It's people that use the internet and they don't have internet at home,

10:17.520 --> 10:19.760
but they need it for like school or they need it for work

10:19.760 --> 10:24.320
and they go and use the Wi-Fi and then tip a buck and think that that's fair.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.840
I come here, I go to those places whenever my Wi-Fi does crap out,

10:27.840 --> 10:30.720
which I have Grande here in Austin,

10:30.720 --> 10:33.440
which goes out every time a bird flies over my house.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.520
So, it's quite frequent, but I still, even under those pretenses,

10:37.520 --> 10:42.480
it's like I feel like I am just crashing out of Bud's,

10:43.040 --> 10:44.800
only I don't know my bud very well,

10:45.600 --> 10:48.800
and my bud didn't really give me permission to come over.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.040
I just sort of showed up on my bud's doorstep.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.120
I actually just showed up inside his living room,

10:53.120 --> 10:55.120
didn't knock or anything, walked right into my bud's place,

10:55.120 --> 10:57.920
and kicked up my feet and wheezed his Wi-Fi juice.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.680
I don't tip at coffee.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.520
Do you really?

11:03.520 --> 11:04.000
Excuse me?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.360
Ooh, Justin.

11:05.360 --> 11:05.760
What?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.280
You're walking a fine fucking line.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.200
Well, you know, I use my credit card for everything.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.600
If there is a blank on a credit card receipt for tip,

11:15.200 --> 11:17.360
I don't care what service you've just performed.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.080
I don't care what you did, amputations, car repair, whatever.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.320
If there's a tip slot, I will put a tip in there.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
I don't think Starbucks isn't doing that yet.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.640
I always feel like at Starbucks or any coffee place,

11:30.640 --> 11:35.680
like the tip jar is like a, it seems like so unorthodox,

11:35.680 --> 11:38.560
like they're sneaking it up until the manager gets back

11:38.560 --> 11:40.000
and then they're going to hide it again.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.840
I don't like that clandestine tipping.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.120
But this is the thing.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.360
This is why if you're at Starbucks, fuck it.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.640
Whatever you want, get yourself a small coffee

11:48.640 --> 11:49.760
and then sit there for eight hours.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.680
Fucking go outside and pick up the trash can

11:51.680 --> 11:52.880
and throw it through the window

11:52.880 --> 11:54.640
and then fucking throw it to the ground.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.000
But I worked in a small coffee shop here in Cincinnati

11:58.000 --> 12:00.320
and there were only about 12 tables.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.560
We'd have someone come and order a coffee

12:02.560 --> 12:04.320
and literally sit there for eight hours.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.920
They'd be there my entire shift.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.200
And then duder like felt completely comfortable

12:09.200 --> 12:11.280
when I walk over and like, hey, can I get you something else?

12:11.280 --> 12:14.240
Giving me the cold shoulder and acting like I was bothering him.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.400
Like that always bothered me.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.680
Like, dude, you realize that like I make my money on tips.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.360
So ground rule, just don't be a cock about it.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.600
Like if you're going to chill at your bud's place

12:25.600 --> 12:26.720
that you don't know very well,

12:27.440 --> 12:29.040
you wouldn't like when he showed up and be like,

12:29.040 --> 12:30.240
hey man, I've got to get to work.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.480
Be like, like, can you move your car?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.240
Oh, fuck.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.320
And also don't fucking sit at the eight-seater by yourself

12:40.320 --> 12:42.480
with your laptop and your single cup of coffee.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.120
Pick the smallest table in the restaurant and sit at it.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.800
Stay out of everyone's way

12:46.800 --> 12:48.960
and don't like kick off your shoes and get real comfortable

12:48.960 --> 12:50.640
because I've seen that and it's awful.

12:50.640 --> 12:55.200
We need to do, we need to release a new like Emily Wall Post

12:55.200 --> 12:57.520
or how to make friends and influence people.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.080
Only it's like, if you are going to be a dick,

13:00.720 --> 13:04.880
like how to just at least minimize the impact on your community.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.720
How to be the least amount of dick

13:06.720 --> 13:09.920
while still acknowledging that you are in fact going to be a dick.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.760
Anytime you go into any place of business,

13:11.760 --> 13:13.440
even when you're giving him your money,

13:13.440 --> 13:14.080
you are inconveniencing him.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.760
You are in an imposition.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.080
Yeah.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.760
Because what you have created,

13:17.760 --> 13:19.760
and this is capitalism really,

13:19.760 --> 13:21.600
is that if you go into a place,

13:23.200 --> 13:26.400
the owner of it is never going to be there ever

13:26.400 --> 13:28.000
because it's 2012.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.720
So what you are doing is basically creating a situation

13:30.720 --> 13:33.760
where you are helping a third party

13:33.760 --> 13:35.760
who is not involved in the transaction.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.680
They're the only one who's happy about the transaction going on.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.920
So you're inconveniencing the person

13:41.920 --> 13:43.760
who you're directly interacting with

13:43.760 --> 13:44.640
because they do not,

13:45.360 --> 13:48.960
I mean, they may in some sort of trickle down sense

13:49.600 --> 13:51.760
benefit from the transaction, but not really.

13:51.760 --> 13:56.640
That chain is far, far too long to see the top link of.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.160
Yeah, you can't get there.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.280
You do not see where the juice is being poured

14:01.280 --> 14:02.880
so that it may trickle down to you.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.200
And this is why the only two things

14:05.200 --> 14:07.680
that show that directly to the person you're dealing with

14:07.680 --> 14:08.960
are tips and commissions.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.720
The best thing you can do-

14:10.720 --> 14:13.200
That's the direct way that you tip a dollar

14:13.200 --> 14:14.480
every time you get a refill.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.600
Just think of it like a bar.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.920
Every time you get a drink, that's a dollar, right?

14:17.920 --> 14:20.400
And so if you get three refills,

14:20.400 --> 14:22.720
the person had to make three trips for you,

14:22.720 --> 14:24.160
that's $3 tip.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.000
I don't care if your coffee only costs $3.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.160
If you throw that person 50 cents on your $3 bill,

14:30.160 --> 14:31.440
you're an asshole.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.600
And hey, if you do a big tip on your first tip,

14:33.600 --> 14:34.400
just split the tip.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.720
Normally, that's a bad idea, but in this case, it's okay.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.840
What if you, can we do like, give them 50?

14:42.400 --> 14:44.560
Like give them a 50 at the top of the month

14:44.560 --> 14:47.120
and then just sort of post on it.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.000
You know, I tell you what,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.280
when I worked in a hotel running room service to people,

14:51.280 --> 14:52.800
I brought this dude like,

14:52.800 --> 14:54.800
I think it was like two glasses of orange juice

14:54.800 --> 14:56.480
in the morning for him and his lady

14:56.480 --> 14:58.800
and dude tipped me like 40 bucks.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.480
Oh, and did you go in and-

15:01.680 --> 15:03.040
I gave him a little love.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.120
And then the rest, but then the rest of the day,

15:05.120 --> 15:07.440
like he called down, I'm like, yeah, what you need?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.480
You got it.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.560
You want all the salt packets we have?

15:10.560 --> 15:11.600
You've got it.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.320
Guys, I just came up with an idea.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.440
You go to this coffee shop a lot, right?

15:17.440 --> 15:19.040
So let's say you're going in there,

15:19.040 --> 15:21.280
you're going in there 20 times a month,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.320
you're getting two drinks every time,

15:24.320 --> 15:25.600
40 drinks a month, right?

15:26.800 --> 15:29.440
Go in there at the top of the next month

15:29.440 --> 15:32.320
and lay a $50 tip on the bar.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.760
Like we're talking with those tips

15:33.760 --> 15:35.760
that they're gonna write into Reader's Digest

15:35.760 --> 15:38.240
and tell about that time they got this enormous tip

15:38.240 --> 15:39.600
when they really needed it.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.040
Like you're gonna seem like

15:41.040 --> 15:44.640
some sort of weird eccentric benefactor, right?

15:44.640 --> 15:47.760
And then make sure everybody in the coffee shop

15:47.760 --> 15:48.880
sees your face.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.920
This is essential.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.120
If you can get them to take a picture with you

15:53.120 --> 15:56.560
or something and then never tip again,

15:57.440 --> 16:00.080
that strategy is gonna pay for itself

16:00.080 --> 16:01.200
in a month and a half.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.680
Is it because in three years

16:03.680 --> 16:05.600
when you're still going to that coffee shop-

16:07.200 --> 16:09.120
They've had eight different turnovers

16:09.120 --> 16:10.160
with like 20 different people.

16:10.160 --> 16:10.880
Don't you know me?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.960
I'm 50 Buck Billy.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.000
You know me.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.240
Hey, don't you know me?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.160
I'm the guy everybody talks about.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.320
Remember, they wrote a Christian song about me.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.680
Like 50 Buck Billy,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.880
you have drank literally 5,000 cups of coffee.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.840
We are at this point talking about a 10 cent tip.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.120
You are a joke.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.960
You are a joke to me.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.240
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.920
Just give me a free coffee.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.360
I can't tip you right now.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.640
I'm sorry.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.080
Was our math good?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.280
Nope, it's one cent tip.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.520
Yeah, Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

16:43.520 --> 16:44.240
That's what I need.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.920
I'm feeling embarrassed for doing a bad math.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.120
Your math was real close.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.720
It was all for one decimal place.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.480
Everybody does a bad math sometimes.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.240
How about this?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.360
Oh, this is Jermaine.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.160
Thanks.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.280
This one was sent in by Jermaine.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.560
This one was sent in by Mitch Reeder.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.120
Thanks, Mitch.

17:03.120 --> 17:03.920
It's by Yahoo!

17:03.920 --> 17:05.680
It's user Tristan who asks,

17:05.680 --> 17:11.760
I get a boner when I drink coffee.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.080
I'm sorry.

17:14.080 --> 17:14.880
One more time.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.040
I get a boner when I drink coffee.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.440
Left the N out of drink and also coffee with one E.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.920
So I am almost 14.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.800
And to help me wake up each morning,

17:26.800 --> 17:32.240
my mother does one half cup coffee plus one half really hot water

17:32.240 --> 17:35.600
plus one packet hot chocolate mix plus whipped cream.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.120
That sounds good.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.760
By the time I sip it down to half a cup,

17:39.760 --> 17:41.120
it is cool enough to guzzle.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.520
So I do while it is actually warm.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.840
The problem is when I guzzle it, I get a boner.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.680
And when I do, I get really horny.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.240
And this morning, I actually got horny.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.280
And then it turned.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.640
Then noticed my hard on.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.600
I am wondering what is causing this.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.120
I will pick a best answer.

17:59.120 --> 17:59.920
I will pick a best answer.

18:02.960 --> 18:03.440
Pardon.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.520
You're 14.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.480
You should be more perplexed that the first half of the coffee

18:08.480 --> 18:09.680
doesn't give you a boner.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.680
Yeah, you know, it's a better question to say.

18:11.680 --> 18:15.440
What kind of hard lifestyle is this kid living that he's having trouble waking up in the morning

18:15.440 --> 18:16.000
at 14?

18:16.560 --> 18:19.200
Oh, mom's got to have my morning.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.960
I had a late night working a graveyard shift.

18:22.960 --> 18:23.440
Who knows?

18:23.440 --> 18:27.520
But I think a better question is why hasn't this woman

18:27.520 --> 18:34.640
been marketed this boner potion that she has alchemically discovered?

18:36.560 --> 18:38.480
This is Jackie's Boner Brew.

18:38.480 --> 18:42.080
It's locally made here in the Wisconsin area.

18:42.080 --> 18:48.640
And actually, a local woman discovered this when she noticed that her 14-year-old son

18:50.320 --> 18:55.520
was sailing at half mast after he drank down the second half.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.280
Gosh, you got to guzzle it.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.240
You got to guzzle it.

18:58.240 --> 18:58.880
That's the trick.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.160
It's the timing things.

19:00.160 --> 19:06.080
If you guzzle the first half and then sip the second, you'll never have a boner again ever.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.800
You know his mom's going to get suspicious when he's like,

19:08.800 --> 19:11.040
yeah, thank you for making this mom.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.880
I'm just going to let the whole cup cool off.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.080
I really am going to just slam this down.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.240
Could I have eight cups of it, please?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.520
And no questions asked.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.280
Man, if guzzling really gives this kid a chub,

19:25.280 --> 19:27.840
he is in for a hard collegiate life.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.000
There's a lot of that man.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.960
Slam that beer.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.080
No, I'd rather not.

19:32.080 --> 19:32.960
I'd rather not.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.880
Come on, let's make a waterfall.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.520
You seriously don't want to watch this?

19:38.320 --> 19:40.160
You wouldn't like me when I was guzzling.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.280
I need a place to hang my coat.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.400
Kyle, do a keg stand.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.680
It's also possible that it is the combination of the caffeine and the sugar

19:51.680 --> 19:55.680
that this kid is consuming that's making his heart just fucking race.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.800
It's just like, oh, boner.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.000
So if you gave this to anyone older than 14, they'd instantly die.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.240
There's a reason for this.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.160
The caffeine opens up your capillaries, right?

20:06.160 --> 20:09.920
And gets the blood flowing and lets it flow downtown.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.240
I think it's the scientifically speaking.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.800
Those are all scientific words you used.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.280
In your downtown area.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.960
Yeah, your dorsal downtown.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.000
Here's the ish.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.680
Do we know if this kid is butt chugging?

20:24.240 --> 20:24.640
Sorry?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.040
Is that not in the additional details?

20:29.040 --> 20:29.600
Let me see.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.040
No, it doesn't say anything about gaping.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.440
Is there any answers to this?

20:37.440 --> 20:39.360
Is there any wisdom that will-

20:39.360 --> 20:40.800
Someone says, you're 13.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.960
Almost anything will give you a boner.

20:42.960 --> 20:43.760
Good point.

20:43.760 --> 20:47.360
If it is continues for a couple of years, then you ask for answers.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.240
As for now, enjoy it while you have it.

20:50.240 --> 20:54.080
That's such a fucking weird thing to say to a teenager.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.080
You've got boners?

20:56.080 --> 20:56.880
Don't miss out.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.280
Solid, solid.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.720
From the ages of 12 to 17.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.360
When I got a boner, it was not a thing to be enjoyed.

21:05.360 --> 21:09.040
It was a thing to like, well, fucking now this is on my plate.

21:09.040 --> 21:09.520
Now.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.240
That's the thing.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.200
In that age range, you never get a boner and go, yeah, finally.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.280
Yeah, I finally get it up.

21:15.280 --> 21:15.840
Like, no.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.560
You pray for the brief moments when you do not have a boner.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.240
Oh, if only, if only I could have a brief respite.

21:22.240 --> 21:22.560
Yeah.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.840
You just pray the teacher doesn't call.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.920
Rigamortis has set in.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.960
Oh, if only God would release me from this curse.

21:31.920 --> 21:36.640
I, I, I, I'm super creeped out by the enjoy it.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.120
Like, what do you mean enjoy it?

21:39.120 --> 21:41.440
Like, how do you want me to enjoy my boner?

21:41.440 --> 21:43.120
Oh, you gotta sketch it.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.360
You gotta go home and sketch that for the last.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.560
It's so beautiful.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.840
I must draw it.

21:47.840 --> 21:52.880
Go get Greg Kinnear from as good as it gets to come by and sketch your boner as you sit

21:52.880 --> 21:53.280
bathside.

21:53.280 --> 22:00.400
Is this fucking guy saying, like, because in 50 years, your dick's gonna be soft like

22:00.400 --> 22:01.760
a bowl full of jelly?

22:01.760 --> 22:02.160
Like, what?

22:02.160 --> 22:02.880
You get out there.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.200
You just have all the sex you can now.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.600
Don't worry about consequences or repercussions.

22:08.400 --> 22:08.960
13.

22:10.560 --> 22:15.200
How loose is Yahoo Answers, like, comment policy that somebody's not like, oh, there's

22:15.200 --> 22:16.480
a, there's a pedophile.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.200
Let's get him.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.040
Better question.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.200
Just jump back real quick to the question itself.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.800
The kid saying that he noticed he had a boner after he was horny.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.960
I would love to be there for that slew thing.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.120
What is this?

22:29.120 --> 22:30.560
What is this feeling?

22:30.560 --> 22:32.960
I am feeling mentally aroused.

22:32.960 --> 22:39.840
Now, if I see just so I'm clear, why did you want to be present inside his head?

22:39.840 --> 22:40.880
I don't want to be there.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.640
I don't want to be there for the event itself.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.920
Travis, I'm going to call the Yahoo Cops on you.

22:45.920 --> 22:52.000
You mean you want to being John Malkovich him so you can see through his eyes as he

22:52.000 --> 22:53.600
is deducing this problem.

22:55.840 --> 22:56.240
Yes.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.800
What would happen if Starbucks started carrying this, this boner brew?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.120
Well, people would stay there for hours and hours and hours.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.120
Listen, the tip situation would definitely be improved.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.800
And I, that was a double entendre.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.120
Just enjoy your boners, everyone, while you still can.

23:14.000 --> 23:14.960
The love of God.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.640
When the rapture comes, all of our boners will be taken away.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.400
That's November 6th.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.920
Enjoy your boners, guys.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.480
That's what carpe diem literally translates to.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.200
Seize your dick.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.920
Gather ye boners while you may.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.240
I'm a recent college grad.

23:30.240 --> 23:35.840
I've been working a robot automation technology company for the past four months.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.000
My boss's boss is a female.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.960
She usually wears business casual clothes.

23:40.960 --> 23:46.400
Today, she wore a skirt and boots and vaguely reassembled a cowgirl.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.960
I wanted to say, you look nice today, or I like your outfit.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.480
I didn't say anything because I don't want to look like a suck up.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.160
And I thought it might come off as creepy.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.160
My desk is close to her office, but we typically don't interact throughout the day.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.720
Usually, we only say hello when passing each other in the hall.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.120
Did I make a good choice by not saying anything?

24:05.120 --> 24:08.720
And should I keep my mouth shut, or is it okay to compliment a woman at work,

24:08.720 --> 24:11.520
whether she is my superior or not?

24:11.520 --> 24:12.480
And that's from Dan.

24:13.440 --> 24:18.640
Well, the Lilly Ledbetter Act stipulates that you are not under any circumstances

24:18.640 --> 24:21.680
allowed to talk to any female ever at work.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.280
I think.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.960
Yes, that is the law.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.640
You can tell one female to pass along to another female that you like her boots.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.760
Well, actually, you have to go through HR.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.280
You have to file a formal compliment request.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.000
You can formally compliment someone in your workplace.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.120
Precisely.

24:41.120 --> 24:45.360
But it has to sit in a folder for six months, and then it can be delivered,

24:45.360 --> 24:48.000
by which point your hair looks great today means nothing.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.040
What the fuck are you talking about?

24:49.040 --> 24:50.000
I'm wearing sandals.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.200
What are you talking about?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.880
I quit this job three months ago.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.840
Now, here's another point that we should consider.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.760
When you said HR, I thought you said a jar.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.440
I thought you said a jar, too.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.920
You put it in the compliment jar.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.640
You float it downstream, and then it buries itself in the mud till the winter thaw.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.560
At the end of the month, someone from the human resources department comes together,

25:12.560 --> 25:16.000
opens up the jar, everyone sits around in a circle, and he reads off nice things.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.600
That actually sounds incredible.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.400
Well, but the trick is you can't put any names on it.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.200
So it's just like someone's hair looked really nice this month.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.600
Yeah, but it would be pretty obvious, you know?

25:25.600 --> 25:29.760
Somebody's mole is clearing up really nicely, and it'd be like, oh, well, that's Janet.

25:29.760 --> 25:36.800
Could you guys, I mean, is that, I really don't know what's okay for men and women anymore.

25:37.920 --> 25:44.880
I don't think, I don't, I would like to think that I like your outfit, or those are some

25:44.880 --> 25:47.120
killer boots, as long as you enunciated.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.840
Well, you're not like, you're not like her friend on Sex and the City or something.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.120
You're not like, ooh, work it.

25:53.120 --> 25:53.760
Yeah, but I mean.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.320
Girlfriend.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.160
But I also like to think that there's certain dates, like, I would never walk in wearing

25:58.160 --> 26:01.120
a new sweater and someone would be like, oh, it's a great sweater, and think, well, that

26:01.120 --> 26:02.400
is sexual harassment.

26:02.400 --> 26:02.880
No.

26:02.880 --> 26:07.040
Yes, but the question is, just put the compliment through this filter.

26:07.040 --> 26:12.640
If it's the same, if you would make the same compliment to a man as you would to your boss,

26:12.640 --> 26:14.240
I don't think the superior thing plays into it.

26:14.240 --> 26:14.800
Oh, it definitely does.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.040
I think it's like, oh, does it?

26:17.040 --> 26:18.240
Okay, well, we'll have to talk about that.

26:18.240 --> 26:22.560
But I think that if it's, if you would feel comfortable giving the same compliment to

26:22.560 --> 26:26.080
a dude, then you're totally, then you're totally fine.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.680
I think compliments are great.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.680
Now, here's the question you risk.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.160
There are two parties involved in this, right?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.960
It's not just intent is only half the battle.

26:34.960 --> 26:41.440
It's also knowing this person well enough to know how your compliment is going to be

26:41.440 --> 26:42.320
absorbed.

26:42.320 --> 26:42.880
That's the thing.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.400
Now, this is a fair point, because there's a good chance that while it may not bother

26:46.400 --> 26:50.560
you or, but like, oh, it's so tricky too, because here's the thing, Dan.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.040
If there is even a moment's hesitation in your brain before you say it, it's not going

26:55.040 --> 26:56.880
to come out smoothly and pleasantly.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.560
No, that's the problem, right?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.480
Hey, booting it up.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.760
Them shoes, they're so good.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.560
I'm going to last you like a heifer.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.760
Hey, cowgirl, ride on them fashions.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.440
What is it like on legs?

27:13.440 --> 27:14.640
I'll just see myself out.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.080
If I could borrow a box to collect my things from my desk.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.560
If you do not know this boss, I would not make the first thing you say to them a compliment,

27:24.560 --> 27:28.320
because if you were on the street and you saw a stranger and you're like, hey, I like

27:28.320 --> 27:28.800
your outfit.

27:28.800 --> 27:29.840
You kind of look like a cowgirl.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.240
The very first thing that's going to run through their mind is like, oh, this person's

27:32.240 --> 27:33.280
trying to stick.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.880
This guy's trying to stick is what it's going to be.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.720
And that is going to create some intensity on my friend.

27:40.720 --> 27:45.120
What if you balance it with like a veiled insult followed by a compliment?

27:45.120 --> 27:47.360
Like, usually you look bad, but today you look great.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.520
You throw down a neg, like a pick up.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.400
Just to balance it out.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.360
And then you leave.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.240
You don't wait for a response.

27:52.240 --> 27:52.960
You leave.

27:52.960 --> 27:57.280
And so she sits there going, I, I don't, I just don't know how I feel.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.600
I need to promote, I need to promote this man.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.000
Okay.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.600
And then you put on a big, silly, you put on a big, silly hat and you maybe shave your,

28:03.600 --> 28:06.480
your beard into like the creepiest facial hair imaginable.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.040
Go on.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.720
Then you, maybe you wear a big pendant.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.360
Maybe you wear some.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.680
And you're, you're the unpredictable guy in the office.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.040
Mystery.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.720
The unpredictable guy, the pick up artist.

28:16.720 --> 28:23.520
I, now Griffin, you think, I, I think that this is, I think we have stumbled on the proper

28:23.520 --> 28:24.080
answer here.

28:24.080 --> 28:28.000
If you have a relationship with someone in any, no matter how casual it may be, if you

28:28.000 --> 28:32.880
have a relationship to where you would feel comfortable saying that, then I think it's

28:32.880 --> 28:33.200
fine.

28:33.200 --> 28:37.840
The fact that you thought, hmm, maybe I shouldn't compliment her and maybe I should write into

28:37.840 --> 28:40.400
that advice show and see what they think.

28:40.400 --> 28:45.360
I think that's your, that's smart Dan telling you that, hey Dan, maybe just get back to

28:45.360 --> 28:45.840
filing.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.480
Maybe get back to programming Skynet.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.640
Across the board, this is a good rule of thumb that like, if you're out in the world and

28:52.640 --> 28:57.360
you want to compliment that cute girl across the way in the shop and you hesitate and your

28:57.360 --> 28:58.560
brain goes, oh, I don't know.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.920
Your brain is as smart, if not smarter than you are at any given point, you should listen

29:03.920 --> 29:06.400
to him or her and not do this thing.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.800
That's a problem with social interaction though.

29:08.800 --> 29:13.920
Like this is the problem that I get into is I think I'd like to pay that person a compliment.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.760
And this is like man, woman, whatever.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.160
I just want to be a pleasant person in society.

29:18.160 --> 29:23.760
I have to like think through every, it's like the ocean's 11 of social interaction.

29:24.400 --> 29:29.440
I have to have like a plan for every, what if he only speaks Spanish?

29:29.440 --> 29:33.040
What if she is drunk right now and I can't tell?

29:33.040 --> 29:34.960
Like I have to have an angle of egress.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.360
So you say like, hey, I really like your boots.

29:37.360 --> 29:41.200
And then they turn around and there's only like a guy in a SWAT outfit standing there.

29:41.200 --> 29:45.200
Like, did you say that like, no ma'am and you walk away and then you go and you stand

29:45.200 --> 29:49.440
outside by the fountain and I have, I stuff a Chinese man in a box.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.720
I sneak him into the back room and let him come out and like, he jumps out of the box,

29:54.720 --> 29:56.000
leapfrogs over her.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.880
She says, what?

29:56.880 --> 29:58.320
And you yell nice boots.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.200
And she turns around.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.080
She's been so distracted by the Chinese man runs away.

30:02.080 --> 30:02.800
Brad Pitt's there.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.840
He's eating a sandwich.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.520
Meanwhile, Casey, I was like, he's driving the getaway truck, but is he?

30:07.520 --> 30:09.280
No, it's one of the robots you built down.

30:09.280 --> 30:09.520
Yep.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.200
The robot explodes.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.120
The woman feels very good about her shoes.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.720
Is that Rob Reiner?

30:14.720 --> 30:15.760
Oh, he's wearing a beard.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.320
It can't be.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.280
It's a fake beard.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.040
Also a fake Rob Reiner.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.720
Also a fake Rob Reiner.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.160
Did you see Ocean's 14?

30:24.160 --> 30:24.320
Yeah.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.680
It fucking sucked.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.240
It was, it was really, really, really bad.

30:28.240 --> 30:28.720
It was 12 minutes long.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.240
It was really more of a short film.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.640
I love those edits though.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.040
Really.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.880
I felt cool while watching it.

30:34.880 --> 30:35.120
Yeah.

30:35.120 --> 30:40.160
I actually don't pay someone a compliment unless I have, I do have to have my angles.

30:40.160 --> 30:46.320
I have to have my angles of exit like on lock before I say anything to someone I don't know.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.240
Sometimes it's the window.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.240
So you gotta make sure you're low to the ground.

30:50.240 --> 30:50.800
Low story.

30:51.520 --> 30:56.800
I was at a hotel at a breakfast buffet a couple of weeks ago and I went to the,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.160
everyone in my room was still asleep.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.400
So I was going to get them to go box.

31:02.400 --> 31:07.200
And I actually asked the woman if they had boxes like that.

31:07.200 --> 31:15.840
Like as I was walking out of the dining hall, like I just wanted to, if she said no,

31:15.840 --> 31:20.800
my trajectory was already like taking me out of the awkward situation.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.600
I was like gone.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.680
I just also want to jump back to how your brain works, Justin,

31:25.680 --> 31:29.440
in that asking for her to go box is an awkward situation.

31:29.440 --> 31:34.000
If you have to go boxes, no, and then you guys just share an awkward pull along.

31:35.760 --> 31:39.360
Like we've known each other for nearly 30 years now.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.800
Do you not know how this works?

31:40.800 --> 31:48.240
If she says they don't have to go boxes, I'm an uncultured simpleton

31:48.240 --> 31:51.040
who doesn't understand the breakfast buffet ways.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.560
Like that's my day.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.280
Suddenly a guy who can't do breakfast buffets, right?

31:55.280 --> 32:00.640
She's going to look at me like a fat guy who needs to like grub out later on some Belgian waffles.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.880
So I need to take a to go box of waffles.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.720
Did I eat enough waffles?

32:04.720 --> 32:06.880
That's like the whole, going to be the whole thing.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.840
I fucked up my exit yesterday.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.880
Oh, Friday I was, I early voted and it was at this huge empty mall.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.480
It was like this mega voting center.

32:17.360 --> 32:22.240
And while I was like in the booth, it was like in a row of other booths.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.960
And as people were finishing up, like submitting their polls

32:24.960 --> 32:28.080
and walking away, this woman was giving them my voted stickers.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.360
And she would say, did you finish voting?

32:29.360 --> 32:30.080
And they'd be like, yeah.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.840
And she'd say, well, congratulations.

32:31.840 --> 32:32.640
Do you feel great?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.920
That's really, you should feel very proud of yourself.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.160
Thank you for coming out and doing your duty.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.840
And then I finished mine and she was, did you finish voting?

32:41.840 --> 32:42.480
And I said, yep.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.360
And she said, here you go.

32:43.360 --> 32:46.320
And she put a sticker on me and I stopped.

32:46.320 --> 32:54.080
I came to a dead stop and like waited for the deluge of praise for doing my civic duty.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.360
And like it didn't come.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.800
And the moment only lasted for maybe a second and a half.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.160
But I felt like such a shithead because it was very, very obvious

33:02.160 --> 33:04.080
that I was waiting for my pat on the head.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.200
And so I just kind of had to like pivot 90 degrees,

33:07.200 --> 33:11.440
which I did sort of like a robot and then walked out of the room, shame face.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.720
I felt like such a piece of shit.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.040
I wanted to get in line and vote again, but they don't let you do that.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.040
Just in the hopes that you might get a compliment on that second pass.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.680
You're really taking this seriously.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.480
I just, it was so hard.

33:25.120 --> 33:29.200
I need, I need positive reinforcement for doing basically anything now.

33:30.800 --> 33:35.040
I hear here's positive reinforcement, financial reinforcement.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.280
That's right.

33:47.280 --> 33:51.200
We're financially reinforcing ourselves talking about sex toys.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.520
It's a sad week here on my brother, my brother and me.

33:54.400 --> 33:59.840
Sad week because this so ends as far as we know for now, at least.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.400
This is the season ender.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.600
This is the season finale of our Extreme Restraints promotion.

34:07.520 --> 34:14.800
I prepared a special, a special game for you guys on this.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.280
The final edition of our Extreme Restraints.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.960
Extreme Restraints.com by the way is an adult superstore.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.240
They have toys.

34:22.240 --> 34:24.640
They have anything you could dream of.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.880
They are essentially, they are the only game in town.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.800
Don't fucking take your business anywhere else.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.840
It's, it's, it's child's play.

34:31.840 --> 34:37.520
Not that children should have access to, you know, electrode butt balls or anything, but.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.020
Right.

34:38.720 --> 34:46.480
So I, for this last, this last edition, I prepared a quick game where I am going to name an item

34:46.480 --> 34:51.440
and you are going to tell me whether or not is it, whether it is by Extreme Restraints.com

34:51.440 --> 34:54.000
or is it a product of my imagination?

34:54.000 --> 34:54.560
Okay.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.200
Are you ready?

34:55.200 --> 34:55.700
Yep.

34:56.480 --> 34:56.980
Okay.

34:57.280 --> 35:01.200
First up, Master Series Extreme Chastity Cage.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.560
That's definitely, I have two of those, so it's definitely real.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.800
Yeah, that's, that's Extreme Restraints.

35:06.800 --> 35:07.520
I know for a fact.

35:10.320 --> 35:13.200
Slappy Master butt paddling thing.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.320
Now, now, now you may have lost it.

35:16.320 --> 35:19.280
It may have come off the rails when you mumbled thing at the end.

35:19.280 --> 35:23.520
I, I just wish that somebody would, some brain trust would get together and finally name

35:24.080 --> 35:26.960
what it is when the, the thing it is that you butt paddle with.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.160
You know, the side paddling thing.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.920
Ah, if only we could figure it out.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.880
I guess we'll never know.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.720
As imagined.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.800
Pussy Crusher Extreme Latch.

35:36.800 --> 35:41.520
That is not a verb that I want ever done to any pussy ever.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.480
How'd it go last night on, on your blind date, Steve?

35:45.040 --> 35:45.680
Crushed it.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.200
We got together.

35:47.200 --> 35:54.400
We went to this really charming vineyard and we crushed up pussy for pussy wine.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.800
Do you remember that one, that one episode of I Love Lucy where she was standing in that

35:58.800 --> 36:00.240
thing, just crushing all those pussies?

36:00.240 --> 36:00.800
We did that.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.360
Yeah, it was like.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.280
We did that, but not with grapes.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.320
With human pussies.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.200
But not with grapes, with human pussies.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.320
So what's your vote?

36:08.320 --> 36:09.120
I think it's real.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.000
I think it's real too.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.360
No, it's fake.

36:11.360 --> 36:11.920
I made it up.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.800
Damn it.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.600
I was wondering how a latch would do crushing, but go on.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.480
The Cockrider Masturbator.

36:20.480 --> 36:20.880
Yeah.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.840
That's gotta be real.

36:21.840 --> 36:22.240
Clearly.

36:23.040 --> 36:23.360
Okay.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.800
Now here's an interesting thing that I, I do want to mention.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.880
They have an electric paddle on here.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.440
It is a, it is a paddle that you spank.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.240
You know, your, your lover, uh, and.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.240
It can also be used for home defense, I assume.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.720
Well, no, this is the thing.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.000
And this is not a joke.

36:43.200 --> 36:48.240
I have this already, but it was marketed to me as an electric fly swatter.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.160
I am 150% sure it is exactly the same thing.

36:54.160 --> 36:58.320
Have you not wondered why after you smack the fly, it has the bitch written out across its face?

36:59.200 --> 37:02.560
And also the fly has also the fly has ejaculated.

37:02.560 --> 37:11.120
Easy access neoprene restraint system.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.160
That's real.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.280
That's totally real.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I'm adding all of these to my Amazon wishlist.

37:16.000 --> 37:16.400
Oh wait.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.920
It's not on Amazon.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.120
Gotta hit up extreme restraints.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.560
Do you guys have extreme restraints prime?

37:22.320 --> 37:25.280
It's like, it's like Amazon prime.

37:25.280 --> 37:29.360
It's like Amazon prime, except instead of doing shipping faster, someone comes to your

37:29.360 --> 37:31.280
house and fucks you with the thing that you bought.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.160
Mm-hmm.

37:32.160 --> 37:34.000
So here's what I want you to do, friends.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I want you to go to extremistraints.com.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.360
I'm going to conduct this little experiment with my brothers right now.

37:40.880 --> 37:45.280
I want you to go to extremistraints.com and I want you to look up the electric paddle.

37:45.280 --> 37:50.160
So boys, I'm sending you a link to the electric paddle in our chat right now.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.720
So I want you to look at this and take it in, okay?

37:52.720 --> 37:53.120
Okay.

37:53.120 --> 37:53.360
Okay.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.240
Okay, you've clicked this link, right?

37:56.240 --> 37:56.560
Uh-huh.

37:57.280 --> 37:57.520
Okay.

37:57.520 --> 38:01.920
So what we're looking at here is a, like a tennis racket, except the handle is long.

38:01.920 --> 38:06.640
It looks like it's probably got a slot for maybe some double A's in there.

38:06.640 --> 38:09.600
And you put that in there and then you press a button and then electricity.

38:10.560 --> 38:15.920
Now I'm sending you a link to the amazing electric bug zapper available on Amazon.

38:15.920 --> 38:19.840
This is precisely, this is precisely the same thing.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.320
It is exactly the same thing.

38:23.920 --> 38:27.440
It is so nice in this world when you can find a multitasker.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.000
You know what I mean?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.200
Thank God, right?

38:29.200 --> 38:33.280
You get the, get the electric paddle, that's going to give somebody a jolt

38:33.280 --> 38:36.400
and also use it as electric fly swatter.

38:36.400 --> 38:36.880
Now I am sending-

38:36.880 --> 38:41.840
Now imagine this, because imagine the humiliation, the last thing going through that fly's head,

38:41.840 --> 38:44.640
when he's like, oh please, oh please tell me that wasn't on someone's ass.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.040
Yeah, but that's what it was.

38:47.040 --> 38:54.400
I am sending you guys now a link to a handheld tortilla warmer.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.600
Okay.

38:57.600 --> 38:57.840
Right?

38:57.840 --> 38:59.040
Yeah.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.240
Pretty much the same exact, we're looking at the same model.

39:02.240 --> 39:07.760
We encourage you and my brother and my brother and me to A, buy all of Extreme Restraints products.

39:07.760 --> 39:13.680
B, don't use the same thing that you use to electro sex your ass to heat up your taco shells.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.200
Please.

39:15.200 --> 39:15.600
Please.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.840
I don't ask for much on this show.

39:18.480 --> 39:22.960
And when you do go to ExtremeRestraints.com use the coupon code MIDDLIST

39:22.960 --> 39:25.680
because you're going to save 20% on that electric foul.

39:25.680 --> 39:29.120
That's going to save you enough money to buy three of these bad boys.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.720
Guys, I know what you've been doing.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.960
You've been waiting for Christmas, holding out.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.480
I don't know the coupon code is going to be good much longer past this week.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.600
I have no reason to believe-

39:37.600 --> 39:39.680
Even after this week, it will still be good for 10%,

39:40.240 --> 39:43.920
but it will never be good for 20% unless we continue to do more spots.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.360
Hey, was it something we said?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.600
Hey, Extreme Restraints.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.680
Hey, Extreme Restraints, can we patch things up?

39:49.680 --> 39:54.080
Like, let us know of all the bullshit because there's been so much of it.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.080
Was what-

39:56.080 --> 39:58.160
Was it when we mocked the sex flash slammy?

39:58.160 --> 40:00.080
We didn't realize it was so close to your hearts.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.040
Do you guys want Yahoo?

40:03.840 --> 40:04.560
Absolutely.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.280
More than I want my next breath, pretty much.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.520
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Caleb Osteen.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.080
Thank you, Caleb.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gail A who asks,

40:13.200 --> 40:17.920
What's a good pet name for an uncle?

40:17.920 --> 40:20.800
What's the role or title in other languages?

40:20.800 --> 40:21.600
Slangs?

40:22.560 --> 40:27.200
Is there a difference whether your uncle is from your dad's side or your mom's side?

40:27.200 --> 40:30.400
Include things like when kinders and kids-

40:30.400 --> 40:36.000
When kinders and kids mess up the pronunciation and it comes out like,

40:36.000 --> 40:36.800
My anki.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.920
Got a fave pet name for your fave uncle?

40:39.920 --> 40:41.440
I hate this so much.

40:41.440 --> 40:46.240
Do you guys know my favorite pet name for one of our uncles?

40:46.240 --> 40:46.800
What's that?

40:46.800 --> 40:47.360
Mark.

40:49.360 --> 40:49.840
Dave.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.480
Dave.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.520
Adult Dave.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.080
Chris.

40:52.080 --> 40:56.640
Like, how do you- that person-

40:56.640 --> 40:58.560
Grown ass man, Mark.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.680
Grown ass Dr. Mark Wahlberg.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.800
Like, why- he's a fucking-

41:04.800 --> 41:05.920
Listen, uncle.

41:05.920 --> 41:11.200
Uncle Felipe, I've been wanting you to be my uncle for a long time.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.480
You and me get closer.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.320
So I came up with a pet name for you.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.760
You're kind of chunky, so I'm going to start calling you my chunkle.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.160
You're my chunkle now.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.640
Have you ever noticed that you have a body odor problem?

41:22.640 --> 41:24.160
From now on, you're my stunkle.

41:24.160 --> 41:24.880
Stunkle's not bad.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.760
You're my funkle.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.720
I used to live with a guy named Jacob Dunkle.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.880
And his- the very name of which apparently makes Travis laugh.

41:32.880 --> 41:33.600
It does.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.800
I love Dunkle.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.800
I saw Dunkle come out of the Argo.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.280
Oh yeah?

41:37.280 --> 41:37.760
Did he like it?

41:37.760 --> 41:38.640
Yesterday I was going to-

41:38.640 --> 41:40.160
What was the Dunkle- how many Dunkle-

41:40.160 --> 41:41.520
How many Dunkle stars did he give it?

41:42.960 --> 41:43.840
He didn't give any.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.880
He did say that you need to respond to his Facebook messages.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.880
Because he said you kind of left him hanging on a few of those.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.480
Oh man, he said it like four months ago.

41:50.480 --> 41:51.360
You need to get back with Dunkle.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.480
Dunkle, I'm sorry if you're listening.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.920
If you're listening and you probably aren't-

41:53.920 --> 41:54.560
He keeps up.

41:54.560 --> 41:55.520
He told me he listens.

41:55.520 --> 41:55.760
Yeah.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.600
So now you have no excuse.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.840
Anyway, he has to like enjoy things and then say that they were a slammed dunkle, right?

42:01.840 --> 42:02.240
Yeah, yeah.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.200
Definitely, definitely.

42:03.200 --> 42:06.720
But he- I can't remember if this actually happened or if we just wanted it to happen.

42:06.720 --> 42:11.920
Like for him to have a sibling that had a child and then he would be Funky Uncle Dunkle

42:11.920 --> 42:15.200
or Funky Unky Dunky or any combination of those three things.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.200
Funky Unky Dunky.

42:23.840 --> 42:24.720
Oh god.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.680
My Uncle Nemo we lovingly call Unk.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.200
He makes it sound like a caveman.

42:33.200 --> 42:33.680
I like that too.

42:33.680 --> 42:35.120
He is a Cro-Magnon.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.400
Hey, did you- So who's bringing what for Thanksgiving?

42:38.400 --> 42:42.640
Well, I'm bringing the Pecan Sandies and is anybody bringing cranberry?

42:42.640 --> 42:44.400
Oh yeah, we assigned that to-

42:48.240 --> 42:50.080
Hey everybody, Unk's here.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.120
Sorry, just stepped on a duck.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.000
Just so I could double check in your fiction,

42:57.600 --> 43:01.360
did someone buy a package from Nabisco Pecan Sandies

43:01.360 --> 43:05.520
and thinks that's a sufficient Thanksgiving offering?

43:05.520 --> 43:06.720
That's how he's set with Asai.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.040
And what's Steve bringing?

43:09.040 --> 43:11.120
He's bringing Pecan Sandies again.

43:11.120 --> 43:14.000
I think if someone's gonna bring Pecan Sandies, it's gonna be Unk

43:14.000 --> 43:17.680
because he does not sound like somebody who is graced with color yet.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.600
He's just gonna pull one out of the back of his van

43:19.600 --> 43:22.800
where he just has stacks and stacks of packages of Pecan Sandies

43:22.800 --> 43:26.240
that he bought when the Piggly Wiggly down the street was going out of business.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.960
Just so I'm clear, is Unk actually Encino Man?

43:28.960 --> 43:32.400
If Unk is toilet- if Unk is toilet trained,

43:32.400 --> 43:35.840
then we are all like one step ahead of the game.

43:35.840 --> 43:40.800
To be fair, Unk is not really related to either my mother or my father.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.600
He's more of a friend of the family, by which I mean a bear.

43:43.600 --> 43:43.920
Okay.

43:47.440 --> 43:50.240
This has been the greatest Thanksgiving of my life,

43:50.240 --> 43:52.960
except for when that bear tore my arm off.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.360
But God, I love my Unk.

43:55.360 --> 43:56.400
You mean Unk?

43:56.400 --> 43:59.200
I'm not gonna talk bad about Unk under my roof.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.160
Unk is the same.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.240
He's the only thing that got me through 9-11.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.440
How old is this bear?

44:07.440 --> 44:08.800
He's an old-ass bear.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.720
Bears only lived at like age seven.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.240
We all know this to be true.

44:12.240 --> 44:13.360
This is Unk Jr.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.800
Excuse me, Unk Jr.

44:14.800 --> 44:15.520
Son of Unk.

44:18.080 --> 44:23.680
His forearms are just as powerful as the original Unk, make no mistake.

44:23.680 --> 44:27.360
His large claws have torn all our tapestries, but we love him very much.

44:27.360 --> 44:30.480
But they've also torn down the emotional walls that was keeping my family apart.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.320
You know, we went three Christmas sets without speaking until Unk showed up.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.560
They say a bear's strength has no limits,

44:38.560 --> 44:42.240
and we finally put that to the test when we used him to rebuild our home,

44:42.240 --> 44:43.520
and by which we mean our love.

44:43.520 --> 44:45.440
He was strong enough to hold his family together.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.640
You lay off Unk.

44:48.640 --> 44:52.880
Every year at Thanksgiving, he brings honey, and we love him for that.

44:52.880 --> 44:56.320
And he always pushes it forward a little shyly, as if to say,

44:56.320 --> 44:59.200
this is all I could do, and goddammit, you've done enough.

44:59.920 --> 45:04.400
He and his son always talk about how they like to wipe their ass with really soft paper.

45:04.400 --> 45:04.960
I hate it.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.680
I hate it.

45:07.680 --> 45:08.320
You know what?

45:08.320 --> 45:11.360
He missed my wedding because he got captured and sent to the zoo,

45:11.360 --> 45:13.040
but I wasn't angry at him.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.160
How could I say angry at him?

45:14.960 --> 45:17.840
I would love, I would straight up love the next time I see him.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.440
I would straight up love the next time we see like our grown ass man,

45:21.440 --> 45:26.560
Uncle Dave, our dad's older brother, to just be like, hello, Unky,

45:27.200 --> 45:29.680
and then just see if I can like just get past it

45:29.680 --> 45:31.840
without it being a thing that he stops me on and goes,

45:31.840 --> 45:33.040
whoa, what the fuck was that?

45:33.840 --> 45:38.480
Oh, you'll be able to tell if Travis ever does that at our house when I'm in the room

45:38.480 --> 45:42.880
because you'll see me throwing myself through a plate glass window and running down the street.

45:42.880 --> 45:46.720
You will turn to talk to Justin, only he will be a Justin shaped cloud of dust.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.640
Got too weird, had to dip.

45:48.640 --> 45:49.040
Please don't.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.200
Just a tiny Asian man here.

45:51.200 --> 45:51.680
Please don't.

45:51.680 --> 45:51.920
What the fuck?

45:56.000 --> 46:00.960
I want to tell you guys, we're talking about talking about awkward conversations

46:01.680 --> 46:04.000
and I wanted to share with you guys my brother,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.520
my brother and me awkward conversation that I had this past week.

46:07.520 --> 46:14.160
I ran into an older lady who is tangentially, I think, familiar with what we do.

46:14.160 --> 46:18.240
She actually said, do you still do your internet radio comedy?

46:18.240 --> 46:22.080
And I said, gathering what she said from those context clues, I said, yes.

46:22.720 --> 46:27.920
That's like calling pizza, like, do you still eat bread cheese sauce?

46:29.360 --> 46:29.840
Yes, I do.

46:29.840 --> 46:30.480
Yes.

46:30.480 --> 46:37.200
And then she told me that a mutual friend is going to be touring with Landau Murphy,

46:37.200 --> 46:41.520
West Virginia native and America's Got Talent winner, Landau Murphy.

46:41.520 --> 46:45.680
And then asked if we should not inquire to see

46:45.680 --> 46:48.800
if maybe we would make a good opening act for Landau Murphy.

46:49.280 --> 46:52.640
She said, does your audience crossover with Landau Murphy?

46:52.640 --> 46:53.600
Almost definitely.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.040
Almost definitely.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.240
I think so definitely.

46:56.240 --> 46:59.200
In fact, we've already been in talks with his people and our people.

46:59.200 --> 47:04.160
The specific blend of uncomfortable I looked when Sidney came over and found me.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.320
Just curled in a ball on the ground crying.

47:06.320 --> 47:10.160
She knew, she said, somebody asked you if you share a demographic with Landau Murphy again.

47:10.160 --> 47:16.480
Do you have some sort of life alert system set up with your wife where like,

47:16.480 --> 47:20.320
if someone comes over and is like, hey, I used to go to church with you,

47:20.320 --> 47:23.360
what kind of comedy do you do that you can press that button

47:23.360 --> 47:25.440
and she would kick in the door like a Secret Service agent?

47:26.480 --> 47:27.360
It's wife alert.

47:27.360 --> 47:32.160
It's help, help I'm awkward and I can't walk away.

47:32.160 --> 47:36.000
I just like collapse into a protoplasmic heap on the ground.

47:36.000 --> 47:36.800
Just push the button.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.560
I have fake seizures before and I'm not above it.

47:41.200 --> 47:45.840
Do you ever wish that you would get like famous enough

47:45.840 --> 47:50.240
that you could just do that kind of thing and get away with it?

47:50.240 --> 47:54.000
Like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, no, that it's fine.

47:54.000 --> 47:54.720
Cannot.

47:54.720 --> 47:55.200
Because you can.

47:55.200 --> 47:55.600
Cannot.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.640
That's how that guy came up with Borat.

48:01.280 --> 48:05.200
Somebody came up to him, he's like, hey, I heard that your comedy show's still

48:05.200 --> 48:07.280
doing pretty good, what do you guys talk about?

48:07.280 --> 48:09.520
Then he's like, very nice, how much?

48:10.240 --> 48:12.160
Borat, goodbye.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.120
Then he walks away.

48:13.760 --> 48:16.880
Kazakhstan, and then he sprints out of there.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.080
I want to actually try that.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.280
You're going to do a Borat impression to try to end a conversation?

48:21.280 --> 48:22.720
Because I can totally see that working.

48:24.880 --> 48:26.800
Yeah, I think that's a time-tested method.

48:27.360 --> 48:29.680
How about another question where we answer it?

48:30.400 --> 48:31.520
That sounds good.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.160
How novel.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.560
I recently joined a dating site and met someone.

48:34.560 --> 48:39.280
We went out for a couple of weeks, but ultimately she decided we'd split and be friends, and I agreed.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.200
Yeah, probably, that's probably the best.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.560
Still fighting it in court.

48:44.560 --> 48:51.200
Yeah, now she seemingly regrets the decision and why I still think being friends is the right choice.

48:51.200 --> 48:55.760
However, I have about two months left on my paid subscription to the dating site,

48:56.960 --> 49:00.480
but I don't want her to think me heartless if I start using it again.

49:00.480 --> 49:04.960
I genuinely like this person and don't want to hurt her feelings.

49:04.960 --> 49:07.840
Should I use the dating site or am I being a jerk?

49:07.840 --> 49:08.800
Yes, you should use it.

49:08.800 --> 49:10.080
I'm from semi-single in Cincinnati.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.080
Yes, you should use the dating site.

49:12.080 --> 49:12.880
Of course you do.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.480
You paid money for it.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.800
And you owe this person nothing.

49:16.800 --> 49:21.200
You met them on a dating site and went on, what, like five or six dates and it didn't pan out.

49:21.200 --> 49:25.840
You weren't married to the person, you didn't get divorced, it didn't pan out.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.480
Yes, you should keep using the dating site.

49:28.480 --> 49:31.840
How is she going to know that you, it's not like if you use a dating site,

49:31.840 --> 49:36.720
it's not like fucking Facebook where it's like, Ralph poked this girl,

49:36.720 --> 49:40.080
but literally in real life poked her with his donger.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.440
Did you hear this, Susan?

49:41.440 --> 49:42.560
Susan, you see this?

49:43.680 --> 49:44.960
He's moved on.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.000
He's moved on.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.160
You have two moved on requests.

49:50.160 --> 49:53.280
You know what, in fact, that might just be a really awesome website.

49:53.280 --> 49:56.320
If it was like, hey, tough love, we're going to help you get over this person,

49:56.320 --> 49:59.520
you're still pining over by updating every time they get in.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.280
Well, that is actually Facebook.

50:01.280 --> 50:05.040
Facebook actually, what's great about Facebook is when you, you know,

50:05.040 --> 50:10.080
when you date someone, you are an active participant in their social media landscape.

50:11.120 --> 50:14.480
And even after you break up with them, Facebook doesn't,

50:14.480 --> 50:17.600
Facebook's like, but I thought you guys were forever.

50:17.600 --> 50:21.120
And Facebook will like show you like, you know, your ex-

50:21.120 --> 50:23.200
Wait, who's this new girl he's with?

50:23.200 --> 50:24.880
Your ex checked in.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.280
Your ex checked in at Uno's Pizzeria.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.320
Like, great, great.

50:28.320 --> 50:28.960
Thank you.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.960
I'm glad she's, can you let me know?

50:30.960 --> 50:33.520
Like, give me some sort of pizza review from my ex?

50:33.520 --> 50:34.800
Cause that would be fantastic too.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.760
She ate a whole pizza by herself.

50:37.760 --> 50:38.880
You made the right call.

50:40.160 --> 50:40.720
Yeah.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.200
She's kind of freaking us out right now.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.800
She's been to Uno's three times a day for the last week.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.160
She's the mayor of Uno's.

50:49.840 --> 50:50.400
Thanks, Facebook.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.920
That's not a four square distinction.

50:51.920 --> 50:52.640
They had a vote.

50:52.640 --> 50:55.120
She was democratically elected the mayor of Uno's.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.680
She's the deciding vote for the Uno City Council.

51:00.160 --> 51:00.640
Yeah.

51:00.640 --> 51:05.760
You just, it's so, those dating sites like thrive on anonymity.

51:05.760 --> 51:09.280
You could fuck everyone, everyone on the dating site,

51:09.280 --> 51:11.440
dudes and ladies all together.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.720
And none of them would know about any of the other people.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.680
Congrats.

51:15.680 --> 51:18.560
It's basically just a big, it's basically eyes wide.

51:18.560 --> 51:19.600
Shut up that bitch.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.600
Like you, you know,

51:21.600 --> 51:27.840
I mean, okay, translate it, translate it to like a much bigger like question.

51:27.840 --> 51:31.360
This is like saying I dated a girl in a town that I lived in.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.640
It didn't work out.

51:32.640 --> 51:34.800
Now I can't ever date in that town again.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.480
Cause I'm afraid she'll find out and think I'm heartless.

51:36.480 --> 51:41.360
She could ostensibly cause she could meet somebody else in the town on like match.com.

51:41.360 --> 51:45.280
It's a fucking, it's a, it's a masquerade fuck fiesta.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.960
No one's ever going to know.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.240
No one is, that's their tagline.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.560
That's actually, that's their tagline, masquerade fuck fiesta.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.240
Masquerade fuck fiesta.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.280
No one has to know.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.480
No one will know.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.880
Get your dick wet and wet and wet and wet.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.520
Quietly, quietly wet.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.720
It's like you're some sort of ninja fuck assassin.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.480
Nobody is ever going to hear you.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.760
You are like the wind.

52:05.760 --> 52:08.240
You will come in, fuck and be a ghost.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.440
Fuck like the wind.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.680
Fuck like a ghost here at match.com.

52:11.680 --> 52:16.160
I met my wife on match.com, but before that I ghost fucked 38 women.

52:16.960 --> 52:20.000
I ghost fucked 38 women in the same month I met my wife.

52:20.000 --> 52:20.800
I'm so happy.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.480
Good luck getting that on a business card.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.080
That's a hell of a tagline.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.360
I don't think they could fit all of it.

52:29.920 --> 52:30.720
The words you said.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.560
It's all abbreviated.

52:34.080 --> 52:35.120
It's an acronym.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.080
It's the best job I ever had.

52:43.920 --> 52:46.560
Just love bringing people together and then hiding one of the people.

52:46.560 --> 52:51.760
It's like the underground railroad of hookups.

52:52.560 --> 52:56.320
You're helping people out of relationships secretly under the cover of night

52:56.320 --> 53:00.160
and bringing them to a safe relationship where they can be free.

53:00.160 --> 53:03.920
Welcome to our wildlife preserve where we keep people that just got out of a relationship

53:03.920 --> 53:06.320
till they are strong enough to provide for themselves.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.160
Please no pictures.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.880
They all fuck, but you don't need to know about it and they don't need to know about it.

53:13.760 --> 53:16.400
When you're on an online dating site, you're fucking people.

53:16.400 --> 53:17.760
And even you don't know about it.

53:18.880 --> 53:19.440
Calm down.

53:19.440 --> 53:20.080
Get off it.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.600
Get off the smut, everyone.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.320
Hey, everybody.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.120
Can we get off the smut?

53:23.120 --> 53:26.720
If you're going to use a dating site, use OKCupid because it's free

53:26.720 --> 53:28.560
and that brings all the nasties out.

53:31.280 --> 53:32.880
You guys know about that weird divide, right?

53:34.080 --> 53:36.000
A match you have to pay for.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.680
And so people there are like, I'm looking for someone who can be my significant other.

53:41.680 --> 53:47.760
And then OKCupid is like, I want someone that will let me poop on them and possibly.

53:47.760 --> 53:52.320
I think that that has always been implicit to me in the name.

53:53.040 --> 53:56.400
OKCupid's like, all right, OK.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.760
I want to poop on these sunglasses and then have you put them on.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.400
OKCupid, whatever you say.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.160
Let's see what's up, I guess.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.920
Match.com is like, hey, let's use science to make sure that you find your soulmate.

54:07.920 --> 54:10.160
OKCupid is like, hey, you like scat?

54:10.160 --> 54:12.880
Hey, I'm not talking about fast talking like Jason Mraz.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.320
Although Jason Mraz is into it.

54:14.320 --> 54:15.200
Here's his profile.

54:16.880 --> 54:18.720
Have you dreamed about pooping on Jason Mraz?

54:18.720 --> 54:20.480
You won't see that shit on match.com.

54:21.600 --> 54:26.560
You will literally see that shit thanks to our special shit spectrum.

54:26.560 --> 54:30.640
You're going to see you're 99% friend, but 2% shit buds.

54:30.640 --> 54:32.720
That's 101% friends.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.880
You say you always want to date Billy Zane.

54:34.880 --> 54:37.840
He's not on here, but we have a bald guy that will leer at you.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.080
He calls himself the Phantom.

54:40.080 --> 54:40.560
How's that?

54:41.360 --> 54:42.320
How's that work?

54:42.320 --> 54:43.760
OKCupid, you're the boss.

54:46.480 --> 54:49.200
Thank you for listening to our comedy podcast, my brother and my brother and me.

54:49.200 --> 54:51.760
We hope you've enjoyed yourself and enjoyed your time here.

54:51.760 --> 54:52.640
That's our main goal.

54:54.240 --> 54:59.120
Thank you to the people tweeting about the show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

54:59.120 --> 55:09.440
Merch, not Paris Simonius, Josh Moore, Iggy K, Michael J. Foyce, Rawby Juan, Tiberius Silver,

55:09.440 --> 55:17.200
BC Evans, DCBY11, OldKinderhook, Krista Whalen, LadyLindas.

55:17.200 --> 55:20.720
Of course, everybody who tweets about us, we really, really appreciate it.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.040
Thank you.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.240
If you want to tweet out our sampler, it's bit.ly forward slash itsmabimbam.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.560
And that takes you to our YouTube.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.280
You can find a lot of other clips there, MBMBAM minis.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.440
Two calls to action.

55:33.440 --> 55:38.080
One, if you have a special personal message you want right on the show or a commercial message,

55:38.080 --> 55:43.920
you can scratch those itches at maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.720
You want a birthday shout out for like-

55:46.720 --> 55:49.760
Birthday shout out, romance shout out, biz shout out.

55:49.760 --> 55:51.440
That is the place that you go to do it.

55:51.440 --> 55:57.040
Other thing, our email is MBMBAM at maximumfun.org.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.680
Send in your questions.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.680
Also send in your Yahoo answers that you find.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.440
There was hardly any this week.

56:04.080 --> 56:07.920
And I understand that there was some power outages in certain parts of the country.

56:07.920 --> 56:09.600
But really, that's no excuse.

56:09.600 --> 56:14.800
Speaking of which, we here at My Brother, My Brother and Me would ask that you take a moment,

56:14.800 --> 56:16.800
take a few seconds, go to redcross.org.

56:16.800 --> 56:22.160
Maybe give to some of those people that are still without, still struggling,

56:22.160 --> 56:25.120
still need a food, water, shelter, what have you.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.640
Go and make a difference.

56:26.640 --> 56:28.080
And if someone could confirm for me,

56:28.080 --> 56:33.920
I saw pictures yesterday of fire-powered cell phone chargers being used in New York.

56:33.920 --> 56:36.560
If someone could confirm for me whether or not those are real.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.760
That's neat.

56:37.760 --> 56:40.000
I want it to be real so very badly.

56:40.560 --> 56:42.720
Do you guys think you would thrive in that sort of environment?

56:43.680 --> 56:44.560
Yeah, yeah, totally.

56:44.560 --> 56:49.040
I think that it would be far too easy for me to go full native.

56:49.040 --> 56:51.360
I think you would go full blown like,

56:51.360 --> 56:53.520
Travis, did you make leather armor?

56:53.520 --> 56:54.800
Yep, I did.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.280
Sometimes we goof on Travis.

56:57.280 --> 57:01.520
Sometimes there is literally no human being I would more want

57:02.480 --> 57:06.160
going out and foraging and protecting my village than Travis.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.840
Travis would flourish in that environment.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.840
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use Our Theme song.

57:11.840 --> 57:14.960
You want to do that again, but I won't mumble so much.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.200
Yeah.

57:15.200 --> 57:18.720
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use Our Theme song,

57:18.720 --> 57:22.720
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed, which now bookends the show.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.120
You know what?

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
There's a lot of logic behind that.

57:28.320 --> 57:31.520
It volts up nicely, but it also descends nicely.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.320
You know what I mean?

57:32.320 --> 57:34.880
And it's like, I don't want to bring the show to a dead stop.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.040
I want there to be some descending action.

57:37.040 --> 57:39.200
And that is exactly what the song brings.

57:39.200 --> 57:42.720
So thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters, very much.

57:42.720 --> 57:46.320
I also want to shout out, check out on Twitter, Make Sharp Stuff.

57:47.520 --> 57:52.000
We retweeted the link, but they are putting out a book and they asked us to contribute on it.

57:52.720 --> 57:56.160
So if you want to check out a little excerpt of the thing we wrote, it's on there.

57:56.160 --> 57:58.800
It's called On the Mayan Apocalypse and Endless Shrimp.

58:00.400 --> 58:05.280
Also, in all seriousness, you guys, on the 6th, get out and vote.

58:05.280 --> 58:06.960
If you're registered, get out there.

58:06.960 --> 58:07.200
Do it.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.440
Seriously, for Obama, for real, though.

58:09.440 --> 58:11.840
Yeah, preferably for Obama.

58:11.840 --> 58:15.200
Definitely, definitely want to send me out a B-Day prez.

58:15.760 --> 58:19.120
That's just P.O. Box, 5400-2576.

58:19.120 --> 58:20.080
I mean, just get that out there.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.320
By which it means a birthday president.

58:22.320 --> 58:25.360
Yeah, and do send it on the 6th, because if it gets here before,

58:25.360 --> 58:27.520
again, we'll throw it in the trash.

58:27.520 --> 58:29.280
Definitely needs to arrive on the 8th.

58:29.280 --> 58:32.400
I was just kidding about if you want to vote for Rami, I guess that's okay.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.960
Just don't tell us about it.

58:34.960 --> 58:35.520
Yeah.

58:35.520 --> 58:38.000
And hey, if you're a Max Fund donor,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.600
you can vote for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for all I care.

58:42.240 --> 58:44.160
I can't pronounce the gentleman's name, but, you know.

58:44.160 --> 58:44.880
Was that scat?

58:46.640 --> 58:47.760
I'm a scat, man.

58:47.760 --> 58:49.360
You can vote for Jason Mraz if you want.

58:49.360 --> 58:55.280
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

58:55.280 --> 58:57.040
Hey, everybody, come on and listen in close.

58:57.040 --> 58:58.960
It's listen to me, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

58:59.680 --> 59:00.880
Scatman time.

59:00.880 --> 59:04.560
It gets funnier every time you do this.

59:04.560 --> 59:12.240
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

59:12.240 --> 59:14.880
You know, I fucking stayed at the same hotel.

59:16.480 --> 59:20.960
Last time I was in New York, I stayed at the same hotel as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

59:20.960 --> 59:21.760
It's true.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.760
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

59:23.760 --> 59:29.920
I was at the Warwick, and that's where Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stayed.

59:29.920 --> 59:31.200
I'm sorry about his name.

59:31.200 --> 59:31.680
I feel bad every time.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.040
It's not coming from a place of racism.

59:33.040 --> 59:37.120
It's coming from the fact that Justin doesn't know how many fucking syllables are in this dude's name.

59:37.120 --> 59:41.360
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

59:41.360 --> 59:43.040
I'm so certain there are no Bs.

59:43.040 --> 59:46.320
But he keeps sneaking in different syllables every time.

59:46.320 --> 59:47.200
That's my favorite.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.600
Did you guys know that Scatman died of throat cancer?

59:51.840 --> 59:53.680
Hey, let's bring it down for a minute, you guys.

59:53.680 --> 59:58.800
What crueller fate could there be than to take his own instrument, you know, to claim him?

59:58.800 --> 59:59.760
His final words were,

59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.800
I see Jesus.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:10.560
Travis, did you know that Scatman John used scatting to, oh, and like mouse scat.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.280
Did you know that he used it to overcome a stutter?

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.760
That's amazing, Justin.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.360
Are you, do you have like a Scat Facts website pulled up?

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.520
No, like I know that about him.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:23.840
Okay.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.200
I know that about Scatman.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.640
Now, when you are Scatman John, does that mean that there are different Scatmen,

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.560
and you get the title and it's like an honorary thing?

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.520
It's like Doctor Who.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.960
Yeah, it's basically, I'm the Dread Pirate Scatman John.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.280
When Scatman dies, he regenerates into a new Scatman played by a new actor.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.360
Okay, listen, we were trying to end the show.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.880
We've given people enough funny.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.800
They have their fill.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.960
This final Yahoo was sent in by Michael Allen.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.760
Thank you, Michael.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ali Suleiman, who asks,

01:00:51.280 --> 01:01:00.000
Can you send me some free Yu-Gi-Oh cards?
