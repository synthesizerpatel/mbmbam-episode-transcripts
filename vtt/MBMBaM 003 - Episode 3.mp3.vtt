If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free. Take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown, honey, I'm still free.

00:26.000 --> 00:44.000
Welcome, welcome back to my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm joined. I should not be so presumptive. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And we are my brother, my brother and me.

00:47.000 --> 01:03.000
So let's just get right into the advice. Let's tuck in here. We've got an anonymous question from FormSpring. I'm in love with my long distance girlfriend and I want to marry her. Should I quit my job and move to Oregon to be with her?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Nope.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Nope.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Next question.

01:06.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, that's an easy one, man. That's gonna put a lot of pressure on her, on your relationship, and I don't think you're gonna... I don't think... unless...

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
You're moving to Portland, Oregon.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, then it's alright.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Is that alright?

01:21.000 --> 01:32.000
That's a fly city, man. I was watching an episode of No Reservations with my boy Tony, and man, they cook some weird shit up in Portland.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Is she a weird shit cook?

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Can you get a job as a weird shit cook?

01:37.000 --> 01:51.000
She might be... there's a whole, like, coven of tattooed gastronomes up there who get, like, their favorite cooking instrument tattooed on their body, and then they eat, like, dog eyes and shit. Like, I don't know what they're doing up there in Portland. It's crazy.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh yeah, aren't they the people, like, meet at each other's house and...

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, they have, like, these secret... it's like Fight Club, but with cooking and eating dangerous things. I love it.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
That's pretty sweet.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't think they're any...

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
It sounds like going to Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

02:03.000 --> 02:17.000
It is kind of like going to Hillbilly. I don't think there are any other cities in Oregon, though. I think Oregon, in my mind, is just, like, a vast wasteland with one pretty cool city in the middle of it. So, I mean, I would like to live in Portland.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I think if you have the opportunity to move there, you should do it, especially if you love this girl. So, you know what? Flip my answer.

02:23.000 --> 02:39.000
Here's my question for the anonymous person asking this question. A, would you move there if she wasn't there? Are you interested in going to the city otherwise? And also, were you guys in the same area prior to this, and she moved?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Right.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Did you meet on MySpace, is basically...

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yes.

02:43.000 --> 02:59.000
If you have been together in the same area before, that's cool. And who am I to say, if you think you've got a real shot with this girl, like, this is really the way it's going to shake out for you, you know, that's the most important thing you can find in the world.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
So, I say, I mean, you need to try to pursue it, but you've got to make sure you have your situation together before you go, or else it is just going to put too much pressure on you guys.

03:08.000 --> 03:19.000
And I really super recommend, don't, like, move there saying, baby, I'm going to marry you. Move there, hang out for a while in the same location, seeing how that dynamic goes.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
That's how hard it is to get broke.

03:22.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, and I would try to, if you can, I would try to get your out of the Pacific, that's how they do it. I would try to get your own apartment too, and not skip straight to moving in with her, I would say.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
We need more info. I can't tell you...

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
More info, dude, more info.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I can't tell you how to roll in your ship, but...

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I'll say this, if you want to, do it.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Just do it. You know better than us.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
This one comes from Dylan via Gmail.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
It says, so a few friends and I will soon be knee-deep in the excitement and thrills of post-adolescence cohabitation.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
This will be our first time living with people we aren't related to outside of an on-campus housing arrangement.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
While we all have some pretty awesome social anxiety, we seem to be able to tolerate each other.

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
I'm slightly worried, however, because one of them is a female. How should I prepare for this? Are there ground rules I should be aware of? Any advice would be much appreciated.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Dylan, I gotta say, man, for my money, you gotta go naked day one.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
You gotta go...

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Just really get it all out there.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
Just really, you gotta get it out. Out. Get it out. Out there. Naked day one.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Naked day one. Everything I know about...

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But then full suit of armor day two.

04:31.000 --> 04:41.000
Everything I know about living, cohabitating, as you put it, with a lady friend, I learned from two guys, a girl and a pizza place.

04:41.000 --> 04:52.000
So it sounds like you should be prepared to... that you and all of your male roommates will probably fall in love with your female roommate at some point or another.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
But she'll eventually just end up with Nathan Fillion, so you should be... it shouldn't be any big of an itch.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Which all women do.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Here's my advice. One word. Boundaries. There has to be set boundaries.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Literal boundaries.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
A firewall. A literal firewall.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
A chest high wall of fire.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
Dividing the apartment so she can put all of her pink shit, her I love Lucy collectibles, on one side and encroach on the other.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Her Wizard of Oz, Chotskies.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Grain of truth.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Who's up next?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Griffin, peeling off of the topic.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
Ramtrap. This is a cohabitation issue that you yourself Dylan may soon be dealing with.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
You too, anonymous guy moving to Oregon.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Ramtrap says my girlfriend of over a year gets angry about having Maxim magazines in the bathroom.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
Sure, it's great to look at side boobs while you're pooping, but I think they're just well written, clever articles.

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
Maxim is the McElroy brothers of magazines, except better looking and less offensive, at least in my view.

05:59.000 --> 06:07.000
Is she wrong to be a dickhead when it comes to my magazines, or should I remain faithful to my promise to take the magazines only to work Ramtrap?

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
It's wrong for you to be a dickhead and call us ugly, which is basically what you just did.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
To be fair, his taste is turned off because he thinks that Maxim has clever, well written articles.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, and where offensive, and where the offensive was.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
No, but good question.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Top 20 best topless nude scenes with ladies in them.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
This is a Maxim meet your own poop.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Why don't you put them, here's my suggestion.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm unnecessarily shortening words today.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
My suggestion is to put the magazines under the sink.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Done.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Don't put them on the back of the toilet, that's a very convenient place for readables to go, but it doesn't look nice.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
And also, Maxim, I'll read a Maxim.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm not above it, but it doesn't make you look like a classy dude.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
So maybe hide your Maxims underneath the sink.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Buy some GQs. GQs are classy.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Don't come in here with this veneer that you're reading it for the articles.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
No, please.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Come on, man.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Best places to do it, in a public bathroom.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That's not...

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
You want good quality articles without side boobs that you and your lady friend can both get behind?

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Get a Reader's Digest subscription.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And here's the thing, as far as her...

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
She's not saying don't have them, she just doesn't want to look at them.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And that's completely fair, I think.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Because pooping is an intimate thing.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
That's her time.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
And she doesn't want you ogling Miranda Kerr while you're dropping a deuce.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
No, that's not her problem.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
That's not her problem.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Her problem is that she has to ogle Miranda Kerr while she is...

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Well, ladies don't poop, but while she's in the restroom, powdering.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Well, she's...

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't know what they do in there.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I think they powder stuff.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Powdering.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Cheesecake Jones, his wife tells, via Twitter...

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
His wife tells him that you can wear blue shirts with blue jeans, but it doesn't feel right.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Help me, brothers. I'm going to defer to Travis on this one.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I assume when you say blue shirts, you work at Best Buy.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
But if you don't, I'm going to go with that's fine.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
The only time I have a problem with pants-shirt combination is when the colors are the same.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
So khaki pants with tan shirts, but if it's the same color blue...

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
If it's the same color blue, which would be weird, why are you wearing a denim shirt with denim pants?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
That's not okay.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
That's a whole lot of luck.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Yeah. That's a whole different choice altogether, my friend.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that from Billy Ray Cyrus?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Who got that last question?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh, what's up?

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
My wife says it's okay to wear blue jeans with a blue jean vest and a blue jean hat.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
And a rat tail.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And a rat tail. Is that...

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And also I'm John Cougar Mellencamp.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I am John Cougar Mellencamp.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
This one comes from Google Answers user Danny.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
Headline, is masturbation create problem?

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
The question is, is masturbation create problem in future life, in married life?

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Is the semen is make daily what we eat or not because after masturbation feel very weakness?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
And is it create problem should I do or not in future?

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
Is it also decrease sex power?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Oh, goodness.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
I'm going to move beyond the grammar issues because he's clearly not a native English speaker

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
and address some of his very real concerns about his renunciation of sex power.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
He might be a natural born American English speaker,

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
but he's just masturbated so much that he's lost a couple verbs and nouns.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
He's saying he's masturbated himself stupid.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Yeah, he beat himself silly.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Maybe that should be the concern.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm masturbating my brain stem out, y'all.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
This is the guy that just wrote us about Maximal.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It's like a before and after.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah, exactly.

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, answer number one is from user Otterly Evil who says excessiveness will make you infertile parentheses flaccid in future.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So I guess it is.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
That's not true.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
That's not true at all.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
Your body's constantly that's like saying that blowing your nose will cure congestion for the rest of your life.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
That's no, that's not the way it works.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Human beings are just seed factories.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
So, I mean, you're in the clear, man.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
The only thing you actually have to worry about is sensitivity.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And also-

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
If you're going nine, ten times a day, dude.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Your decreased sex power because you can't, that is a-

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
That's a real thing.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
That's a thing that you can run out of.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
If you're masturbating regularly, hold off five days, you can power an entire town off of your one penis.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Just with your sex power?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah, just with your sex power.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
That's the new green movement.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
You keep the whole town lit up.

11:12.000 --> 11:22.000
Do you know what I found out is a thing in sperm count is if you use your laptop a lot because the heat from it can kill your voice.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Really?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Can cook them up.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Not on the permanent.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
You would think that it would be like a nice soothing sauna for them, but no, it's an oven.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, it's a bad scene for them.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
Speaking of sex power, you know, I was reading my Cosmo, like I do, it's what I do, and I found some great advice for the ladies.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
A little something the ladies might like.

11:43.000 --> 11:53.000
It's from an article called 30 Things to Do with a Naked Man, and this suggestion is find his G-spot.

11:53.000 --> 12:04.000
The hint is a guy's prostate, the walnut-sized gland under his bladder, is the ultimate magic button to push if you want to blow his mind in bed.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Ultimate magic button.

12:05.000 --> 12:13.000
To tantalize it, partway through oral sex or intercourse, rest two fingers against the swath of skin between his testicles and anus.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You stay the fuck away from my walnut.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Do you mean taint?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
You mean his taint.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
You mean his taint, right?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
It's an efficiency of language issue at this point. You mean his taint.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Excuse me, Cosmo. Please don't tell anyone to do that.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
Cosmo, my walnut is a temple, and I don't want, it doesn't need any insurrectionists. Nuh-uh.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
What's your walnut, how's everybody's walnut situation today?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It's feeling good.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
The walnut's fine.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
Do you guys remember when I went to Bonnaroo and I didn't shower for five days and I got walnutitis?

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
Here's my question. What actual situation would that be okay in? Like, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

12:55.000 --> 13:03.000
When I went to see a walnutologist about my walnutitis and he checked my walnut, like, still questionable.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
You know what's weird about that story? Griffin went five days without a shower, still shampooed every day.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
It was nice.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
I had lots of Aquafina, which I could, you know, wrap my shit up with.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Hey, wait a minute. Don't touch my walnut.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Stay away from the walnut. Don't listen to Cosmo.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Let's do another one from Yahoo. This one's from Yahoo Answers User.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Wait, wait, wait. Quick timeout before we go to Yahoo.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
If you're, like, sitting down, popping up in Gmail about to tell us that we need to be more free about our walnuts and maybe we should try it, stop it.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Gross. I don't want to hear anything about it.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
What you do with your walnut is your business, friend.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, that's your walnut, not my situation.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
I would never do that, but if you want to, I mean, if you want to tell me about it, whatever.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Just keep your hands off my walnut.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I'll give you guys my personal email. We'll make some shit happen.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
This one comes from Yahoo Answers User Donald.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
It is possibly the saddest thing I've ever seen on the internet.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm in love.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
That was his. That was his emphasis, not mine.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm in love with Krista from FernGully.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Are there any websites devoted to her?

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, God.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I mean, we've all been there.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
She's a good looking fairy.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Cartoon fairy.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Now, if he had said baddie, I would have understood that.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I get that.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
You know, the problem with Krista from FernGully, if you're in love with her,

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
is that no adult woman is going to satisfy that fantasy for you.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I mean, they're just too old, right?

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
They're just too beaten down.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They're too big.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
They don't have the naivete of a Krista from FernGully.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
And that's the problem.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
You're just not going to find an adult woman to fill that need for you.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
If you know what I mean.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
It's tragic, really.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Listen, we help everybody on this show.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
And that means sicko child molester perverts.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
We do not discriminate.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
We will help sick pedophiles and not help them to get better,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
but help them to just keep it quiet.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Have you considered taking up a parent?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Oh, goodness.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, golly.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Oh, my goodness, my golly.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
Hey, to clarify, I don't support pedophiles.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
No.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
You just help one bitch.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
But to clarify, guys, if you are a pedophile, stay away from the walnut.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I don't care what age you are.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
It's not going to be a cool scene.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
This one comes to us from our good friend Mitch Dyer via Gmail.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
He says, my friend needs to leave his dead-end, low-paying job

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and get out of his lame living situation.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
He likes the idea of university in my city and would excel in it,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
but he refuses to leave home for another city because, quote,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
all of his family is here.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
He is 22.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
How do I convince him to sack up, move out, and get his education on?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Well, that's a tough one, Mitch.

16:14.000 --> 16:23.000
Well, Mitch, I would say that there is, I mean, okay.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You only get one shot.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You only get one spin around the globe.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
And I definitely could see where he would value going to the university,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
as your people say, in the great white north.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
But I don't know.

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
There's a value to having people surrounding you who care about you.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
I mean, there's a worth to that.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
And I think you have to accept that worth before you can, you know,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
you can't blow that off.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
You can't convince him to do anything if you aren't also accepting

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
that there's value to that.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
And I'll say this.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
As someone who is in a similar circumstance,

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I graduated college and moved home and didn't know what I was going to do.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
If I had moved earlier than I was ready to,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
it wouldn't have been a good situation for me.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Like, I wasn't sure what I was going to do.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
It took me three years to decide what I was going to do.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
But once I decided, I was ready to go and I got to move on.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
So, you know, maybe he's just not ready to do it yet.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
On the other hand, it also helped that I had people in my life,

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
like Justin and Griffin and our father, who encouraged me to find what I wanted to do

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
and encouraged me to make decisions and move on with my life

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
and not just sit around at home.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
So don't let your friend wallow and hang out and do nothing in his dead-end job,

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
but at the same time pushing him, you know, just help him get ready.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
But you also say he needs to leave.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
And that's an interesting word to me because you're not saying he wants to leave.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You're saying he needs to leave.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
And that sounds like your judgment, Mitch.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
No, no, no. I think some people can legitimately get the blinders on

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
where they can stay and just, you know, be stagnant in a town

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
because they're so familiar with it.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Like, just because all your family and friends are there,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
just because you move out, they don't all die, you know?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
They do all die.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
I agree, but here's the problem with that, Griffin, is I agree,

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
but everyone's definition of success is different.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
So while some people might go, man, you've got to get out and explore the world

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
and try new things every day, his friend might be completely happy

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
staying in this town and working a job and just being employed and having a family.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
So what you should do is you should take that friend out for a night on the town, okay?

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And at the beginning of the night, hang out with all of his friends and his family

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
like for a big family dinner at the Olive Garden.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
And you have soup, salad and breadsticks for hours, and you just have a great time.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
And then at the end of the night, you take him to a local subway

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
and you show him the 55-year-old sandwich technician that's working there

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
and you say, you want this to be you, it's okay if you do, that's your choice,

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
but if you stay in this town, you're going to be a lonely 55-year-old sandwich technician.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I think it's sandwich artist. It's more art than technical.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Sandwich engineer at a subway.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Also, Mitch, here's a key point for you, buddy, because we care about you

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
because you're the one riding in.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
If you convince a friend to move out to the city you live in,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
you're opening yourself up to a lot of pressure.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Yeah, that's all on you to be BFF.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
That's all on you to be his BFF for life.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
And if you're cool with that, fine, but for life, Mitch.

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
Not just his BFF, but you are replacing his city ambassador.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
When SD Zow from Twitter goes to the movies,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
how the hell is he supposed to know which armrest is his?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
There's only one each side.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Am I lost? Guys, what's the deal?

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
I have a great trick that I do, and I'm happy to share this with people.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
As soon as you get to the movie theater, first thing you do, hit that concession stand,

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
buy a soda, and then as soon as you sit down, put that soda in one of the armrests.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
And then if the person next to you has umbrage with that,

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
you just meet their eyes and you just keep your hand on your soda

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
with your arm on the armrest, and it's yours.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
I actually have a move that I do where if I sit down and the armrests are already taken,

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
I just wedge my elbows in behind their elbows and smile at them a lot.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
And then they slowly move their elbows away from mine, and then both armrests are mine.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
If it's one of the things where the armrests can deploy or be hidden,

21:09.000 --> 21:18.000
I think the thing to do is to put it up, move one, put it up, wink at the stranger.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
They will more than likely be so happy to put the down.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Hey, let's take turns giving each other back rubs.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Hey, my hammies are real tight. I got some tight hammies.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
No pressure.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Can you rub this down for me?

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Hey, Mitch, you were right. It was a great idea to move here.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
Can you just give me a quick back rub like Banana would do if we were in a movie together?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Because you're my whole system now.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
You're all I've got.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
I have put all of my eggs in the Mitch basket.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
So if you could give me a slow rub down.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Bringing it back.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
This one comes to us anonymously from FormSpring.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
It says, I feel like I'm slipping away from all of my friends.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
We used to have a big thing in common which got us all hanging out together,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
but now that's gone and I hardly see them anymore.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
M-B-M-B-A-M? How can I say my friendships?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Was that big thing like you all murdered someone?

22:09.000 --> 22:16.000
It sounds like this guy got pulled along by the Mitch wagon.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
This is what happens, Mitch.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Have you considered uniting over your shared adoration for a podcast?

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
Say one that featured three brothers giving advice to people just like yourself.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I totally understand where this question is coming from.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
My group of friends was established because we all did community theater when we were kids,

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
but now we have scattered across the country.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It sounds like that's the same thing that's going on there.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I think you need to just evaluate.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
I still consider these people to be my dearest friends,

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
even though I only see them or talk to them a handful of times every year.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
But every time we do see each other, it's not weird.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
It's not like, hey man, why haven't you given me a call?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
It's just a naturally sort of established thing.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
That's a really good point.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
I had a super close-knit group of friends in college.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
We're literally hanging out every day.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
I think that what you're experiencing is totally normal.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
We're not built to have a super close group of friends your whole life.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
This is sort of how we progress.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
You have this super close group of friends in college.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Then you grow up, you do the family thing, but they're still important to you.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
What you have to keep in mind is as an adult,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
friendships are more work than they were when we were children.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Everything was convenient.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
You're my best friend because you live across the street from me.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
As an adult, it's all about phone calls and making trips and making plans.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
It's not the same.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Lives are different.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
You grow apart.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
The important thing is that you work at it.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
If you want to keep these friends, you make the effort.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Don't expect it to be as easy as it was.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Call more. Use the phone. It's great.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
A Skype user named Date Wives just asked to be added to my contacts list,

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
offering me sex with married women.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Do you need our advice?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I do. That would be great.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Is it internal show advice?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Don't do it.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I never use Skype.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I went through today in my request.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
I literally had like 30 hot sex with me requests.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
And I was like, do I know these people?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
This is great.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
But I didn't know them at all.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It was awful.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Jesse writes from Gmail.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
He says, my wife is a very tidy person and is always putting my stuff away.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Unfortunately, I'm not a slob and I keep my positions well organized.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
So mostly this entails her rearranging my things in a manner that makes them impossible to find.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
For instance, today I spent well over an hour searching for printer paper

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
that was previously neatly stacked on top of a shelf at my home office near the printer,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
but had been put away in a closet in our guest room.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Oh, that would piss me off.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
I'm having a visceral gut reaction to this question.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm so, so angry right now.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Wow, that would piss me off.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Jesse, I will help you with this.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
This is something I have experience with.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I can guide you.

25:24.000 --> 25:32.000
You have to develop boundaries of rooms in the nicest way possible.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
My wife and I got married.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
We decided that all my video games would go downstairs to the den

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
where I have all my older consoles and stuff like that, all downstairs in the den.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
We keep our living room relatively media-free.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
We have the 360 and the PS3 and the cable box and all that jazz,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
but as far as DVDs, CDs and stuff, not in there.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
In exchange, I have an office where I have Master Chief's helmet

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
glowering down at me from a shelf because she doesn't move things around in here.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
This is my area to deal with as I see fit.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Honestly, that's the only way you can do it.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
You have shared spaces, you have her spaces, you have your spaces.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
You've got to have your own zone where she doesn't interrupt your flow.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Same for her and you.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
If she has some crazy way she wants to keep things, you've got to let that happen.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Or just go to two different houses.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Two different houses is a thing?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Two different wives.

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
Not keep any of your stuff in the house and just have it be all of her stuff

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
and then pretend that you don't live there whenever her dad comes around.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
Do you know anybody who's tried that strategy before?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
No, I can't say that I do.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
This one comes from Yahoo answer user NoName2.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
He says, is it strange to be attracted to cheese?

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
I know this seems like a joke.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
It seems like a thing that somebody puts on Yahoo to seem weird or quirky,

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
but these answers, man, I'm starting to think it's a thing.

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm starting to think that it's the next foot crush food thing.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Foot crush is a thing.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Can we address that real quick?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
That's your new tub girl, guys.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
If you want to really mess somebody up, trick them.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
Just search for food crush or feet food crush on YouTube

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
and then link someone you know or don't care about pictures or videos

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
of feet crushing food because it is huge.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
It's like 100 times more disturbing than it should be, right?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Right.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
Find the one with the woman crushing chocolate eggs filled with cream.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Oh, God.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
It's hugely upsetting.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
It's upsetting enough because the act itself is not upsetting.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
The knowledge that somewhere, somebody is having a slow beat.

28:06.000 --> 28:12.000
Someone is massaging their walnut in small sensitive circles.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
That's brutal.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Anyway, cheese.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Someone says Turophile, lover of cheese.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Totally didn't make that up.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Google it.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It's a thing.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
It is a thing.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
One person named Indian Tiger said, no, it is not strange.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Best of luck.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Keep smiling.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
What?

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
How about you hide your smile if it's derived in any way

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
from sexual cheese pleasure?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
One person says not at all, especially Swiss cheese.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Wink.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Winky.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Oh, God.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
So here's the thing about abnormal psychology.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
All of abnormal psychology is based on context

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
and maybe in 30 years when everyone's boning down on cheese,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
it won't be weird anymore.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
But yeah, it is.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Hey, it is.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Griffin, do you remember the story?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I think we talked about this like six months ago.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
The woman who was in love with a roller coaster.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Oh, yeah.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
No, it wasn't a roller coaster.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
It was like one of those Viking ship swinging rides.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
What's that called?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Objectum sexuality is what that's called.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
That's the scariest YouTube video.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That's like Tub Girl Prime.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
That's like some real heavy shit.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
The thing is when someone was telling me about it,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
it was like a sexual thing, the vibration.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
No, like in love, like romantic.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I'm in love with this carnival ride.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Oh, God, it's awesome.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
I made fun of that in a college journalism class,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
and I got some shit from people who thought I was being insensitive.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
But nope.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Insensitive?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
What?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
No.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Nope.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
Some of us are trying to live in a society, you crazy hooker.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
This one comes from Stevie D from Gmail.

29:56.000 --> 30:03.000
Sometimes when I'm at a party with my friends,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
we play rock band, and we all take turns singing.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I get really psyched for when my turn comes

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
because I have super bitchin' pipes,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
and when I sing Simple Man by Lynyrd Skynyrd,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
it brings the house down without fail.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
However, sometime between when I grab the microphone

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
and the song selection menu, a change comes over me,

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
and I wind up picking Crush, Crush, Crush by Paramore.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Granted, every healthy virile man within a quarter mile

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
is at half-mast by the time the song is over.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
Arr! Half-mast!

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
But it is still concerning.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
What does this say about me, and is my concern warranted?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Stevie D.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
I think we can all agree that Paramore rules.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Paramore does rule. Agree.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
What?

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Paramore is a... no, they're a catchy band.

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
Why am I not allowed to love novelty boats at theme parks,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
but you guys can enjoy Paramore, and I rock.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Well, first of all, the lead singer of Paramore

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
is far more attractive than an inanimate Viking boat ship.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Can you imagine? What if she was on the masthead?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
What if it was her and Vitamin C

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
on opposite ends of the Viking boat ship?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And they're all holding cheese.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, and they're all holding cheese.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And your walnut.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Can we pause the show for two and a half minutes?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
No, I don't think there's anything...

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
I would be more concerned with why your singing voice

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
has an area of effect like gives dudes gay boners.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I don't know why that happens.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
And that's not troubling if you're hanging out with a bunch of gay dudes,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
but if your voice has the power to make people gay,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
you should probably have consent forms.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
With great power comes great responsibility, my man.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Absolutely.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
You're ruining marriages in a quarter-mile radius,

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
and be real careful.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
Hey, guys.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
Hey, Mike.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Mike is in Ann Arbor,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
and he's on a flogging molly kick at the moment.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
He's taught himself some of the songs on the Geetbox

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
and is trying to decide how best to sing with them.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
For those unfamiliar with the band,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
the lead singer has an Irish accent.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
The problem is that I do not.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I am an American. A lot is lost.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
But I have tried it in an Irish accent.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I'm afraid I'll be making a fool of myself.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Oh, don't be afraid. That's exactly what's happening.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Just embrace it. Go with it.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
You could be an American cover band of flogging molly.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I think that there's a market for that.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Here's my advice. German accent.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
I would say learn an accent that is completely different from Irish or American.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Oh, I like it.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
For some reason, I read this question,

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
and it reminded me of Griffin doing Macy Gray.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Just embrace it, brother. Just do it. Don't be afraid.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
I think you have to, especially if you're doing it at an open mic,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
you've got to emulate that voice because it makes it a lot more...

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Travis and I have been doing a pretty triumphant rendition

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
of The Proclaimers' I Want to Be 500 Miles.

33:05.000 --> 33:12.000
We do the accents, I think perhaps unconsciously,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
but we still do them and it adds to the effect.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
What helps in all seriousness is don't take it seriously yourself.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
As you're doing the accent, don't try to nail it,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
especially if you're doing an open mic night thing.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
They know what you're doing, and you know what you're doing,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
so just have fun with it. Don't make it a big deal.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Unless the person isn't familiar, then they're going to be like,

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
why is that guy sounding like an idiot?

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
He's a child up there at the microphone.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Is that the guy from Once? Nope.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
There are many American songs.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Just find one of those. Save yourself this conundrum.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
Oh, that's the other thing. Floggy Molly's a shitty band.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Whoa! Whoa!

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
This one comes from Yahoo Answers user...

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Oh yeah, really? Your cred's been revoked.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
This one comes from Yahoo Answers user Nikolai.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
He says... or she says? No, I think it might be he says.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
This is under the pregnancy and parenting baby names category.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
Can I name my baby girl Justin after Justin Bieber?

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Yes.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, yes.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I think we should defer to Justin on this one,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
because it's his name, and he has dominion over it.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I mean, can you?

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
Can you name your baby after Justin Bieber? Yes.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
I mean, should you tell anybody? No, probably not.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
Do you think Mr. Bieber will appreciate it? Like, the honor?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Why don't you pick somebody more deserving?

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Why don't you pick a more deserving Justin to name your child after?

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Someone who's gonna give that kid the sort of minute-one publicity

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
that a baby starting out in today's fast-paced Twitter-based world needs.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
Maybe name your baby after, like, a Justin McElroy.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Somebody who's gonna get the name out there.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Gonna get that baby promoted.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Justin McElroy Bieber Nikolai.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I love it.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
What about Justin McElroy Bieber,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
and I'll hyphenate my last name. He'll just have me back.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm so sorry, Justin. I'm so, so sorry.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
I didn't know what I was doing. I'm so, so sorry.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Please, baby, baby, please. Please, baby. Please, baby, baby.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
One more time.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
I'll tell you one time, Justin. I'm sorry.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
You shouldn't have said that thing about your teeth.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
It was just a boat at an amusement park,

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
and there was a calliope in the background,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
and I had a belly full of cotton candy, and I didn't know what I was doing.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
I'm so sorry. There was no line.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
I saw it there in the reflection of the street lamp,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
and I thought, yes, yes, I'm a boatman.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
I'm a boatman for life, and I left you.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I didn't go to see your show.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
And I'm sorry, Biebs. I'm sorry.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Why don't you name your kid Viking Fury?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
That would be the coolest name ever.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
That would be the best name ever.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
See, now I want to use that.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Viking Fury. That's awesome.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
This is my son, Viking Fury.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What's his last name? Fury.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
His first name is Viking.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Sorry about your kneecap.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
He's two, and he's got a little baby ax.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
My first ax.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
What's up with that beard he's got going?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't know. I named him Viking Fury.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It really stuck.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It's red like a sunrise.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Did he just kill that narwhal?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Yeah, he did. He's crazy.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Viking Fury, get over here.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Honey, get the muzzle.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
Viking Fury's trying to eat mutton.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
His stomach can't digest it.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
He's only six weeks old.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Mush up some mutton, sweetheart,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
for Viking Fury.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Oh, goodness.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I want to hear Griffin's last question,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
but first I feel like we should tell people

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
how they can seek our guidance.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
There's so many ways, so many options.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I recently compiled them on a new page

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
on the My Brother, My Brother, and Me official website,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
which is MBAM.com.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
And real quick,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I want to throw out a big thank you

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
to everyone who's going to that page

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and going to all of our things.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And thanks for everything so far.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Given us so many hits.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Once we start selling out,

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
we are going to make a tidy profit.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Yeah, a tidy, tidy profit.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Actually, we were actually in the...

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I think we made it to number 12

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
on the iTunes comedy podcast chart.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Which is overwhelming.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And a misnomer,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
because it really... it's about helping.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
It's not about yucks here.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
But yeah,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
it was super, super great.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
And if you haven't rated or subscribed yet,

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
that would be awesome.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
But really, we'd love it if you would just

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
find somebody who isn't a fan yet,

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
say, hey, do you have 35 minutes

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
to really get your shit in order.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Like really get it together.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
You need to tell them that they have a problem.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And that we can address it.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah. And if they want to start listening that way,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
say, I'm going to listen to you

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
if you can solve this problem for me,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
we're down. We're up for a challenge.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
But all of our links are on mbmbam.com.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
There's links to

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
our form spring page

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
where you can ask questions anonymously.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
There's our email, mbmbam at gmail dot com.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You can join our Facebook appreciation group,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
which is...

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
If you do that, that would be huge.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
You can subscribe on iTunes,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
leave a rating, leave a review.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
We really appreciate that.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
There's RSS feeds for Zoom users that you can download.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
It's all on Mamba,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
mbmbam.com.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Or the Mamba,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
as I call it.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Everybody for listening, it's overwhelming.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Justin Russo, thanks for making all of our

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
sweet images, our JPEGs.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And Travis,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
thank you for joining us yet again,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
despite your debilitating disease.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I think

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
it's nice that with what little time left,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
you're getting to be

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
on a podcast.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I'm just glad my wish is coming true.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Thank you all for listening to the series

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
finale.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Very,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
very special.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
You can tune in

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
next week for My Brother and Me.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Goodbye, sweet world.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Uh,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
final question of the day.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
This one comes from, oh god, I should have

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
realized that I can't say this person's name.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
This comes from Yahoo Answers user

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
C4TF00D,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
which I think is supposed to be cat food.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Uh, who asks,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I need love potion ingredients.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Help please.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
How am I supposed to break to this?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
And this has been My Brother, My Brother.

39:45.000 --> 40:11.000
You will never know me.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Yeah!
