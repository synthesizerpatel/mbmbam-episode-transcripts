WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.680
Life is like a hurricane. Hold on, let me just do it. Life is like a hurricane. Okay.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.560
Life is like a hurricane. They're back, folks. Welcome back to Duckburg. We are here to

00:56.560 --> 01:04.240
commemorate a huge event over the weekend. DuckTales are back in a huge way, and we,

01:04.240 --> 01:12.160
the whole gang, us. DuckTales am here. Yeah, we are today. Today, look around you. Today,

01:12.160 --> 01:17.840
we are all DuckTales. Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, a sort of DuckTales. I'm

01:17.840 --> 01:24.080
gonna rename it, Justin. Okay. My Huey, my Dewey, and my Louie. Yeah, my name is-

01:24.080 --> 01:27.280
How about, can I show, can I do? Yeah. Yeah, please. Please go ahead.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.840
Quackin' Up with the McElroy Brothers. Oh, that's pretty good.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.960
Stop. Quackin' Up with the McElroy Brothers calling DuckTales fanzine.

01:36.160 --> 01:42.800
This is our DuckTales fanzine. My name is Justin Huey McElroy. I'm Travis

01:42.800 --> 01:57.520
Webigale McElroy. I'm Griffin Gooey. This is a night record we should mention. We don't typically

01:57.520 --> 02:02.560
do these, but if it feels like the atmosphere is a little bit more loosey-goosey, then that's why,

02:02.560 --> 02:06.880
although that doesn't make sense, because I just ate a bunch of cheese pizza and like a half a

02:06.880 --> 02:13.200
pint of ice cream, and so we have about t-minus 60 minutes before I experienced complete butt death.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.280
On DuckTales, are there any geese?

02:19.600 --> 02:23.360
Because there's like ducks, right? And then there's beagles.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.480
Yeah, and robots. No, that'd be fucked up, wouldn't it? That would be like a human show

02:28.480 --> 02:32.640
with a bunch of humans, and then one human would walk in with a long, long, beautiful,

02:32.640 --> 02:37.840
sexy neck into the scene, and that would be kind of like if you're watching Law and Order SVU,

02:38.480 --> 02:47.600
and then in walks a celebrity. Who's a celebrity nowadays?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.680
Couldn't summon up any names of celebrities?

02:49.680 --> 02:57.200
Let me try. Let me try. Chris O'Donnell walks in, but he's got a long, long, long, long neck.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.480
That would be kind of like the one episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse,

03:02.480 --> 03:06.960
which is a half hour of Goofy staring at Pluto and just being like,

03:06.960 --> 03:11.760
what the fuck? We can all agree this is fucked up, right? Yuck!

03:11.760 --> 03:16.800
He'll just stare at silence for like three minutes sometimes, and then he'll just be like,

03:16.800 --> 03:21.040
no, but seriously, what the fuck? Yeah, it would be like an episode of

03:21.040 --> 03:25.600
Mickey Mouse Clubhouse if there was a new character introduced who's just a fucking

03:25.600 --> 03:30.720
filthy rat that would just shit, couldn't speak in the fun way that the other me speak,

03:31.680 --> 03:37.200
but just like shits right on the floor and eats like a dirty sock, and he's just like,

03:38.080 --> 03:41.040
because he's a rat and not a mouse. It's fucked up if you think about it.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.080
There is a Mortimer Mouse on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse that is just evil as fuck,

03:48.080 --> 03:51.120
and he looks like a dirty rat and never eats his fucking guts.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.160
So Ducktales is back. Has anyone ever entertained the idea that

03:54.160 --> 03:57.840
the reason Goofy wears clothes and talks and the reason Pluto doesn't

03:57.840 --> 04:00.160
is because they're just different species of dog?

04:01.760 --> 04:05.200
It's not some weird fucked up thing. I mean, just some dogs are smarter than other dogs.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.560
No, that all clocks true. So Ducktales is here.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.920
Can we talk about- The series premiered yesterday.

04:15.680 --> 04:23.040
The second episode comes out September 23rd.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.120
Give me some time to stew.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.800
Give me some time to fucking peek and back off. Six weeks, okay. That's fine.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.240
If you don't want to bring me to Ducktales climax right away, that's fine.

04:32.240 --> 04:39.600
Just drop one episode on me for me to just vision board out and print out

04:40.240 --> 04:45.280
JPEGs from the episodes. Where's the merch? Where's something?

04:45.280 --> 04:48.800
You can't give me one episode of Ducktales and be like, it's back. It's really not.

04:48.800 --> 04:54.560
Do you think there are people in message boards and chat rooms like Twin Peaks

04:54.560 --> 04:57.520
that are like, what do you think is going to happen with the rest of the season?

04:57.520 --> 05:04.000
In this one scene, Glomgold was wearing red plaid. Do you think that means that it's like blood

05:04.000 --> 05:09.600
and it's all connected because that guy, I think that that's his brother.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.160
Also, by the way, Twin Peaks.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.360
Hey, that's nothing.

05:15.360 --> 05:23.920
Are we free to talk about the, I'm sorry, insane thing that happened last year

05:24.560 --> 05:29.440
that Travis willed into existence, or is that, do you think, forebidden

05:29.440 --> 05:31.440
from being spoken about on the podcast?

05:31.440 --> 05:33.360
No, that's public knowledge now.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.360
Okay. Last year, we were talking about how very good it would be to have

05:37.360 --> 05:44.160
our friend Ducktales back in the world because it's a good show and the news about

05:44.160 --> 05:48.880
Ducktales being rebooted with a star-studded cast, we're like, fuck yeah, we're here for it.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.840
We won't have to change our password that we use when strangers come to pick us up

05:53.840 --> 05:59.920
at the playground. That's a bim-bam deep cut. Travis said, let's get Lin-Manuel Miranda up

05:59.920 --> 06:08.960
in the mix and let's get him his gizmo duck straight up. Travis was not plugged into the

06:08.960 --> 06:17.440
casting process to know that that was the truth. A day later, Lin texted us, who fucking blabbed?

06:17.440 --> 06:20.080
Who blabbering blatherskites?

06:21.680 --> 06:28.720
It's hysterical, by the way, that Lin thinks we know literally anybody else. Anybody on earth

06:28.720 --> 06:35.920
who could have blabbed other than him are Hollywood patient zero, the only person that

06:35.920 --> 06:38.480
we actually know that could do anything.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.960
Travis was swept up in a months-long grand jury investigation.

06:44.960 --> 06:51.760
I tried to explain that I'm just a precog. I always have been. I was born a precog and I've

06:51.760 --> 07:02.640
lived a precog life. I tried to explain that to the judge. Eventually, the case was thrown out

07:02.640 --> 07:13.440
because I was able to predict the judge's murder and save their wife. But then if the judge wasn't

07:13.440 --> 07:19.600
murdered, then your thing wasn't true. Minority Report 2, it's bad. That was what happened in

07:19.600 --> 07:30.800
the appeal. Shit. Hey, Trav, you got any other shots to call? How about the Name of the Wind

07:30.800 --> 07:39.760
series coming out? It's gonna be real good. Yeah, who's in it? Us. Oh. But not as who you'd think.

07:41.600 --> 07:47.760
All three of us play Elladin, stacked on each other's shoulders in a long row. Yeah, they

07:47.760 --> 07:52.880
haven't done that in a while in a movie or TV show for a while. I think the last time I saw that was

07:52.880 --> 07:59.680
Cloud Atlas and there was Tom Hanks on top of two uncredited actors. Two uncredited Tom Hanks. He

07:59.680 --> 08:03.680
just said, I want to be tall in this one. If I'm going to be in this one, I want to be real,

08:03.680 --> 08:09.120
real tall. So he had two uncredited actors carrying his weight. There's an amazing cast

08:09.760 --> 08:14.560
in this new reboot of DuckTales. There's David Tennant, Scrooge McDuck, Danny Pudi is

08:14.560 --> 08:19.920
Huey, Ben Schwartz is Dewey, Bobby Moynihan is Louie, Kate McCoochie is Webigale. It's amazing.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.000
It's a huge cast. Beck Bennett is Launchpad, McQuack, are you kidding me? Get out of here.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.320
Star-studded cast. Who's playing Donald Duck? Well, Tony Anselmo. Now I know what you're thinking.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.320
I don't know the name Tony Anselmo. Well, you wouldn't, except for this one thing.

08:34.320 --> 08:40.800
Tony Anselmo is the reigning Donald Duck. And that is the one part where they're like, well,

08:41.760 --> 08:47.760
no, you gotta go to Tony. You gotta get Tony because Tony has been Donald Duck since

08:47.760 --> 08:56.400
1986. Every time you've heard Donald Duck on the original DuckTales. Yeah, that's Tony Anselmo.

08:56.400 --> 09:02.640
Like Tony Anselmo is only Donald Duck. Check his IMDb. It's Buckwild. Only Donald Duck

09:02.640 --> 09:09.840
and always Donald Duck. You can do like a star-studded cast and like we're going to take,

09:09.840 --> 09:14.240
you know, Huey in a different direction and we're going to make Launchpad sound slightly different.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.040
But you couldn't have like Donald Duck as played by Michael Fassbender just like walking around

09:19.040 --> 09:25.760
like, hello, nephews. Come, come with me now. Oh, uncle. Yes, we must fight Glomgold.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.280
You could have gotten, you could have gotten me though.

09:27.280 --> 09:36.080
Oh, what a fight. I tried to almost watch that, that, that Lovecraftian deep tongue.

09:36.080 --> 09:41.360
Yeah, no kidding. Thank you to Tony. Thank you to DuckTales. Can we do the show advice?

09:41.360 --> 09:50.560
Yeah. Would love to get Tony on the show, by the way. So Tony for listening, get at us. Let's do

09:50.560 --> 09:54.720
this. Let's stop dancing around it. There's probably somebody who listens to our show

09:55.680 --> 10:02.480
with like a full blown conspiracy theory that we must just do all sorts of native advertising

10:03.040 --> 10:08.080
on our show. Like there's no way that they just talk about these things for 12 minutes and no one

10:08.080 --> 10:12.880
paid for 12 minutes. There's no way what human being would do a show where they just said

10:13.840 --> 10:21.120
DuckTales for 12 minutes without being paid to do it. We would. We did. We did.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.360
Here's our first question. I need your help. For about a year now, once a month,

10:25.360 --> 10:29.840
someone in my building leaves a banana peel on or around my doorway. At first,

10:29.840 --> 10:34.720
I regarded this as bland bemusement, but then they started deliberately hiding them under my

10:34.720 --> 10:40.640
drawing umbrella or under the doormat, which is a bit sinister. Today, I was horrified to find one

10:40.640 --> 10:46.800
hanging on my door handle. I had to touch the gross banana mess with my real human fingers.

10:46.800 --> 10:53.600
Any advice on how to get this to stop or failing that advice on how to ferret out the culprit

10:53.600 --> 10:56.720
would be appreciated. And that's from Kip.

10:56.720 --> 11:04.320
Um, is it possible that this is the symbol that lets God's angels of vengeance know to pass over

11:04.320 --> 11:09.680
your house, saving, saving you on this- Trying to save you, Kip.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.640
Trying to save you on this high holy day. Maybe, maybe it's possible.

11:12.640 --> 11:20.000
Is it possible that in a similar vein, this is some sort of like local secret, like secret society,

11:20.000 --> 11:24.560
and they really want you to join and they don't understand. They keep leaving. They're calling

11:24.560 --> 11:28.720
card to let you know that they're calling you up. And yet you keep not showing up to their monthly

11:28.720 --> 11:31.200
meetings. Of the Nanner team.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.240
Of the Nanner team. That is their name. It's not very scary.

11:34.240 --> 11:40.480
But they do a lot of good. They do good. They're very much like Shriners in that way.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.000
So secretive, just like Shriners. What's even going on in those tiny cars?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.520
They run everything the Nanner team does, and I'm glad we can finally discuss them

11:47.520 --> 11:51.600
openly in the podcast. Well, I mean, we'll have to shut the show down after this. I mean,

11:51.600 --> 11:56.720
we'll have to shut the show down after this. I mean, we can't invoke the Nanner team name

11:56.720 --> 12:03.760
and then just continue making jokes like silly boys. Maybe Banana Man lives in your building

12:03.760 --> 12:07.840
and he comes home drunk. He's like, I'm going to take a shit right here.

12:07.840 --> 12:13.600
And then he does shit. It's his shit. And he always shits right there on your door.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.680
Hold on. OK, so you mean Banana Man, the cartoon within Danger Mouse,

12:17.680 --> 12:23.120
if I remember correctly, and in your mind, canonically, he shits banana peels?

12:23.120 --> 12:26.800
He doesn't even shit whole bananas. That's what's fucked up to me is he shits out

12:27.360 --> 12:32.800
the used husk of a banana. Well, I don't want to. I mean,

12:32.800 --> 12:36.160
I don't want to play this game with you, but he only eats bananas.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.720
So what do you want him to shit? You know, some whole like Griffin.

12:39.920 --> 12:46.800
So we please don't invoke that that curse back upon my brand. So we got so far list of such.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.000
Let's get let's this is going to be helpful. Let's do a list of suspects.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.160
We've got somebody from Nanner team. We've got somebody protecting you

12:54.160 --> 12:58.640
from God's angel of righteous vengeance. We have but we do have Banana Man.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.040
I'm going to go ahead and put Donkey Kong on the list.

13:02.400 --> 13:07.360
He's either cruising cruising by and he either finishes his snack ever because he's very he's

13:07.360 --> 13:13.920
a very deliberate young ape and he finishes his banana snack on his way to his apartment.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.480
And do you even know your fucking neighbors? Do you even know that you live next door to

13:18.480 --> 13:21.920
fucking Donkey Kong? OK, whatever. And he just always finishes the banana there.

13:21.920 --> 13:26.320
And that's where he drops it. Alternatively, there's a Mario Kart race that goes on by.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.240
So they just toss it there trying to trip up Toad or Yoshi or whoever.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.600
Griffin, if you live in the same apartment building as Donkey Kong,

13:33.600 --> 13:35.920
you would know because every time he tried to walk up the stairs,

13:35.920 --> 13:38.880
you'd have to jump over those barrels. That is a good point.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.960
Video game. Justin, you have a video game joke?

13:40.960 --> 13:45.040
Uh, I don't actually. Isn't that weird? Yeah. Wow. Huh?

13:45.040 --> 13:49.520
Yeah. Huh? So Donkey Kong is definitely on the list.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.720
It could just be a mean child. There's a lot of those.

13:52.720 --> 13:57.280
A mean? But here's the thing, Griffin. A mean but deliberate child. Like,

13:57.280 --> 14:00.960
I would understand if the banana peel just showed up, like, on your doormat.

14:00.960 --> 14:06.960
But under your doormat? Like, this might be someone in the building who now thinks it's

14:06.960 --> 14:11.680
a funny inside joke they have with you, except they forgot to let you inside.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.040
Uh, Kip, I have a question. Have you ever seen Memento?

14:19.120 --> 14:22.240
It's a great movie. It's good. It's really good.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.040
So I watched Children of Men yesterday. That's another good movie. Travis,

14:25.040 --> 14:28.720
have you seen a good movie lately? Um, let's see. What have I watched lately?

14:28.720 --> 14:31.360
I'm saying Kip's eating the bananas. I liked Moon.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.840
Moon is underappreciated. Oh, it's a good one.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.160
Yeah. I'm saying Kip's eating the bananas

14:36.160 --> 14:38.320
is what I'm saying. And forgets about it.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.200
Kip is eating the banana, and it's a very- and it's not like-

14:41.840 --> 14:45.360
Okay, this is gonna sound wild until I put it to you like this.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.280
Tell me the exact moment that you last ate a banana.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.400
Me? Exactly. Thank you.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.080
I'm asking both of you. Tell me the exact last moment that you ate a banana.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.200
On purpose or accidentally? Both.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.400
It was- it was that fateful- it was that fateful viral video.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.600
Okay, well Griffin had a viral hit the last time he ate a banana,

15:05.600 --> 15:07.760
so he probably- I have- I have lots of evidence.

15:07.760 --> 15:12.720
I will admit, since having a baby, I mindlessly eat bananas sometimes,

15:12.720 --> 15:17.200
because like, we'll give her half a banana, and while I just stand there and stare at her,

15:17.200 --> 15:22.080
mush it into her face like a monster, I will realize I'm eating the other half,

15:22.080 --> 15:27.520
almost like simpatico, like I can't help it. Like, we must both destroy bananas in this moment.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.160
Okay. Okay.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.760
This is what I'm saying, Kip. You need to look- take a long look in that deep,

15:31.760 --> 15:36.960
dark, truthful mirror and say, hey, did- did I eat the banana?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.200
Am I doing this to myself? Is this a Kip joint that I created for myself?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.880
Am I the Nanner monster?

15:42.880 --> 15:45.920
Am I the Nanner monster? It's possible. Those are all very-

15:45.920 --> 15:47.440
Am I the founder of Nanner team?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.720
Get a fucking Nest Cam or something and get to the bottom of this,

15:52.720 --> 15:54.960
because I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight. Thank you, Kip.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.000
How about a Yahoo? Yeah, absolutely.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.640
Man, I got some fucking wild ones, y'all. Um, I'm gonna read this one.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.320
I don't know if it'll be a good conversation point, but I was so intrigued by it,

16:06.320 --> 16:10.000
and it was sent in by Chris, uh, Haug. Thank you, Chris.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.880
It's Yahoo Answers user Mike Will, and this is a Yahoo Answers Now, so time is of the essence.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.480
Mike Will asks, in singles and dating,

16:19.520 --> 16:22.800
how I got the blank ATM card that changed my life.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.840
There's not a question mark on this. I guess they're a little bit more loosey-goosey with

16:25.840 --> 16:31.280
punctuation in Yahoo Answers Now. Um, it's a period at the end of this one,

16:31.280 --> 16:36.160
and if you're waiting for more, you're gonna be disappointed, because there isn't any more.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.920
This seems like, uh, maybe a prompt for, like, a short story and a creative writing class,

16:41.920 --> 16:44.640
but how I got the blank ATM card that changed my life?

16:44.640 --> 16:52.560
Um, I think I would posit that what this headline is trying to make us think is, like, an ATM card

16:52.560 --> 16:58.400
that is, like, somehow fully loaded, but without any restrictions, but in fact,

16:58.400 --> 17:02.080
wouldn't a blank ATM card just be... It wouldn't work.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.040
Yeah, it would just be a, like, rectangle of plastic, right?

17:05.040 --> 17:09.280
You'd get on Amazon, and you'd say, like, I'm gonna buy myself a nice foot bath,

17:09.280 --> 17:13.920
and then they send you a card, and you're like, okay, I'm gonna buy myself a foot bath.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.320
And then they say, what's the... Mike, Will, whichever.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.520
I need the information on the card, please, to complete the transaction.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.240
It's me, Jeff Bezos. I think I'm the Amazon guy.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.840
And you can't provide the information, because it doesn't exist as a blank ATM card.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.920
It did change his life, though.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.280
That would be a fucking power move, though. If you walked into a store, and they're like,

17:35.280 --> 17:39.840
that'll be 56.30, and you just handed them a rectangle of blank plastic,

17:39.840 --> 17:43.760
and just, like, stared at them as they tried to, like, insert it into the chip machine,

17:43.760 --> 17:46.560
or swipe it, and you just kept looking, and they're like, it's not working.

17:46.560 --> 17:51.440
Just, like, gnawed at them. Like, never address anything until they're like, just leave.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.720
Please just take your stuff and get out.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.720
And then, who's that? It's your husband. That's how I met my husband.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.040
My blank ATM card changed my fucking life.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.080
Changed everything.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.600
Let's do a different one, because this is dumb.

18:06.560 --> 18:06.880
All right.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.600
This one was sent in by six different people, but Madeline Diaz was the first one.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.360
Thank you, Madeline. It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, so it's also Mike Will.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.320
Says, my cat saw me throw away a mouse.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.160
My cat brought me a mouse, and it saw me pick it up and throw it outside.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.840
Will my cat know that I trashed it?

18:28.880 --> 18:29.360
Okay, wait.

18:30.720 --> 18:36.560
Is the concern of this question, like, my cat knows that there's a mouse in the garbage,

18:36.560 --> 18:39.920
or is the concern of this question, my cat gave it to me,

18:39.920 --> 18:42.880
and, like, as a present, and saw me throw it away?

18:42.880 --> 18:45.600
This cat is not going to be offended.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.240
Kitties are so funny, because they're always bringing you little gifts,

18:50.240 --> 18:52.160
and you never really want the gifts.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.200
I just love these, I just love these little guys.

18:57.200 --> 19:01.200
Cats are like, cats are like the extended family that found out,

19:01.200 --> 19:04.320
like, you were into something, because they saw you have it, like, once,

19:04.320 --> 19:06.640
and then, like, you're always getting Minions toys.

19:06.640 --> 19:11.680
Your cat, your cat saw you eat one mouse, and was like, oh, I got you, me too, me too, me too.

19:11.680 --> 19:15.840
Oh, man, oh, I had a mouse, then he took the mouse away from me.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.200
He must want mice.

19:17.200 --> 19:17.600
I got this.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.480
Yeah, he must love them.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.760
The question asker says they threw it in the trash,

19:21.760 --> 19:24.320
and then later in the question, they threw it outside.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.880
I do not know the cat on Earth that if you were like,

19:29.600 --> 19:32.400
anyways, I'm just going to chuck this mouse outside,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.960
that cat would not be like, oh, dunk, free mouse.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.280
Like, there's no way that cat's not going to make a run for it.

19:37.280 --> 19:44.080
Um, user J-O-E says, oh, Joe, oops, says.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.040
He's been inside too long, pull him out.

19:49.040 --> 19:52.480
Says, Kitty says, I will never understand humans,

19:52.480 --> 19:54.800
they throw out good food, such a waste.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.520
I don't think Kitty, I love these little guys, like I said,

19:57.520 --> 20:00.720
they're always up to fun and games that, like, I don't really understand,

20:00.720 --> 20:05.600
but I don't think they necessarily understand value,

20:05.600 --> 20:12.160
or, like, would make any sort of evaluations of my human, like, motivations.

20:12.160 --> 20:16.240
If your cat thought it was weird when you threw the mouse in the trash,

20:16.240 --> 20:21.600
how would your cat react if you just methodically started skinning the mouse,

20:22.160 --> 20:26.320
and then rubbing it in butter and garlic, and then sauteing the mouse,

20:26.320 --> 20:30.240
and then sitting down, and getting your deboning knife,

20:30.240 --> 20:34.640
and deboning the mouse, and then sitting down, and just enjoying the mouse.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.320
Would that be more strange for your cat to process?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.880
It seems like that would be also very troubling for the cat.

20:40.880 --> 20:43.280
I always find it funny when people talk about, like,

20:43.280 --> 20:46.800
oh, it must be so weird, like, my cat watches me clean his litter box,

20:46.800 --> 20:47.920
like, what does it think I do?

20:47.920 --> 20:50.160
Your cat doesn't care.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.640
Your cat doesn't think about you in that way.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.000
Your cat doesn't give two shit.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.840
And this isn't a cat versus dog thing,

20:55.840 --> 20:58.240
because my dog also doesn't think about the things I do

20:58.240 --> 20:59.680
three seconds after I'm done doing them.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.120
I love these pets.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.120
Can we stop the podcast for, like, a minute,

21:03.120 --> 21:06.400
so I can go find my kitty and give him a big kiss on his head?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.640
But do you guys remember when I had the lizards?

21:08.640 --> 21:09.840
You had lizards?

21:09.840 --> 21:12.560
You don't remember that brief period where I had the aquarium

21:12.560 --> 21:16.880
up in my attic room with the two, like, red lizards in there?

21:16.880 --> 21:17.920
You don't remember that?

21:17.920 --> 21:19.440
I don't remember you had lizards.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.280
Somebody gave me a box with some lizards in it

21:21.280 --> 21:23.200
when I was in elementary school or middle school.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.320
I didn't have them very long.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.680
I wasn't very responsible.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.800
They were already pretty old when they were given to me, folks.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.680
Don't worry at home.

21:29.680 --> 21:35.520
Um, but I remember thinking, this may be the best tra-

21:35.520 --> 21:39.520
like, the best trade-off of pet-to-owner interaction level

21:39.520 --> 21:42.000
of, like, even better than fish.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.880
The low level, I must commit to enjoy these lizards

21:46.880 --> 21:47.840
being in this glass box.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.880
I gotta know more about this person that gave you a box

21:50.880 --> 21:53.120
and said, here's two very old lizards.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.880
Will you help them die, Travis?

21:54.880 --> 21:59.360
Will you help these old lizards find their way to Jesus?

22:00.480 --> 22:03.360
I wish I could remember more salient details

22:03.360 --> 22:05.040
about this lizard exchange.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.960
But honest to God, the only thing I can remember

22:06.960 --> 22:09.840
is coming home one day from, like, some kind of practice

22:09.840 --> 22:12.480
and mom and dad being like, hey, sorry, your lizards are dead.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.120
And I walked into my room where they were in the aquarium

22:15.120 --> 22:16.720
and I poked them and they started running around

22:16.720 --> 22:18.320
and I looked at mom and dad and they were like,

22:18.320 --> 22:20.240
I swear they were dead, like, 10 minutes ago.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.160
Welcome to-

22:22.160 --> 22:25.760
Thank you for calling Travis McElroy's lizard hospice.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.680
We do have where we try to provide the most calming

22:29.680 --> 22:32.480
sort of spiritual experience for your lizards, too.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.960
Feel free to let go.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.640
That's the main thing we try to achieve here.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.840
If you guys are gonna have a bird pet,

22:41.040 --> 22:42.640
what kind of bird pet would you have?

22:42.640 --> 22:43.840
Big bird, little bird?

22:44.560 --> 22:45.360
Which one would you go?

22:46.640 --> 22:47.920
Justin says no way.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.360
No way, birds fuck me up, man.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.480
Not even like a hawk, Justin, but your falcon?

22:52.480 --> 22:54.400
Birds are the mice of the sky.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.160
No way on earth would I ever have a bird pet.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.200
That's beautiful.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.560
What if it, okay, what if it got out and I had to move?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.880
Cause no way, no way.

23:02.880 --> 23:03.680
Yeah, yeah.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.680
So you mean got out within your home?

23:06.320 --> 23:10.400
Got out in the house and it'd be like, hi, century 21.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.440
It did happen again.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.960
Is this Jake with State Farm?

23:14.960 --> 23:15.760
I need to move.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.360
I know State Farm doesn't sell houses,

23:17.360 --> 23:18.960
but I didn't know who else to call.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.240
I'm so scared.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.480
Hi, is this J-A-K-E with State Farm?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.840
Oh wait, sorry, it's Jake.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.360
Is this Jake with State Farm?

23:25.360 --> 23:25.920
Go eat ass.

23:26.800 --> 23:30.080
I would want to do a heavenly dove.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.240
I want a hawk.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.960
I just always pictured myself something of a 15th century lord.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.480
That's so much work.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.400
I know that's how you envision yourself.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.760
I want a beautiful dove.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.400
One that's completely quiet all the time though.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.240
I'd just like to have my own wings.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.040
Does that count?

23:47.040 --> 23:49.360
I kind of put my wings on my kitty.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.800
That's the best of both pets.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.400
Oh man, if Buttercup could fly.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.320
Oh, that'd be amazing.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.680
If I have a flying dog.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.960
Not a good podcast.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.040
It's nine o'clock p.m. on a Sunday night.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.840
What do you want from us?

24:03.840 --> 24:05.680
Family Guy's on and I know I'm missing it.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.520
Jesus.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.400
How about the question?

24:08.400 --> 24:08.960
That's what I want from you.

24:08.960 --> 24:13.680
What do you guys think Stoodie Griffin?

24:13.680 --> 24:17.840
What do you guys think Stoodie Griffiths is doing right now?

24:17.840 --> 24:20.560
I bet he's probably messing with his dog.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.920
His dog friend, Briggan.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.880
And they have a good old time.

24:24.880 --> 24:32.480
I bet whatever he's doing, it is not like congruous with what his age would suggest.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.320
Yeah, love that.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.080
I'm gonna read this fucking question if you don't.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.400
I was driving home from work yesterday and I stopped behind-

24:40.400 --> 24:45.280
One night with my lab, I did see quite a fright.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.080
I don't know the words.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.000
That's it?

24:50.160 --> 24:52.880
Nothing more topical than a Monster Mash reference in August.

24:52.880 --> 24:57.840
That's not even the way the song starts.

24:57.840 --> 24:58.480
You just decided-

24:58.480 --> 25:01.760
I was driving home from work late one night.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.640
My boss is a real jerk and kept me late.

25:04.640 --> 25:05.280
What a dick.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.760
Anyway, Mash.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.560
I had to quit.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.320
I had to quit my job.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.200
I hate my job.

25:15.760 --> 25:20.720
If all Griffin needs is two words to start his Yankovic machine up.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.000
Two words and a gerund.

25:23.040 --> 25:27.760
He needs two words and a gerund to start the Yankovic proclamation.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.960
I'm not sure that I want to-

25:28.960 --> 25:29.200
Okay.

25:29.920 --> 25:34.720
I was driving home from work yesterday and I stopped behind a van at a red light.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.720
The van had a rear-facing seat occupied by two teens.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.840
We made eye contact.

25:39.840 --> 25:40.880
That's your first mistake.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.480
I spent the rest of the red light looking at the floor.

25:44.480 --> 25:48.560
How should I handle this situation if I get stuck behind them in traffic again?

25:48.560 --> 25:49.120
And that's from-

25:49.120 --> 25:51.680
Oh God, please stop looking at me in Orlando.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.680
Man, holy shit.

25:53.680 --> 25:57.840
So like we had a station wagon growing up that had rear-facing seats and there were,

25:57.840 --> 25:58.960
you know, a grip of us.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.560
And so like almost always one of us would be back there having to,

26:02.560 --> 26:07.840
um, you know, have eye contact with people behind us.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.960
So like, first of all, think about the fact that this is the only time this happened to

26:10.960 --> 26:15.200
you all night and to them it was, it was Tuesday.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.160
Like this was, this is their, this is their fucking life.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.280
And so like I cannot imagine-

26:19.280 --> 26:23.520
When you had eye contact with M. Bison, it was the worst day of your life.

26:23.520 --> 26:28.480
Like it's, this is, this is, first of all, is this, how is this fucking allowed?

26:28.480 --> 26:32.160
Like since having a child and having to put like a car safety suit on,

26:32.160 --> 26:32.960
a safety seat in the car,

26:32.960 --> 26:36.880
I feel like I'm way more aware of like automotive safety standards.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.960
How is it cool for folks to just be like,

26:38.960 --> 26:42.000
we're going to face the opposite way as everybody in the car.

26:42.000 --> 26:42.960
Are we good?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.840
I don't think you're good back there a little bit, maybe.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.680
Not just from a safety standard though, Griffin,

26:47.680 --> 26:50.560
it also sends a signal to whoever is in those seats like,

26:50.560 --> 26:53.040
and you're not a part of the rest of the car.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.360
Enjoy looking out the back.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.600
We'll be up here talking.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.400
It does preclude the need for a baby on board sticker.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.400
Cause it's like, look, they're right there.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.840
Look, there's babies.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.240
Make your, make whatever driving decisions you want.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.960
But as you can see, I have my teens in the car.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.880
Please try to be responsible.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.440
Drive like your teens are in my car.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.520
I think the best thing-

27:16.400 --> 27:18.640
Trying to run me off the road like Liam Neeson.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.840
I think the best thing you could have done is reached down

27:21.840 --> 27:25.440
and retrieved your fidget spinner and then spun it up real good for them

27:25.440 --> 27:28.240
to show them that like you mean them no harm and you're,

27:28.240 --> 27:30.160
you know, you're safe and with it.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.880
Roll down some windows and blast LMFAO.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.160
Is that still a thing?

27:34.160 --> 27:34.960
Absolutely.

27:34.960 --> 27:35.760
It's still a thing, Travis.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.440
I'm so glad you've said that.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.200
We knew this was going to happen,

27:39.200 --> 27:42.480
but we made an episode of our TV show,

27:43.840 --> 27:45.200
our short-lived television program,

27:45.200 --> 27:48.800
which has a new home, by the way, vrv.co forward slash nbmbam.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.160
Go watch the whole thing for free.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.520
We'll talk more about it at the end,

27:51.520 --> 27:54.320
but we made an episode about it and we knew this would happen,

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
but it's about teens and connecting with teens.

27:56.320 --> 27:59.360
And we focused heavily on dabbing and fidgets

27:59.360 --> 28:01.120
and water bottle flips.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.960
We missed fidget spinners by like a day.

28:03.520 --> 28:03.840
Yeah.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.880
And the absence of fidget spinners from that episode

28:06.880 --> 28:09.680
has just hope like it insta-dated it.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.640
It like is already hopelessly out of date

28:12.640 --> 28:15.440
because fidget spinners were not present in the episode.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.680
It's like by the time it came to air,

28:17.680 --> 28:22.160
it was already hopelessly free of fidget spinners.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.800
I wish there was a thing you could do in the car

28:24.800 --> 28:27.680
that didn't involve paying attention to anything outside of the car

28:27.680 --> 28:30.720
that was like even remotely safe or acceptable.

28:30.720 --> 28:31.840
Like, you know what I mean?

28:31.840 --> 28:33.360
Like if there was like a little-

28:33.360 --> 28:34.160
Like a partition.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.560
Right, but at the front,

28:37.680 --> 28:40.400
a partition that popped up on the hood

28:40.400 --> 28:42.720
that prevented like, you know what I mean?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.760
But then it's unsafe and you can't see when the light changes.

28:45.760 --> 28:50.800
Anytime I am stopped at a stoplight next to somebody else,

28:51.600 --> 28:54.800
especially if they have like a flashy car

28:54.800 --> 28:57.680
or like a loud car or they look young,

28:57.680 --> 29:01.120
I'm always really afraid of sending any signals to them.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.080
This is true.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.400
It's gonna sound like a joke, but I'm just gonna say it anyway.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.120
I'm always afraid of sending any signals to them

29:07.120 --> 29:08.720
that I want to race them.

29:08.720 --> 29:13.360
I'm always worried that I want to do the wrong thing

29:13.360 --> 29:15.520
and they're gonna think that I'm trying to race them.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.840
Or I'm saying that my Honda Pilot is faster than their car in any way.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.280
And I'm just always really paranoid

29:21.280 --> 29:23.280
about making it clear that I don't want to race them.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.600
Have you, has your foot ever slipped

29:25.600 --> 29:27.680
and you've accidentally like tapped the accelerator

29:27.680 --> 29:29.120
while you're also holding the brake and you're like,

29:29.120 --> 29:30.960
oh, oh God, no, no, no, no.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.160
And I have to take my hands off the wheel

29:32.160 --> 29:35.040
and be like, no, no, no, no racing, no racing, please.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.720
I feel like I used to get that in Huntington

29:36.720 --> 29:38.800
when like, you know, fucking high school,

29:38.800 --> 29:40.720
especially driving home from high school,

29:40.720 --> 29:44.400
the high school that Travis and I and Justin

29:44.400 --> 29:46.000
for I guess three of the years attended

29:46.000 --> 29:47.840
was like up on this big hill

29:47.840 --> 29:49.280
and you had to like get out on the highway

29:49.280 --> 29:50.080
and drive up to it.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.960
And so like everybody just fucking drove.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.040
I feel like driving home from that especially,

29:55.040 --> 29:56.560
like every other day,

29:56.560 --> 30:00.320
some motherfucker in like a big Ford truck

30:01.040 --> 30:02.800
would like try to race us.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.400
And I didn't know how to tell them like,

30:05.280 --> 30:07.920
no, I don't, but then they still race you.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.760
And I, even though I didn't want to participate,

30:09.760 --> 30:12.560
I still take the psychic damage from knowing I lost.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.800
It's a lose-lose situation.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.680
Do you, do you ever when you're driving

30:17.680 --> 30:19.920
like just designate in your mind,

30:19.920 --> 30:21.440
especially when you're on a long car trip,

30:21.440 --> 30:25.680
like that car and I are somehow cosmically connected now

30:26.320 --> 30:28.160
where like, you just see like another,

30:28.160 --> 30:31.200
like you and red car are just like

30:31.200 --> 30:32.960
kind of maintaining the same speed

30:32.960 --> 30:35.040
and going the same direction for a hundred miles.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.320
On a road trip, like you and, you know,

30:38.320 --> 30:41.520
some, you know, Beatle just keep passing each other

30:41.520 --> 30:42.880
for like eight hours.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.760
And it's like, oh, nice.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.120
And then you stop at a Denny's

30:45.120 --> 30:46.320
and then you leave the Denny's

30:46.320 --> 30:47.760
and like an hour later you see him again.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.600
It's like, oh, you stopped too, yes.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.200
Nice. I saw today

30:51.200 --> 30:52.720
when I was driving back from Huntington,

30:53.280 --> 30:55.760
two motorcyclists, motorcyclers?

30:56.400 --> 30:57.360
Cyclerinos.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.760
And they were- Gearheads.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.680
Gearhead, two gearheads.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.560
And they were on bikes, like one car ahead of me

31:05.120 --> 31:08.000
and like together for easily 25 miles.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.560
And then suddenly at an intersection,

31:10.560 --> 31:13.440
one of them turned and the other one kept going

31:14.240 --> 31:15.280
for a long time.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.840
And I got a divorce just there on the road.

31:17.840 --> 31:21.280
Suddenly I was incapable of accepting

31:21.280 --> 31:24.000
that they had not been together that whole time.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.960
Like that they were just two independent gearheads

31:27.520 --> 31:30.320
that are just like, let's ride together for a while.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.720
And like, I was truly blown away and touched

31:32.720 --> 31:34.560
by that moment of like, I don't know you

31:34.560 --> 31:35.680
and you don't know me,

31:35.680 --> 31:37.840
but we're gearheads for life now.

31:37.840 --> 31:38.720
Let's go.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.960
I can't wait till self-driving cars like fix all this

31:40.960 --> 31:44.160
because I will not have to even look up from my Mad Magazine

31:44.160 --> 31:46.000
that I'm just sitting in the cockpit

31:46.000 --> 31:50.080
of my fucking GoPod that Elon just made for me.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.400
It's a custom Elon original GoPod.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.480
And just like, you're in your GoPod facing backwards

31:54.480 --> 31:55.600
like an asshole.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.480
You know, fidget spinning two or three spinners

31:58.480 --> 32:00.640
at the same time, like showing off that.

32:00.640 --> 32:02.240
And I'm just like, nice try.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.240
And meanwhile, I'm trying to solve all the puzzles

32:04.240 --> 32:07.360
and all the Mad Magazine, get all the jokes

32:07.360 --> 32:08.880
in the Mad Magazine.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.160
Trying to fold that back page.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.600
Do the fold one, yeah.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.320
I love that.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.360
All right, we've lost the plot.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.920
Let's go to the money zone.

32:25.200 --> 32:28.560
This week, I want to tell you about an old friend.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.520
Oh, hey old friend.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.480
Come on in, sit on down.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.680
Oh, it's been a while.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.120
It's been a while since we talked over it.

32:35.120 --> 32:35.600
What's that?

32:36.160 --> 32:37.120
You brought snacks?

32:37.760 --> 32:38.800
Your nature box?

32:38.800 --> 32:43.280
Snacks, well, that was a weird intro to this ad.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.280
But nature box is sponsoring us this week.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.280
They have over a hundred snacks and they taste good

32:47.280 --> 32:49.680
and are actually better for you.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.360
All snacks are made for-

32:51.360 --> 32:53.760
Everybody, if you listen back to that part,

32:53.760 --> 32:56.560
if you're re-listening, when you get to that section,

32:56.560 --> 32:59.680
I want you to imagine Travis like hanging by a noose

32:59.680 --> 33:02.320
and Griffin and me just staring up at him like,

33:02.320 --> 33:04.080
nope, let him dangle.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.760
We're absolutely not gonna jump into this weird intro trap

33:07.760 --> 33:09.280
that he has laid for himself.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.240
Absolutely not.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.520
I'm not worried.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.720
I'm like fucking looping.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.720
I'm gonna get out of whatever trap you laid for me.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.800
I'm a bit of a joke wizard like that.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.640
No bad joke can hold me.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.040
All snacks are made from high quality, simple ingredients,

33:23.040 --> 33:25.600
which means no artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.280
So you can feel good about what you're eating.

33:28.880 --> 33:32.000
I myself, I love a nice salty snack.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.480
Love the Asiago cheese crisps.

33:34.480 --> 33:39.680
I like the sesame sticks, that kind of thing.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.120
Way deep into that.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.320
But they also have like whole wheat chocolate.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.080
I like a big island pineapple.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.400
It's just a big pineapple ring that's all dried out

33:46.400 --> 33:47.680
and I can look through it and pretend

33:47.680 --> 33:49.920
that it's like a little portal to another world.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.000
Justin, what do you like?

33:52.560 --> 33:54.400
The chewing gum that they have.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.440
Have you guys tried that yet?

33:56.320 --> 33:57.040
Is that real?

33:58.080 --> 34:00.240
No, but I was trying to get it going.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.400
If they wanted to have some nature box chewing gum,

34:02.400 --> 34:03.840
I bet it would be great

34:03.840 --> 34:06.000
and it'd have lots of real fruit flavor.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.840
And I would love that sort of natural approach.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.480
Yeah, I love their hypothetical gum too.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.440
That's my favorite.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.120
Chav, what is your other stuff they don't have,

34:13.120 --> 34:14.400
but that they would crush?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.400
I really liked their nature box donuts

34:16.400 --> 34:17.760
that are just filled with vegetables,

34:17.760 --> 34:19.120
but it doesn't taste like it.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.320
I got my home insurance through nature box.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.320
And there's no artificial sweeteners in there.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.920
But then my kitchen exploded and they got me.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.720
They didn't give me money.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.480
They just sent me a bunch of snacks.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.680
And I was like, nature box, this is actually bad insurance.

34:35.680 --> 34:38.000
I need a new home nature box.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.040
This would all happen in the hypothetical.

34:41.040 --> 34:41.920
And right now you'll say-

34:41.920 --> 34:42.960
This is the world that I see.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.520
This is the world I see when I peer through my pineapple rings.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.760
Nature box is offering my brother,

34:47.760 --> 34:49.920
my brother and me fans three free snacks

34:49.920 --> 34:52.080

34:54.400 --> 34:55.840

34:55.840 --> 34:58.400
That's naturebox.com slash my brother

34:58.400 --> 35:00.560

35:00.560 --> 35:03.040

35:03.040 --> 35:04.800
Come chow down on these delicious

35:04.800 --> 35:06.480
preservative free stargates.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.680
Everybody step back.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.920
I'm about to talk about me undies.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.600
You want to look good in your underwear

35:13.600 --> 35:14.640
and be comfortable.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.040
The balance is hard to find.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.040
In fact, it's razor thin.

35:19.040 --> 35:20.720
It's shaped like a me undies logo

35:20.720 --> 35:23.280
because they're the only underwear that are both.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.080
August is national underwear month

35:26.080 --> 35:28.720
and celebrate me undies is making it easier than ever

35:28.720 --> 35:30.640
to try the world's most comfortable underwear

35:30.640 --> 35:32.960
by giving you a risk free guarantee.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.280
All national underwear month long,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.680
which is the only thing we're allowed to call it now.

35:37.680 --> 35:38.400
No more August.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.120
August is dead.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.600
If you don't love your me undies, they're free.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.800
Me undies are made from linsing micro modal,

35:46.800 --> 35:49.440
a sustainably sourced naturally soft fabric

35:49.440 --> 35:51.680
that's proven to be three times softer than cotton.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.840
Listen, there's other stuff we could talk about

35:53.840 --> 35:57.520
with me undies, but just please just try them

35:57.520 --> 36:00.800
and tell me that you don't think that it is life-changing

36:00.800 --> 36:03.600
comfort and pleasure there down there

36:03.600 --> 36:04.960
because you will not regret it.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.920
You're not going to need to,

36:05.920 --> 36:07.520
I don't care about this guarantee they have.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.080
It's a lie.

36:08.080 --> 36:08.640
You know why?

36:08.640 --> 36:11.200
Because you're never going to do that in a million years.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.720
They're fantastic.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.320
Get those lounge pants.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.400
Those lounge pants are dope as fuck.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.360

36:36.640 --> 36:38.000
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.360
Hey, I want to tell you about Drunks and Dragons.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.280
It's a podcast on iTunes.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.240
You can go to geekly, G-E-E-K-L-Y inc, inc.com

36:50.240 --> 36:52.160
to find out more about this podcast.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.880
It's an actual play, fifth edition D&D campaign

36:54.880 --> 36:57.440
that is filled with unlikely but lovable heroes.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.240
With an expansive back catalog, Drunks and Dragons

37:00.240 --> 37:02.480
follows a group of friends as they try to save the world

37:02.480 --> 37:04.160
without destroying it in the process.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.520
Even though there's a large backlog,

37:05.520 --> 37:06.640
you can jump in any time.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.080
And we even have an abridged version

37:08.080 --> 37:09.680
to help listeners get caught up quick.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.200
Adventure Zone, the first campaign is ending this week.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.480
You're looking for something else?

37:14.480 --> 37:17.760
Another vine to swing to that has all that fifth edition

37:18.560 --> 37:20.640
actual play content that you crave?

37:20.640 --> 37:24.320
It's all geeklyinc.com for the Drunks and Dragons podcast.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.480
I got a message for Nick, and it's from Aaron,

37:26.480 --> 37:27.760
and it says, hey, buddy.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.200
I don't know why I made that sound so sardonic.

37:31.200 --> 37:31.600
I'm sorry.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.880
What's up, you piece of shit?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.440
Hey, dookie lord.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.640
Thanks for being the best paleontologist,

37:38.640 --> 37:40.480
dungeon master, and boyfriend ever.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.280
The brothers and I say, great job, Nick.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.080
Keep up the good work, CRJ.

37:46.080 --> 37:49.440
Also, just a nice Carly Rae Jepsen nod in there

37:49.440 --> 37:51.520
to let Carly know that she's doing a good job.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.320
I love that.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.320
Yeah, I would like it, actually, I would prefer it

37:54.320 --> 37:56.000
if all our messages from now on would be like,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.400
hey, Susan, congratulations on graduating.

37:58.400 --> 38:01.280
You're the best friend that I could ever ask for.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.560
I'll never forget that day we spent

38:02.560 --> 38:05.040
in the big hot air balloon ride.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.120
And Carly, the album is great.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.320
Can't wait for the new one to drop.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.360
Cuts the Feeling is the fucking jam of the summer,

38:11.360 --> 38:12.800
and we're all so grateful for it.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.720
And if it is a taste of things to come in your next LP,

38:17.840 --> 38:19.040
I couldn't be more excited.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.280
Please keep following this exciting direction

38:21.280 --> 38:24.960
for music that is completely redefining the face of pop.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.200
And also, whoever you were at the beginning,

38:27.840 --> 38:29.360
again, congratulations on graduating.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.760
But really, mostly, Carly, thank you for changing me.

38:32.560 --> 38:36.720
You are just the queen of jumbotrons.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.480
Hey, MaxFun fans.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.800
It's me, Jesse, the owner of MaxFun.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.320
I've got a question for you.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.400
Will you help us make our shows better?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.320
We wanted to find a way to find out

38:46.320 --> 38:49.280
what the MaxFun community thinks about our shows.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.560
So we started something called the MaxFun Listener Panel.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.360
Basically, you subscribe to a podcast feed,

38:55.360 --> 38:58.560
and twice a month or so, roughly speaking,

38:58.560 --> 39:00.480
we'll send you an episode of a show

39:00.480 --> 39:03.280
and instructions on how to fill out a quick survey

39:03.280 --> 39:05.280
about what you think about that show.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.320
10 questions, nothing too crazy.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.880
You'll be hearing existing shows

39:10.880 --> 39:13.360
that we're thinking about making changes to,

39:13.360 --> 39:15.920
secret pilots of shows that we're developing

39:15.920 --> 39:17.360
that you'll only hear this way,

39:17.360 --> 39:20.160
shows we're considering adding to the network,

39:20.160 --> 39:24.560
and what you think about them really matters to us.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.800
So to join the panel is easy.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.880
Just go to maximumfun.org slash listener panel.

39:30.880 --> 39:35.120
That's maximumfun.org slash listener panel.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.200
Thanks for helping make MaxFun better.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.480
I have a Yahoo here, and this one is from Seth Carlson.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.040
What do you all think about the delivery man?

39:45.040 --> 39:47.360
Oh, because he's delivering.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.120
I like that because then like one in every thousand times,

39:51.120 --> 39:52.960
he does deliver it to the wrong address,

39:52.960 --> 39:55.440
which I think is still a pretty good hit rate,

39:55.440 --> 39:57.200
all things considered, for sure.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.320
Hey, everybody, this is Radio Lab.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.440
We got a Yahoo.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.640
I don't get it.

40:01.280 --> 40:01.840
Anyway, thank you.

40:01.840 --> 40:02.960
I have to read it.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.160
Thank you, Seth.

40:04.160 --> 40:08.160
It's Yahoo Answers user eatbabyseals.

40:08.160 --> 40:08.800
Damn it.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.600
Damn it.

40:09.600 --> 40:10.480
Damn it.

40:10.480 --> 40:15.040
Says, what's your trademark?

40:15.040 --> 40:16.240
What's your trademark?

40:17.280 --> 40:18.720
What's your trademark?

40:18.720 --> 40:20.000
What's your trademark?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.160
What's your trademark?

40:22.720 --> 40:22.880
No.

40:23.920 --> 40:24.880
What's your trademark?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.040
I thought about this, and it was like,

40:28.160 --> 40:29.920
in high school, there's a kid who did tricks.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.640
He did magic tricks at the table during lunch.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.880
He would always come around and he would do magic tricks.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.520
And he was also, he was very wealthy also.

40:37.520 --> 40:41.440
And so he had a couple trademarks.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.040
I thought it might be fun to just like,

40:43.040 --> 40:44.160
oh, that's Griffin.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.680
He's always got a mint.

40:46.640 --> 40:50.160
He's always got a mint, and he's handing them out if you need them.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.600
One time at church camp, different year than the Andy Mack year,

40:53.600 --> 40:55.520
I always had sunglasses on.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.560
And that could have been like my thing.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.800
This is going to sound like I'm making this up

41:00.800 --> 41:02.080
after talking about Andy Mack,

41:02.080 --> 41:04.960
but I'd wanted people to call me shades,

41:04.960 --> 41:06.720
but I had a youth pastor who was like,

41:06.720 --> 41:09.920
you can't, that'll just happen if it happens.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.520
Andy Mack, I could sneak in a little bit.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.080
Was it Jim?

41:12.080 --> 41:12.880
Jim Moosey?

41:12.880 --> 41:14.240
No, it was a different.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.680
It was out of state.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.600
What's your trademark?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.920
His youth pastor in Canada, you wouldn't know him.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.560
That's Griffin.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.000
He's always got sunglasses on.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.280
He always has a mint.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.040
And so if you're at a party and you have this,

41:25.040 --> 41:26.240
if you have the hot breath,

41:27.040 --> 41:29.360
just look for the guy with sunglasses

41:29.360 --> 41:31.120
because that's his trademark and ask him for a mint

41:31.120 --> 41:32.880
because that's his second trademark.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.080
I love that.

41:34.080 --> 41:36.960
I would like to be Travis,

41:36.960 --> 41:40.000
the guy who always knows where the food trucks have stopped.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I don't know how often that would come up,

41:42.000 --> 41:42.640
but like when it did.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.000
And it's gonna be too difficult.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.760
It's gonna be tough for you to track that.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.280
It's an unrealistic trademark.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.800
I can always have mints.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.800
I can make sure I've always got mints.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.080
I eat a lot of Tic Tacs in my car,

41:52.080 --> 41:53.040
but they're not the mint flavor.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.200
I almost always have like either orange

41:55.200 --> 41:56.960
or the assorted fruit flavored Tic Tacs

41:56.960 --> 41:58.800
and I always have them in one of my cup holders

41:58.800 --> 42:00.240
so I can have myself a little snack

42:00.240 --> 42:02.000
when I have to go and run a chore.

42:02.000 --> 42:02.960
That's kind of a trademark,

42:02.960 --> 42:05.120
but then nobody gets to experience those with me

42:05.120 --> 42:08.720
because nobody ever gets in my car except for baby

42:08.720 --> 42:10.720
and he can't have Tic Tacs, he'd just swallow them.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.680
What's your trademark, Justin and Travis?

42:14.240 --> 42:19.440
I had wanted for a long time for it to be yo-yo.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.080
I wanted to be sort of yo-yo Jay,

42:23.600 --> 42:25.920
the guy who was so good at yo-yo tricks.

42:25.920 --> 42:30.400
And it just, here's the thing about a worthwhile trademark,

42:30.400 --> 42:35.600
like a worthwhile trademark is it really does take,

42:35.600 --> 42:37.440
you gotta put the work in.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.800
You have to put the effort into getting,

42:40.800 --> 42:42.880
because another trademark you could have

42:43.760 --> 42:45.200
is Justin McElroy,

42:45.200 --> 42:48.400
the guy that always publicly fucks up yo-yo tricks.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.560
And that would be a less desirable trademark,

42:50.560 --> 42:53.680
but it would be an effective and I would say pervasive one

42:53.680 --> 42:56.320
that would be pretty pernicious.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.560
It would be tough to shake that one.

42:58.560 --> 43:01.600
My personal trademark,

43:01.600 --> 43:04.640
and I've only just begun implementing this,

43:04.640 --> 43:06.160
is Travis McElroy,

43:06.800 --> 43:09.280
the guy who's a time traveler from the future

43:09.280 --> 43:11.440
stuck in the past trying to get home.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.960
Yeah, because what's great about it is

43:14.960 --> 43:17.360
unlike Justin's yo-yo fantasies,

43:17.360 --> 43:19.840
it actually takes very little work

43:19.840 --> 43:22.080
because I can say anything about the future

43:22.080 --> 43:25.360
with very little research and no one's gonna be like,

43:25.360 --> 43:26.800
that's not what it's like in the future.

43:26.800 --> 43:29.280
And it also makes me interesting

43:29.280 --> 43:30.960
because people really wanna know about the future.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.000
And here's the other thing,

43:34.000 --> 43:34.960
and I know what you're thinking,

43:34.960 --> 43:36.720
but Travis, people already know you.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.840
Yes, of course.

43:37.840 --> 43:42.160
That's why my mythos is my consciousness

43:42.160 --> 43:43.760
traveled back from the future

43:43.760 --> 43:46.080
and inhabited my current present day body.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.920
And I can't figure out how to get my Travis McElroy

43:49.920 --> 43:52.560
consciousness back to the year 2087,

43:53.360 --> 43:55.040
the day I was dying.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.280
Sounds like a lot of work, that trademark.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.640
I could just have a couple of tens of Altoids

44:00.640 --> 44:02.240
on me at all time and that's a trademark,

44:02.240 --> 44:05.200
but yours requires you to pretend to know things from 2087.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.800
But Griffin, how far are your Altoids gonna take you?

44:08.800 --> 44:09.920
It's like, oh, can I have an Altoid?

44:09.920 --> 44:12.960
You can, end of interesting exchange.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.240
But if I talk about like-

44:14.240 --> 44:16.560
Well, then I show them my other trademarks.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.280
I put on my, well, I don't put on the sunglasses.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.520
I've had them on the entire party.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.280
You're starting to sound like a trademark troll

44:23.280 --> 44:25.600
where you just get really broad trademarks.

44:25.600 --> 44:26.880
Oh, let me keep going.

44:27.440 --> 44:27.760
Okay.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.000
I then ask them if they have any weed.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.040
That's my other trademark.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.880
The problem with having a-

44:34.880 --> 44:36.320
And then I jump really high.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.400
It's another trademark of mine is how high I can jump

44:38.400 --> 44:39.360
and people love it.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.200
One issue with having a,

44:41.920 --> 44:44.160
let's say contextually popular podcast

44:44.800 --> 44:48.160
is that it's so hard to try to establish a trademark

44:48.160 --> 44:49.120
for yourself in high school

44:49.760 --> 44:52.560
when I was really thinking about trademarks a lot.

44:52.560 --> 44:57.040
And now sometimes parts of my life just become trademarks

44:57.040 --> 44:59.680
and I don't necessarily need or want or desire.

44:59.680 --> 45:02.880
Like you talk about beans and then on Twitter,

45:03.600 --> 45:06.080
to everybody on Twitter, you become Bean Boy.

45:06.080 --> 45:08.080
And really that's my life I'm living.

45:08.800 --> 45:12.400
I'm living the bean life like day to day

45:12.400 --> 45:15.680
and it's not necessarily something that I want to define

45:16.480 --> 45:17.280
me as a person.

45:17.280 --> 45:20.000
I don't need an additional trademark on those lines.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.560
Please join me in my banana vore corner

45:22.560 --> 45:25.440
and we can hang out here and have a little party together.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.880
I just didn't mean for that to be my bram.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.760
I guess is what I'm worried about.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.920
Well, we don't get to make this call, my boy.

45:31.920 --> 45:35.360
You talk about beans or sexual swallowing

45:35.360 --> 45:37.840
or you eat a banana funny once and it goes viral.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.360
And then that's who you are to folks.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.800
But I've got fucking layers, man.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.120
I've always got fucking mints on me,

45:45.120 --> 45:46.320
but nobody calls me the mint man.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.280
Nobody ever asked me for a mint.

45:47.280 --> 45:51.200
They always want to talk to me about bananas or vore.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.680
They edited out the part of the banana video

45:53.680 --> 45:55.040
where right after Griffin's like,

45:55.920 --> 45:56.800
anybody got a mint?

45:56.800 --> 45:57.760
Just kidding.

45:57.760 --> 45:58.720
I always have them.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.920
I always have them.

46:00.880 --> 46:02.400
I could be Travis McElroy,

46:02.400 --> 46:05.200
the guy who zones out during recording the podcast

46:05.920 --> 46:07.360
because he's scrolling through Facebook

46:07.360 --> 46:09.760
and gets distracted by pictures of Chris Evans.

46:10.320 --> 46:10.880
What do you think?

46:11.520 --> 46:15.680
I am a cashier at a farmer's market in Michigan.

46:15.680 --> 46:19.440
We sell a huge variety of stuff, including fresh shrimp.

46:19.440 --> 46:22.080
Today, a toddler walked by our shrimp cooler and started-

46:22.080 --> 46:28.080
You have to read it, read it, read it, read it.

46:28.080 --> 46:28.480
I can't.

46:28.480 --> 46:31.040
That's the problem with reading a few words ahead

46:31.040 --> 46:33.120
is that sometimes I can mess myself up

46:33.120 --> 46:34.320
while I'm trying to read it good.

46:37.120 --> 46:41.600
We sell a huge variety of stuff, including fresh shrimp.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.000
Today, a toddler walked by our shrimp cooler

46:44.000 --> 46:47.600
and started chanting, shrimp, heaven, now.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.640
Emphasis on the now,

46:50.640 --> 46:52.800
eventually leading his mother to say,

46:52.800 --> 46:57.760
please, please, Daniel, we can't keep doing this.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.120
What is shrimp heaven?

47:11.120 --> 47:13.360
Why does Daniel need it now?

47:13.360 --> 47:15.920
What are my responsibilities in this situation?

47:15.920 --> 47:18.000
If any, I'm confused and delighted

47:18.000 --> 47:21.920
by the slogan eating child.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.880
But I fear something darker may lay under the surface

47:24.880 --> 47:27.840
that's from shrimp Jesus will return.

47:29.840 --> 47:31.200
All right, let's take a-

47:31.200 --> 47:33.280
Shrimp heaven now.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.000
Let's all take a minute and collect ourselves

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
and appreciate how good this child is

47:38.560 --> 47:39.920
and how good this situation is.

47:39.920 --> 47:44.320
All right.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.560
There's just no reality in which,

47:48.080 --> 47:51.760
like, talk about trademarking.

47:51.760 --> 47:54.400
This kid went for a narrow line on it,

47:54.400 --> 47:56.240
but I do celebrate it.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.240
That is a great trademark.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.360
Shrimp heaven now.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.440
Okay, I'm back.

48:07.440 --> 48:11.280
I like the idea of like, he's trying to say,

48:11.280 --> 48:14.000
like, let me get all up in shrimp heaven right now.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.120
That's what it's gotta be, right?

48:15.120 --> 48:16.880
This is not a religious child.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.160
I have to imagine.

48:18.800 --> 48:19.520
Here's the thing.

48:20.880 --> 48:24.080
What I would like to believe is that this kid

48:25.280 --> 48:28.000
is just crazy for shrimp.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.200
Just loves those prawny bastards.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.240
Wild for this stuff.

48:32.960 --> 48:36.560
So much so that it has led his parents

48:36.560 --> 48:39.840
to say things like, please, Daniel,

48:39.840 --> 48:41.840
we can't keep doing this

48:41.840 --> 48:44.080
because this child's shrimp hunger

48:44.080 --> 48:46.320
is driving them out of house and home.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.360
It's an expensive protein.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.360
It's a lot of work to prepare one.

48:52.320 --> 48:55.360
Fresh shrimp, not precooked, not boiled shrimp.

48:55.360 --> 48:56.720
Just fresh shrimp.

48:56.720 --> 48:57.840
And it's all Daniel's.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
And they got those dookie veins in them still

48:59.840 --> 49:01.920
and that takes a while to get those out of there.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.360
No, Daniel loves it all.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.080
They go to remove the mud vein

49:06.080 --> 49:08.240
and Daniel's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.840
God doesn't make any mistakes.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.440
That's part of the shrimp, Monferric.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.520
Why don't you leave that in there for Daniel?

49:13.520 --> 49:14.960
Let Daniel handle that for you.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.320
Shrimp heaven now.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.160
Do you think this kid burned down a red lobster?

49:20.160 --> 49:21.920
Definitely, definitely.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.440
Or did something in a red lobster

49:23.440 --> 49:24.880
that required it to be burned down?

49:25.520 --> 49:27.760
And now he has to facilitate the shepherding

49:27.760 --> 49:29.520
of these shrimp souls to heaven.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.480
That's possible too.

49:30.480 --> 49:31.360
To free himself from his own burden.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.240
To get the shrimp up to heaven by eating them.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.960
How, if you saw that exchange,

49:37.600 --> 49:39.520
how do you not just leave your job?

49:40.240 --> 49:42.000
How do you not just stand up, walk out,

49:42.000 --> 49:43.440
and follow these people and be like,

49:43.440 --> 49:46.800
listen, I have to get to the end of this story.

49:46.800 --> 49:49.200
I have to hear the rest of shrimp heaven now.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.240
What is Daniel doing?

49:50.800 --> 49:53.840
I've made six episodes of a television show.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.360
Now on vrv.co, go check it out.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.560
I've made six episodes of television show

50:00.560 --> 50:01.520
and I don't think I'm like,

50:01.520 --> 50:04.480
you know, especially tuned in

50:04.480 --> 50:06.160
to what Hollywood wants or needs.

50:06.160 --> 50:08.160
But I'm pretty sure I could make a television show

50:08.160 --> 50:10.080
about your child, about shrimp.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.080
And the name of the show would be called Shrimp Heaven Now.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.120
And I guess it'd be a shrimp review television.

50:15.120 --> 50:16.320
We'll figure that out later.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.280
But we got the title, we got the heat.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.560
Get Kristen Bell in there.

50:18.560 --> 50:22.880
And that plus Shrimp Heaven Now equals Emmy success.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.040
All the Emmys and some Golden Globes to boot.

50:27.040 --> 50:31.840
We haven't had a My Brother, My Brother, Me t-shirt

50:31.840 --> 50:36.800
available on Tipotico for quite a while.

50:37.440 --> 50:39.680
And I feel like maybe this is the one.

50:39.680 --> 50:43.600
I feel like this is a new era for this show.

50:43.600 --> 50:46.400
And I feel like a t-shirt that just says Shrimp Heaven Now

50:47.040 --> 50:50.160
would be extremely, extremely powerful.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.440
Do you remember those that?

50:52.400 --> 50:55.200
Do you remember the like Peace Loving Crabs t-shirt?

50:55.200 --> 50:57.440
I think it was Joe's Crab Shack, right?

50:57.440 --> 50:59.920
What if we just had a shirt that was like a shrimp,

50:59.920 --> 51:01.760
an angel and a clock?

51:01.760 --> 51:03.680
And it's like, everyone knows.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.280
The other way we do it is just the black t-shirt

51:05.280 --> 51:08.720
with the white words all on the same like paragraph break.

51:08.720 --> 51:11.520
That's, you know, and it's like shrimp and heaven and now.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.840
Or we could also do Keep Calm and Shrimp Heaven Now.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.360
That one's really good also.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.120
I think we have a lot of opportunity here

51:17.120 --> 51:18.160
for Shrimp Heaven Now.

51:18.160 --> 51:19.760
And I think we may have found a trademark

51:19.760 --> 51:21.840
that I will take from this child.

51:21.840 --> 51:25.440
We could have one that say Big Dog Shrimp Heaven Now.

51:25.440 --> 51:29.200
That one's got no fear for Shrimp Heaven Now.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.280
Hyper color sort of.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.400
Hyper color shrimp, yeah.

51:32.400 --> 51:36.160
Maybe a lizard with sunglasses, an old lizard.

51:38.880 --> 51:41.760
I can't believe how good this is.

51:41.760 --> 51:46.160
It's renewing my entire faith in humanity.

51:46.160 --> 51:50.880
Shrimp Heaven Now, but Shrimp Heaven Now by itself

51:50.880 --> 51:52.080
is very good.

51:52.080 --> 51:54.640
I mean, we can all agree that Shrimp Heaven Now

51:54.640 --> 51:55.840
is excellent and beautiful,

51:55.840 --> 52:02.400
but the fact that we can't keep doing it with Daniel

52:02.400 --> 52:04.560
is what really brings it over the limit

52:04.560 --> 52:07.600
because that could have been a one-off.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.520
You know, kids say the darkest things

52:09.520 --> 52:11.200
is one thing that I have made up.

52:11.760 --> 52:16.400
And, you know, he could have just spouted

52:16.400 --> 52:17.360
whatever came to his head.

52:17.360 --> 52:20.800
No, this is a recurring theme for Daniel.

52:20.800 --> 52:21.920
It's Shrimp Heaven Now.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.200
I think that there's a lesson in that, though.

52:25.200 --> 52:26.800
I obviously love Shrimp Heaven Now.

52:26.800 --> 52:29.040
No three words have ever been more perfectly suited

52:29.040 --> 52:31.920
for each other, but there's a limit.

52:32.480 --> 52:34.720
There's a limit to it before it could be exhausted,

52:34.720 --> 52:35.840
as is evidenced by the fact that,

52:35.840 --> 52:37.760
hey, everybody, Shrimp Heaven Now,

52:39.200 --> 52:40.560
it's losing something, isn't it?

52:41.120 --> 52:43.040
I almost feel like, let's call the episode, I feel like,

52:43.040 --> 52:44.880
because we're going to keep saying Shrimp Heaven Now

52:44.880 --> 52:46.720
and I don't want to rob it of its power.

52:46.720 --> 52:48.400
Let's go five or six episodes

52:48.400 --> 52:50.160
and then really drop a Shrimp Heaven Now in

52:50.160 --> 52:52.080
and then it'll be like a fun, fun callback.

52:52.080 --> 52:56.400
To that point, I think we do need to qualify the t-shirt.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.480
So in big bold letters, Shrimp Heaven Now,

52:58.480 --> 52:59.840
and then in a smaller subtitle,

52:59.840 --> 53:01.440
we can't keep doing this,

53:01.440 --> 53:03.200
but just like acknowledges like,

53:03.200 --> 53:05.680
we know that this is like,

53:05.680 --> 53:09.840
this is a brief moment in time of viral t-shirt marketing

53:10.480 --> 53:12.880
of shrimp heavy advertising.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.560
I was thinking it would be the title of this episode, right?

53:14.560 --> 53:15.280
Shrimp Heaven Now.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.320
It's a good episode title.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.440
Please don't tweet at us and each other,

53:19.440 --> 53:20.560
Shrimp Heaven Now.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.720
I'm going to do a Twitter search tomorrow

53:22.720 --> 53:24.960
for Shrimp Heaven Now and any results I get,

53:24.960 --> 53:26.080
I'm going to be very disappointed.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.200
We got to protect this.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.480
We got to protect this.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.880
Yes, well, I'm tired of us burning through things

53:33.840 --> 53:34.560
so quickly.

53:34.560 --> 53:37.600
We have to sort of hoard this resource

53:37.600 --> 53:39.760
of Shrimp Heaven Now being funny.

53:39.760 --> 53:43.360
Let's do a slow burn, like I Love Bees kind of slow burn

53:43.360 --> 53:46.640
and like, you can tweet Shrimp Heaven Win

53:46.640 --> 53:49.760
with a question mark for like the next two months, right?

53:49.760 --> 53:51.280
You can tweet that whenever you want.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.280
Or, here's what I want.

53:53.280 --> 53:57.120
I want everybody to just tweet either Shrimp or Heaven or Now,

53:57.120 --> 53:59.840
just one word, but not the whole thing.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.680
And then people can put it together.

54:01.680 --> 54:02.960
And you can make it private.

54:02.960 --> 54:05.760
Like if you want to use ShrimpHeavenNow.com

54:05.760 --> 54:07.440
to access our podcast,

54:07.440 --> 54:09.200
you definitely can do that.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.760
That's an option that's available to you for sure.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.000
But like, you don't need to go run in your mouth about it.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.160
But when that t-shirt does become available

54:18.160 --> 54:21.520
and like, I'm on it, like we're doing it,

54:22.240 --> 54:23.760
you can get it at that URL.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.920
So if you're listening to this in the past or the future,

54:26.960 --> 54:27.920
Travis, what is it?

54:28.960 --> 54:30.320
Well, Justin, it's hard for me to say

54:30.320 --> 54:32.720
without giving away too much information

54:32.720 --> 54:34.880
that could damage the time stream.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.560
Okay, that's a really good trademark actually.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.200
Because there's fear, there's a fear in it.

54:39.920 --> 54:40.800
I love that.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.280
That's going to do it for us folks on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.040
We alluded to this earlier.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.000
Well, we didn't allude so much

54:46.000 --> 54:47.840
as give you a fucking URL to visit.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.600
We said it eight times before.

54:51.120 --> 54:53.280
Our show got sold by CISO.

54:53.280 --> 54:54.320
Rest in peace, CISO.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.440
Shutting down this year.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.480
According to reports,

54:58.480 --> 55:00.000
we don't have any insider information there.

55:00.000 --> 55:00.960
But the point is,

55:01.520 --> 55:07.360
our show can now be found at vrv.co forward slash mbmbam.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.640
Now here's the cool stuff.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.560
Now make sure you don't go to vrv.com.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.840
That's not going to get you anything.

55:13.840 --> 55:19.760
But vrv.co slash mbmbam is going to give you our show for free.

55:20.560 --> 55:21.520
It's ad supported.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.880
There'll be ads, but you can just watch the show.

55:24.880 --> 55:26.160
And not just the show,

55:26.160 --> 55:29.440
you can watch all the bonus materials.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.360
There's one that's like one of my favorite things that we shot

55:31.360 --> 55:34.400
where we're all bugging the mayor about Candle Nights

55:34.400 --> 55:35.040
that didn't make it to the show.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.480
Shit, that's a good, yeah.

55:36.480 --> 55:38.400
But it's really, I love that.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.960
I want to point out it's just in America right now.

55:40.960 --> 55:41.680
The US.

55:41.680 --> 55:45.760
The places where it was available on iTunes, it's still there.

55:46.320 --> 55:50.080
But it's not on Verve anywhere else.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.320
And I hope that that changes.

55:52.320 --> 55:54.320
But as we've said so many times before,

55:54.320 --> 55:57.040
that is not a decision that we make at all.

55:57.840 --> 55:58.800
In any way, shape, or form.

55:58.800 --> 55:59.040
Yeah.

55:59.040 --> 56:00.720
But I also want to say,

56:02.320 --> 56:04.720
this upcoming JoCo Cruise,

56:05.840 --> 56:07.680
my wife and I will be there.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.200
We'll be doing some Shmander stuff.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.800
And probably classes and appearing on other people's things.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.640
And there's still a few cabins available.

56:14.640 --> 56:19.280
So if you'd like to join us, go to JoCoCruise.com

56:19.280 --> 56:20.000
and check that out.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.920
And I also do want to say, as Griffin mentioned,

56:22.720 --> 56:25.920
we will be putting out the ultimate,

56:25.920 --> 56:31.040
the final episode of the Adventure Zone balance arc.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.720
Adventure Zone will be continuing.

56:33.360 --> 56:34.560
Don't get it twisted.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.640
This is just the ending of this storyline.

56:36.640 --> 56:39.120
And if you have never listened before,

56:39.760 --> 56:42.640
it's maybe one of the top five things

56:42.640 --> 56:44.560
I'm most proud of in my entire life.

56:44.560 --> 56:46.160
Especially, I would say,

56:46.160 --> 56:48.320
due in large part to the work that Griffin does.

56:49.600 --> 56:51.120
He's an amazing DM and writer.

56:51.760 --> 56:53.360
And so if you've never checked it out,

56:53.360 --> 56:55.840
you have four days that you could just like-

56:56.400 --> 56:57.760
Please don't just listen to the finale.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.600
You will not enjoy it, I don't think at all.

56:59.600 --> 57:01.920
But start at the beginning, listen straight through.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.360
And it'll be there even if you're not ready by Thursday.

57:05.360 --> 57:07.200
That's how podcasts work, Travis.

57:07.200 --> 57:10.240
It's now informing you how on-demand content functions.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.640
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

57:12.640 --> 57:13.520
for these four theme songs.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.360
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.040
It's a really, really, really good album,

57:17.040 --> 57:18.640
as are all the Long Winters albums.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.320
You should go listen to all of them.

57:20.320 --> 57:22.320
And speaking of going and listening to things,

57:22.320 --> 57:25.440
go listen to all the other amazing shows on MaximumFun.org.

57:25.440 --> 57:28.240
There's a ton on there that fit a bunch of different genres

57:28.240 --> 57:31.280
and styles and tastes and interests.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.720
You're going to find something you like,

57:32.720 --> 57:34.320
but probably a bunch of stuff you like.

57:34.320 --> 57:36.640
So go check it out, MaximumFun.org.

57:38.400 --> 57:41.200
Here's a final, sent in by the delivery man,

57:41.200 --> 57:42.080
Seth Carlson, thank you.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.680
It's Yahoo Answers user Matt asks.

57:45.680 --> 57:46.560
And I'm going to read the whole thing

57:46.560 --> 57:48.160
because the additional details are fucking great.

57:48.960 --> 57:50.800
Will there be a Zootopia 2?

57:51.440 --> 57:53.520
In the first film, they only had mammals,

57:53.520 --> 57:56.400
not birds, reptiles, or bugs, not even tapirs.

57:56.400 --> 57:59.360
I love tapirs and would love to see one or two in a sequel.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.760
I admire the tapirs in the Ice Age films.

58:01.760 --> 58:05.760
Oh, my name is Justin McElroy.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.280
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:07.280 --> 58:08.320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.240
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

58:10.240 --> 58:13.600
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

58:13.600 --> 58:37.280
The three of you went to a cave of a big red dragon

58:37.280 --> 58:40.960
and is standing over a hoard of precious golden rubies.

58:40.960 --> 58:43.200
And he says, what do you do, adventurers?

58:43.200 --> 58:44.400
I'm a dragon man.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.280
I cast fire on him.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.160
It's very good.

58:46.160 --> 58:48.080
I address the red dragon and say,

58:48.080 --> 58:50.160
us, we're the hosts of The Adventure Zone,

58:50.160 --> 58:53.360
a podcast about family playing Dungeons and Dragons.

58:53.360 --> 58:54.480
Very good synergy.

58:54.480 --> 58:55.280
Commit to the bit.

58:56.720 --> 58:58.880
I roll to charm new listeners.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.760
It is very effective against all odds.

59:01.760 --> 59:02.720
Everybody, we're the McElroys.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.680
We host The Adventure Zone,

59:03.680 --> 59:05.760
it's a podcast where we play Dungeons and Dragons together.

59:05.760 --> 59:07.120
It's a comedy podcast.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.480
We don't take the rules too seriously

59:08.480 --> 59:09.520
because there's a lot of them

59:09.520 --> 59:10.800
and we did not take the time to learn them.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.520
Maybe listen to us.

59:11.520 --> 59:14.160
We come out every other Thursday on the Maximum Fun Network.

59:14.160 --> 59:16.880
You can find us on iTunes or on MaximumFun.org.

59:16.880 --> 59:45.440
I think this promo is a critical hit.
