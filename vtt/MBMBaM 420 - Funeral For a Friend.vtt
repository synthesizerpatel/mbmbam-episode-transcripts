WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.720
Isn't it rich?

00:29.720 --> 00:34.760
Are we a pair?

00:34.760 --> 00:43.760
Me here at last on the ground and you in midair.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.360
Where are the clouds?

00:48.360 --> 01:02.280
Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve?

01:02.280 --> 01:11.160
One who keeps staring around and one who can't move.

01:11.160 --> 01:15.560
Where are the clouds?

01:15.560 --> 01:20.720
There ought to be clouds.

01:20.720 --> 01:28.640
Just when I stopped opening doors.

01:28.640 --> 01:36.440
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.

01:36.440 --> 01:44.840
Making my entrance again with my usual flair.

01:44.840 --> 01:54.920
Sure of my lies, no one is there.

01:54.920 --> 02:05.880
Don't you love a farce?

02:05.880 --> 02:11.280
It's my fault I fear.

02:11.280 --> 02:20.320
I thought that you wanted me to have a voice, I'm sorry, my dear.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.320
Where are the clouds?

02:25.320 --> 02:30.320
Sending the clouds.

02:30.320 --> 02:34.320
Don't bother.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.320
They are here.

02:39.320 --> 02:55.320
Isn't it rich?

02:55.320 --> 02:59.320
Is the corpse one of the clowns?

02:59.320 --> 03:03.320
Is that what he's saying?

03:03.320 --> 03:12.320
Losing my timing this late in my career.

03:12.320 --> 03:17.320
Where are the clouds?

03:17.320 --> 03:24.320
There ought to be clouds.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.320
Well, maybe.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.320
Oh?

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
Next year.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.320
Oh.

03:31.320 --> 03:36.320
Well, you got me so excited for clowns.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.320
And it's always next year with the songs.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Yeah.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.320
And here they are.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
Enjoy.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
All right.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.320
Now, this is never a note I've given someone after a funeral, Justin.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
Kind of milking it.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.320
Kind of milking it.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.320
Making a real meal out of it.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.320
Good note.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.320
Good note.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.320
Thank you.

03:55.320 --> 04:05.320
And welcome, everyone, to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era, episode 420, Funeral for a Fiend.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.320
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

04:08.320 --> 04:14.320
I'm Travis Big Dog Wolf Wolf McElroy, and just quick note, it's his friend there, Justin, Funeral for a Fiend.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.320
My mistake.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.320
That's my mistake.

04:19.320 --> 04:24.320
I'm looking at the, this is Griffin, I'm looking now at the website.

04:24.320 --> 04:34.320
And I'm reading some things that people have written about, let's just say, current events that aren't in the best taste.

04:34.320 --> 04:42.320
And so I'm over here like, let me dunk on them like a brave internet warrior, and I go to click the answer button.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.320
Let me do it again and again.

04:44.320 --> 04:55.320
Yeah, it's grayed out because that function is no longer available to us as of today, April the 20th, the funny weed day.

04:55.320 --> 05:00.320
But there's nothing funny today because I can't answer on Yahoo Answers.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.320
So what is it now?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320
Is it just Yahoo Readums?

05:03.320 --> 05:09.320
Nobody can smoke any of their weed today because it's all soaked with tears.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.320
It won't light.

05:11.320 --> 05:18.320
A lot of people have wanted us to do this episode for a long time, and we've told them there's nothing very funny about weed.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.320
This website does suck though.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.320
I just logged on to the one that Griffin's prompting.

05:25.320 --> 05:30.320
I was about to get pretty maudlin, and then I just logged onto the front page.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.320
It's a bad website that will not be this.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.320
I've never gone to Yahoo Answers in all this time.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.320
Don't start now, baby.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.320
Maybe check it out in like 2011.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.320
But if I don't start now, Justin, when would I start?

05:44.320 --> 05:45.320
Okay, let's see.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.320
Answers.yahoo.com, read-only mode.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.320
This is not an endorsement.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
I wouldn't.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.320
It's not a great time.

05:52.320 --> 06:01.320
It's a lot of people who are like, let me get all up on and be the last one to turn the light out and say the worst shit so that it'll be sort of the epitaph.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.320
This episode is the epitaph for Yahoo Answers.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
Yeah.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.320
We've done the media.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.320
We've been doing media about it.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.320
I wrote a piece for Esquire about it.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.320
I went on to ABC News Radio.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.320
Yes, I went on to ABC News Radio.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.320
There was a New York Times piece that talked to me about it.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.320
I wrote a feature for Le Monde, but you probably didn't read that because it was French.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.320
Do you read Le Monde?

06:26.320 --> 06:35.320
And this 15-year-old website's dead, and I've been in a genuine stupor since the news hit.

06:35.320 --> 06:40.320
My son was born, and then a day later, my website died.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.320
Oh, so I see what you're saying, Griffin.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.320
He's the reincarnation of Yahoo Answers.

06:44.320 --> 06:52.320
If it had been flipped one day, it would have been so – like, the soul would have left Yahoo Answers and inhabited the son, but that's not possible.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.320
Well, Chelsea, everyone knows that babies don't get souls until their second day.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
Come on, dude.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
Yeah, that's true.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
That's fine.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
Oh, boy.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.320
So we're just – I guess we're just free-forming it.

07:03.320 --> 07:09.320
It's a tragic thing for – I mean, for us, because the content –

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
For us.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.320
The content will be more difficult to produce, categorically.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.320
This was half the show.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.320
On a good day, half the show.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.320
Yeah.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.320
And some might say the good half.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
Good half of it.

07:24.320 --> 07:28.320
No, you know, we'll find a way to patch this quilt together.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.320
I want to say – let's take it all the way back to the beginning of this relationship,

07:32.320 --> 07:38.320
because when we started My Brother, My Brother and Me, it was April of 2010, so it's been –

07:38.320 --> 07:39.320
Right.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.320
11.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.320
11 years, almost exactly.

07:43.320 --> 07:47.320
And we didn't even note that particular anniversary.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.320
Such a wild time it's been.

07:49.320 --> 07:58.320
But it was April 2010, and I had hosted the Joystick Podcast before this, and we had a nice following of great people from that,

07:58.320 --> 08:06.320
but we were worried it wouldn't be enough to have a consistent base of questions for our advice show that we had cooked up.

08:06.320 --> 08:13.320
So I think it was Griffin hit on the idea of including answering questions from Yahoo Answers to give advice to those people.

08:13.320 --> 08:22.320
And it has been pretty much a consistent split between Yahoo and our listeners since the beginning, since the jump.

08:22.320 --> 08:28.320
It has been there with us through different hosts.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.320
It's been there with us through different music.

08:30.320 --> 08:37.320
It's been there with us through different cities that we've lived in, through live shows and at-home recordings.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
Yeah.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.320
Through all three Travis's.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.320
Yeah, all the Travis's.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.320
Yeah, they keep dying.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.320
Well, what are you going to do, you know?

08:45.320 --> 08:50.320
Well, just stop the lifestyle that you're –

08:50.320 --> 08:59.320
I did just want to say I was reading the Wiki page for Yahoo Answers, which date of birth, June 28, 2005.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.320
And it's in so many different languages.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.320
I didn't even know that.

09:04.320 --> 09:09.320
And it says dissolved for May 2021 in 13 days' time, it says.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.320
So now Wikipedia has a death clock.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.320
But the thing that really hit me is down under in popular media.

09:16.320 --> 09:25.320
It says the comedy advice podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me features a recurring segment in which co-host Griffin McElroy selects and reads a particularly humorous or outrageous question from Yahoo Answers.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.320
The hosts then discuss and attempt to answer the question to comedic effect.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.320
First of all, thank you, Wikipedia.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.320
Second of all, there's a link here.

09:32.320 --> 09:39.320
And you know how it has like the numeric references at the bottom of the page of the Wikipedia article?

09:39.320 --> 09:45.320
The sentence here, we have the 69th reference link here.

09:45.320 --> 09:53.320
And it's just – it's not like God's real and he's here in Yahoo Answers.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.320
And that's Wikipedia page I guess is all I'm trying to say.

09:56.320 --> 10:10.320
Can I just say that I think that even beyond content, I think we owe a certain life debt to Yahoo Answers for unlocking within the three of us our shared love of both ghosts and horses.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.320
Yeah, sure.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.320
I think we never would have come to that if it weren't for Yahoo Answers.

10:16.320 --> 10:25.320
So we're trying to find a way to fill in this hole in our heart, which is bad to have in your heart.

10:25.320 --> 10:41.320
Like I've talked to doctors about it because I felt like a literal hole has been punched in my heart by the evil corporate guys at Yahoo or whatever sort of corporate company owns Yahoo at this point.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
I haven't followed it very closely.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.320
It was pretty mean of them to make this decision just to hurt you, Griffin.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
I'm sorry about that.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.320
It sucks.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
I don't know why they –

10:48.320 --> 10:55.320
Yeah, and really robbed me of all the joy of my new baby, but that's something I'm working – that's my cross to bear, right?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.320
They probably didn't know that.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.320
Do you regret naming your baby Yahoo Junior now?

11:00.320 --> 11:06.320
I regret naming him Yahoo Answers forever jokes because it wasn't true.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.320
We got 15 years.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.320
I got a Yahoo.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
I got a Yahoo for you.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
What?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
Do you?

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
Yeah, I've always wanted to try it.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Oh, sure, sure.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
I've always wanted to try one.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
Yeah.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.320
This is going to be my last chance.

11:20.320 --> 11:26.320
Yahoo Answers is shutting down today as we're recording this, 4-20.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.320
Not shutting down.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.320
Shutting down.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
It's no longer accepting new.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.320
Read only.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.320
Read only.

11:31.320 --> 11:38.320
I do not understand the period where you're like, I just need a little while to soak it in before you pull the plug.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.320
Yeah.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.320
Reading is one of my top two favorite things to do on Yahoo Answers.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.320
But this was posted two days ago.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.320
Yeah.

11:45.320 --> 11:49.320
Does anyone know what's going on with legendary actor Danny Glover?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.320
I haven't heard anything about him in a while.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.320
I'm getting kind of worried.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.320
Yeah, I don't know.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.320
I don't know Yahoo.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.320
And you know what sucks?

11:57.320 --> 11:58.320
You know what sucks, guys?

11:58.320 --> 11:59.320
What?

11:59.320 --> 12:00.320
I'll fucking never know.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
Yeah.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
You'll never know.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.320
Where am I supposed to get that from?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Do you know what I mean?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
Yeah.

12:08.320 --> 12:14.320
The first answer is there are no legends that I'm aware of that make mention of Danny Glover.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.320
Well, bullshit.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.320
That's not true.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.320
Second answer, Google his name.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.320
And while you're at it, Google Mel Gibson, too.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.320
Haven't heard anything about him for a while.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.320
That's actually fine.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.320
That's all fine.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.320
We're okay with that.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
Yeah.

12:28.320 --> 12:32.320
And then lastly, from question mark, he's still filming movies.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.320
Okay.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.320
All right.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.320
But see, that's what I'm saying.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.320
See what we're going to lose out on.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.320
No more of this?

12:37.320 --> 12:42.320
Question mark like Indiana Jones reached in under the closing door.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
Yeah.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.320
He saw the hat of truth there and was like, he's still in movies.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.320
He grabbed it and then it slammed behind him.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.320
And there's no more.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.320
Where are we supposed to get answers from?

12:53.320 --> 12:54.320
Do you know what I mean?

12:54.320 --> 12:55.320
Yeah.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
Yeah.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.320
Like when you get it from Google, it's like a-

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
It's cold and heartless.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.320
It's a robot giving it to you.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
Yeah.

13:02.320 --> 13:07.320
A robot, not only a robot, a robot looks at some of the different answers and then picks

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
the best, most relevant-

13:08.320 --> 13:09.320
Picks the one it likes best.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.320
Thanks, robot.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
Yeah.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.320
No, thank you.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.320
If I wanted actual information, I'd go to the fucking library.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.320
Right.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.320
Exactly.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.320
Exactly.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.320
Pull out the Encyclopedia Britannica.

13:20.320 --> 13:26.840
I want the human connection that Yahoo- I felt closer to the Yahoo Answers user than I

13:26.840 --> 13:28.320
do to my own children.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.320
Yeah.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.320
I met my wife on Yahoo Answers.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.320
A lot of people don't know that.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.320
Yeah.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
It's true.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
I've been staring.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.320
Griffin asked, who am I going to marry?

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
And Yahoo said, Rachel.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.320
Yeah.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.320
I've looked at this website for many years.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.320
Many, many years.

13:41.320 --> 13:48.800
I'm just now kind of looking at it, and we have some Yahoo warriors that have been knee-deep

13:48.800 --> 13:49.800
in here.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
Yeah.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
Sure.

13:51.800 --> 13:57.940
And seeing the content on this website, I am at this point having a bad feeling that

13:57.940 --> 13:59.880
we should not have let people do that.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.880
You know what I mean?

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
No.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:03.280 --> 14:08.240
We shouldn't have let people spend that much time down in the mines, as it were.

14:08.240 --> 14:16.000
But now, first of all, they did a tremendous service, and my Yahoo warriors are very precious

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
to me.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Precious.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Precious people.

14:19.000 --> 14:27.600
But also, they are broken now, and they're walking out of so many Chilean miners coming

14:27.600 --> 14:28.680
out of the shaft.

14:28.680 --> 14:34.920
Only they've been down there for 11 years, and they don't know how to live a normal

14:34.920 --> 14:35.920
life anymore.

14:35.920 --> 14:40.760
They're going to be the people in the Western who are like, people don't sling guns anymore.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.280
I don't know what to do with myself.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.200
I guess I'll buy eight cows and live a quiet life, and they're like, we've got one more

14:46.200 --> 14:48.520
Yahoo answer that needs taking care of.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.520
No, but they don't.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.520
They don't miss.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.520
That's the thing.

14:51.520 --> 14:58.160
The problem is, what is happening to our Yahoo Answers warriors now is that they are so hurt,

14:58.160 --> 15:03.880
let's be honest, by their service, and yet, when the website is gone, they'll still be

15:03.880 --> 15:05.640
chasing that hide.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
That's what I'm worried about.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.760
Where are they going to turn to now?

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
Quora?

15:09.760 --> 15:14.200
People keep saying Quora.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.440
Everybody listen to this.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.760
Everybody listen with your listening ears right now.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.320
Hey, guys, I've got a Quora here.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.200
That's fucking nothing.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.200
It's nothing.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.200
No.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.200
It's nothing.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.520
And there's probably some good stuff on there.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.280
We just have to find a new name for the segment.

15:33.280 --> 15:37.400
It's not a replacement, and it kind of is insulting that you would say that, Travis.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
Yeah.

15:38.400 --> 15:43.320
No, I'm not saying I'm worried that that's where they'll turn to get their cats.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.320
To get their eye.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.320
Yeah.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.320
Yeah.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.320
There's also some other problems with Quora, which I've never visited but am now.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
There's ads on it.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.320
What?

15:52.320 --> 15:53.520
You guys are trying to make money?

15:53.520 --> 15:54.520
Where's the purity?

15:54.520 --> 15:55.520
You know what I mean?

15:55.520 --> 16:00.800
Yahoo Answers was so smart in that they never made any money off of it at all.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.800
Never monetized.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.800
Exactly.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Yeah.

16:03.800 --> 16:09.200
So, like, when somebody asks a question like, how are NBA ratings since having gone woke?

16:09.200 --> 16:17.240
Like, I know that business and corporation, it won't put its finger on the scale.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.280
Do you know what I mean?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.280
Yep.

16:20.280 --> 16:30.200
I do have a concept for how we can keep the torch, the torches of Gondor lit just a little

16:30.200 --> 16:35.160
bit longer, and it's not a forever solution for this.

16:35.160 --> 16:42.000
That will only happen when we've raised the capital to buy the Yahoo Answers service.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.880
I don't think they're going to give it to us piecemeal, so we will need to also raise

16:44.880 --> 16:52.480
the capital to buy Yahoo, which is not out of the question, but I have a little temporary

16:52.480 --> 16:53.960
solve for this.

16:53.960 --> 16:54.960
Okay.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.200
And I'm curious what you hear about it.

16:56.200 --> 17:06.720
There is a trove of good Yahoos that we have not discussed at all.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.600
In fact, there's over 500 of them.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
Wow.

17:10.600 --> 17:15.440
And it's a segment, I don't have a name for the segment yet.

17:15.440 --> 17:21.880
Maybe it's like coming out of the slow cooker, pop them out the crock pot, because now we've

17:21.880 --> 17:28.840
had, for some of these bad boys, 11 years to ruminate on them.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.080
What is the source of these, Griffin?

17:31.080 --> 17:38.880
I'm saying we return to, as we've promised, the final Yahoo Answers.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
Oh my god.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.880
Are you-

17:40.880 --> 17:43.160
Oh, so these are the final Yahoo Answers.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.220
Oh shit.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.440
Maybe that's it.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.960
The final- and when these are done, we can do the- we are now at the halfway point of

17:49.960 --> 17:57.000
my brother and my brother and me, because once we've run out of Yahoos in the past,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
then that's it.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.880
But if we do one in app, and we just go back and we check back in-

18:01.880 --> 18:04.560
We're at like 5.56 right now.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.600
That's roughly 5.55 Yahoo Answers.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.280
I think we've missed one or two.

18:09.280 --> 18:14.240
And I guess there's probably 100 or so on there that we wouldn't feel great about revisiting

18:14.240 --> 18:18.900
at this point in our lives and careers, if I can guess.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.160
Can we demo this?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.160
Can we sample this?

18:21.160 --> 18:23.240
Because I've pulled a few here.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.840
And I don't know if we-

18:24.840 --> 18:25.840
How far back you gone?

18:25.840 --> 18:26.840
Yeah, are you on sequential?

18:26.840 --> 18:27.840
Or are you-

18:27.840 --> 18:33.200
Well, for this demo, right now I got the box in demo mode, because I pulled up like 20

18:33.200 --> 18:34.200
from the whole span of the thing.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.360
Oh, so we'll only hear like the first 30 seconds?

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
Right.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.320
And it'll be like a Yahoo, Yahoo, Yahoo, Yahoo.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.320
Exactly.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.720
The audio word mark.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.400
Just to sample it, right?

18:47.400 --> 18:52.240
Here's one, and this is from episode, let's see.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.240
Episode 55.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.240
That's spaghetti-

18:54.240 --> 18:55.240
Spaghetti-getting.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.240
Spaghetti-getting.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.240
Yeah.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.240
The final Yahoo on that one.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.320
I'm bored.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.420
What do you do for fun?

19:00.420 --> 19:03.880
It is raining out also, and I am an old man.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.880
I feel like we can have fun.

19:04.880 --> 19:05.880
Do you know what I mean?

19:05.880 --> 19:06.880
Still good.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.400
We got that laugh.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.960
That laugh we just got of, what a funny thing.

19:10.960 --> 19:11.960
We got that.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
I don't want to milk that again.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.120
We didn't have the courage at that point to say like, well, hold on, let's answer.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.120
Well, hold on.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.320
What does an old man do on a rainy day?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.320
To have fun.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.320
Not just what does he do?

19:21.320 --> 19:28.680
Because he can't do something sort of challenging or sort of artistically rewarding that's not

19:28.680 --> 19:30.520
particularly fun.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.760
He wants to have fun on a rainy day.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.240
He could re-watch The Mandalorian.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
Yeah.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
That's true.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.240
Yeah.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.240
That's good.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.780
I mean, this question was asked in 2011, so well before The Mandalorian came out.

19:42.780 --> 19:47.360
Now we have the wisdom to say, hey, old man, Disney Plus is here, and it's got all the

19:47.360 --> 19:50.480
great content that you crave, like the Falcon and the Winterman.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.880
And it's got Mandalorian, and it's got Yoda's kids.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.520
Well, maybe, oh, oh.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.240
This is an aspect we've never dealt with before is the time travel of Yahoo Answers.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.280
Perhaps he was so bored, he went on to write The Mandalorian.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.280
Oh, that's great.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.280
He created The Mandalorian.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
Yeah.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.280
You don't know.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.560
You know what I just did with my kids?

20:10.560 --> 20:17.560
We got some markers and paper, and drew all over some sheets of paper, and then I folded

20:17.560 --> 20:20.920
them into airplanes, and it made some real fun designs.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.360
That's cool.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.200
That's a cool thing that he could do with your kids.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.840
And that's another thing that we can come back to is like now.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.400
So what I'm saying is watch my kids.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.400
Right.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.400
Yeah, watch my kids, old man.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.160
But we also now, we're dads of six together.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.160
Oh, God.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.160
Yeah, collectively.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.080
Together we have fucking six of them, y'all.

20:39.080 --> 20:44.960
Yeah, so we know a lot now that we didn't know back in episode 129 when we closed things

20:44.960 --> 20:51.400
out with, is it bad to give my six-month-year-old baby a little French onion dip?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.280
I tell you now, no.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.760
If that kid will eat it, it's great.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.760
Six months, yeah.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.760
I think that's probably fine.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.880
Don't give it to him on a Frito scoop.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.880
No.

20:59.880 --> 21:00.880
Because baby-

21:00.880 --> 21:02.400
And it's just a little bit.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.400
Don't, okay.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.560
You could probably get away with giving it to him on like a regular Frito, but a Frito

21:06.560 --> 21:08.160
scoop is far too robust.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.160
Too crunch.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.160
No.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.720
Too firm a crunch for those gumless guys.

21:11.720 --> 21:16.560
I think if you soaked the Frito scoop for about three seconds, not much, you don't want

21:16.560 --> 21:18.680
it to be soggy or you're not going to get the dip, you know what I mean?

21:18.680 --> 21:20.360
Right, you want the baby to have a good time.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.360
Right.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.360
Right?

21:22.360 --> 21:23.360
He's the Frito scoop that he's just chock-a-block full.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.360
It's a fucking Super Bowl party.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.360
Yeah, sure.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.360
Like, come on.

21:26.360 --> 21:33.000
I don't want to use up too many of these because it is now a finite resource, but I did want

21:33.000 --> 21:34.160
to mention one.

21:34.160 --> 21:40.360
I got a big kick on this when I was returning to these to like reference some for this media

21:40.360 --> 21:42.120
stuff we've been doing.

21:42.120 --> 21:48.160
I found a few that are in an interesting sub-genre of we were the dummies.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.920
Yeah, that's fun.

21:49.920 --> 21:50.920
That's a fun one.

21:50.920 --> 21:55.680
Here's one that I discovered that I enjoyed.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.720
Can you get a tattoo while breastfeeding?

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
Oh.

21:58.720 --> 22:06.640
Which, at the time, which is January 28, 2013, we thought, boy, that is a crack up.

22:06.640 --> 22:12.640
Now, us fathers of six think, oh, you mean, is it safe to get a tattoo during the period

22:12.640 --> 22:14.400
that you're still breastfeeding your child?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.400
Oh, that's right.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
Yeah.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
Yeah.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.000
But we would have taken it then as concurrently.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yes, exactly.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Okay.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
While actively breastfeeding.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.960
Achieving that, by the way, probably, yes, it's safe to do basically everything while

22:26.960 --> 22:30.120
you breastfeed except, you know, high speed stunts.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.400
Well, it depends on where you're getting the tattoo.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
Well that's-

22:34.400 --> 22:37.240
Like you wouldn't want to get a nipple tattoo while the baby's right there.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.840
Here's what I would say to you, Travis, is don't get a tattoo anywhere you wouldn't breastfeed.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.320
That is what I would say there.

22:44.320 --> 22:49.760
No, I'm talking about fit like on your body, Jameon, not like where you're going to.

22:49.760 --> 22:54.140
I'm saying keep the needle nowhere near the baby and you could be actively breastfeeding

22:54.140 --> 22:55.280
and getting a tattoo at the same time.

22:55.280 --> 23:01.720
I don't think that a person who's sort of invested in their own happiness is going to

23:01.720 --> 23:06.120
get a nipple tattoo during the period that they are breastfeeding their child.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.720
That doesn't seem like a recipe for happiness.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.120
I'm not going to tell people what to do with their bodies, maybe that's their thing.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.920
I mean, you're right.

23:13.920 --> 23:21.080
The very first final Yahoo I did was can birds get allergies and like-

23:21.080 --> 23:22.080
Can they?

23:22.080 --> 23:23.080
Maybe.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
I don't know.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.400
That's not as ridiculous.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.920
No, it's still a funny idea to me.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.440
Yeah, it is kind of funny because it's like, what are you going to do about it?

23:29.440 --> 23:30.440
You know what I mean?

23:30.440 --> 23:31.440
A lot of illuminati-

23:31.440 --> 23:32.440
A picture of a bird sneezing.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.440
A lot of illuminati-based ones.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.440
A lot of illuminati.

23:34.440 --> 23:35.440
I'm going through it.

23:35.440 --> 23:42.160
What's funny is that you could pick any one thing out of this list and do a search on

23:42.160 --> 23:48.400
the page and find three about spaghetti, three about Kenny Rogers, four or five about Dakota

23:48.400 --> 23:49.400
Fanning.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
Right.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
There's plenty.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
Oh, yeah.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.400
There is a couple about Kenny Rogers, huh?

23:53.400 --> 23:54.400
Yeah.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.400
Chris Gaines.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.400
For sure.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
A lot of Chris Gaines stuff.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.400
For sure it's going to be in there.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
Yeah.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
Sorry.

24:00.400 --> 24:05.400
There's also some of them that we can't really circle back to because they don't provide

24:05.400 --> 24:08.880
much of a launchpad for healthy conversation.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.680
Like for instance, episode 336.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.640
You are all asshole.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.640
That's all that that one is.

24:15.640 --> 24:21.040
And I don't know that we can turn that into a good five minutes of content.

24:21.040 --> 24:25.160
Because the rest of that was I will now destroy the website in a few years.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Goodbye.

24:26.160 --> 24:30.200
I feel like that's the kind of thing though now we're a little bit more mature and we've

24:30.200 --> 24:31.560
dealt with some stuff.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.560
We could maybe reach out to that person and just see how it's going.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.320
Maybe change the direction of the show, make it about mending some fences.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.320
Yeah.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.320
It's a good.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.080
No, I don't ever want to talk to anybody who's unironically used this website before.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.080
No, that's fair.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.080
That's fair.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.080
Especially they call me an asshole.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.080
Yeah.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.080
That's not nice.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.080
True.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.080
I hurt my feelings.

24:49.080 --> 24:54.080
I mean, is that our answer to this?

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
Because we're going to have to like-

24:55.080 --> 24:56.080
It's an answer.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.080
We're going to have to have more answers.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.080
It feels like stalling.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
Yes.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.080
Yeah.

25:00.080 --> 25:04.640
I think I'm going to need to bring back Riddle Me Piss and play along at home and Sad Libs

25:04.640 --> 25:05.640
and stuff to fill the gaps.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.640
You know what I mean?

25:06.640 --> 25:07.640
For sure.

25:07.640 --> 25:12.240
They were on hiatus for about a week and a half and I think it's time to bring them back.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.700
Maybe even more.

25:13.700 --> 25:19.240
Maybe like two Sad Libs an episode or something just to fill the time.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.520
Griffin you might have to come up with bits.

25:22.520 --> 25:28.200
And I know that that's scary and hard and trust me, I know most of them are going to

25:28.200 --> 25:33.680
be clunkers at first, Griffin, but eventually you might find something like Work of Fart

25:33.680 --> 25:34.680
that really works.

25:34.680 --> 25:35.680
Yeah.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.560
I mean, people love Work of Fart so bad.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.760
Yeah.

25:39.760 --> 25:46.560
So you might need to start generating something like Celebrity Wine Wine Not like Justin has

25:46.560 --> 25:50.040
or something like that.

25:50.040 --> 25:55.880
But right now, Griffin, just spitball what's a bit that you could do, fill in, that would

25:55.880 --> 26:00.400
be as good as Yahoo Answers as far as generating content for the show.

26:00.400 --> 26:05.520
Yeah, I could do one about how two guys' songs sound the same.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.040
I could do one about Big Burgers.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.040
Yeah.

26:09.040 --> 26:15.800
I could do one where it's like quizzes for our friends.

26:15.800 --> 26:19.400
And quizzes for our friends is a good jumping off point.

26:19.400 --> 26:27.800
I could do one where I do a trick, like a visually a trick that...

26:27.800 --> 26:29.440
Like magic or stunt?

26:29.440 --> 26:32.760
It could be either one as long as it's cool to see.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.760
Or both.

26:33.760 --> 26:38.640
Well, what I would do is I would post a video alongside of each episode of me doing a trick.

26:38.640 --> 26:45.640
Can you imagine if Tony Hawk ramped a sick jump and while he was in the air pulled something

26:45.640 --> 26:46.640
out of a hat?

26:46.640 --> 26:47.640
That'd be good.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.640
That'd be fucking cool.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.640
And that's a great idea for a segment, Travis.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.840
I could just say a cool thing that would have happened.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
Like it would be cool.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.480
Yeah, just call it picture this.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
Yeah.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.840
Wouldn't it be cool if Space Jam 2 came out tomorrow?

26:58.840 --> 27:01.520
That could be the segment of just like, wouldn't it be great if...

27:01.520 --> 27:03.840
Well, I can't picture that though, Griffin.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.320
What would that look like?

27:05.320 --> 27:06.320
You know what I mean?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.040
Yeah, it's just a concept.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.120
I think, and let's just have this discussion.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.640
I know which way it's going to go, but should we cancel My Brother, My Brother, Me?

27:16.640 --> 27:17.640
Should we put it?

27:17.640 --> 27:18.640
Should we put it?

27:18.640 --> 27:19.640
Because here's the thing.

27:19.640 --> 27:29.880
There's something very, very, very, very, very scrumptious about Yahoo Answers ending

27:29.880 --> 27:33.280
and we do episode 420 and it's the end of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

27:33.280 --> 27:39.440
Folks, the way the last couple months have gone, I am afraid to have the conversation

27:39.440 --> 27:43.680
because you know how we love to do things for the lulz that turn into doing it for the

27:43.680 --> 27:54.640
serious that turn into big loss of revenue for the McElroy family ad hoc, also writ large.

27:54.640 --> 27:59.640
Anyone who knows me will tell you that it takes very little convincing for me to not

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
work.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
Right?

28:01.640 --> 28:02.640
Yeah.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.640
It's the easiest thing.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.320
Someone's like, I don't know how, and I'm like, oh, we don't have to.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.040
People think that podcasting for a living is the easiest thing in the world and there's

28:10.040 --> 28:11.960
one thing easier than podcasting.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
It's not podcasting.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
Yeah.

28:13.960 --> 28:14.960
Yeah.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.840
And listen, I love the image.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.840
I'm listening.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.640
My Brother, I'm on pins and needles over here, I'm dialed in.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.560
The scene is this.

28:23.560 --> 28:29.240
They are lowering Yahoo Answers' casket into the ground, starting I guess today and ending

28:29.240 --> 28:30.240
on May 4th.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
It's a slow lowering.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
Slow process.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.240
Slow process.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.640
Are beating our breast.

28:34.640 --> 28:39.680
We are grief stricken and we throw ourselves into the open grave on top of the casket and

28:39.680 --> 28:41.820
we yell, bury us too.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.920
Bury us alongside it.

28:43.920 --> 28:49.400
We are the favored cats and possessions of the pharaoh that is Yahoo Answers.

28:49.400 --> 28:54.040
Bury me with my funny, which is what I call Yahoo Answers.

28:54.040 --> 28:59.520
I'm not saying it's a good idea, but I just had a baby.

28:59.520 --> 29:06.760
And I, you know, I rely on this show to support my family.

29:06.760 --> 29:11.080
But there's something that makes kind of a lot of sense about this.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
Yeah.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
This is feeling more right.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.080
It's good symmetry.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.080
The more we.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.800
I mean, let's say this.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.160
At the very least, I think we got to end this episode on a cliffhanger because we have not

29:23.160 --> 29:27.160
had a season finale cliffhanger for so long.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.280
I feel like we're due one where it's like a cliffhanger.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.280
You know what I mean?

29:31.280 --> 29:32.280
Yeah.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.920
Well, we got listen, we got two weeks before the site absolutely goes away.

29:35.920 --> 29:36.920
Yeah.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.920
You know what I mean?

29:37.920 --> 29:39.040
So I don't know.

29:39.040 --> 29:43.000
I'm trying to get an Empire Records thing.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Is that that?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
What's that move?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Is that what the movie's called?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.440
The one with the with Renee Zellweger?

29:49.440 --> 29:50.840
Yeah.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.880
And they have to do a rock concert to save Empire Records at the end.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.880
I've tried to get going.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.960
I mean, I'm not really on so sheep, so I've just been kind of just trying to mentally

29:58.960 --> 30:04.360
project it out there like the secret that I want there to be a Let's Save Yahoo Answers

30:04.360 --> 30:07.520
thing out in the Internet.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.880
Whether it's a big music festival, that would be irresponsible to do right now.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.960
But you know what I'm saying?

30:11.960 --> 30:13.880
And nobody has gotten excited about that.

30:13.880 --> 30:24.160
But if we chain ourselves to this heavy, drowning weight of Yahoo Answers and say, we'll die

30:24.160 --> 30:27.480
too, now will you save it?

30:27.480 --> 30:35.040
I think that maybe that would get some ground swell going.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.920
I am prepared to chain myself to Yahoo Answers.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.760
I am worried about putting out the one...

30:41.760 --> 30:46.120
Kind of thought you guys would go along with me a little bit on that one.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.120
My worry...

30:47.120 --> 30:50.000
I'm starting to second guess again because...

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
I'm already chained.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
Why did you wait until after I chained myself?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Please.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.320
I am a little worried about putting out into the universe that it's a season finale cliffhanger

31:00.320 --> 31:12.000
you know, because we may not get across the board the response we're hoping for.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.720
Yeah, that's a risk, isn't it?

31:19.720 --> 31:22.960
That is the risk.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.960
Maybe some folks that go, well, guess it's time.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.760
No, just check this out.

31:28.760 --> 31:34.320
I chained myself to Yahoo Answers, but not so that I will be dragged down to hell where

31:34.320 --> 31:37.440
Yahoo Answers is definitely going to go.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.440
No question.

31:38.440 --> 31:48.440
Rather, to keep Yahoo Answers moored to my mighty dock, and I won't let it go.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.440
And I don't know what that means.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.280
Oh, so you've chained Yahoo to you.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Right.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.200
It's not going fucking anywhere.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.240
So I guess...

31:57.240 --> 31:58.240
And I don't know what that means.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.240
Shit.

31:59.240 --> 32:06.880
I had just started to go towards acceptance, but now I am trending right back towards denial.

32:06.880 --> 32:10.240
And that feels right to me because I feel happier.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.160
What's the biggest flash drive you have, Griffin?

32:12.160 --> 32:13.160
Can you download...

32:13.160 --> 32:14.160
I got one right here.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.160
This is...

32:15.160 --> 32:17.160
Yeah, just download Yahoo Answers onto it?

32:17.160 --> 32:20.080
I got an SD card here with 32.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.080
That's probably...

32:21.080 --> 32:22.080
Oh, I think that'll do it.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.440
It's just words, right?

32:23.440 --> 32:25.640
That is the fun thing about this.

32:25.640 --> 32:32.520
I wanted to mention about Yahoo Answers, which will be shut down for good on May 4th.

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
What?

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
Yeah, I know.

32:34.520 --> 32:39.280
Here's what's something wild to think about is this site is just text.

32:39.280 --> 32:47.360
I mean, it's just text, and it probably is like one billionth of the storage capacity

32:47.360 --> 32:50.600
required to keep YouTube running, right?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.640
It's just the tiniest little bit of data in the grand scheme of things.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.320
And Yahoo Answers is like, yeah, we just can't afford to...

32:58.320 --> 33:00.240
Is it that Yahoo?

33:00.240 --> 33:06.360
Or maybe would you kind of be happier brand-wise from a holistic brand perspective if people

33:06.360 --> 33:07.360
didn't like...

33:07.360 --> 33:10.040
Every time you mentioned Yahoo, people are like, oh, you mean the garbage?

33:10.040 --> 33:11.040
No, no, no.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.800
It's not that anymore.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.460
It's good now.

33:16.460 --> 33:20.560
Now it's good because we got rid of that one thing.

33:20.560 --> 33:29.640
I don't want to belabor this remembrance because if we remember too hard, we'll remember the

33:29.640 --> 33:32.560
bad times too.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.840
I'm not about that right now.

33:34.840 --> 33:35.840
That's what the Bible says.

33:35.840 --> 33:39.080
That's what the Bible says to do or not to do.

33:39.080 --> 33:44.440
I just want to say I love you, Yahoo, and thank you for everything you've done for me

33:44.440 --> 33:48.960
and my career and this show.

33:48.960 --> 33:58.480
You were a bad website that was propagated by bad people whose terrible work was sifted

33:58.480 --> 34:05.680
through by some of the finest people who's ever lived in the world.

34:05.680 --> 34:10.620
We may replace the time slot for you on this show.

34:10.620 --> 34:15.320
We will have to or else the show will become shorter and our advertisers will have a word

34:15.320 --> 34:17.620
to say with us about that.

34:17.620 --> 34:26.640
But you will not be replaced in our hearts and our souls.

34:26.640 --> 34:32.320
I'm going to miss Yahoo Answers and I'm pretty sorry to see you go.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.960
You were a really great generator material even though a lot of people, man, it was almost

34:36.960 --> 34:38.800
as bad as the haunted doll thing for a while.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.240
People loved Chomp That Flavor.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.600
Now, the flavor had been out there from before us.

34:42.600 --> 34:46.320
We didn't invent or discover Yahoo Answers that would have fit on our cap.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.320
That would have been.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
Exactly.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
But I am going to miss it.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.000
I feel like it's an essential part of the DNA of this program and I feel like it's a

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
new day dawning.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.360
But it's a period of renewal.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.480
That's what we can hope for.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.160
Maybe something about crypto we could take a-

34:59.160 --> 35:00.160
Awesome.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.160
Yeah.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.160
Oh, that's great.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.160
Some sort of cool crypto update.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.160
That could be cool.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.160
When you tell people you want to-

35:05.160 --> 35:06.160
Oh, boy.

35:06.160 --> 35:09.160
The pipes, the pipes are calling.

35:09.160 --> 35:13.120
I think this is what Travis wanted to open up the show with and he just wanted to make

35:13.120 --> 35:15.160
sure that we didn't get to the-

35:15.160 --> 35:18.360
Let's just let him go.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
This is appropriate.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.360
Then we'll fade it out.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.360
Thanks for listening, everybody.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.360
We'll be back with a regular episode.

35:22.360 --> 35:26.640
If you can even call any of our episodes from now on, Travis, can you turn it down just

35:26.640 --> 35:27.880
a little bit?

35:27.880 --> 35:32.680
If you can even call any of our episodes from now on regular.

35:32.680 --> 35:37.680
Thanks to me and Travis for our theme music and thanks to you for listening and I'm looking

35:37.680 --> 35:39.160
forward to seeing you again soon.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.160
It'll be different us.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.240
Maybe a little bit more world weary, but we'll be back.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.520
Definitely sadder.

35:44.520 --> 35:53.440
Blushed and white with snow, tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.640
Travis, can you fade yourself out?

35:55.640 --> 35:58.840
I would love to hear you do that sort of organically.

35:58.840 --> 36:17.480
Oh, boy, I love you so much.
