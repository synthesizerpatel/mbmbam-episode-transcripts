00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Good evening, side audience. Hello, other people. My name is Clint McElroy.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Anybody named McElroy is going to get a big round of applause.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
We're going to be starting the show in just a second.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
I wanted to kind of prime the crowd a little with some very important Mabim Bam trivia.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Just to kind of see who's been paying attention.

00:34.000 --> 00:44.000
First of all, anybody listen, has listened to all 201 episodes?

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
The rest of you get the hell out.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
So you'll know these answers.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
First of all, which McElroy brother is deathly afraid of spiders?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Travis.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Give yourself ten points.

01:00.000 --> 01:10.000
Number two, what is early onset jack disease?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Early onset jack disease.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
175 pounds in the womb.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
That's right, when you have a 175 pound child in the womb.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Security, row one, scene two.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Question number three, and this, now we'll resort to animal.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
Which business, which animal was the subject of the business name suggestions?

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Speed rats, shitty cats, your mother gets on it.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Exactly.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
Number four, which animal has received the most Mabim Bam references?

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And finally, who is Goofy Hart McKinley?

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh, sorry.

01:55.000 --> 02:04.000
She was the warrior cat question answer.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
So maybe she gave birth to Brangle Cat.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
But these are the midwives.

02:10.000 --> 02:21.000
Ladies and gentlemen, his brother, his brother in him, Justin Travis and Griffin Acklemore.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Oh wait, there's more.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but there's a nerd degree on his palm.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I haven't seen anything.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I only mentioned so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
What's up, you cool babies?

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
Get up, get up, get up.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Y'all get it twisted.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Distraction is mine, motherfuckers.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'll fucking get it.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Fuck what you heard.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's what you hear it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It's what you hear it.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Listen.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
It's what you hear it.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Listen.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
It's what you hear it.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Listen.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
The McElroy brothers.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Yo, give it to your motherfuckers.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Now open up, close the door.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Stop the crime.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Go fuck this baby, baby.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
The McElroy brothers.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Got such a good heart.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
The McElroy brothers.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Beat the motherfucker one day if you can.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Damn right.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
The McElroy brothers.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Go in and dance.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
The McElroy brothers.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Hell yeah, son.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
The McElroy brothers.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Got something to break, man, with the enemy.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
We've used that before, and it's just so great, man.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I worked so hard on it that I didn't want it to just be a one.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
the advice show for the modern era.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I just took a bite out of a cupcake from this,

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
and it expressly says, for Sydney.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Who got us these?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Thank you for the cupcakes, whoever.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
No one's going to mess up, all right?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Secret cupcakes.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Secret cupcakes.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Copier and non-poison?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
What the fuck are we doing?

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
This is so many podcast shows.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I really, I don't remember if anything that I've said

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
has ever not been recorded.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Speaking of which, let me start recording.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, no.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
No, we got it on the six other recording devices.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I'll just say everything again.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Thank you for the cupcakes, our dad.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Thank you, cupcakes.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You know the shit about the question asker,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
because that's, god damn.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I think my favorite thing is when he asked about

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
who was deathly afraid of spiders,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
that like three people that said Justin

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
got so harshly shouted, it's Travis.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Fucking fuck.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Fuck this guy.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, thank you, everybody, for coming tonight

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
to this late, late shift.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
This was the original.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
It used to not be the late show.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
It used to just be the show that we were doing.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
You guys weren't worth it from the beginning,

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
and I appreciate that.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
That's what you got.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
So what you're going to have now is like

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
live, unfiltered, unadulterated Nagler brothers.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
There's nothing.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
No kidding.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I mean, we've done half the work that Justin

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
has done tonight, and I already feel like

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
just keeling over dead.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
So this is probably going to be the worst

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
or best show that we've ever done.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
You know what's kept me going the entire time?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
My second audience to my right hand side,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
my dog, Perry.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Dog time opens up.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
We will not look or talk to the dog time.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Sir, we asked everybody to arrive on time, sir.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
It's extremely rude of you.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So what do we do in this podcast?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Is this the medical history one?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Travis, how about, okay,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
you've never listened to our show before.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
What are you doing here?

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
It's possible they came here for saw bones, ass.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's an advice show.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
We try to help people who ask us questions

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
and questions we find in the Yahoo Answers service,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
and we turn them an alchemy like into wisdom.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
So let's do that right now.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
I believe we have some questions for people

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
who are actually visiting here in the meeting space.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
We should also mention, oh, do we not have

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
another microphone that we can...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, we do right here.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Okay, we'll get comfy.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, we may give people on stage to ask questions.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So think about what you might want to chat about.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Listen, let me be extremely fucking clear about this.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
You are playing a dangerous game.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Because, first off, I'm drunk.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
And...

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
The only thing I'm bummed about is that I don't have any...

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I had like a Jameson ginger ale for the first show.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Now I don't have any more.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
But I believe in a higher power that...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Dear Jesus.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Dear Jesus, Jameson.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I haven't talked in a while.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
No, but that's the one thing.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But don't make it a bummer.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Don't make it about poopy.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
If you're going to ask us a question over here,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
just don't ruin the entire show with your question,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
or we will save the show,

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
and you will not like the sacrifice we have in it

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
in order to get it back on the rails.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Believe me.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Travis, questions.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
This question comes from Jeremy Franklin.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Are you here?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Is your girlfriend here with you?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yep.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Great. Terrific.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
So here's the question.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Is she about to get real?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
My girlfriend stinks like butts.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Whoa!

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
No.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Jeremy?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
How dare you, sir?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
So Jeremy actually says,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
My girlfriend has just moved in with me,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
and it's going great.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Except...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
She has no sense of bed geography.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
She's constantly rolling over on top of me,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
sleeping diagonally so there's no room for me,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
or kneeing me in her sleep.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
How can I train her to sleep like a normal person

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
so I can get good bed sleep?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I don't think the two of you sleeping in the same bed

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
is going to be a problem.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I understand this question because I have these instincts.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
When my wife gets out of bed earlier

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
than I'm going to get good bed,

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
I will instantly reorganize in a diagonal position.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I do not know why.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
There's something about the luxury.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
My body's covered by bed space.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
No matter...

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Whoa.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Whoa.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
My body's covered with bed space,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
but there's something about the fact

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
that I'm absorbing an entire bed.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, no.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
It's about the denial of comfort

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
to your pregnant wife

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
that is so close to you.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
She's already up.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
She's got to get up early to make my room.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Do you want to...

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
This is my reason I just sleep in separate beds.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
In separate rooms.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Separate houses.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I haven't seen my wife in two years.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
I have a theory that if you don't have this problem

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
with your significant other,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
you're the problem.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Because I think in every relationship...

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
That's like living around a bed

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
where you don't see the sucker in your head.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Right.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I am a straight-up princess and a pea sleeper.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I am a delicate flower.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Justin and Sydney are coming to learn this

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
because we're showing a hotel room here.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
I build a fucking exoskeleton of pillows around myself.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I need two under the head,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
one between the elbows,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
and one between the knees.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I need four pillows.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
We had six in the room as soon as you got in.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh, man.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It's going to suck for two of you guys.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I think I'm the troublemaker.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That was actually a really hard call

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
we had to make last night

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
because we are staying at the garden.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Oh, the garden, you know.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It's still about 28 between 6 and 7.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
We're staying there.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
We realized that we had four people in the room.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
We had six pillows.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
That's not going to fly.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Especially since my wife doesn't have

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
her special S-shaped pillow snookle

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
that she needs for breakfast.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
So I said,

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
we're going to need some more pillows over here.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
So I called a friend to ask, and they said,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
how many pillows do you need?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Did you call them?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I called because you can't talk to people like anybody.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Like a girl.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Girl didn't call.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Also called to cancel dinner reservations tonight.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
And then Justin asked,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
were they mad?

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
In his defense, they were pretty mad.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
They were not psyched about it.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Everyone calls in front of us and says,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
we need more pillows.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
You know, this is ridiculous.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And they say, how many?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And I think we had this moment at the beginning

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
because it's like...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Ideally, like 10.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
How many can you get?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
How many you got?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
How many do you have?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
How about you start the negotiation?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We'll work it out.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Exactly.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't want to make the first offer.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You make the first offer.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
I wrote a number down on this piece of paper.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Send your man out to collect the paper.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
What were we talking about?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Bad sleepers.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
People are bad at sleeping.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
See, I'm bad at sleeping.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I tend to be the one who flares around.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
And then I also wake up from flailing around.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
So the number of times I've hit my wife in my sleep.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
In my sleep.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
In my sleep.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And then I've woken up immediately going,

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Is that real?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Did I dream that?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I'm a horrible person.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
How about a Yahoo?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah, Yahoo.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
This Yahoo...

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
No, that helped.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
See, I think it was sent in by Jacob Locker.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Thank you, Jacob.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
It's by Yahoo Answers.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Hold up.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Meowchel.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Who asks,

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Would you consider the Tim Allen grunt art?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I can assume you're familiar.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Like an actor, which is considered an artist.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Wait, I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
So on the count of three,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
if everybody can give me a Tim Allen grunt.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
This is going to be fucking awesome.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Okay, one, two, three.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I just want to say,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
a lot of the people that only get one,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I've never heard Tim Allen go grunt.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Explain that.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And raise your hand if I'm right.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
I think some people were doing...

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
It's multiple.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
And then the other people were doing

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
the questioning grunt.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Really?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
That's so bad.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Who does that?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yes, the breathy.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
The breathy, excitable grunt.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Then you also have that kind of like

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
you just found out disappointed.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Being derogative.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't think he ever had a...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I think he did.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Where like, Wilson would say something very...

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Wilson?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
That was when Fyre was brought up.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
No, he would say...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
When Wilson would say something really deep,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
he would go...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Like, reflected fucking grunt.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
You're right.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
No, he has to have a nasal grunt.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
He said,

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Artful.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Agree or disagree?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
It's more artisanal.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I feel like it's a...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I feel like Tim Allen's a comedic artisan.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
But I don't know if I would say it's an art.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
It's a work of art.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I mean...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
It's a piece.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It's a piece.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It's a creation.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
It's an effort.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Do you think he crafted it?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Like, he stood in front of the mirror and went,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Oh.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
No.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Wait.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
I'm on to something.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Hey, sweetie.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Is this funny?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
When I do that, do you laugh?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Do you have nerve problems?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Just imagine...

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I want you to imagine

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
that a T.J. just broke a window with his slingshot

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
and I walk into the house and I see the window and I'm like,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I'm very disappointed in T.J.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And when I see the window, I make this noise.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It's sort of like a zombie having a stroke.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
The ring for me started $10.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I'll tell you what was fucking hard on that show

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
were all the wipes.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
All the transitional wipes.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That's what it seems.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
God damn.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't know.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Can we all tell about how that was the only show

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
literally in existence to ever do...

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I guess Boy Meets World actually did get a little bit creative

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
with its shit.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Early, like, season one through three.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
And then they fell off.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
And they went straight to Cross Dissolves.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
I miss, like, a lawnmower eats up the scene.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
It's so fun.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I think we have a greatest hits reel

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
that was cute.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Let's watch that.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
They fell together.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
No, we don't.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Did we do it?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It's on the USB drive.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Labeled the best bit ever.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's labeled a very good bit,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
but the Macro is playing the head.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Is it art?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Absolutely, yeah.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Next question.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Hey, brothers.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Hey, Travis.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
No, that's the...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Okay.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I recently decided that I want to move out of my mom's house.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
The problem is that it is expensive

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
to live anywhere around where I live,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
and I am currently paying for schooling,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
so there's not a whole lot for me to offer.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
My brother has offered for me to live with him,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
and he said we can discuss the details later.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
But I was wondering what I could do to

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
pay rent without paying cash.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
If you put...

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
If you put quotation marks around the word pay,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
then it gets gross.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Buying groceries and driving him around

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
since he can't drive himself

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
are the only things I've thought of.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
If you could offer some suggestions,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
that would be great.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And that's where we're moving on up to the cheap side.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah, right there.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
All right, right on.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Cool.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Backrubs on demand.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Backrubs on demand.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah, I have a backrubist who lives with me.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
We're also brothers,

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
but mainly he rubs my back.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
And that's how he pays.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
He pays me with backrubs.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Whoop!

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
That's the reason Wilson never came up

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
from behind a switch

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
is because he had a brother backrubist.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
He was constantly getting a backrub

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
whenever he saw him.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Because if you had somebody that you had hired

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
with rent professionally to rub your back,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I think you would have somebody do it

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
in full time, right?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Eventually the meat would...

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
And by full time you mean

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
every waking torture hour of his life.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Can I get a drink real quick?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
No, absolutely not.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
These attendants aren't going to release themselves.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Uh, Jesus.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I don't like anything as much as I like having money,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
so it's really tough.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I mean, you could make him a picture,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
but money would probably be...

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Could you make me a vision board,

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
like inspirational mindset

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
you guys are going to have together?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
You're going to make him a new one every day?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
It would have to be...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Figure out the length of time

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
you could get away with not paying rent

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and his frustration peak,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
and then be like, oh, vision board,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
got you a new one.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
God damn, that is pretty inspirational.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
You're right.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
You can hang out for four more days.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
It's like Dread Pirate Rawlings in the sky.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Good luck.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I will have that picture in the morning.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
How about any other answer?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yep.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
This one was sent in by Jeff Danielson.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Thank you, Jeff.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And thank you to everybody who sent in Yahoo's.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
There were trillions, which was exhausting.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
They weren't all drew down report,

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
but they were mainly.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
They were mostly drew down report.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
He's gained two levels in Yahoo shaman-dom

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
since we started this morning.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Isn't he here?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
No, he doesn't know.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Thank you, Jeff.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
It's by Yahoo answers user Fabricio.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's just a name guy.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
By laughing at it, that's racist.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Fabricio has a 4% on Yahoo answers.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
We've only recently become aware of the fact

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
that Yahoo answers has like a rating system for users.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
We had somebody who had a 1% in the last episode,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
and god damn, they didn't earn it.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't think that there's like a rating system

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
you can have for like,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
you're a more worthwhile user of Yahoo answers.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
You're the smallest piece of shit on this website.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Fabricio asks,

19:04.000 --> 19:12.000
does emotion count as an ingredient when cooking?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
That's it.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, no details.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
No further questions.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I mean, they say like,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
put a little bit of some special love in it.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Does that go the other way though?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Like, I put a little border in it.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Someone was really fucking angry

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
when they made this chili.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
You taste it.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
I don't like when I read a recipe on like,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
the internet or a book,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
where they have in the list of ingredients,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
like a little extra love.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
And that's a legal document.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hold on, you read a recipe on the internet,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
like that's legal.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Some of us build a shopping list,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
and some of us maybe are confused

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
when we see love?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
What?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I don't know.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
What am love?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
What am love?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I was trying to bake some cupcakes.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
So you're suggesting that if you had a recipe

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
for turkey chili,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
and you went to the store and bought it,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
and then followed the instructions,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
put a lot of love in there,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
and then you cooked it,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
and it came out,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
and the whole time it was strawberry pie,

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
you would be like,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm pressing charges.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
This is false advertising.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
It clearly said chili at the top.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I was curious when it put strawberries in it,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
but okay.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm saying the ingredients list

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
is a legally binding document,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
and they should have just put like great...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I see a little extra love in there.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
You know what I think?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Grow love.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You really showed them.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
I know, right?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
If I want to put some extra love in there,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
you know how I show my love?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I made you this.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
But if...

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
What do you care if I had emotion or not?

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
You're still full.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
If you blow a kiss in your turkey chili,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
don't I get to taste it?

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
Can you taste a kiss in a turkey chili?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I love having built-in punchlines.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
I think that's like the crux of home and Peru,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
but I think that's...

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
You can actually build like three fours

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
that are showed by hilarious wives.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
You get that fence sound of a bitch in there.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
You have Tim,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
you go vroom, vroom,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
and you get three fours going to an episode.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Get some discouraged looks from Patricia Heaton.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
You cast Richard Korn as the most...

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Oh, yikes.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Thank you.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I thought so.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, I didn't think so, obviously.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Thanks, Dog Pound!

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Thanks, Dog Pound!

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Okay, stop.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Okay?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Just stop the Dog Pound.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
This is the only thing they have.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
They know the difference between the moms

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
and everybody loves Raymond and...

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Oh, this is weird, but...

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Go to Dog Pound.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Travis, read a question, please.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Great.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm going to be honest.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.280
Great.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.280
You're killing me.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.280
Go faster.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.280
Go faster.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.280
How could you not...

21:58.280 --> 22:00.000
I've been working as a waitress at a 24-hour

22:00.000 --> 22:01.840
cafe for almost two years now.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.840
Congratulations.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.840
Thank you.

22:03.840 --> 22:04.840
I've never heard of it.

22:04.840 --> 22:05.840
I've learned ways to handle potentially awkward....

22:05.840 --> 22:08.440
That's what I do works every time.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.040
I've learned ways to handle potentially awkward

22:10.040 --> 22:11.800
situations like tables that are drunk

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
or openly fighting,

22:12.800 --> 22:14.480
but I still haven't found a way to manage

22:14.480 --> 22:16.040
declined credit cards

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
that isn't totally uncomfortable

22:17.040 --> 22:18.800
for everyone involved.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.680
I'd say the tactful way to say that a card

22:21.680 --> 22:25.040
down especially for people who are obviously on dates and that's from cough

22:25.040 --> 22:37.000
it up in Austin Texas yikes I think you know you broke no I think you just have

22:37.000 --> 22:43.320
to make the noise that the audience collectively made and just hear me you

22:43.320 --> 22:46.280
want to fucking explain no they don't have they know they just gave you a

22:46.280 --> 22:56.760
piece of plastic that represents dollars like here's my card you put the card on

22:56.760 --> 23:01.200
the table you lean in gingerly to the earth

23:08.480 --> 23:13.040
God can you print out can you have pre-printed out like letters from the

23:13.040 --> 23:16.160
governor like you know how to take credit cards from his bank and then he

23:16.160 --> 23:19.320
bring it back to them with the letter like check the letter man sorry I can't

23:19.320 --> 23:22.160
no can do all you got to do is say I think something's wrong with our

23:22.160 --> 23:27.520
machine the cards not work it works for everyone else but you

23:27.520 --> 23:33.360
fucking machine yeah every person on a date it worked when I spent $500 early

23:33.360 --> 23:40.760
on candy I'm just trying to envision a circumstance of what you're out of money

23:40.760 --> 23:46.880
but also pretty happy on your day you got candy waiting to know

23:49.320 --> 23:56.280
no matter how else the game goes a roomful of candy you know how the data has to be

23:56.280 --> 24:05.400
going for you to be sitting there thinking oh yeah absolutely I think so

24:05.400 --> 24:15.640
you have picked the

24:35.400 --> 24:55.920
I mean we've gotten shit every show which is bananas like this has been the

24:55.920 --> 24:59.080
most exhausting day I think of all ours but also like one of the best as we keep

24:59.080 --> 25:11.480
getting nice shit from everybody and every show we like receiving I'm

25:11.480 --> 25:17.680
exhausted for past me audio quality is not it's not super great and apologies

25:17.680 --> 25:22.080
this is the last one though is the last New York live show that we did at the

25:22.080 --> 25:27.320
pit thank you the pit I wish we had done better recording the audio there's a new

25:27.320 --> 25:33.000
live show coming up the LA live show that we recorded Jesus a month ago Jesus

25:33.000 --> 25:39.520
yeah well like three weeks ago the end it ended the second week we'll probably

25:39.520 --> 25:44.800
throw that up later after Justin has a child and probably won't be super funny

25:44.800 --> 25:49.600
for a while when the child of destiny is born yes all these jokes though talking

25:49.600 --> 25:55.240
about all these jokes has gotten me pretty hungry I would say okay so you're

25:55.240 --> 26:00.160
not really reinventing the wheel with this live show money zone interruption

26:00.160 --> 26:06.080
all right you go ahead tough guy guys it's time we think outside the box or

26:06.080 --> 26:11.360
inside the box time to think outside the bun yeah and inside the box okay just

26:11.360 --> 26:14.680
like that you're both sued those are both copyright infringements nature box

26:14.680 --> 26:22.920
live moss nature box bought up is nature box nature box does not have fast food

26:22.920 --> 26:29.680
inside a nature box nobody does it like Sara Lee well well that that's a little

26:29.680 --> 26:34.120
that's a little on the nose listen you know you're looking at your diet and

26:34.120 --> 26:37.680
you're looking at your tummy and you're saying I need to not snack as much the

26:37.680 --> 26:44.200
snacking is killing me Roger it's like me and you say listen let's be honest

26:44.200 --> 26:47.720
you're never gonna stop stacking some never gonna stop so maybe you swap out

26:47.720 --> 26:52.000
the Oreos have you ever thought that maybe you need to snack more but with

26:52.000 --> 26:57.480

27:41.640 --> 27:45.760

you've been dying to try this is the moment tons of people have tried it from

28:19.520 --> 28:24.960
our listener base and a lot of them have liked it all right listen I gotta be

28:24.960 --> 28:29.440
sure you guys I don't understand this new advertiser we have I'm hoping Griffin

28:29.440 --> 28:35.760
can explain it to me well that's because your your simple Promethean brain can't

28:35.760 --> 28:41.160
understand the logic of computers I've been learning Prometheus the one who

28:41.160 --> 28:45.800
brought computers to human to the people that's right now that was data that was

28:45.800 --> 28:51.560
data from Star Trek when you travel I remember that episode time here's a fact

28:51.560 --> 28:58.320
for you chuckle fucks coding has become the most desired job skill of 2014

28:58.320 --> 29:03.880
whether it's HTML whether it's CSS that stands for cascading style sheets

29:03.880 --> 29:10.320
chuckle fucks yeah I maybe know a thing or two about these subjects I've been

29:10.320 --> 29:13.960
trying to learn it in my brain it's very difficult because I don't understand

29:13.960 --> 29:22.480
like maths or sciences but one month is a website that will help you learn these

29:22.480 --> 29:27.680
very very complex methods maths and sciences in a very straightforward way

29:27.680 --> 29:32.320
for instance one month HTML is the easiest way to learn how to code to

29:32.320 --> 29:38.560
build websites here's how it works you have 30 days roughly about a month it's

29:38.560 --> 29:42.560
debatable but roughly the length of one month and you do 30 minutes a day and

29:42.560 --> 29:48.920
then starting from scratch knowing nothing like you idiots do know nothing

29:48.920 --> 29:54.960
that is you got me you got me now reel me in you will build idiot an actual

29:54.960 --> 29:58.480
website from scratch starting from day one and you'll be welcomed into a

29:58.480 --> 30:02.920
community of 12,000 more than 12,000 other students learning each other

30:02.920 --> 30:09.120
helping each other touching each other it'll teach you the stuff that you need

30:09.120 --> 30:15.040
if you're wanting to apply for a web focused job like HTML and CSS you get

30:15.040 --> 30:18.480
video tutorials you get hands-on exercises and training and by the end of

30:18.480 --> 30:23.120
the class you will have three projects including an online portfolio a blog

30:23.120 --> 30:27.400
template and a landing page which is like basically everything you need in

30:27.400 --> 30:32.100
this digital era that's amazing and if you if you already know HTML they have

30:32.100 --> 30:37.680
other classes too for other for other stuff other coding things maybe jQuery

30:37.680 --> 30:42.880
maybe Ruby maybe Python I have no idea I have one to teach you how to use

30:42.880 --> 30:48.240
Facebook yeah they do rails is good they have one called Facebook for me ma's and

30:48.240 --> 30:52.440
it teaches you the difference between a wall post and a comment and a private

30:52.440 --> 30:58.980
message join right now at one month comm slash my brother you get 25% off Wow do

30:58.980 --> 31:02.560

31:02.560 --> 31:08.000
together and do it for 25% less than it would normally cost you by going to one

31:08.000 --> 31:11.080
month comm slash my brother that's amazing this is not a joke I will

31:11.080 --> 31:14.960
actually probably do this there are there's some good resources to learn how

31:14.960 --> 31:20.040
to do this online but a lot of them aren't like super comprehensive like

31:20.040 --> 31:22.960
they'll give you the groundwork and then sort of back off from there this one

31:22.960 --> 31:27.160
sounds pretty thorough so I'm gonna give a give it a checkout so this next

31:27.160 --> 31:31.600

just like a dad with a mustache and like a construction helmet and he would get

32:34.520 --> 32:40.160
himself into thorny situations to extract children from those weird thing

you don't understand two words anyway we got more live show so gobble it up

34:51.320 --> 35:00.200
turkeys turkeys I am so excited for this Yahoo it was sent in by emerald member

35:00.200 --> 35:09.080
level 13 yahoo shaman drew that it is by gap answers user bulls-cubs fan who asks

35:09.080 --> 35:15.880
do you think the clock has sex at noon and midnight

35:15.880 --> 35:28.000
I think I did you think about it here the big hand is on top of the little

35:28.000 --> 35:35.440
hand so do you think at noon and night they have sex also I'm incredibly

35:35.440 --> 35:55.200
stoned yeah I can't even ever become 69

35:55.200 --> 36:20.440
works everybody alive if you don't put this on

36:20.440 --> 36:28.720
you're right you know the worst part of this question is the fucking dumbest and

36:28.720 --> 36:33.680
after we decided to put it in the show I had to sit there and think if there were

36:33.680 --> 36:38.520
times when the hands also touched at the noon and midnight and it was it was a

36:38.520 --> 36:42.840
crazy logic puzzle for a four-year-old

36:42.840 --> 36:52.000
18 people in this audience are thinking about it right now no just me okay

36:52.000 --> 37:21.160
you'll get someone down here yeah yes remember the metrics hey just put the

37:21.160 --> 37:27.840
folks at home that's the sound of his chair scooting back he did my name is

37:27.840 --> 37:34.120
Matt and my question is I started a new job in December and you know trying to

37:34.120 --> 37:37.960
get my foot in the door I wrote up a real interesting cover letter where I

37:37.960 --> 37:41.600
mentioned that I played Dungeons and Dragons and that's what got me the

37:41.600 --> 38:07.320
interview so it's great whenever when my job started if we would somebody who

38:07.320 --> 38:10.840
would come into the office they would be like that's that's Matt he's our

38:10.840 --> 38:16.360
dungeon master and it was funny for a while now there's certain expectations

38:16.360 --> 38:21.560
you know more professional people in and the joke is sort of lost its much to me

38:21.560 --> 38:26.880
yeah my way is how you bring it back do I suck it up and just accept it or what

38:26.880 --> 38:56.680
can I do to get a nickname I fucking need them right now do you play with the

38:56.680 --> 39:01.080
dudes that you work with no but the guy who is looking through resumes said oh I

39:01.080 --> 39:04.480
used to play with my older brother when I was young and that's why your resume

39:04.480 --> 39:07.760
stood out but can I tell you something I'm sure you made the job that's it

39:07.760 --> 39:29.640
dumb yes there are people who would be happy to have a job where everyone

39:29.640 --> 39:59.560
I just keep it at your desk have a bunch of skulls with like candles

39:59.560 --> 40:04.600
on top of them what's melted down over it you can be I found this working in a

40:04.600 --> 40:09.480
lot of jobs you can be such a character at the office that they often will

40:09.480 --> 40:15.640
forget the work part you become so essential as part of their like daily

40:15.640 --> 40:19.840
routine things they see things they interact with you can just not do the

40:19.840 --> 40:38.840
work did you ever dungeon master when you play D&D yeah that's that's why I

40:38.840 --> 40:44.360
got it oh what's great is you want to play your

40:44.360 --> 40:55.120
card so that eventually you get introduced like this so you gotta play

40:55.120 --> 41:01.920
your guys like this you want to get it so that eventually they say this is Matt

41:01.920 --> 41:24.640
in a really like shameful embarrassing like don't talk to me you seem to be

41:24.640 --> 41:32.520
adventure you found me once more this is my rat don't have rats you can have

41:32.520 --> 42:00.640
rats here was sent in by read Carpenter think you read it's by a green 33% not

42:00.640 --> 42:12.400
bad still failing great green asks is it possible to eat a salt shaker is it

42:12.400 --> 42:16.200
physically possibly for any human being to eat a salt shaker without assistance

42:16.200 --> 42:21.280
like breaking it up beforehand as in actually putting a whole salt shaker in

42:21.280 --> 42:30.800
your mouth chewing it up and swallowing do you ever wonder like when we find

42:30.800 --> 42:35.800
these questions like what circumstance made someone go how about the fucking

42:35.800 --> 42:40.640
coolest like business power move

42:41.440 --> 42:46.240
we're gonna acquire your company for half the price if you ask for no you're

42:46.240 --> 43:06.280
not okay yeah I guess you got a good point yeah can we have the I'm having

43:06.280 --> 43:16.560
salt and there is someone in this country who is having a very great stand

43:16.560 --> 43:44.280
off with a salt shaker I mean some guys like that won't do that I just love that

43:44.280 --> 43:49.840
the question is not is it recommended to eat a salt shaker listen I'm not looking

43:49.840 --> 43:55.440
to cheat by breaking it up ahead of time I know I could do that and that would be

43:55.440 --> 43:59.880
cool can I break it with my teeth the party thinks the salt would be the worst

43:59.880 --> 44:05.440
part all that's all wait not the glass shards of the metal top there's a dude

44:05.440 --> 44:09.120
who like ate an airplane there's like that dude that was on Guinness and he

44:09.120 --> 44:27.120
thought or maybe this Ripley's believe it or not and now I'm saying yeah about

44:27.120 --> 44:31.080
two months ago I was promoted to a new position at my job I love my job and the

44:31.080 --> 44:35.700
trust my boss has put in me but the truth is I often feel like I have no

44:35.700 --> 44:41.160
idea what the fuck I'm doing not only do I not have any previous job experience

44:41.160 --> 44:45.240
in this field but it's not even related to what I went to school for I started

44:45.240 --> 44:48.840
almost completely cold I like to think I'm a fast learner and my bosses seem

44:48.840 --> 44:52.680
happy with my work so far but I still get overwhelmed I worry about earning

44:52.680 --> 44:55.960
the respect of my more experienced co-workers how do you deal with

44:55.960 --> 45:09.440
imposter syndrome and that's from sheep in wolf's clothing on the darkness all

45:09.440 --> 45:15.160
right there's only one option you know what it is right oh yeah you got a fake

45:15.160 --> 45:24.640
you gotta pick big you gotta pick big I know I'm gonna fuck up for a while now

45:24.640 --> 45:28.400
for a good line for two months I know everybody in the office suspected I

45:28.400 --> 45:33.960
don't know what I'm doing I'm 12 I know I know what you're saying you look like

45:33.960 --> 45:38.360
an adult here is this fortune-telling machine

45:38.360 --> 46:06.960
I don't know what

46:08.880 --> 46:15.720
good can you ask for a different job can you do that at a job you got anything

46:15.720 --> 46:25.040
easier can I try boss boss would be cool boss is cool let's trade these I'll be

46:25.040 --> 46:31.240
boss you'd be whatever my job is I'm not entirely sure what if the twist is like

46:31.240 --> 46:37.560
the boss when someone asked you to do something just look at him go well how

46:37.560 --> 46:43.680
would you do it and then when they say but I agree I'm gonna do this that's

46:43.680 --> 46:46.360
what I was gonna say pretty much what I've been doing so thank you

46:46.360 --> 46:50.120
can you show me one time

46:53.400 --> 47:01.400
Susan you're a surgeon you should have said something about your beginning a

47:01.400 --> 47:10.800
long time with many many failed surgeries again maybe because she was

47:10.800 --> 47:15.680
robbed of so many years jumping from 12 to whatever she is now she wants to rock

47:15.680 --> 47:39.240
others it's like dark big big big saw started with your art

47:45.680 --> 47:54.320
what should we get a live one yeah yeah we yes

47:54.320 --> 48:12.640
short walk so we don't need to cover anything what's going on so every

48:12.640 --> 48:15.920
morning my breakfast at the same deli that's like right down the street from

48:15.920 --> 48:21.880
my work goes at this sign that's like a smoothie with Red Bull and I can't

48:21.880 --> 48:26.640
decide whether this is a great idea or the absolute worst idea so brothers I'm

48:26.640 --> 48:33.400
really curious is it how early is too early for soda Steve how early is too

48:33.400 --> 48:36.160
early for diarrhea

48:38.040 --> 48:41.920
we're wearing glasses right now it's like we said five hour energy drinks

48:41.920 --> 48:46.400
backstage before Travis literally said okay you to move that down so you know

48:46.400 --> 48:58.160
redirect your comfort is important we were I realized at what time was it it

48:58.160 --> 49:02.720
would have been about eight o'clock we're eating dinner I realized that like

49:02.720 --> 49:09.280
I have been meaning to take a five-hour energy shot all night and I'm not not

49:09.280 --> 49:15.000
not staying awake any longer than I have to today so I can't have I can't have

49:15.000 --> 49:19.120
shows over at 11 or what-have-you and then still be awake for another two

49:19.120 --> 49:22.920
hours because I took my five-hour energy and Travis says to me fine just take

49:22.920 --> 49:29.600
four hours worth okay here's the thing for a long time I've always wondered if

49:29.600 --> 49:33.720
you do half of a five-hour energy drink do you get two and a half hours of a

49:33.720 --> 49:55.400
hundred percent energy or five hours of like 50% energy but I think that is a

49:55.400 --> 50:03.120
really rough way to get your day started not not the not the actual effects of

50:03.120 --> 50:09.600
it it's fucking gross it's gross it's super gross

50:09.600 --> 50:14.080
what if you come to depend on it then it's like oh that's Steve he drinks a

50:14.080 --> 50:20.960
Red Bull smoothie every night oh that's Steve's morning slop he has to slap that

50:20.960 --> 50:24.160
down his his gullet or else he just can't get started

50:24.160 --> 50:31.440
Steve's a little sweaty he didn't have his glock on his mouth. Don't talk to him, tell him about my glock.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.440
What if that deli shuts down? You'll die.

50:33.440 --> 50:38.440
What else is in this smoothie except Red Bull?

50:38.440 --> 50:42.440
I think it's like strawberry, banana, and kiwi.

50:42.440 --> 50:45.440
Why are you saying those ingredients like they're gross?

50:45.440 --> 50:49.440
It's like kiwi, I don't know, there's definitely Red Bull in them.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.440
That's the good part.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.440
Some kind of fruit?

50:53.440 --> 50:55.440
Are you supposed to put carbonated shit in?

50:55.440 --> 51:01.440
Carbonation is by its very definition not especially smooth.

51:01.440 --> 51:05.440
Listen, smoothies are kind of like freestyle like remixes anyway.

51:05.440 --> 51:09.440
I've thrown celery in smoothies. What? You can do anything.

51:09.440 --> 51:15.440
Wow, putting behind bars. A vegetable?

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
So what do you want me to do?

51:17.440 --> 51:19.440
Don't do it, don't fucking do it.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.440
You should stop other people from doing it.

51:21.440 --> 51:27.440
Everybody scream.

51:27.440 --> 51:30.440
You like this one?

51:30.440 --> 51:31.440
I do like that one.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.440
Travis likes this one so we'll do that.

51:32.440 --> 51:33.440
Sent in by Jennifer Chee.

51:33.440 --> 51:34.440
Thank you Jennifer.

51:34.440 --> 51:35.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

51:35.440 --> 51:39.440
No.

51:39.440 --> 51:40.440
Perfect.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.440
No, asks.

51:42.440 --> 51:46.440
Okay.

51:46.440 --> 51:53.440
Did Darth Vader...

51:53.440 --> 52:02.440
Did Darth Vader still have a penis after the accident?

52:02.440 --> 52:05.440
Some terminology to clear up.

52:05.440 --> 52:08.440
It wasn't really an accident.

52:08.440 --> 52:18.440
Oh, he had the higher ground and he went for him. He got his legs done. I guess the lava was not intentional for either party.

52:18.440 --> 52:25.440
If you're wondering, that's why he was yelling, no.

52:25.440 --> 52:36.440
I think if they have the cybernetic parts for all of his burned out body, then I saw Bicentennial Man and they fucking perfected that shit.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.440
Okay, wait.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.440
What you're telling me is...

52:40.440 --> 52:43.440
Bicentennial Man and Star Wars exist in the same universe.

52:43.440 --> 52:44.440
Right?

52:44.440 --> 52:46.440
But different canons.

52:46.440 --> 52:54.440
What you're telling me is that if Darth Vader were to in one flourish remove his copies, you would see behind him a separate...

52:54.440 --> 52:58.440
Robin Williams penis from Bicentennial Man.

52:58.440 --> 52:59.440
Perfect one to one.

52:59.440 --> 53:06.440
Because listen, they've perfected that technology, but they don't want to risk chopping and screwing it too much.

53:06.440 --> 53:10.440
So you get the same model across and you can get it in a back alley.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.440
Wait, is it the same mechanical penis?

53:12.440 --> 53:13.440
Are you saying...

53:13.440 --> 53:14.440
The past Apple generation.

53:14.440 --> 53:22.440
Are you saying that in a scene where Bicentennial Man dies and the camera goes to the right, you would see Darth Vader go...

53:22.440 --> 53:40.440
I hope somebody was taking pictures of that out of context.

53:40.440 --> 53:41.440
That's exactly...

53:41.440 --> 53:43.440
For those of you listening at home...

53:43.440 --> 53:48.440
Justin stood up and very ludely pointed to his bathing suit region.

53:48.440 --> 53:50.440
To my Bicentennial Ball.

53:50.440 --> 53:56.440
Bicentennial Man's? Is that what I...

53:56.440 --> 53:58.440
I'm gonna stick with Dom.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.440
Stick with Dom.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.440
What?

54:00.440 --> 54:01.440
Dom Pound?

54:01.440 --> 54:02.440
What?

54:02.440 --> 54:03.440
Sorry.

54:03.440 --> 54:07.440
Does Darth Vader have...

54:07.440 --> 54:10.440
I don't think the Empire would have any use for Darth Vader.

54:10.440 --> 54:11.440
Okay, but here's the thing.

54:11.440 --> 54:14.440
If not, he comes up off the table.

54:14.440 --> 54:20.440
As if he's looking at Palpatine and he's like, okay, good, ankle, knees.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.440
What the fuck?

54:21.440 --> 54:29.440
So I'm just gonna pee inside.

54:29.440 --> 54:32.440
Right in the screen.

54:32.440 --> 54:37.440
The good news is I can't drink.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.440
But I'm just gonna pee in the suit.

54:40.440 --> 54:43.440
All right then.

54:43.440 --> 54:47.440
She's always so angry all the time.

54:47.440 --> 54:51.440
I can't stop thinking about Robin Williams' penis.

54:51.440 --> 54:54.440
Because you think about it, because we're thinking about it.

54:54.440 --> 54:58.440
So by the end of this episode, it's just gonna be a recurring string of

54:58.440 --> 55:04.440
referencing Robin Williams' penis and just going...

55:04.440 --> 55:08.440
This is something I'm actively thinking about, Dom.

55:08.440 --> 55:09.440
Because I bet...

55:09.440 --> 55:11.440
No, hear me out.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.440
No!

55:12.440 --> 55:17.440
I bet it's a lot like his knuckles.

55:17.440 --> 55:24.440
But just one.

55:24.440 --> 55:25.440
But just one.

55:25.440 --> 55:30.440
There wouldn't be four.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.440
Yeah.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
I don't even know more.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.440
Is the show done?

55:34.440 --> 55:36.440
Yeah, I think we might be done with the show.

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
No, never.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
I'm gonna keep thinking about Robin Williams' penis all night.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.440
Let's do another...

55:41.440 --> 55:43.440
Do you have any more in your notebook?

55:43.440 --> 55:45.440
What about the...

55:45.440 --> 55:46.440
What is it?

55:46.440 --> 55:47.440
Tuxedo one.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.440
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
Guys, just wait.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.440
You're gonna love this question.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.440
Guaranteed.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.440
It's very good.

55:53.440 --> 55:59.440
Two years ago, I bought a tuxedo for my wedding through an online vendor.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.440
It didn't fit right and wasn't made to be tailored.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.440
So in desperation, I just bought a second one from the department store.

56:04.440 --> 56:09.440
Now I own two tuxedos like I'm some kind of big shot.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.440
I haven't had much luck selling it online.

56:11.440 --> 56:15.440
So what can I do with a second slightly ill-fitting tuxedo?

56:15.440 --> 56:17.440
And that's from Sartorial in San Fran.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.440
Does anybody...

56:18.440 --> 56:19.440
Quick poll.

56:19.440 --> 56:22.440
Does anybody in here own a tuxedo?

56:22.440 --> 56:23.440
There's like five.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.440
That's not a lot of tuxedos.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.440
Owned, though.

56:26.440 --> 56:28.440
This is what I want to understand.

56:28.440 --> 56:31.440
Did they not have renting tuxedos where this guy lives?

56:31.440 --> 56:32.440
What kind of life are you living that you're like,

56:32.440 --> 56:36.440
I'm gonna use this often enough that I need it?

56:36.440 --> 56:39.440
I better get married in a while.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.440
That sounds awesome.

56:40.440 --> 56:41.440
I wish I was living here.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.440
Not really, because I don't really like anything that I've ever been to

56:44.440 --> 56:45.440
where I had to wear a tuxedo.

56:45.440 --> 56:48.440
But I'm sure that you enjoy the satisfaction of design.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.440
No judgment for me.

56:49.440 --> 56:53.440
I think you're gonna need to wear the smaller one and hulk out.

56:53.440 --> 56:59.440
What if he wore the smaller one underneath the bigger one?

56:59.440 --> 57:01.440
Can you imagine the psych addict?

57:01.440 --> 57:02.440
He has warm in here.

57:02.440 --> 57:05.440
He's hot.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
Sweat tux.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.440
My restrictive tux.

57:09.440 --> 57:16.440
Could you build robotics into it and make it like the...

57:16.440 --> 57:20.440
Hey, you are backing into Robin Williams Phoenix.

57:20.440 --> 57:28.440
No one should ever back into Robin Williams Phoenix.

57:28.440 --> 57:31.440
This guy's really taking a beating this episode.

57:31.440 --> 57:32.440
No, I was making...

57:32.440 --> 57:34.440
Anything else?

57:34.440 --> 57:37.440
I was making a super great...

57:37.440 --> 57:40.440
Jackie Chan's the tuxedo.

57:40.440 --> 57:42.440
Jackie Chan.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
He has a magic tuxedo.

57:44.440 --> 57:46.440
It's been a really long time since I've clutched it.

57:46.440 --> 57:51.440
Can you tear one up and use it to fake disasters?

57:51.440 --> 57:54.440
Like you walk into a room in a regular one.

57:54.440 --> 57:57.440
You switch, come out in the destroyed one.

57:57.440 --> 57:58.440
Like, wow, do not go in there.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.440
Woo!

58:00.440 --> 58:04.440
Ate Ventura.

58:04.440 --> 58:06.440
Ate Ventura was like, tuxedo.

58:06.440 --> 58:10.440
He goes...

58:10.440 --> 58:11.440
It's been a weird day, you guys.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.440
Yeah, it's been a long day.

58:13.440 --> 58:18.440
What other movies have tuxedos?

58:18.440 --> 58:20.440
Is there a name?

58:20.440 --> 58:22.440
I think we should be done.

58:22.440 --> 58:31.440
Have we given...

58:31.440 --> 58:32.440
You're on my blood!

58:32.440 --> 58:34.440
Take my blood, negotiator.

58:34.440 --> 58:38.440
No tuxedos in that.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.440
Have you ever noticed how many movies there are without tuxedos in them?

58:41.440 --> 58:46.440
Let's name a few.

58:46.440 --> 58:47.440
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

58:47.440 --> 58:49.440
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

58:49.440 --> 58:51.440
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

58:51.440 --> 58:52.440
Thank you.

58:52.440 --> 58:57.440
Thank you to Michael and Kevin and Ronnie, everybody from the People's Improv Theater.

58:57.440 --> 58:59.440
They have done everything.

58:59.440 --> 59:02.440
We are like babies that they have nurtured all day.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.440
We have no idea what we're doing, and they kept us alive.

59:05.440 --> 59:06.440
They are wonderful.

59:06.440 --> 59:07.440
They have been our heroes.

59:07.440 --> 59:09.440
Thank you so much to you fine people.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.440
The dog pound.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.440
Thank you so much.

59:12.440 --> 59:17.440
And also, I enjoy your friendship.

59:17.440 --> 59:22.440
And thank you to our wives and our dads for being supportive, being in the show.

59:22.440 --> 59:24.440
Our sisters.

59:24.440 --> 59:27.440
Our sisters are wonderful people.

59:27.440 --> 59:35.440
Big thanks to SawBelt for just like, their first day of life.

59:35.440 --> 59:38.440
On your way out the door, make sure to stop by the merch table.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.440
We have a bunch of new merch.

59:39.440 --> 59:40.440
Do this quick because it makes me uncomfortable.

59:40.440 --> 59:41.440
I know.

59:41.440 --> 59:42.440
It was made just for this show.

59:42.440 --> 59:46.440
Eventually, it will be online for sale, but you got the first crack at it.

59:46.440 --> 59:50.440
We got awesome patches, button packs that you guys are going to dig.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.440
Awesome new tote bags.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.440
Pack your bags and move away bag.

59:54.440 --> 59:57.440
On your way out, if nothing else, grab one of these postcards.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.440
It will give you a coupon code for 20% off if you order stuff online.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440
So it's really great.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440
Make sure you grab it.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:09.440
And we'll be out there doing a real quick short meet and greet before we call it a day.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.440
So come see us after the show.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:18.440
Thanks to, I guess, DMX and Sean for all joking along with their smart theme song.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440
X, go and give it to you.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.440
Chopped and screwed by a group from McElroy.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.440
And also, it's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.440
Thank you.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440
Thank you to McElroy for having us.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:34.440
Thank you to New York City.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440
Ah, boy.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440
Good jokes, guys.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.440

Y'all are really going to love this closing group.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.440
We really take it to the bridge here.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440
Get ready.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440
And that's going to do it for us.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440
We're going to have a final one.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.440
Final one was sent in by Thomas Anderson.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.440
Thank you, Thomas.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Victor who asks,

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.440
Does the hologram of Michael Jackson performing last night have a soul?

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:37.440
Thank you, Michael.
