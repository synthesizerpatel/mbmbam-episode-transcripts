00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.400
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.080
I'm your babiest baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Look at all the stars!

00:56.080 --> 01:02.880
Look at the stars! Look at the stars! The stars and the red carpet. In fact, this year,

01:02.880 --> 01:12.400
the red carpet's in Biastin. Come on down to Biastin. Sorry, Biastin? For Oscars 2014 edition,

01:13.440 --> 01:23.760
boy. Yeah, so it's Oscars time for the awards. Movies, let's celebrate them. Come on, movies

01:23.760 --> 01:29.840
and their makers and the people who do them. I felt these dream weavers, these dream weavers,

01:29.840 --> 01:38.000
magic makers, warlocks of celluloid. No one knows how movies are made. They squish it. They press,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.720
the actors press up against the celluloid in the positions that they are supposed to be in,

01:42.720 --> 01:48.880
and that's what a director does. How many of the Academy Award nominated pictures have you guys

01:48.880 --> 01:56.000
seen and enjoyed? Okay, important real question. How many things is Thor 2 nominated for? Because

01:56.000 --> 02:00.960
that was the only movie I saw in theaters this year. Wow, that bumps me out to a huge degree.

02:00.960 --> 02:07.360
Listen, when you're talking about award shows, you get into a lot of opinion. So I think in order to

02:07.360 --> 02:11.520
make our way through this conversation, we should start with just the facts. So for instance,

02:11.520 --> 02:17.600
I'll start with Gravity's the only good movie that came out last year. Hachi-machi. Was it better

02:17.600 --> 02:26.000
than Thor 2? It edged it out just barely. Oh, it was so close. Go down the list of all the other

02:26.000 --> 02:31.360
films, and 12 Years a Slave, I don't know, some of those shots went on a little long.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.080
Filomena, they don't explain what the title means ever in the movie.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.520
Wolf of Wall Street, ate too many breasts in that film.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.720
He ate too many breasts? How many breasts did he eat? That's the thing, he goes mad with money

02:48.720 --> 02:54.720
power. And he's just eating the breasts off women because he's a wolf. The Werewolf of Wall Street.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.320
Wait guys, hold on. This is going to be a thing. The weird thing about that movie is it didn't

02:58.320 --> 03:04.240
have any wolves in it. And I think that's probably my biggest disappointment. I have my favorite

03:04.240 --> 03:10.480
t-shirt that has a wolf on it. I was wearing it and I was ready. I told Sydney before, I thought

03:10.480 --> 03:16.240
it was so funny. I said, I think this is going to be a howling good time. Then there was no wolves

03:16.240 --> 03:22.240
and I was like, oh, okay. Kind of misleading. How long do we have to wait before we can do a remake?

03:23.120 --> 03:31.200
With a wolf in it? Yeah. A wolf in a suit? We have to wait just long enough for wolves to evolve

03:31.200 --> 03:38.800
where they will listen and do anything we say. Anything at all. Just do what we tell you to do,

03:38.800 --> 03:44.000
Wolf. Just fucking come on. White Fang. That was the only one and he wasn't even a wolf, was he?

03:44.000 --> 03:50.240
No, he was like a husky, I think. Balto. That was an animated feature, wasn't it? Also not a wolf.

03:50.800 --> 04:03.120
Iron Will. Iron Fang? No, I think Iron Tooth. Okay. Snow Dogs. Snow Dogs. Okay. Snow Dogs

04:03.120 --> 04:13.520
passed over again for any awards, any recognition. It's actually up for best makeup. Oh, okay. Good.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.320
I thought. Well, they did a great job making that one dog look like Cooper Gooding Jr.

04:18.320 --> 04:26.560
I thought Andy Serkis was so good as those wolves. As all the wolves. Movie Fever. We've got it.

04:26.560 --> 04:33.520
Oscars coming up. Make sure you get your picks in to us when you're listening to this, which is the

04:33.520 --> 04:38.160
day after the Oscars. Just send us- So you should have a real advantage. Send 10 bucks in with your

04:38.160 --> 04:46.320
ballot and we will have that. We'll just have it after that. We'll have that $10 and perfect.

04:46.320 --> 04:52.800
Thus completes the transaction. Thank you for the money in advance and to hold up our end of

04:52.800 --> 05:02.560
the bargain, we're going to help you with some advice. I started attending marital arts classes.

05:03.680 --> 05:10.720
How does it work? Grab your wife by the ankles and dip her head in paint. How does one wife?

05:12.000 --> 05:16.320
I started attending martial arts classes for the first time a couple of years ago. I love it.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.360
And in the last few months, I have finally started to feel as though I can really identify

05:21.360 --> 05:27.120
as a martial artist. My problem is that it seems weird to talk about this hobby that involves

05:27.120 --> 05:33.040
hurting people and or throwing them to the ground. Brothers, when, if ever, is it socially acceptable

05:33.040 --> 05:37.680
to talk about martial arts? That's from White Belt in the Bible Belt, which is-

05:37.680 --> 05:38.880
When you're getting mugged.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.400
When you're good. Before you get mugged, preferably.

05:42.400 --> 05:49.040
Well, how do you- Okay. The mugging interaction begins when somebody like pulls a knife or gun

05:49.040 --> 05:52.720
or a sharp pocket. When you see someone that looks like a mugger.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.840
Oh, great. This is great. So go ahead and list off-

05:55.840 --> 05:58.720
You say sir or madam, because we're not sexist here.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.640
Travis, Justin, I want you to start listing off some characteristics of what muggers look like.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.040
Begin.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.280
A flat cap.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.360
Begin and don't stop until I tell you to stop.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.040
Okay. They have a flat cap.

06:09.040 --> 06:09.360
Terrific.

06:09.360 --> 06:14.640
They have a grisly sort of like half beard. They have scars. They're holding a lead pipe.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.400
They are very large, very rotund.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.600
You could have just described like a construction worker or plumber.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.640
They're kind of like a construction worker or plumber, but they have a

06:25.280 --> 06:29.200
cigar stub and they call you Mac. They say, hey Mac.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.240
You are just going down the line of-

06:30.240 --> 06:33.520
Wait, are you talking about a mugger or someone who's trying to intimidate me for the mob?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.880
Yeah, a little bit of- Yeah, it's all the same thing.

06:36.880 --> 06:37.360
Okay.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.560
But yeah, that's what a mugger looks like.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.520
Wow. Okay.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.240
My perfect mugger wears a black mask.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.640
He's got a black and white striped shirt and maybe he's holding a gun

06:50.640 --> 06:52.640
and like a bag with a money sign on it.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.040
And he's got the ball and chain like around his ankle, right?

06:57.040 --> 06:58.800
Uh-huh. That's my ideal mugger.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.200
And maybe he's like in the process of like running away, but he's frozen in place and

07:03.200 --> 07:05.760
there's a little dust cloud coming out from behind him.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.920
Yeah. Griffin, who's your ideal mugger?

07:07.920 --> 07:11.120
I would just, I would have to say Bradley Whitford.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.120
Yeah. It seems like you could talk to him, you know?

07:15.120 --> 07:15.600
Yeah.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.320
And you know he's just doing it to like support his family?

07:18.320 --> 07:19.680
Sure. No, he has his reasons.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.360
There's probably a stigma about adults just getting into martial arts.

07:27.360 --> 07:32.320
Like don't get me wrong, if you are like an adult who is already sick at martial arts,

07:32.320 --> 07:36.880
that's pretty fucking cool. Tony Jaa, what's up Tony Jaa?

07:36.880 --> 07:39.600
I don't think that it is just relegated to martial arts.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
Cause I think that's true of like, if you were an adult who was just getting into skateboarding,

07:43.600 --> 07:49.040
like if you're Tony Hawk, you're awesome. If you're like 35 year old dude who's like,

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
I'm going to try skateboarding for the first time.

07:51.040 --> 07:51.360
Sure.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.440
You're going to have to do that in private for a while.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.240
Or if you're like, I'm going to take up break dancing. You know what I mean?

07:56.800 --> 08:00.720
Have we had this conversation before? I'm getting the weirdest deja vu right now.

08:00.720 --> 08:07.920
No, it's because Travis and I had to talk you out of beginning to take Muay Thai classes.

08:07.920 --> 08:14.080
Uh, I, well, I, I, I saw the raid and I really want to get into Indonesian martial arts.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.280
I don't think that that's so wrong.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.120
Why wouldn't you?

08:17.120 --> 08:19.440
It's a weird scene because I have,

08:19.440 --> 08:23.200
I have a lot of questions about how adults start getting into martial arts.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.120
And question number one, is there an adults only martial arts class?

08:27.120 --> 08:32.240
Because if not, that's not especially fair. Like, come here, you 12 year old little sweaty fuck.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.760
It seems like it would really give you an overinflated sense of your abilities.

08:35.760 --> 08:40.080
Yeah. Yeah. Except for three ninjas. Hi. That exists.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.280
Shit. You're right.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.200
So I don't think it's that big of an advantage.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.920
Three ninjas versus three Tony Jaws. Go.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.120
Tony Jaws because he's a robot.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.720
He's yeah. He's the strongest man on earth.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.560
So was the youngest three ninja.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.080
That's damn it. You're right.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.960
They don't make his, they don't make his that cute. I mean, they do make them.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.040
They manufacture them in Hollywood.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.160
What do you guys think that Rocky Colt and Tom Tom are doing at this moment?

09:02.160 --> 09:02.660
Yeah.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.640
Searching Wikipedia for the names of the three ninjas, I would assume.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.080
No, I knew that off the top of my head.

09:11.520 --> 09:22.240
I think that it's not that it's weird so much as I don't think anybody gives a shit.

09:22.240 --> 09:28.560
And it's not just martial arts. I just don't think that anybody wants to know about like,

09:28.560 --> 09:32.240
you don't, nobody wants to hear about what's going on in your life.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.840
They want to talk about themselves.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.760
No, the appropriate time to answer the question,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.720
the appropriate time to bring it up is when someone asks.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.720
Yeah. Or in conversation, if someone starts talking about martial arts,

09:43.280 --> 09:47.360
then I think it's okay to lean into it there.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.720
But how often does that, that guy's going to be like, oh my God, thank God.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.640
Oh man, I've been wanting to talk to you about this for a while.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.960
Holding his breath for the last like five minutes

09:54.960 --> 09:57.200
as they slowly started talking about hobbies.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.880
I mean, does anyone kick for a hobby?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.120
I mean, if you're doing it so you can tell people that you're doing it,

10:03.120 --> 10:05.280
then you're doing it for the wrong reasons.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.560
I think you're doing it for yourself.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.440
So to bring yourself peace of mind and maybe a little physical fitness.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.400
And in that context, you know, you can keep it to yourself.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
It doesn't need to be anybody else's.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.800
But Justin, let me counterpoint. I'm sorry to interrupt,

10:18.800 --> 10:22.720
but if it's something that he's just started doing and he's really excited about,

10:22.720 --> 10:24.240
of course he wants to share it with people

10:24.240 --> 10:26.800
because it's something new and exciting in his life.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.680
I don't think he's necessarily doing it to tell people about it

10:29.680 --> 10:32.080
so much as it is an awesome new thing that he's like,

10:32.080 --> 10:34.640
guys, I'm doing this and it makes me totally happy.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.160
Moreover, Justin, let's go down the line of all the hobbies

10:38.160 --> 10:40.960
that I know that you have picked up in the past year.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.200
Fuchigi, juicing.

10:43.200 --> 10:43.600
Correct.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.520
Amateur beer brewing.

10:46.640 --> 10:47.840
Gone on that for a bit.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.560
Now Griffin-

10:48.560 --> 10:49.840
Where was geocaching in there?

10:49.840 --> 10:50.480
Geocaching.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.200
Geocaching.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.680
Now let me twist this back around on you, right?

10:53.680 --> 10:56.800
If I had not talked about that, would you have had that list to throw in my face?

10:57.680 --> 10:59.600
I believe my point is made.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.520
I'm saying the only point I'm trying to make is that there is definitely a stigma to adults

11:05.520 --> 11:06.480
just getting into-

11:06.480 --> 11:09.520
If next time we're all three in town and dad's like,

11:09.520 --> 11:13.120
oh boys, I meant to tell you that I'm a brown belt in Taekwondo.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.320
We would be like, hey pops, that's fucking crazy.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.280
And then he would throw us across the room.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.880
Yeah, he would use our own weight against us, like water.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.640
Our dad is like water.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.960
He's the water, water avatar.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.360
What's the, what's they call them in water avatar?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.600
An avatar is a water man.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.840
He uses a water and he bends it.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.640
You guys want Yahoo?

11:39.920 --> 11:40.240
Yes.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.640
I don't think you really do.

11:43.200 --> 11:43.680
I do.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.360
I do, I do.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.480
This Yahoo was sent in by Joe Smith.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.440
Thanks Joe, it's by Yahoo answers user poncho crook who asks,

11:52.640 --> 11:56.240
how long will the people at Olive Garden grate your cheese or ground your pepper?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.920
They say, say when, if you want them to stop grinding your pepper,

11:59.920 --> 12:01.920
what happens if you never say when?

12:01.920 --> 12:02.560
You own them.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.440
You own the Olive Garden?

12:05.440 --> 12:08.320
They have to just stay with you the whole time in your life.

12:08.320 --> 12:08.400
It's a life bond.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.680
You just carry the bowl with you.

12:10.480 --> 12:10.800
I mean, they'll run out-

12:10.800 --> 12:12.080
It's a life debt?

12:12.080 --> 12:12.480
Yeah.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.080
It's not infinite cheese, right?

12:14.080 --> 12:16.080
As much as that, don't get me wrong, that's the dream.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.120
Well, you have to tell them to do it super slowly.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.200
Not so fast.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.360
What's your rush?

12:23.360 --> 12:25.040
How will I know when to say when?

12:25.680 --> 12:26.720
Where's the fire?

12:28.880 --> 12:30.560
Hey Daniel, where's the fire?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.640
And occasionally you gotta say, you're doing a great job.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.200
One flake at a time, my man.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.840
Does anybody else get super stressed out in this situation?

12:37.840 --> 12:38.080
Yeah.

12:39.440 --> 12:44.720
You're worried about how much cheese and or pepper is gonna optimize this pasta for me?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.320
Cause I'm all about pasta optimization.

12:47.680 --> 12:54.160
But also how much is too much pasta-mization that the Olive Garden employee,

12:54.160 --> 13:00.800
I just call it the garden, that this garden cheese jockey is gonna be like,

13:01.600 --> 13:04.800
oh Jesus dude, like save some for the future.

13:04.800 --> 13:12.240
I think you're always, in my mind, I'm always weighing my desire for parm

13:12.240 --> 13:16.000
versus the judgment of the cheese jockey.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
So in my head, I mean, I may look calm, collected, ready to get into some Alfredo,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.200
but in my head I'm thinking, no whammies, no whammies, no whammies, stop.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.120
But what if you say stop too soon?

13:27.120 --> 13:28.240
He's like, oh, that's it, huh?

13:28.240 --> 13:30.960
Well, that's not gonna optimize the pasta, but okay, bye forever.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.480
I mean, the dream is always that when you say when,

13:34.480 --> 13:38.720
lights start flashing and balloons fall from the ceiling and come out like, you've done it.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.280
You did it.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.840
You were the first person to solve the pasta.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.080
To the nanosecond.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.040
You got it right.

13:45.040 --> 13:45.520
That is a weird-

13:45.520 --> 13:46.800
You are the chosen one.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.800
That is a weird point, right?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.840
At some point during the Olive Garden experience,

13:52.640 --> 13:55.520
they have decided to pass the reins on to me.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.200
You finished cooking this.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.160
You have been the pasta expert.

14:00.720 --> 14:05.920
You've been the midwife of this pasta experience from conception

14:05.920 --> 14:09.760
and now here at the very end, right before delivery, you're asking me to take the reins.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.760
That's pretty experienced though.

14:11.760 --> 14:16.240
You get to run it in the extra half a yard into the pasta end zone.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.880
I'll go into the flavor end zone.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.200
I'll take it the last few yards.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.680
Well, they know that you need it.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.040
You haven't got a lot going on right now and you haven't had a lot to celebrate

14:27.040 --> 14:28.880
and they're like, I'm gonna let him have this.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.200
And maybe you just need to impress your friends.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.120
Like, oh man, did you see how much pepper Ron put on his pasta?

14:35.120 --> 14:38.560
That was like to the flake, the perfect amount.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.120
I wanna blow this out.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.280
I think that they shouldn't stop at cheese.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.520
I think they should basically come to your table

14:45.520 --> 14:49.280
with a pot of stewed tomatoes and pasta uncooked

14:49.280 --> 14:52.400
and then they walk you through each step of the experience.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.080
Okay, we're getting towards al dente.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.880
You want me to pop that out or just a little bit perfect?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.680
Like have a carpenter there going, how tall do you want your table?

15:00.480 --> 15:03.120
Say when, how wide should the chair be?

15:03.120 --> 15:03.600
Say when.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.760
Can they make a Top Chef season that is just this?

15:07.760 --> 15:10.640
Like for today's quick fire challenge,

15:11.280 --> 15:13.520
we're gonna put some sprinkles on the ice cream.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.320
Go for it.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.400
Too many sprinkles, Danielle.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.120
Nice try.

15:18.560 --> 15:18.880
No.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.720
I would love it if after you said when,

15:20.720 --> 15:25.280
the waiter just leaned over and quietly but derisively said, you ruined it.

15:26.320 --> 15:31.200
Or helpfully was like, hey man, I'm gonna give you a mulligan,

15:31.760 --> 15:36.080
but you're gonna wanna go like a few seconds richer on this cheese.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.360
I don't wanna tell you how to optimize your cheese game.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.320
I don't think anyone saw you fuck up so bad just now.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.440
So I'm just gonna lean back and I'm gonna start going again

15:47.440 --> 15:49.040
and we're gonna pretend like this never happened, okay?

15:50.960 --> 15:53.200
I think if I were a cheese jockey,

15:53.200 --> 15:57.280
I would really employ the phrase, are you sure a lot?

15:57.280 --> 15:58.640
When, are you sure?

15:59.760 --> 16:00.640
Is that really all you want?

16:01.440 --> 16:02.880
You want a mound of pepper.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.280
There is a soft mound.

16:05.280 --> 16:11.360
I guarantee there is another Olive Garden vet listening to this

16:11.360 --> 16:14.960
who has had to pull the emergency brake

16:14.960 --> 16:18.400
and just say like, that's enough cheese.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.880
Did you, was that, you were a line cook, right?

16:20.880 --> 16:21.920
That was, yes.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.840
I never made it out to the big show.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.480
You pre-cheese.

16:25.440 --> 16:29.280
You were in charge of the pre-pro on that cheese.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.560
Yeah, I don't know why at some point it got taken away from me,

16:32.560 --> 16:36.640
the professional chef, and got handed over to the waiter.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.920
Like they're gonna kibitz that last bit.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.280
I just don't, I don't appreciate it.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.880
What if that's not like,

16:42.880 --> 16:46.000
what if the line cook has no idea that that's happening

16:46.000 --> 16:47.360
and just somewhere along the lines,

16:47.360 --> 16:49.360
Olive Garden like upper management was like,

16:49.360 --> 16:51.600
they're not putting enough cheese and pepper on this.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.520
Let's put it in the hands of the waiter.

16:53.520 --> 16:53.760
Yeah.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.880
Don't tell them though.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.920
Don't tell the line cooks.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.120
You're saying that somewhere in the Olive Garden chain,

16:59.120 --> 17:02.000
there's a line chef that nobody wanted to fuck with.

17:02.000 --> 17:02.800
Yeah.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.280
I cannot have another conversation with that man.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.120
Listen, we'll just take care of it afterwards.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.680
We'll post game it.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.640
It'll be fine.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.680
We'll fix it in post.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.440
I don't think that they would,

17:15.440 --> 17:16.560
I mean, they would probably,

17:17.440 --> 17:22.480
they would probably stop at some point and sort of force you.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.080
I think the inertia has to go back to them at some point

17:26.080 --> 17:29.360
where they would stop at some place that felt natural

17:29.360 --> 17:31.200
and then sort of ask you like,

17:31.200 --> 17:32.480
are you sure?

17:32.480 --> 17:34.000
Like they make you say it.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.360
Are you fucking with me?

17:36.720 --> 17:37.280
Are you sure?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.360
This entire restaurant is full of pepper.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.640
Like every square inch of it is pepper now.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.520
Are you sure?

17:44.240 --> 17:46.000
Your table mates have left.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.280
Your bowl has broken under the weight of all this pepper.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.440
Are you sure about this?

17:51.440 --> 17:54.960
How great would it be if while they're grinding the Parmesan,

17:54.960 --> 17:57.760
you open up a little baggie underneath the grinder

17:59.040 --> 17:59.840
to keep going?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.600
This is for Yeater.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.000
Say that.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.440
This is for Yeater.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.040
Why would you say Yeater?

18:09.040 --> 18:10.720
I want it Yeater.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.440
Okay.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.120
More Parmy peas.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.680
I'll say you're dressed like an adult teen baby.

18:18.400 --> 18:18.880
Oh boy.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.280
Cheese me peas.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.800
Next, next question.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.200
Peas.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.440
When he stopped and you look at him

18:27.440 --> 18:29.600
and you say right to his face,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.280
got any more cheese?

18:31.280 --> 18:33.840
And only then does he realize he was dressed like Steve Urkel.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.200
Oh man.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.800
How embarrassing for him.

18:37.600 --> 18:38.880
Not for you at all.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.400
Not embarrassing for you at all.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.040
Only for him in that situation.

18:43.040 --> 18:43.920
Oh boy.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.040
Where's Ashton?

18:45.040 --> 18:45.600
Where is he?

18:46.320 --> 18:47.280
Get out of here.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.480
He's across the table from me.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.000
Him and Jaleel White are best friends.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.320
Here's the scenario.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.160
I'm at a red light.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.200
It's very late night.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.800
There are no other cars in sight.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.760
I am certain there are no red light cameras

18:59.760 --> 19:01.280
or police officers around.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.240
Can I just go?

19:03.200 --> 19:05.680
Would I be breaking any kind of driving etiquette?

19:05.680 --> 19:07.200
That's from ANSI in Austin.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.840
I swear to God we've talked about this before.

19:09.840 --> 19:10.160
Really?

19:11.440 --> 19:13.040
I'm almost certain that we have.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.240
If we have, it's been so long that we've forgotten

19:16.240 --> 19:18.080
and maybe we've grown and matured.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.040
Maybe, but like I see people quoting shit from three episodes ago

19:21.040 --> 19:22.720
and I'm like, I don't remember that at all.

19:22.720 --> 19:27.120
So I don't think our memory is as unimpeachable.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.000
Do you guys ever do this?

19:28.800 --> 19:29.040
No.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.120
You know why?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.720
Because I'm not a fucking criminal.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.360
There is a light that is right next to the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company house

19:37.360 --> 19:40.960
that frequently, I would say like once or twice a week, breaks

19:41.760 --> 19:47.200
and will not turn green for the person trying to turn on to the street.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.960
I've sat there through seven minutes

19:50.960 --> 19:54.800
and watched the other two lights change green while it stayed red

19:54.800 --> 19:58.640
and it kind of forces you to make that Pete and Pete bus driver decision

19:58.640 --> 20:00.240
of like, am I gonna do it?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.280
Am I going for it?

20:02.400 --> 20:02.960
I mean, yes.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.960
If your other option is wait and die of old age or starvation,

20:06.960 --> 20:09.040
then yeah, I guess go ahead and break this law.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.600
But here's the crazy thing about it, Griffin.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.560
It always happens that somebody pulls up behind me

20:14.560 --> 20:16.720
just as I make the decision to go.

20:16.720 --> 20:20.320
So all they see is me running a red light.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.120
Is there anything more exciting than seeing somebody run a red light?

20:23.840 --> 20:25.920
I always assume there's a police chase.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.560
Oh, no, no.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.360
For me, it's like, what's he doing?

20:29.360 --> 20:33.360
Oh, if another car had been coming, oh no, that would have been bad.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.720
Crazy motherfucker.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.880
Like, it's like I witnessed a bank robbery.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.440
But there's also a part of you that like is so envious.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.920
Like, man, to have a life where you can just do that,

20:42.480 --> 20:45.360
to just run it, you know, go for it.

20:45.360 --> 20:49.120
I find that it's completely legal if you say out loud,

20:49.120 --> 20:50.640
I'm just gonna go.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.240
I'm like, then it's totally cool.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.880
And if you get pulled over, you say like, no, I announced it.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.360
That's pre-crime then, right?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.200
That's what Minority Report is about.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.040
You announcing that you're about,

21:01.040 --> 21:03.440
I'm just gonna stab this guy eight times.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.000
Okay, cool.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.640
You can be sure there are no cars or stoplight cameras,

21:08.640 --> 21:12.880
but like, what about extremely fast people?

21:12.880 --> 21:18.640
Yeah, you can't see if there's like a really speedy toddler

21:19.440 --> 21:21.600
chasing like a beautiful butterfly.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.200
That is a fast toddler.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.200
Like a really fast toddler.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.920
And even like faster, very directed butterfly.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.440
Like baby Tony Jaa.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.120
Yeah, if baby Tony Jaa,

21:33.120 --> 21:36.960
what if you had prematurely ended the career of baby Tony Jaa

21:36.960 --> 21:39.680
because he sprinted out in front of you chasing a butterfly?

21:40.640 --> 21:41.920
Butterflies, peas.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.400
I'm gonna kick him with my knee.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.240
That's what he does.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.360
He kicks things with his knees.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.200
That's like his whole shtick.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.000
That's his bit.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.040
Hey, it's a good bit, man.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.120
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.200
I think I've probably done this a couple,

21:59.200 --> 22:02.080
like if it's late at night and I'm sure there's somebody around.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.280
You're a little drunk.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.400
I'll go for it.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.640
No, like definitely not then.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.840
When I drink and drive is the only time I focus, you know?

22:09.840 --> 22:11.600
Don't say that.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.360
There are many levels.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.720
The only time I feel alive, you know what I mean?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.000
Don't say that.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.880
Don't say any of this.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.080
I don't mean any of it.

22:18.080 --> 22:18.880
I don't drink anymore.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.240
My wife's 17 weeks pregnant.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.240
She's what?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.160
She's 17 weeks pregnant.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.280
That's super long, isn't it?

22:27.280 --> 22:28.640
It thought it was only 12.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.200
Read a book.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.600
Okay, you do need to read a book.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.320
He's right.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.440
I need your help in being a little mean to someone.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.520
I recently found out that a friend of mine

22:37.520 --> 22:40.320
was kicked out of his dorm suite for getting scarily,

22:40.320 --> 22:42.880
belligerently drunk and threatening his roommates

22:42.880 --> 22:44.480
who are also friends of mine.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.000
Campus security had to deal with him.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.120
He seemed normal since then, but I find it seriously creepy.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.160
Can I just ghost it and stop speaking to him?

22:52.160 --> 22:54.000
Or do I have to offer explanation?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.720
That's from not good at confrontation in New York.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.080
I mean, if you ghost it, that's explanation enough.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.360
He knows what he did.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.560
That sucks.

23:02.560 --> 23:06.240
I feel like your only mistake was not immediately ghosting it

23:06.240 --> 23:07.440
right after that happened.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.080
At the same time, let's go walk this back a little bit.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.640
If you're somebody's friend,

23:16.640 --> 23:19.360
and I can understand that some people just have,

23:19.920 --> 23:22.320
some people just have that evil inside of them,

23:22.320 --> 23:24.240
and you can see it, you can sense it, you can feel it,

23:24.240 --> 23:25.760
but this guy's friend,

23:25.760 --> 23:28.320
he's obviously got a substance abuse problem.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.840
I think it's worth a convo to at least,

23:31.840 --> 23:34.720
even if you are 100% committed to cutting ties,

23:34.720 --> 23:37.920
at least to say, hey, just so you know,

23:37.920 --> 23:40.480
I'm not comfortable being around you

23:40.480 --> 23:42.880
until you get your life fixed.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.120
Because one of the things you hear

23:45.120 --> 23:48.560
in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on TV

23:49.120 --> 23:51.920
is that I lost all my friends, blah, blah, blah.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.440
That guy's not gonna be able to say that

23:53.440 --> 23:56.160
if you don't tell him that that's why he lost his friends.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.680
He might just assume that you moved.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.800
I'm like, I'll cut someone out.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.040
I'll get out the fucking liquid paper

24:03.040 --> 24:05.040
if it's deserved.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.880
But I think you're right.

24:06.880 --> 24:07.760
I think in this case,

24:08.800 --> 24:12.560
this person probably needs somebody

24:12.560 --> 24:15.040
to tell them how completely,

24:15.040 --> 24:17.440
I mean, they probably know how unacceptable that is,

24:17.440 --> 24:20.160
but they need to know that their actions

24:20.160 --> 24:23.200
have impacted other people on a serious level.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.360
You know what, I'm going to retroactively agree

24:25.360 --> 24:26.240
with you guys.

24:26.240 --> 24:26.480
Yeah.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.440
I concur.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.960
Speak to the man, if nothing else,

24:28.960 --> 24:33.200
to say this is why it would be difficult to be friends

24:33.200 --> 24:34.400
with you right now,

24:34.400 --> 24:39.760
but if you deal with it and it ceases to be an issue,

24:39.760 --> 24:41.040
I'd love to hang out with you again.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.480
And you know what?

24:42.480 --> 24:45.840
Is it gonna be like an easy, comfortable conversation?

24:45.840 --> 24:48.960
No, but these are the kinds of conversations

24:48.960 --> 24:50.880
that make, if not your friendship,

24:50.880 --> 24:53.360
at least you, stronger.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.240
You have to build up a tolerance for stuff like this

24:56.240 --> 24:58.800
because at some point you're gonna get out of college

24:58.800 --> 25:02.160
and you're gonna get into full-blown adulthood.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.960
And if you don't start having conversations like this,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.600
it's basically like you're building up warrants,

25:07.600 --> 25:08.800
emotional warrants,

25:08.800 --> 25:11.280
and you're just gonna be on the lam your whole life,

25:11.280 --> 25:14.240
running from emotional town to emotional town,

25:14.240 --> 25:16.640
trying to stay one step ahead of the emotional law.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.240
And right now you could just pay your debt

25:20.240 --> 25:21.840
to emotional society.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.000
You got a little bit lost in that metaphor, didn't you?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.840
Yeah, well, it got a little ahead of me, yeah.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.040
Yeah, and have the conversation.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.000
You'll be tougher for it.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.200
You might help this guy out.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.000
And your friendship, if you decide to preserve it,

25:34.000 --> 25:34.640
it's gonna be better.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.840
That's gonna be tough, man.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.600
I know, but I don't have to fucking do it.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.440
All I have to do is tell him what to do.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.360
Hey, can I throw something out?

25:43.360 --> 25:45.680
I think that writing him a letter,

25:48.320 --> 25:50.320
if you do not feel prepared or ready

25:50.320 --> 25:52.000
to have a face-to-face conversation,

25:52.800 --> 25:54.480
a letter is the next best option

25:54.480 --> 25:56.960
as opposed to a text message or an email.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.040
Because a letter says, I cared enough

25:59.040 --> 26:01.440
to put the time in to do this.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.880
And it's something that he can reference back to

26:04.880 --> 26:06.240
should he ever have a tough moment.

26:06.240 --> 26:10.320
I just feel like if somebody's in this situation,

26:13.680 --> 26:15.840
it is probably not a one-sided issue.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.840
I have known very few people who abused alcohol

26:19.840 --> 26:22.000
where the whole story was, I just love it.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.000
It tastes so good in my mouth.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.800
It tastes great, and I feel great.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.640
That's very rarely the whole story.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.360
And if Travis is right,

26:32.240 --> 26:34.640
if you are completely opposed to having the conversation,

26:35.200 --> 26:38.000
some sort of written communique would be,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.280
I mean, at the very least, novel.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.760
Better than a Facebook poke.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.000
Certainly, certainly better than that.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.440
A telling Facebook poke.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.000
And if it helps, it doesn't just have to be like,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.680
I'm cutting you out because of this,

26:49.680 --> 26:50.880
deal with it and get back to me.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.880
It can be like, hey, if you're going through something

26:52.880 --> 26:55.360
and if there's other issues you want to talk about,

26:55.360 --> 26:58.160
I'm there for you, but I want to support you.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.240
But only via written communication.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.760
If you can employ some sort of Pony Express delivery system.

27:03.760 --> 27:07.040
I've included a self-addressed stamped envelope.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.480
Sorry, so sloppy.

27:08.480 --> 27:13.040
Ralph, can you get that person back in your group after they...

27:13.040 --> 27:14.000
It's not the drinking.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.720
The belligerently drunk part is obviously not ideal,

27:18.720 --> 27:23.600
but to me, the real sticking point is the threatening

27:24.240 --> 27:29.040
your other friends because that just seems like a long road

27:29.040 --> 27:29.760
to hoe to get...

27:30.720 --> 27:32.560
If one of my friends was like, I'm gonna kick your ass,

27:33.760 --> 27:36.240
I don't know that I would ever be like,

27:37.040 --> 27:38.880
hey, let's go bowling.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.360
I mean, Travis knocked a guy out with a bowling pin once.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.200
But that was on accident.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.720
Well, you hit him in the head with a bowling pin.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.040
But I accidentally knocked him out.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.320
He was wearing a football helmet.

27:52.320 --> 27:52.800
Can we point...

27:52.800 --> 27:54.160
Travis isn't like a mugger.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.920
That was probably our worst college game.

27:59.200 --> 28:03.440
And that beats out our game Lockjaw,

28:03.440 --> 28:07.120
where you kept your fist six inches from somebody's face,

28:07.120 --> 28:10.480
shouted Lockjaw at them so they would lock their jaws

28:10.480 --> 28:12.000
and then you punch them in the face.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.440
Now, that was a hit game.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.520
Does it beat Fireworks Bathroom?

28:16.320 --> 28:18.400
Sorry, remind me about Fireworks Bathroom.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.720
Wasn't Fireworks Bathroom the game

28:20.720 --> 28:23.040
that you used to play over at Jason's?

28:23.040 --> 28:24.160
Where someone was in the bathroom

28:24.160 --> 28:25.760
when you throw a firecracker in there.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.480
No, I thought they cut up a bunch of fireworks

28:28.480 --> 28:29.840
and then emptied it in the sink

28:29.840 --> 28:32.320
and then everyone stood in the bathroom

28:32.320 --> 28:34.160
and then they lit the sink

28:34.160 --> 28:37.600
and then the last person in the bathroom won the game.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.360
Yeah, the last person to leave the bathroom.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.640
That was a great game.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.760
Another hit one was when we bought a lobster

28:43.760 --> 28:49.360
and made the lobster fight Jason's iguana for its freedom.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.520
And if it won the fight, we wouldn't eat it.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.880
We'd eat the iguana instead.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.560
So of all those games, the worst was probably the one

28:59.120 --> 29:02.080
where one guy would wear a football helmet

29:02.080 --> 29:03.440
and the other guy would hit him in the head

29:03.440 --> 29:04.640
with a bowling pin.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.040
It's probably showing some level of restraint,

29:08.160 --> 29:09.200
save Travis.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.720
Travis was eager to impress

29:11.440 --> 29:14.720
and he would just clobber the guy.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.160
So yeah, you may have seen this guy on-

29:20.160 --> 29:20.640
That's what we're saying.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.400
We know we just made it sound like a lot of fun

29:22.400 --> 29:23.920
for the past minute and a half, but-

29:23.920 --> 29:24.960
Yeah, so don't drink.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.080
It sounds like fun.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.360
But in Travis's defense, Brandon McCoy,

29:29.360 --> 29:31.440
the guy he hit, ended up on Veep.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.560
So what's up now?

29:33.760 --> 29:35.520
I guess Travis really helped him out.

29:35.520 --> 29:35.840
Travis bashed-

29:35.840 --> 29:36.720
You're welcome, Brandon.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.440
Travis bashed some acting smarts into his dome.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.280
Should we go to the money sign?

29:41.280 --> 29:41.600
We should.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.920
I know you've tried Hulu.com,

29:53.920 --> 29:55.440
literally everyone on earth has,

29:56.160 --> 30:00.640
but HuluPlus.com is way, way better.

30:00.640 --> 30:03.680
It's like Hulu Plus' sexier older brother.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.480
He knows where to buy alcohol

30:06.480 --> 30:09.040
and he is a cool guy that you can hang with

30:09.040 --> 30:10.720
for just $8 a month.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.480
You're saying it's the Justin of Hulus.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.120
It's the Justin of Hulus.

30:16.000 --> 30:16.960
Yes, and he-

30:16.960 --> 30:19.280
He's taking a philosophy class in college

30:19.280 --> 30:21.120
and he can talk to you all day long

30:21.120 --> 30:22.480
about the meaning of life and shit.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.480
He's got a little mustache.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.360
He knows, he's ready to show you SNL,

30:27.360 --> 30:30.080
Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank and Scandal

30:30.080 --> 30:31.040
over at his house.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.920
And he'll let you watch every episode.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.960
He'll loan you his copies of Law & Order,

30:36.960 --> 30:39.680
SVU, Doctor Who, Lost and Community.

30:39.680 --> 30:40.880
Let you watch all of them.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.280
You know what?

30:41.280 --> 30:43.040
He's been taking some film classes too

30:43.040 --> 30:45.920
and he's created a couple of original Hulu programs

30:45.920 --> 30:48.400
like The Wrong Man's and Behind the Mask,

30:48.400 --> 30:50.000
which is his new docu-series

30:50.000 --> 30:52.320
that takes you inside the world of sports mascots.

30:52.320 --> 30:55.360
Also, he smells like aged leathers.

30:55.360 --> 30:58.160
He's got access to ad-free movies,

30:58.160 --> 30:59.360
one would hope,

30:59.360 --> 31:01.040
and some kids content,

31:01.040 --> 31:04.080
which is perhaps questionable, but hey.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.760
He's learning and growing.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.720
You know, he works with Big Brother's Little Sisters.

31:08.720 --> 31:09.600
He works with Big Brother's-

31:09.600 --> 31:10.720
What is that program called?

31:10.720 --> 31:12.400
Sorry, it's not what you said.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.560
And he's gonna hang with you.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.480
The best part is he's gonna hang with you

31:18.480 --> 31:20.800
for two weeks for free

31:20.800 --> 31:23.920
if you go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

31:24.960 --> 31:25.360
Otherwise-

31:25.360 --> 31:27.280
Huluplus.com slash my brother

31:27.280 --> 31:29.200
for an extended free trial.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.160
His usual hang fee is $7.99 a month,

31:32.160 --> 31:33.680
which is already really good

31:33.680 --> 31:35.040
for the amount of stuff you're gonna get,

31:35.680 --> 31:37.040
but you can get it for two weeks free.

31:38.160 --> 31:38.640
Peep it.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.600
Hey guys, don't know if you know,

31:39.600 --> 31:42.800
but it is National Start Your Business Month.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.360
Is it really?

31:43.360 --> 31:44.480
All that that implies.

31:45.520 --> 31:45.840
Yes.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.160
I'm ready to start some business.

31:48.160 --> 31:48.720
I'm gonna start getting busy.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.240
I'm gonna start business with you,

31:50.240 --> 31:51.520
start business with that guy.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.160
Get busy.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.400
And so for this month only,

31:54.400 --> 31:55.760
you can take advantage of LegalZoom's

31:55.760 --> 31:57.680
National Start Your Business Month special

31:57.680 --> 31:59.360
and get a free three month trial

31:59.360 --> 32:00.560
of the all new QuickBooks.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.120
Holy crap.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.840
That's $119 value free

32:05.840 --> 32:07.200
when you enter my brother

32:07.200 --> 32:08.640
into the referral box at checkout.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.440
No big deal.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.360
Don't say we never gave you anything.

32:11.360 --> 32:17.120
Enjoy this $120 that we just had for you to have.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.800
Holy shit.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.560
LegalZoom provides self-help services

32:20.560 --> 32:22.560
and can connect you with the right attorney,

32:22.560 --> 32:24.240
but they're not a law firm.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.080
So go check out LegalZoom.com

32:26.080 --> 32:27.600
and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.920
It's an incredible deal.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.680
So why wouldn't you do it, stupid?

32:31.680 --> 32:33.440
Go get that free shit, you dumb idiot.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.040
Come on.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.520
I got another message for Justin

32:38.400 --> 32:41.280
and this is coming straight at you from Sarah.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.800
This is not for me.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.320
It's for another Justin.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.960
She says, happy first anniversary, Justin.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.640
Now don't get confused.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.960
She's talking about this other Justin.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.800
I have been married for over seven years.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.720
I'm not crazy about this.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.920
I have to go through life ignoring the fact

32:57.920 --> 33:00.720
that Justin Long exists, Justin Timberlake,

33:00.720 --> 33:01.920
and that one's tough for me

33:01.920 --> 33:04.560
because I like his music and I like his acting.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.720
I am a little miffed at you for acknowledging his existence.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.040
I've asked you several times not to do so.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.360
Sarah says of this other Justin who apparently exists,

33:15.360 --> 33:17.760
I hope hearing it from your favorite podcasters

33:17.760 --> 33:18.800
makes it even more special.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.640
Thanks for being such an amazing husband

33:20.640 --> 33:25.760
and a great dad to our annoying bird, Petey.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.600
Dad was in quotes and I did my best.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.040
I got his butt.

33:30.400 --> 33:30.960
There it is.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.120
Brother, since Justin is a jazz musician,

33:33.120 --> 33:35.920
now to clarify, I myself am not.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.400
This other Justin, it is, plays baritone sax.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.920
Could you do a scat for him?

33:42.480 --> 33:43.680
She says, thanks.

33:44.240 --> 33:44.960
Love the show.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.280
We are not fucking kids.

33:47.280 --> 33:59.120
I'm actually, I was actually just practicing

33:59.120 --> 34:00.800
some Pentecostal scat.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.320
That was the divine spirit talking.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.400
Got the holy spirit deep down inside you.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.640
The holiest spirit of the scat man.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.760
Happy anniversary, you two.

34:10.320 --> 34:14.800
I have a message for Jonas and it's from John,

34:14.800 --> 34:18.400
Alexis, Shady, and Sarah who say,

34:18.400 --> 34:19.440
happy birthday, Jonas.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.160
If this message is late, it's because we wanted to see

34:22.160 --> 34:23.840
if you lived through your broke back adventure

34:23.840 --> 34:25.200
to Mount Washington.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.440
Happy birthday and thanks for getting all of us

34:27.440 --> 34:29.920
into the erudite wisdom of the brothers.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.680
Guys, we've said this many times before.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.840
You don't have to take the heat for this stuff.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.400
You don't.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.880
He's gonna be mad at you now and he could be mad at us

34:38.880 --> 34:40.720
and we're never gonna meet Jonas.

34:40.720 --> 34:44.960
We don't give a solitary shit what Jonas thinks of us.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.680
I do.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.360
Okay, well Travis does, we don't.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.000
Travis does.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.480
Two thirds of us don't give a fuck about Jonas.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.760
Don't carry it all.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.640
Jonas, I love you.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.880
Don't carry it all, put it on us.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.880
He sounds like a nice dude, like happy birthday and shit.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.120
You love mountains and shit, but I don't give a fuck.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.640
Jonas, don't let me in with it, please.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.840
Don't let me in with this, Jonas.

35:01.840 --> 35:02.480
I'm so sorry.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.560
Happy birthday, Jonas.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.600
Happy birthday, Jonas.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.640
I don't give a shit though.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.320
Justin, what are you doing?

35:08.320 --> 35:10.800
Strapping a chicken in my arm.

35:10.800 --> 35:15.200
Heard there's some plague out west, so I just wanted to get out ahead of it.

35:15.200 --> 35:19.280
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast, Sawbones,

35:19.280 --> 35:22.480
where we talk about everything from trepanation to bloodletting,

35:22.480 --> 35:25.680
you would know that that is a ridiculous idea and it will never work.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.400
Sawbones, I haven't caught it.

35:28.400 --> 35:28.960
Sawbones?

35:29.680 --> 35:32.960
Yes, it's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network

35:32.960 --> 35:34.560
and we record it every Friday.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.840
On the Maximum Fun Network and we record it together.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.320
You a doctor or something?

35:40.960 --> 35:41.360
Yes.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.920
I hate talking about money.

35:46.480 --> 35:50.960
It makes me uncomfortable to discuss restaurant bills, gas money, etc.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.560
with friends and co-workers.

35:52.560 --> 35:57.200
If an amount less than $20 is owed to me, I would really rather not discuss it.

35:57.200 --> 36:02.080
I would gladly lose out on the money if the cost is not having a conversation about money.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.280
How can I get people to take me seriously when they say,

36:05.280 --> 36:07.280
how much do I owe you?

36:07.280 --> 36:08.720
And I say, don't worry about it.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.040
That's a currency coward.

36:12.320 --> 36:18.240
You are the conductor of a train that I have been a passenger on my entire life, my friend.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.880
Wait, are conductors actually on the train or do they just hang out at the station?

36:24.880 --> 36:27.680
Yeah, they hang out at the station and then when they see the train come and they say,

36:27.680 --> 36:29.920
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, bye.

36:29.920 --> 36:30.640
You're doing it.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.040
You can do it, don't give up, don't give up.

36:36.080 --> 36:39.360
It's such a tricky scenario because I am totally with you.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.440
I fucking hate dealing with this.

36:41.440 --> 36:44.560
But at the same time, you know what I hate more is when a friend is like,

36:44.560 --> 36:47.520
hey, you paid for those movie tickets.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.320
It was $19.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.520
How much do I owe you?

36:49.520 --> 36:53.440
How do I say, oh, don't worry about it without sounding like I'm saying like,

36:53.440 --> 36:54.640
you need this more than I do.

36:54.640 --> 37:00.640
Here's the, I think the misconception here is that when someone says,

37:00.640 --> 37:01.840
how much do I owe you?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.280
It's not about you.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.280
I just always accept that it's them saying,

37:07.840 --> 37:11.840
I feel a burden now because I owe you something.

37:11.840 --> 37:16.720
And I would like to alleviate that burden by just evening it out between us.

37:16.720 --> 37:20.720
And when you go, oh, don't worry about it.

37:20.720 --> 37:24.080
You're lording it over them that you don't need their petty money.

37:24.080 --> 37:29.840
One of my favorite things about adulthood is that we migrate over to a

37:31.600 --> 37:35.600
monetary system that more closely resembles wampum.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.400
In that, like, if someone comes over and you buy them dinner,

37:41.360 --> 37:43.120
you don't have to split the goddamn check.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.480
You just know that someday you're going to go to their place

37:46.480 --> 37:47.920
and they're going to get you dinner.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.960
Or give you a ride to the airport.

37:50.960 --> 37:54.960
Or house sit your dog, or dog sit your dog.

37:54.960 --> 37:55.920
Or sit on your dog.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.680
Or sit on your dog's house.

37:57.680 --> 38:02.720
When you're younger, though, money is the most valuable thing.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.240
No one has any of it, so it becomes very scarce.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.520
When it becomes easier to procure, when you're not in the adult world,

38:09.520 --> 38:12.080
there are things that are worth more to you than money.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.240
Like, God, please drive me to the airport.

38:14.240 --> 38:14.720
Please.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.360
I love the regi- because I remember in college,

38:17.360 --> 38:21.280
there being retroactive, like, claims where it's like,

38:21.280 --> 38:24.720
um, I would pay you back for this, but do you remember a month ago

38:25.440 --> 38:27.200
I paid for the movie tickets?

38:27.920 --> 38:30.720
I feel like this is pretty balanced now, right?

38:30.720 --> 38:31.920
So I'm going to go.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.680
I also think the how much do I owe you question is a little unfair

38:36.400 --> 38:39.680
unless the, like, unless they have zero idea.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.720
Like, I, because I think that's just invi-

38:42.720 --> 38:44.160
I'm not going to invoice you.

38:44.160 --> 38:48.080
Like, just give, if you think that I should have some money,

38:48.080 --> 38:49.440
just give me some of it.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.240
Did you guys ever have a friend in college that you were 100% sure

38:53.200 --> 38:56.720
was fucking you on these matters?

38:56.720 --> 38:58.000
Like, they go out and they're like,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.280
hey, I'm gonna run out and get some pizzas.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.240
Can you split the cost of being?

39:00.240 --> 39:00.880
You're like, yeah, sure.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.240
And they run out and get two hot and reddies,

39:02.240 --> 39:03.200
and you're like, how much do I owe you?

39:03.200 --> 39:04.000
And they say $8.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.360
And they're like, oh, that's, that's interesting

39:05.360 --> 39:08.240
because I know they're $5 a piece, you piece of shit.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.360
Yes, we, we had, and we, we would also have periods

39:13.360 --> 39:16.560
where we would become suspicious that some people had money.

39:18.560 --> 39:22.320
Hey, listen, I heard that he is getting money from his parents,

39:22.320 --> 39:23.760
that his parents give him some money.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.880
So he has some money.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.920
He just has it.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.720
I think he just has money that he's not, like,

39:28.720 --> 39:30.240
giving to us or doing anything with.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.360
He just has it.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.040
I always say, I think the sweetest comment

39:33.040 --> 39:35.840
is when you can, like, get a big group of people

39:35.840 --> 39:38.800
and everybody chips in to a point that you end up with boner.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.320
Like, I'm going to run out and get beer

39:40.320 --> 39:41.360
and everyone gives you $5.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.680
And so you end up with like 50 bucks

39:43.680 --> 39:45.360
and the beer costs you 40.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.840
Travis, holy shit, you were that guy.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.600
It's capitalism.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.240
No, that's, that's you fucking your friends.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.280
They need that service.

39:53.280 --> 39:56.080
That's you fucking your friends in they butts

39:56.080 --> 39:57.680
where they wallets is.

39:57.680 --> 40:01.520
No, because the guy who takes money from a lot of people

40:01.520 --> 40:04.480
is going to get burned as many times as he wins out.

40:04.480 --> 40:04.960
That's true.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.800
It's luck of the, it's luck of the draw.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.200
That money that Travis earned,

40:09.200 --> 40:11.600
he probably lost out on another time.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.800
Or at a casino.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.920
Well, yeah, but that's a different thing entirely.

40:15.920 --> 40:17.200
Yeah, it's a completely different.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.000
Well, cause here's the thing.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.920
I do look at it as a service at that point,

40:19.920 --> 40:21.920
because if you're the guy who stayed sober

40:21.920 --> 40:24.720
to go buy beer halfway through the party when you ran out

40:24.720 --> 40:26.080
and so you're able to like drive

40:26.080 --> 40:27.600
and go get it and go to the trouble.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.000
Yes, I am going to profit off this transaction.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.240
Sure.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.480
Well, no, that sounds totally reasonable.

40:34.240 --> 40:34.880
That's your job.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.600
Thank you.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.040
Griffin, do you have any Yahoo's?

40:37.040 --> 40:37.440
I do.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.080
I feel like one of those would go down really nice right now.

40:41.280 --> 40:45.600
This Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.080
Thanks, Drew.

40:46.640 --> 40:47.520
Enroll member.

40:47.520 --> 40:52.240
It's by Yahoo answers user T, T-E-A, who asks,

40:53.680 --> 40:56.000
what should I do to celebrate my rat's birthday?

40:57.360 --> 40:58.320
Hello all.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.760
I currently only have one rat.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.080
Why is that funny to you?

41:02.720 --> 41:03.360
I don't know.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.880
It's the idea of all the people reading the question.

41:06.880 --> 41:07.520
Salutation.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.440
Hello, millions of readers.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.960
I currently only have one rat, Frowny Face,

41:12.960 --> 41:16.000
parentheses, my other one passed away last week

41:16.640 --> 41:17.760
and his name is Blue.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.280
Blue is going to be two on March 2nd this Sunday

41:21.280 --> 41:23.360
and I'm so excited to celebrate.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.760
The rat's name is not named Frowny Face then.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.520
No, no, no, no.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.680
This person is sad that they only have one rat

41:29.680 --> 41:31.680
because the other one died very recently.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.040
So very fresh corpse.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.680
Blue's going to be two on March 2nd this Saturday

41:35.680 --> 41:37.360
and I'm so excited to celebrate.

41:37.360 --> 41:41.600
I have a few gifts, paper mache hut, treats, toys,

41:41.600 --> 41:45.520
and dog bones, but I have no cake recipe

41:45.520 --> 41:46.640
or activities planned.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.160
I must make him a cake,

41:48.160 --> 41:49.760
but I want it to be completely homemade.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.600
I have a tiny rat size cake pan.

41:51.600 --> 41:52.400
No, you don't.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.680
So all I need is a recipe for the batter.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.200
I also need some activities

41:57.200 --> 41:59.360
since he is unfortunately by himself.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.920
He won't be able to play any games involving multiple rats.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.800
Instead, I have to plan other stuff for him to do.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.000
Do you guys have any ideas?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.920
Lastly, how can I make a mini rat pizza?

42:07.920 --> 42:08.720
You can't.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.880
Oh, and I also almost forgot.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.320
What other homemade toys would you like?

42:12.320 --> 42:13.200
DIY, please.

42:13.200 --> 42:13.840
Thanks, everyone.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.040
Smiley face, T.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.800
This person went through some complex emotions

42:16.800 --> 42:17.520
during this question.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.760
So I know I feel like you could give the rat a bagel bite

42:21.760 --> 42:23.840
and it'd be perfectly happy with that as a rat.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.080
That is a deep ass dish pizza for a rat.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.280
Listen, rats eat fucking garbage every day.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.400
Do you think the rats are gonna be like,

42:30.400 --> 42:31.760
this isn't rat specific?

42:31.760 --> 42:32.640
Not this rat.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.880
This rat's got a dope life.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.680
That's true.

42:35.680 --> 42:38.880
I know what I would give my rat that I owned,

42:38.880 --> 42:40.000
my personal rat.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.360
I would give him a quick ride to ye olde trash can

42:43.360 --> 42:48.960
where he could die outside and not in my home.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.640
And then I'd find the things,

42:50.640 --> 42:52.400
I'd gather up all the things

42:52.400 --> 42:55.600
that he'd ever touched or looked at and burn them.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.040
Happy birthday, rat.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.360
What was I doing?

42:59.360 --> 43:02.960
Why would I get you if I knew that I hated you?

43:02.960 --> 43:04.640
I hate you so much.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.960
When one of you died, I should have been thrilled

43:07.760 --> 43:09.760
because then that cut my rat problem

43:09.760 --> 43:12.240
that I haven't had in half.

43:12.240 --> 43:12.560
50%.

43:13.600 --> 43:17.440
Get out of here, you trash eating rat.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.360
Why would you have a rat?

43:19.360 --> 43:21.360
Why would you have a rat cake man?

43:21.360 --> 43:26.320
Do you think the rat is a nickname for a turtle?

43:26.320 --> 43:27.920
Maybe they have a rat because they love them

43:27.920 --> 43:31.520
and they're their friend and they need the companionship.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.440
They definitely do need the companionship.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.400
That is not up for debate.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.440
Holy shit.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.480
All I'm saying is I don't wanna get a flood of emails

43:38.480 --> 43:41.840
and tweets from rat owners and rat lovers who are like,

43:41.840 --> 43:43.600
oh, you guys so close-minded.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.320
How dare you?

43:44.320 --> 43:46.160
That's such a myth and rats are great

43:46.160 --> 43:47.840
and super sweet and very intelligent.

43:47.840 --> 43:51.360
No, listen, over the years of making this program,

43:51.360 --> 43:55.040
it's gonna be four years next month, okay?

43:55.040 --> 43:58.720
After four years of recording this program,

43:58.720 --> 44:03.040
I've become more culturally sensitive

44:03.040 --> 44:05.360
to so many groups of people.

44:05.360 --> 44:09.440
Rat owners, I'm drawing a line in the sand.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.160
Here's the thing, unless your pet rat

44:12.160 --> 44:16.480
has the power to transmogrify into an incredible wizard

44:16.480 --> 44:20.560
and he's your familiar, you have to stop.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.960
I love the Family Circus way you say that word.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.960
What?

44:24.960 --> 44:25.920
Familiar.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.920
Can you do me a favor?

44:27.920 --> 44:32.080
What do you call the pasta that's just like long noodles

44:32.080 --> 44:36.400
and you would put like a puttanesca sauce on top of it

44:36.400 --> 44:38.240
and eat it?

44:40.160 --> 44:41.440
Do you mean biscotti?

44:41.440 --> 44:42.000
There we go.

44:45.040 --> 44:50.240
Why do you have a rat-sized cake pan?

44:50.240 --> 44:53.360
I have a bottle cap and a sense of creativity.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.960
Let's be honest.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.560
Do you think this person's ever showed up to a party like,

44:56.560 --> 44:58.400
hey guys, I brought cake for your birthday.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.400
Ah, fuck, I made it in a rat pan.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.040
Shit.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.840
Well, this is not gonna be enough for anybody, really.

45:03.840 --> 45:05.680
I made a cracker, so I made.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.760
Also, thanks for inviting me to a party.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.360
I own rats, so it doesn't happen.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.040
Oh no, you're dumping pig's blood on me.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.040
How could this happen?

45:15.760 --> 45:16.400
Again.

45:16.400 --> 45:21.280
So that's gonna do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother,

45:21.280 --> 45:21.520
and Me.

45:21.520 --> 45:25.440
We hope you had as much fun listening as we had recording.

45:25.440 --> 45:28.000
Thank you to people who are tweeting about our program.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.440
Like Patrick Malone had a sweet baby boy named Griffin

45:31.440 --> 45:32.800
born on Valentine's Day.

45:32.800 --> 45:33.360
I know.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.400
It's adorable.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.640
Wait, I think it's because somebody asked me on Twitter

45:36.640 --> 45:39.520
like a few months ago if that was cool.

45:39.520 --> 45:40.560
I named my son after you.

45:40.560 --> 45:40.800
Yeah.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.600
Guys, that's lovely.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.240
That's wonderful.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.600
This is the first I'm hearing about that

45:45.600 --> 45:47.040
because I don't read Twitter, I guess.

45:48.640 --> 45:50.240
So congratulations, Patrick.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.480
Thank you to others tweeting about the show like Matt.

45:52.480 --> 45:56.480
Kate Earlwine, who said that she dreamt she won an NBNBA prize

45:56.480 --> 46:01.040
package with two raincoats, sparkle bouncy balls, smiley face

46:01.040 --> 46:02.640
yo-yos, and a space t-shirt.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.800
So yep, you're welcome.

46:05.680 --> 46:12.800
Thanks to Joe Smith, Brooke Takkar, BTA, who hasn't listened

46:12.800 --> 46:14.480
to our show but is thinking about it.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.840
Come on, BTA.

46:15.840 --> 46:21.440
Marshall Henderson, Jay Dez, Chris Letty, Mark Beatty, Bill

46:21.440 --> 46:27.440
Humphrey, Lauren, Bad Dad Aura, Root, Matt Warren, so many

46:27.440 --> 46:27.680
others.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.480
Thank you so much.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.920
We sure appreciate it.

46:29.920 --> 46:34.960
If you want to share, get somebody onto the NBNBAM train,

46:34.960 --> 46:36.000
send them a link to our sampler.

46:36.000 --> 46:41.760
It's bit.ly forward slash NBNBAM 2013 or bit.ly forward slash

46:41.760 --> 46:42.880
It's My Bim Bam.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.920
I want to thank Travis.

46:43.920 --> 46:47.120
I want to thank Travis for being here, fighting off the

46:47.120 --> 46:49.280
plague to record this episode.

46:51.600 --> 46:55.280
You guys can't hear the sounds of his disease, but they're

46:55.280 --> 46:55.760
there.

46:55.760 --> 46:59.120
I edited him out and he is a trooper and I'm proud of him.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.160
Thank you, Travis.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.680
Now, Travis, if things, I'm sure you're going to get better,

47:03.680 --> 47:06.960
but if things break bad and they don't go your way, you need

47:06.960 --> 47:08.080
to be ready.

47:08.080 --> 47:11.040
So I want to remind you to head to LegalZoom.com.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.480
It's not a law firm, but it provides self-help services at

47:14.480 --> 47:15.840
your specific direction.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.040
You can enter discount code my brother and you're going to

47:19.040 --> 47:19.920
save some money.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.120
So get that sorted out before things get worse or better, as

47:23.120 --> 47:24.080
I'm sure they will.

47:24.080 --> 47:27.280
But if they don't, but if they don't, I will also probably

47:27.280 --> 47:30.640
spend some time laying on the couch, checking out Hulu Plus.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.640
Because Hulu Plus is where you can binge on thousands of

47:32.640 --> 47:34.320
features anytime, anywhere.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.880
And I'm going to rock out that free trial of Hulu Plus by

47:36.880 --> 47:39.200
going to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.800
Guys, I have huge, huge ass news.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.520
This news has the biggest ass.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.080
The 2014 Max Fund Drive is coming up.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.680
During the last two weeks of March, you can tune in to

47:51.680 --> 47:56.160
support your favorite podcast, like, I don't know, us, and I

47:56.160 --> 48:00.080
don't know, Sawbones, and stop podcasting yourself, and Jordan

48:00.080 --> 48:01.680
Jesse Go, and Bullseye, and throw in the shade.

48:01.680 --> 48:02.800
And my brother, my brother, and me.

48:02.800 --> 48:03.840
My brother, my brother, and me.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.480
I already did us.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.120
I know, but I'm repeating it because it's very important that

48:07.120 --> 48:08.720
they support us above all others.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.440
Except for Sawbones, definitely Sawbones.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.840
You can toss them a pity vote here and there, but mostly my

48:13.840 --> 48:14.400
brother, my brother.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.440
So starting March 17th, we will be running some of our best

48:17.440 --> 48:21.840
shows of the year and offering spectacular thank you gifts to

48:21.840 --> 48:23.440
get you in the giving spirit.

48:23.440 --> 48:28.000
We usually do pretty extra length, extra size apps.

48:29.600 --> 48:32.240
And then we have a bonus episode that goes out to donors

48:32.240 --> 48:33.200
that we've done.

48:33.200 --> 48:35.040
Have we done four at this point?

48:35.040 --> 48:37.440
Or we've done three, and this will be our fourth, I think.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.720
I think that's right.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.080
I think, I don't.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.760
No, because we wouldn't have done one in 2010.

48:41.760 --> 48:42.720
We wouldn't have done one in 2010, yeah.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.360
Well, no, but 11, 12, 13, and this will be our fourth.

48:46.720 --> 48:50.800
Except we didn't join MaxFun until the middle of-

48:50.800 --> 48:53.040
We have some bonus episodes.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.440
We have a number of episodes.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.120
And if you're a donor, then you get all of them.

48:57.120 --> 49:02.000
So we also have other bonuses that we will talk about once

49:02.000 --> 49:06.320
the drive starts on the 17th that we give out to donors.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.800
All three of us are donors, which is kind of weird

49:08.800 --> 49:10.960
because that money go right back in our pockets.

49:10.960 --> 49:11.600
No, not really.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.000
I love what this network does.

49:16.000 --> 49:21.600
And I spend almost as much time as I do doing anything else

49:21.600 --> 49:24.560
in my life listening to podcasts on MaxFun.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.160
So don't miss it.

49:26.160 --> 49:29.520
MaxFun Drive starts March 17th, and it runs for just two weeks.

49:30.080 --> 49:30.880
You can listen in.

49:30.880 --> 49:33.840
You can sign up to support us and catch the best shows

49:33.840 --> 49:34.720
that we have to offer.

49:34.720 --> 49:35.840
Holy crap.

49:35.840 --> 49:36.800
It's happening, you guys.

49:36.800 --> 49:39.040
I want to thank also John Roderick in the long winters

49:39.040 --> 49:41.120
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

49:41.120 --> 49:43.280
which is on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.360
You can find it on iTunes.

49:45.360 --> 49:49.440
You can find it at stores, but you should get it

49:49.440 --> 49:51.520
because it's really, really fucking good.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.000
Thank you again for listening.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.320
Griffin, do you have a final question for us to enjoy?

49:56.320 --> 49:56.820
I do.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.800
This one was sent in by Emerald member, Drew Davenport.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.080
Thank you, Drew.

50:02.080 --> 50:02.720
It's by Yahoo!

50:02.720 --> 50:05.280
It's by Yahoo! answer to user, James, who asks,

50:07.600 --> 50:09.840
how did Obama get Jay Leno fired?

50:13.600 --> 50:15.120
I'm Justin McElroy.

50:15.120 --> 50:16.000
I'm Travis McElroy.

50:16.000 --> 50:16.880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.240
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

50:18.240 --> 50:19.280
Kiss your dad.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.160
Score.

50:20.160 --> 50:38.160
And the lips.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.000
Maximumfun.org.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.040
Comedy and culture.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.160
Artist owned.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.200
Listener supported.

50:43.200 --> 50:47.840
I am so proud to be an American and to be hosting Throwing Shade with you.

50:47.840 --> 50:51.840
I am proud to have really deep brown eyes.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.400
Well, this is actually supposed to be, you know,

50:54.400 --> 50:58.000
this is supposed to be a thing so that people listen to our show.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.360
I've just been so busy this week.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.880
But I'm very happy to be here.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.320
The podcast is called?

51:02.320 --> 51:03.280
It's called Throwing Shade.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.160
You're the co-host, yeah.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.680
So Throwing Shade, we talk about-

51:05.680 --> 51:06.560
You're the gay co-host.

51:06.560 --> 51:07.760
I'm the female co-host.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.400
I always forget.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.600
We're friends in real life.

51:09.600 --> 51:10.100
Call me.

51:10.100 --> 51:10.600
Call me.

51:10.600 --> 51:11.100
Call me.

51:11.100 --> 51:11.600
Call me.

51:11.600 --> 51:12.100
Call me.

51:12.100 --> 51:13.960
We're friends in real life, kind of.

51:13.960 --> 51:16.200
And we talk about lady and gay issues.

51:16.200 --> 51:16.680
Yeah.

51:16.680 --> 51:20.600

51:20.920 --> 51:23.000
If you love the world and hate yourself.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.400
Please listen to Throwing Shade.

51:24.400 --> 51:43.400
Yeah.
