00:00.000 --> 00:19.840
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to what I can only assume is the beginning

00:19.840 --> 00:22.600
of the downturn of My Brother, My Friend.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.440
I'm so glad you could be here for the apex of our program.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.480
After which, listen, I've seen a lot of Behind the Music.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.480
This is the good part.

00:31.480 --> 00:35.040
This is what they showed just before and shortly after.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.560
As we're walking off stage Charles would be like, you know what I've always wanted to

00:38.560 --> 00:39.560
try?

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
Math.

00:40.560 --> 00:46.120
We realized when we were just backstage that we hadn't done one of these in six months

00:46.120 --> 00:51.760
and so like my body, like my nervous system didn't know how to react to this many people

00:51.760 --> 00:54.920
all essentially yelling at me very loud.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.560
And so like my fight or flight response actually kicked in.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.440
I tapped my chest and that wasn't like, oh thank you, I'm so honored.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.280
It was like, my heart is like fucking racing right now.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.880
With a small tonal shift we would have had to leave.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
I know.

01:08.880 --> 01:13.880
There's like a weird part of my brain that's like, you need to get the fuck out of here.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.520
First off, can I get a little more monitor?

01:15.520 --> 01:20.280
I don't know what that means but I like to say it every time.

01:20.280 --> 01:25.280
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the Marchanera.

01:25.280 --> 01:34.040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

01:34.040 --> 01:40.440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

01:40.440 --> 01:48.720
And I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, media luminary, Griffin MC McElroy.

01:48.720 --> 01:55.680
With Chilean miners emerging from a six-month-long slumber, we have returned.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
And that's going to do it for us.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.480
We want to say thank you to John Roderick.

01:59.480 --> 02:05.160
This little Mariah Carey headset thing that they're wearing, they actually send you this

02:05.160 --> 02:07.680
when you get 30 under 30.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
So you can do your TED talk.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
Imagine this.

02:09.680 --> 02:16.720
So here's the really special thing about tonight's show that I'm so excited about that you won't

02:16.720 --> 02:20.000
be, but we really were, because it had never occurred to us.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Watch this.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.280
You ready?

02:23.280 --> 02:24.280
We can stand up.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.280
Nowhere to hide.

02:25.280 --> 02:32.760
I could do the whole show from back here.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.760
Where's Travis, they wonder.

02:35.760 --> 02:43.720
So we can just kind of, if energy's flagging, we could just sort of like get up on stage

02:43.720 --> 02:49.840
like Def Comedy Jam and just like get some, we won't do that much, we'll immediately forget

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
we could do it.

02:50.840 --> 02:56.400
And as long as we're like taking people behind the curtain, like we all have just like children's

02:56.400 --> 03:06.240
bladders and so this technology may actually allow us to run to the zone and still participate

03:06.240 --> 03:11.680
in our communal comedy.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.400
Leave the bathroom door open, I'll hear the japes.

03:15.400 --> 03:22.520
Oh man, I really am a little, I'm a little freaked out right now.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.360
We've also had a lot of sugar today.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
Yeah.

03:25.360 --> 03:30.280
We have had both Voodoo Donuts and Blue Star Donuts.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.560
And you said I couldn't do local references.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.560
I did it.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.320
I mean, you did successfully name two donut places.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.840
Thank you.

03:38.840 --> 03:44.120
Now I'm doing the slow carb thing, so on the Saturdays I get to just like eat like a garbage

03:44.120 --> 03:45.120
person.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.400
And this is my first one, so I was so excited.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.600
Like I was literally woke up first thing this morning just like we need to walk to get donuts

03:51.600 --> 03:55.440
and Travis and I walked 20 minutes in the rain to go get donuts.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.500
It's worth it too.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.880
Should we start doing the thing we do on the podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me?

03:58.880 --> 04:02.720
We have so much time without the opener, I just want to spend a minute with them.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.720
Yeah.

04:03.720 --> 04:10.640
We don't have an opener, so we were hoping, if it's okay with you all, extra long, extra

04:10.640 --> 04:11.640
weird.

04:11.640 --> 04:12.640
Is that?

04:12.640 --> 04:13.640
Okay.

04:13.640 --> 04:19.400
Okay, now let's, hold on, the other thing is, we say weird a lot.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.480
I'm not trying to curry local favor.

04:21.480 --> 04:26.200
I know that would be like the whack, like I don't, when we do a show at Boston, I'm

04:26.200 --> 04:32.100
like not like this show's going to have extra beans like that, like is Portland known for

04:32.100 --> 04:36.440
being weird and remaining, so yeah, yeah.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.440
Interesting.

04:37.440 --> 04:45.560
It's like the old slogan, keep Boston beans.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.640
On this show, we take your questions and we turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.440
We are going to do questions from the audience, probably a lot of them since we have a lot

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
of time to kill.

04:53.440 --> 04:54.440
We'll do a good amount.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.880
I don't want to over promise, I'd rather under promise and over.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.760
But we do have the one rule, does everyone know what the audience question rule is?

05:01.760 --> 05:02.760
Audience.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.760
Okay.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.760
That's right.

05:04.760 --> 05:05.760
No, no danger of that.

05:05.760 --> 05:10.200
Some, some, some like weird podcast angel just got its wings.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.200
Okay.

05:11.200 --> 05:15.400
All right, here we go.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
Questions and podcast.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.200
We can't go six months without doing these again.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.320
I literally, it's like learning to walk again.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.400
Please be patient with us.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.880
We'll cut out the bad parts and only you will experience them.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.880
If I'm worth, so here's the thing.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.880
No.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.880
Justin.

05:31.880 --> 05:39.440
If I'm working as a cashier, wait, why did I stand up?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.440
If I'm working.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.600
Justin and Travis are now standing and I'm getting very nervous sitting down.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.600
If I'm working.

05:44.600 --> 05:52.320
Oh, we should mention, we've still got to post this, we can't do a lot of visual humor

05:52.320 --> 05:53.320
like this.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.320
Yeah.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
They don't have to know this is just for them.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.320
Okay.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.360
If you, if they laugh and you don't know why, get your feet off the couch.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.800
That's vegan leather.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.800
It really is.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.800
That's not a Portland knock.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.800
How do I get out of this bit?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.240
You know, okay.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.440
So here's the first question.

06:11.440 --> 06:16.760
If I'm working as a cashier and someone hands me their credit card and the card has a cool

06:16.760 --> 06:22.440
picture of their family or their dog or something on it, is it cool if I just take a sec to

06:22.440 --> 06:26.240
scope it out in front of them?

06:26.240 --> 06:30.280
Is it more rude to completely ignore it after they've gone through all the trouble of getting

06:30.280 --> 06:32.480
a custom card like that?

06:32.480 --> 06:36.520
If I look, should I react and give them a thumbs up or something?

06:36.520 --> 06:41.040
Maybe I could say something like, nice family and dog.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.440
That's from not stealing your credit card information, just checking out that cool family

06:44.440 --> 06:46.560
and dog in Portland.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.560
Are you here?

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
You're here?

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
Didn't make it.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.560
Oh, no.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
Really?

06:51.560 --> 06:56.160
Is there a way to say the two words, nice family, without it sounding like a threat?

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
Yeah.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
Yeah.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.160
Like you're in fucking cage fear.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.160
Yeah.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.160
That's fine.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.640
That only ends with, it'd be a shame if something happened to them.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.280
I didn't know that you could get, this first thing that I want to address is I didn't know

07:08.280 --> 07:12.920
you could get custom cards printed, because if so, you know I'm going to get a hologram

07:12.920 --> 07:16.600
by a Charizard or Blastoise on there.

07:16.600 --> 07:21.680
And then that's good, because you go to Chipotle or whatever and you can purchase your goods.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.880
But also, if you're losing the big game.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.640
Wouldn't it be way cooler with Pikachu though?

07:27.640 --> 07:29.480
Because everybody loves Pikachu, right?

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
Love the Pokemon.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
He's probably the best one.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.480
Wouldn't you say?

07:32.480 --> 07:34.480
Griffin, don't you agree that Pikachu is among-

07:34.480 --> 07:38.800
You're about to make me pop off on this stage right now.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.960
I'm just curious what you think about Pikachu.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
He's fine.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.240
He's fine.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.320
He's good for what he is.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.200
He's probably the best.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.200
Probably no Pokemon competing in a fight.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
All right.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
Fine.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.200
Okay.

07:52.200 --> 07:58.160
He evolves into Raichu.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.960
He has a better form.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.880
He has an older brother who's better.

08:03.880 --> 08:12.840
Thank you for acknowledging that older brothers are better.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.440
They do if they have better stats and better attacks.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.780
You know, I hadn't really thought about it before, but if you do get a custom picture

08:20.780 --> 08:25.880
of your family and or cool dog on your credit card, what you are basically saying is, I'd

08:25.880 --> 08:30.520
like to bring discussions of how my family looks into transactions.

08:30.520 --> 08:34.640
I would like the person I'm transacting with to get a good look at my family and dog.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.880
This is a good point, Justin.

08:35.880 --> 08:40.640
Who are these human beings who are trying to extend transactions with cashiers?

08:40.640 --> 08:41.640
I need a talking voice.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.160
Because it's none of these three.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.160
Maybe it's somebody-

08:44.160 --> 08:47.240
Put some fucking fun trivia on it and give us something to discuss.

08:47.240 --> 08:51.560
Maybe it's somebody who makes a lot of really unwise, irresponsible purchases, so they're

08:51.560 --> 08:54.880
like, a fucking speedboat, yeah.

08:54.880 --> 08:58.680
Rex would hate a speedboat.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.680
Rex would hate a speedboat.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.080
He's afraid of the dang things.

09:03.080 --> 09:07.080
Unless it's just a picture of your daughter in a captain's cap flipping you off.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.080
She would actually.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.640
She thinks, Molly knows how to party.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.640
I should get this boat for her.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.640
I should get the speedboat.

09:11.640 --> 09:16.360
Do you think if you go to the trouble of getting a custom card made, you want people to-

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
Yeah, absolutely.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
Like if you hand it to them, they're like, what?

09:18.360 --> 09:19.360
They'll be like, uh, it's you, baby.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.360
What do you think of my family?

09:20.360 --> 09:25.800
Now listen, if you do, here's the thing though.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.640
If you look at the card, you have to say something.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.880
Like you can't just pass it out.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.920
You can't look and just, okay, a family, interesting.

09:34.920 --> 09:40.240
Side note, why do people want to make it so easy to steal their ID?

09:40.240 --> 09:41.840
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.400
What you've created here is like a little coupon to your identity.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
Right.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.040
Here's my number to all my money.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.640
Here's what all my family looks like.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.680
You can see we're standing in front of our home.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
That's our address.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.920
And this is how small the dog is guarding that home.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
Yeah, right.

09:56.920 --> 10:01.120
Everybody's wearing a t-shirt that has a design that explains their greatest fear on it.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.120
Right.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.720
And right below that, their social security number.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.600
So you can just steal my whole family's identity if you want.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.600
Enjoy.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
Enjoy my family's identity.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.600
Do you guys want to know who?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.600
It's up to them.

10:10.600 --> 10:16.720
What happens if you lose that credit card?

10:16.720 --> 10:21.260
I'm just looking forward to that call of like, could I get a new family, please?

10:21.260 --> 10:23.320
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.320
Right in high Zoe Kinski.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.920
It is right in high.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.640
I need to sit down and really write all these.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.640
I feel so bad.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.880
But there's like, we've come up with so many honorifics at this point.

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
Thank you, Zoe.

10:34.880 --> 10:35.880
It's Yahoo Answers user.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.400
The website is bad.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.120
We'll refresh it.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.120
Oh, God.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.120
Why did I refresh it?

10:42.120 --> 10:43.120
Last time this happened, I lost the website.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.120
Oh, shit.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.680
Okay, everybody turn off the Wi-Fi.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.680
Okay, I can't.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
It's just a funny name.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
Justin, go.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.680
Uh, duh.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.680
Asks.

10:52.680 --> 10:59.320
I had a funny second half, but you'll never hear it.

10:59.320 --> 11:11.880
If David Blaine and Chris Angel got into a fight, how horny would I get?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.200
How would the fight play out?

11:13.200 --> 11:17.080
Who cares who wins?

11:17.080 --> 11:18.080
I care very much.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.800
No matter who wins, we lose.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.480
How does the question, how would it play out, not factor in who wins?

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
Yeah.

11:26.480 --> 11:30.920
I just want to know if illusions would be used, or if they would just go for straight

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
punching.

11:31.920 --> 11:37.280
If they would go for just straight punching and hair pulling, tell me your opinions.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.280
Hold on.

11:38.280 --> 11:43.480
Justin is fantasizing about a fight between two magicians, in which they just punch each

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
other.

11:44.480 --> 11:51.480
Yeah, you just want to see them kick their asses.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.480
It would be like-

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
Kasparov versus Deep Blue.

11:53.480 --> 12:00.200
If these two got into a fucking punch fight-

12:00.200 --> 12:02.760
Is this basically the plot of Incredible Burt Wonderstone?

12:02.760 --> 12:03.760
Because I haven't seen it.

12:03.760 --> 12:04.760
Travis, please break this down.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.760
It is.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.760
Largely the plot of-

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
Oh, shit.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.720
It is, actually, a little bit, literally.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.000
Have you watched it, too?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Jacuzzi.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.520
We'll talk after the show.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.520
Scandalize.

12:18.520 --> 12:22.400
I didn't realize you were a Wonderhead.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.960
Illusions are hard.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.480
It's hard in this day and age.

12:26.480 --> 12:35.840
We have magic computers, et cetera, et cetera, in our hands, science, magic, indistinguishable.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.880
You know, the gold quote.

12:38.880 --> 12:39.880
Illusions are hard.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.680
By Gerald R. Tolkien, these little phones, man.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
Did you say Gerald Tolkien?

12:44.680 --> 12:45.680
By Gerald Tolkien.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.720
Gerald Tolkien said-

12:47.720 --> 12:49.920
These phones, man, it's like magic.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.920
Crazy.

12:50.920 --> 12:55.920
When I did Gandalf, I was like, phones, man.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
What?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.920
No, that's not what I'm trying to get at.

12:59.920 --> 13:03.360
What I'm trying to get at is, illusions are really hard to do.

13:03.360 --> 13:10.040
I think the challenge is increased exponentially if someone is fighting you to make them less

13:10.040 --> 13:11.040
impressive.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.480
Just stop punching me for one second.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
What's this?

13:14.480 --> 13:15.760
Oh, no.

13:15.760 --> 13:21.280
I'm literally thinking about David Blaine running a loop over a woman, and Chris Angel's

13:21.280 --> 13:22.720
like, she's not floating.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.720
It's a hook.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.120
Or you can't see it.

13:26.120 --> 13:29.640
Or Chris Angel just runs in and just fucking slaps the rope away.

13:29.640 --> 13:30.640
Right.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.480
He's like, I'm going to bite this quarter and, hey, come on, stop.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.480
Come on.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.640
I'm going to put this cigarette through my hand, stop, no.

13:37.640 --> 13:42.680
If David Blaine paid someone to suck all the oxygen out of the room, he would have a definite

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
increased advantage.

13:43.680 --> 13:50.160
I mean, it's just science.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.200
He trained himself to hold his breath for eight minutes underwater.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
I see.

13:54.200 --> 14:02.200
If the oxygen's out of the room, Chris Angel's blacked out on the floor, which isn't a room

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
at all.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.680
It was actually the outdoors, mind freak.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
Whoa, shit.

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
See, that's the trick.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.680
That's the trick.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.680
It's like, I've created a prison of ice that neither of us will be able to own.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.480
Are we outside of the prison of ice?

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
Boom.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.640
Oh, I lavaliered my lavalier off.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.000
Really got to clip this bad boy on.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Really pinch it around.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, dear.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I think David Copperfield should show up and shoot him with a shotgun.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
What's up?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.320
I'm very old, and I'm out the game.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
Pop.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.320
Dead.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.320
I made an airplane disappear.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
Why can't I make YouTube?

14:31.320 --> 14:32.920
Pop, pop, pop.

14:32.920 --> 14:37.400
Just because, hold on, just because David Copperfield's not doing specials anymore doesn't mean he

14:37.400 --> 14:38.400
doesn't still do magic.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.880
I don't think he's out of the game.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.320
Yeah, we're doing him a disservice by suggesting he would murder people with guns and not with

14:44.320 --> 14:45.320
his magic.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.100
He can fly, okay?

14:47.100 --> 14:48.400
Let's cut him a little bit of slack.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.640
No one knows how he did that still.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
Yeah.

14:51.640 --> 14:56.160
He palmed, that one time when he got mugged, he did magic, he palmed his own watch.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.160
You heard that?

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
Somebody said, yeah, so.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
He got mugged.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.360
That's a story for three of you.

15:00.360 --> 15:04.840
He got mugged, and while he was getting mugged, he palmed his own watch so they wouldn't steal

15:04.840 --> 15:05.840
it.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.480
So the person with him still got mugged.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.840
The person with him got mugged, but he was like, what, David Copperfield helps those

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
who help themselves.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
Boy, I bet that was awkward.

15:14.840 --> 15:15.840
Like, geez, Dave, thanks, bud.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.840
I have my grandma's ring.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.120
You couldn't have palmed that one too, huh?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.120
Don't get greedy, Madeline.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.040
David's like, Madeline, how did you make out?

15:25.040 --> 15:28.240
I kept my watch because of my trickery.

15:28.240 --> 15:31.640
Hey, and I kept your watch, but it's mine now.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.080
Hey, Madeline, Madeline, what time is it?

15:34.080 --> 15:38.880
Time for you to learn how to do magic, I guess.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.840
I bet that David Copperfield immediately called his parents and was like, you said this would

15:42.840 --> 15:45.840
never come in handy.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.680
Okay, how about another question?

15:51.680 --> 15:52.680
Yes, please.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.680
Hi, brothers.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.680
Hi.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.680
Hi.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.680
Hey.

15:56.680 --> 16:01.640
I've been having an issue, whoop, I've been having an issue ever since my boyfriend and

16:01.640 --> 16:02.640
I started cohabitating.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.360
He scares the shit out of me.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.360
Bad start?

16:07.360 --> 16:08.920
Not on purpose.

16:08.920 --> 16:14.280
Just when he comes home or walks into the room after taking a shower, he's tried saying

16:14.280 --> 16:21.200
hey as a warning or being a bit noisier, unlocking the door, but I'm often cooking or listening

16:21.200 --> 16:25.240
to a podcast, oh, thank you, and usually jump from fear.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.240
Help me, brothers.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.680
What can he do to make his entrances less frightening?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.560
That's from Scared in Seattle.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.080
Okay, hold on, Scared in Seattle, you're here.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
Okay.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.080
Yeah.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.080
Hi.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.360
Does your boyfriend have like an old-timey organ that he plays like a spooky stinger

16:41.360 --> 16:43.360
at like, baaam?

16:43.360 --> 16:44.360
Yeah.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.360
Hello.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.360
Are you dating Slenderman?

16:46.360 --> 16:47.360
Harvey Slenderman.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.360
Nice to meet you.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.360
I'm an accountant.

16:49.360 --> 16:55.920
I struggle with this a lot because I spend a lot of time editing podcasts, and so I've

16:55.920 --> 17:01.360
always got the old cans on, and I have YouTube bozos just like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

17:01.360 --> 17:06.880
fart, boner, fart, boner, boner, just bark into my ears, and then when Rachel wants

17:06.880 --> 17:12.600
to get my attention, there's no good way to do it that doesn't spook me terribly.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.600
Could you tie a bell around your boyfriend?

17:14.600 --> 17:20.280
It's a little dehumanizing, but I mean, I'd rather you not get scared.

17:20.280 --> 17:26.200
To be fair, your boyfriend's jangling his keys and saying, hey, he's gone half the way.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.200
He's gone, yeah.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.320
Maybe you meet him halfway, you get like a Bluetooth speaker, and you don't wear headphones.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.920
You could try learning Taekwondo, and then you'd be anticipating an attack.

17:34.920 --> 17:39.960
At every moment, you'd be praying that someone tries to make a move on you because you're

17:39.960 --> 17:40.960
a weapon.

17:40.960 --> 17:47.320
I've got an idea that I've been developing for four seconds now, and it's for an app,

17:47.320 --> 17:51.960
and the app is called JRMY, Jermy, and it's for Jeremy, the boy, I'm assuming.

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
What's his name?

17:52.960 --> 17:53.960
Matt.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.240
Matt's already four letters, so that's no good.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.240
Yeah.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.480
There's probably an app called Matt, so let's stick with Jeremy for right now.

18:00.480 --> 18:05.560
Jermy, it's called Jermy, and you use it, and you're going to, this is not, Matt, not

18:05.560 --> 18:08.000
good for him, but I'll have to be tagged somehow.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
RFID.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.120
RFID, maybe he carries an Amiibo with him all the time.

18:12.120 --> 18:18.600
He always has an Amiibo on him, and when he comes in the door, your Jermy app is always

18:18.600 --> 18:22.040
running, and it's like, Jeremy's home, and it lets you know because it knows that he's

18:22.040 --> 18:23.040
close because of the tag.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.040
Push notification.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
Push notification.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.560
You're listening to the podcast, and it's like, fart boner, hi, McElroy's, listen to

18:27.560 --> 18:32.920
all our shows, we're sellouts, and then you get like, Jeremy's home, and you know to be

18:32.920 --> 18:33.920
ready.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.160
Maybe one butt in, one butt out.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.960
Or what if, okay, I'm going to take that, let me throw this out.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.560
What if it just constantly let you know when Jeremy wasn't home?

18:41.560 --> 18:45.880
And if it stopped notifying you, that means he is home.

18:45.880 --> 18:46.880
Yeah.

18:46.880 --> 18:53.800
So you're listening to our family of incredible products, but there's also a fourth-

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
Jeremy's not home.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.800
Jeremy's not home.

18:55.800 --> 18:56.800
Jeremy's not home.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.800
Jeremy's not home.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.800
Jeremy's not home.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.800
Jeremy's not home.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.800
Jeremy's not home.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.800
Jeremy defends systems.

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
Voltron.

19:02.800 --> 19:08.520
Also, you should get Voltron to protect you, because then you'd never be-

19:08.520 --> 19:12.320
What fear needs someone with Voltron at their side?

19:12.320 --> 19:18.720
He's made of five lions.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.720
What if he had a body man?

19:21.720 --> 19:22.720
Think about it.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.720
If he had his own, like, you know, like, Dule Hill was for President Bartlett, you could

19:25.720 --> 19:29.280
have somebody who like, enters the room before, and is like, Jeremy's going to do it.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.000
They're still going to be scared.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
It's not Jeremy himself.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.040
What if instead it was a hype man that you heard coming a mile away, Jeremy!

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
Jeremy!

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
Oh shit, Jeremy's here!

19:39.040 --> 19:43.880
Just ringing a cowbell, like, who's in the house?

19:43.880 --> 19:44.880
Jeremy!

19:44.880 --> 19:48.760
No, I mean, literally, he's in the house.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.000
I'll be back in the morning.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.680
You guys stay in the same room, please.

19:52.680 --> 19:57.800
What if you hung Christmas lights all over, like, in Stranger Things, and then when Jeremy

19:57.800 --> 20:00.680
gets home, he just flicks them up and down, and that's it?

20:00.680 --> 20:02.160
That's the most practical one, I think.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.160
That's practical.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.480
And also, it's festive and nice.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.320
You stepped around Christmas, and it's like, stop it, Jeremy!

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
You're disrupting the spirit.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
Yahoo?

20:10.320 --> 20:11.320
Another Yahoo?

20:11.320 --> 20:12.320
This one was sending...

20:12.320 --> 20:13.320
All right.

20:13.320 --> 20:18.680
I mean, it's a bad company.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.680
You don't have to cheer for Yahoo.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
They provide a good...

20:21.680 --> 20:22.680
Oh, yeah, okay.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.560
You have a haunted doll down there in the front row, and it's freaking me out.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.800
Not because it's a haunted doll.

20:26.800 --> 20:32.680
I keep thinking it's a baby, that you're just like, look at these three goofins.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.680
Someday, darling.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.960
I just keep seeing it out of the corner of my eye, and it's freaking me out.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
Yeah.

20:38.960 --> 20:44.080
You can even lower it out of eyesight, if you want to see it.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.080
It's your seat.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.080
You can do whatever you want with it.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.080
But...

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
Griffin, are you ready?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.080
Yeah.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.080
I just lost...

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
It's nice.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.080
I lost the website, unfortunately.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.080
Yahoo.com?

20:53.080 --> 20:59.400
Yeah, no, it's almost like it's a really fucking bad website that I'm gonna dance on its fucking

20:59.400 --> 21:01.240
grave when Yahoo's gone.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.960
When Yahoo's gone, I will do a dance on its grave.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.520
Do you need some filler?

21:05.520 --> 21:08.200
No, I'll just read another one, but that one's just got eaten.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
Which one was it?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.200
Can you get it back?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.200
It's gone.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.200
That's what I'm saying.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
Which one was it?

21:13.200 --> 21:14.200
I'll try to remember it.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.200
No, forget it.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.200
How about this one instead?

21:16.200 --> 21:17.200
Okay.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.600
It was sent in by Rachel Rosen.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.600
You here, Rachel?

21:22.600 --> 21:27.560
Thank you, Rachel.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.200
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.200
It's probably not gonna load.

21:30.200 --> 21:36.040
Oh, Rinaldo, it loaded something.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.720
Fucking toilet website.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.320
I'm gonna get that other tab back.

21:40.320 --> 21:58.920
Rinaldo asks, what would happen if I pinched a police officer for not wearing green today?

21:58.920 --> 22:04.000
I don't have that instinct where I look at a police officer and think, I wonder how much

22:04.000 --> 22:07.800
stuff I could get away with doing to and on them.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.800
Yeah.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.280
What would they let me get away with?

22:10.280 --> 22:17.000
I mean, the answer is you're a white man, so pretty much whatever you want, but...

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
But...

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Whoa.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Commentary.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Whoa.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, shit, there he goes.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Damn, he's getting fired up.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
He's getting political.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.920
Didn't think that one was worth a laugh, but...

22:26.920 --> 22:27.920
He's going back to his seats.

22:27.920 --> 22:31.840
But wouldn't you feel bad if you pinched that cop and he turned around and he had a green

22:31.840 --> 22:32.840
lapel pin on?

22:32.840 --> 22:33.840
Oh, boy, oh, I did my parts.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.840
Oh, no, it's not.

22:34.840 --> 22:35.840
Oh, nothing to see.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.840
Nothing to pinch here.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.840
Nothing to pinch here.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.840
Oh, lighty, lighty, light.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.840
My granddad made me this lapel.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.840
No, no, no, no, no.

22:40.840 --> 22:41.840
It's cool.

22:41.840 --> 22:42.840
We're Irish.

22:42.840 --> 22:43.840
It's fine.

22:43.840 --> 22:44.840
It's cool.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
It's fine.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.840
It's fine.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
It's fine.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.840
Oh, Delilah.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.840
Oh, Delilah?

22:49.840 --> 22:50.840
You pinched me.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
You pinched me, Denny Boy.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.840
We're Irish.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.840
You can tell by our accents.

22:53.840 --> 22:54.840
Yeah.

22:54.840 --> 22:55.840
Our very good accents.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.840
Griffin, you didn't do one.

22:58.840 --> 22:59.840
Do one.

22:59.840 --> 23:00.840
Yeah.

23:00.840 --> 23:01.840
No, I'm good.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.840
I need you to do one.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
We all need to be in this.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
Yeah.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.840
Tora, lora, lora.

23:05.840 --> 23:06.840
You pinched me good.

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
I deserve that one, didn't I, Lighty?

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
How about that?

23:08.840 --> 23:13.840
Tora, lora, lora.

23:13.840 --> 23:18.840
Have you ever wanted to change your fate?

23:18.840 --> 23:25.840
That was brave and Scottish.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.840
Yeah.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.840
It's a quote from the movie, Brave, Pixar's best movie.

23:29.840 --> 23:34.840
Come at me.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
It was just okay.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.840
Her family turns into bears.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
Like, what the fuck, guys?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.840
Like, you had a good movie, and then it's like, my family's bears.

23:40.840 --> 23:41.840
Like, what?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.840
And Griffin, everyone's super worried about mom.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.840
The children are bears.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.840
The kids are bears and, like, having fun.

23:48.840 --> 23:54.840
They could, like, kill a guy, and it's like, oh, my brothers, they killed a guy.

23:54.840 --> 23:55.840
Mama mia.

23:55.840 --> 23:56.840
Mama mia.

23:56.840 --> 24:03.840
He's actually got away from you.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.840
I'm going to pinch a cop.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.840
I am.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.840
Next cop I see not wearing green, I don't care what day of the week it is, I want to

24:10.840 --> 24:11.840
pinch him.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.840
Is it illegal?

24:12.840 --> 24:13.840
Who's the bigger Christian?

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
Is it illegal to pinch a cop?

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
Somebody say yes.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.840
Well, this is a comedy show.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
We don't need answers.

24:21.840 --> 24:22.840
Thanks, Matt.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.840
Thanks, Matt Locke.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.840
We'll do the law up here.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.840
I mean, is it legal to pinch anybody?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.840
I didn't wear green yesterday at all, and I traveled.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.840
I was on an airplane, and I saw lots of people wearing lots of green, and I thought, am I

24:33.840 --> 24:34.840
going to get pinched?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.840
And I thought, no, I'm a 29-year-old man.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.840
Like, nobody's going to walk up to me and be like, boop.

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
Gotcha.

24:40.840 --> 24:46.840
Looks like we didn't see that special color on you, boop.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.840
The mood I'm in while I'm traveling, I would leap in the air and spin kick them.

24:49.840 --> 24:50.840
Like, I have no basis.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.840
Yeah, I'm always, like, on high alert.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.840
Yeah, high alert.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.840
I'm ready for anything.

24:56.840 --> 24:57.840
Want another question?

24:57.840 --> 24:58.840
Yeah, don't pinch it.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.840
Just, like, don't pinch a cop, I guess.

24:59.840 --> 25:00.840
Don't pinch anybody?

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
Don't pinch anybody.

25:01.840 --> 25:06.840
I guess the one teachable moment we have from this is probably don't pinch a cop.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.840
Or you'll get pinched.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
Oh.

25:10.840 --> 25:13.840
No, no, no, no, no.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.840
That got an applause rate.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.840
That got, like, a bad Gulf Drive applause.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.840
I'll take it.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.840
How proud do you think I am that I won't accept that?

25:25.840 --> 25:30.840
He wanged that one, but it's Jack Nicklaus, so.

25:30.840 --> 25:31.840
Did I say the right one?

25:31.840 --> 25:32.840
I don't know.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.840
I get Jack Nicklaus and Nichols.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
Somebody said no.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.840
Is it Nichols or Nichols?

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
Nicholstein.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.840
No, not that one.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.840
This June, I'm headed...

25:42.840 --> 25:43.840
That's weird.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.840
Oh, Jesus.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
Hold on, let me try again.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.840
This is my stuff.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.840
This June, I'm headed...

25:51.840 --> 25:53.840
Do you need me to defrag it?

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
Yeah, if you can try to read, just start with the third.

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
Let me run the diagnostics on it.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.840
Third question.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.840
This June, I'm headed...

26:00.840 --> 26:01.840
Keep going.

26:01.840 --> 26:02.840
Just keep going.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
This June, I'm headed...

26:03.840 --> 26:07.840
I want a munch squad.

26:07.840 --> 26:11.840
I want two munch squads.

26:11.840 --> 26:17.840
Welcome to Munch Squad, the show of the show.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.840
I'm really excited.

26:19.840 --> 26:24.840
This is a very new take on Munch Squad.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.840
Not new, precisely, but I owe this one to Matt.

26:27.840 --> 26:32.840
Matt's an Australian who saw the thing that we're about to talk about,

26:32.840 --> 26:37.840
which is the chicken parmi from Jenny's, and it's a pie.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
From whose?

26:39.840 --> 26:42.840
It's Jenny's chicken parmi.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
Who's Jenny's?

26:43.840 --> 26:44.840
I'm going to show...

26:44.840 --> 26:50.840
You all won't be able to see this very well, but this is the chicken...

26:50.840 --> 26:53.840
For those of you at home, it looks like it's screaming.

26:53.840 --> 26:58.840
Yeah, it looks like a screaming pie.

26:58.840 --> 27:03.840
It looks like if you cut a chicken pot pie in half, and the pie yelled at being cut in half.

27:03.840 --> 27:04.840
How could you?

27:04.840 --> 27:05.840
No!

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
Well, he's Australian, so he'd be like,

27:07.840 --> 27:09.840
Gore Blimey, how could you?

27:09.840 --> 27:10.840
La-dee-da-dee-da.

27:10.840 --> 27:11.840
La-dee-da-dee-da-ay.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.840
To-ra-la-la-la.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.840
It's cool, we're Australian.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
Jeez, jeez, jeez.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.840
So, listen.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.840
Listen!

27:18.840 --> 27:20.840
You can get this one at Jester's.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.840
And the thing...

27:21.840 --> 27:22.840
What is it?

27:22.840 --> 27:23.840
Is it Jenny's or Jester's?

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
It's Jenny's pie at Jester's.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.840
It's Jenny's...

27:27.840 --> 27:29.840
Just shut up.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.840
Let me do my podcast.

27:32.840 --> 27:36.840
My great award-winning podcast, Munch Squad, within your podcast.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.840
We've rented out this small space for you.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.840
This small retail space in the corner of the store.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
All right, you're gonna make me stand up.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.840
So, okay.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.840
So, Matt's an Australian, and Matt saw this pie, and he was like,

27:51.840 --> 27:52.840
that's a Munch Squad right there.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.840
But there was no press release,

27:54.840 --> 27:57.840
so Matt emailed the franchisee manager and said,

27:57.840 --> 28:03.840
Hi, I need a press release about your chicken parm.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.840
So, wait.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.840
This is our first bespoke Munch Squad.

28:07.840 --> 28:12.840
This is the, like, PR blast of this press release.

28:12.840 --> 28:13.840
This is the first sort of...

28:13.840 --> 28:16.840
I'm announcing the chicken parm.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.840
So, here's the reason it's called Jenny's, okay?

28:19.840 --> 28:24.840
This is a statewide Jester's pie competition,

28:24.840 --> 28:29.840
and Jen Bogg was the creator of it, okay?

28:29.840 --> 28:34.840
And Jen Bogg from Waikiki has won a statewide Jester's pie competition

28:34.840 --> 28:37.840
with her yummy chicken parm-y pie.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.840
The soup pie star.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
Stop it.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.840
That's not...

28:42.840 --> 28:44.840
That doesn't sound like the thing you want.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.840
If it was a soup designing competition, I could meet you halfway,

28:48.840 --> 28:52.840
but no, it's soup pie star competition called on members of the public

28:52.840 --> 28:55.840
to create a new and unique pie-flavored...

28:55.840 --> 28:57.840
fucking mission accomplished, I guess,

28:57.840 --> 29:00.840
to be sold in Jester's stores across WA...

29:00.840 --> 29:03.840
I'm assuming that's Western Australia, is that a state?

29:03.840 --> 29:05.840
Yeah.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.840
No, it's...

29:06.840 --> 29:08.840
Hey, context clues. Come on, y'all.

29:08.840 --> 29:09.840
Come on, y'all.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.840
I said Australia, all right?

29:11.840 --> 29:14.840
They're really going to like this one in the other country, aren't they?

29:14.840 --> 29:17.840
In that one specific Northwestern state?

29:17.840 --> 29:21.840
Australia, we're exporting our pies to Washington.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.840
As a joke.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.840
Yeah, it's a bad pie, mate.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.840
We made it as a joke for Washington.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.840
Ms. Bogg won out of almost 2,000 entries

29:30.840 --> 29:33.840
with about 400 votes for her parm-y pie recipe.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.840
That's not very many.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.840
It's not impressing you.

29:36.840 --> 29:37.840
Sorry, sorry.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.840
I don't want to be mean, but was that on Internet?

29:39.840 --> 29:41.840
Because there's a lot of folks.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.840
Considering there were 2,000 entrants,

29:43.840 --> 29:46.840
you have to assume most of you were voting for their own pies,

29:46.840 --> 29:50.840
and 400 people were like, no, that's actually better than mine.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
What are the other pies in that case?

29:52.840 --> 29:53.840
Dust and mothballs.

29:53.840 --> 29:54.840
Yeah.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.840
And old soup in a pie.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.840
So here's the quote.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.840
Here's the quote from Jenny.

30:01.840 --> 30:05.840
I know you're wondering, how did you come up with this pie?

30:05.840 --> 30:08.840
She says, I love chicken parmies.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.840
And I love pies.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
All right.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.840
What better way to bring my two loves together

30:14.840 --> 30:16.840
than by combining them?

30:16.840 --> 30:17.840
Nope.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.840
I love my kid, and I love bourbon.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
I also love to cook.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.840
But I'm pretty accident-prone in the kitchen.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
I thought you were saying you love your kid,

30:33.840 --> 30:35.840
and you love bourbon, and you love to cook.

30:35.840 --> 30:36.840
No.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.840
The quote is, I also love to cook.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.840
But I'm pretty accident-prone in the kitchen.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.840
This is an accident, so good job.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.840
Good job describing.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.840
And I thought I would leave the cooking to gestures

30:49.840 --> 30:51.840
and just sit back and enjoy the new flavor.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.840
So she doesn't want to make her own line of chicken parmies

30:54.840 --> 30:56.840
that she could sell.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.840
Right.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.840
This is made, what's in it?

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
Crumbled chicken breast.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.840
That's a bad start.

31:05.840 --> 31:08.840
That's not among the things I want chicken to do.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.840
It's not supposed to do that.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.840
They probably mean, that's probably Australian for,

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
it has a crust, right?

31:15.840 --> 31:17.840
Breaded, maybe?

31:17.840 --> 31:18.840
Somebody's saying yes.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.840
Why do you know what Australian's called?

31:21.840 --> 31:24.840
Anyway, it's made with crumbed chicken breast,

31:24.840 --> 31:25.840
mashed potato.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.840
Shh, let's just sneak it in.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.840
They won't notice.

31:28.840 --> 31:35.840
And Napoletana sauce and tasty cheese,

31:35.840 --> 31:37.840
which is better than the alternative.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.840
I agree.

31:39.840 --> 31:45.840
This is made with good flavors and enjoyable taste.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.840
This Australian pub favorite was made available

31:47.840 --> 31:48.840
in all gesture stores.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.840
Book your plane tickets now.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.840
From Tuesday, March 7th.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.840
I have a very, very important question.

31:56.840 --> 31:57.840
Wait, I'm almost done.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.840
I'm almost done.

31:58.840 --> 32:03.840
Ms. Bog even gets a piece of the pie profits.

32:03.840 --> 32:07.840
She will get 50 C, that could be literally

32:07.840 --> 32:09.840
any amount of money,

32:09.840 --> 32:13.840
for every chicken parmi pie sold.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.840
That's the, let's just take,

32:15.840 --> 32:18.840
They sell for 100,000 C's.

32:18.840 --> 32:19.840
Here's one more look,

32:19.840 --> 32:22.840
because I know you want it, yeah.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.840
This is a real question.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.840
There's french fries hiding behind it.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.840
They're embarrassed to be there.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.840
Oh no, get us out.

32:30.840 --> 32:35.840
Is Waikiki in Australia?

32:35.840 --> 32:38.840
I'm hearing mixed answers.

32:38.840 --> 32:43.840
How many people thought it was in Hawaii like I did?

32:43.840 --> 32:46.840
And how many people think it's in Australia?

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
Okay.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
We have our answer.

32:48.840 --> 32:52.840
They're not Wikipedia, they paid to be here.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.840
Like we can't Google our audience.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.840
I found that Yahoo, I rescued it from the depths.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.840
What the fuck?

33:00.840 --> 33:01.840
Okay, I literally had it,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.840
and then literally a second later,

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
I'm not fucking kidding, a second later,

33:05.840 --> 33:07.840
I said here it comes and it refreshed.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.840
Sorry, this content is not available right now.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.840
I didn't touch anything.

33:10.840 --> 33:11.840
It's shy.

33:11.840 --> 33:15.840
This is our first shy Yahoo answer.

33:15.840 --> 33:26.840
Someday you'll start screen capping them.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.840
Un-fucking-believable.

33:29.840 --> 33:30.840
I have no other stalls.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.840
That was my one big stall, was that one.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.840
All right, but I'm going to jump into whatever happens next

33:36.840 --> 33:37.840
in the middle of it and be like,

33:37.840 --> 33:39.840
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

33:39.840 --> 33:40.840
Okay, that's fine.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.840
Let's add a little suspense.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.840
Hold on, let me, let's screenshot some.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.840
No, I'll figure it out.

33:49.840 --> 33:53.840
This June, I'm headed to Japan for 10 days.

33:53.840 --> 33:54.840
It's a question.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.840
It's a question.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.840
Also, he's allowed to if he wants.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.840
Yeah.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.840
Fuck you.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.840
Why did you respond to my like, no, how dare you.

34:05.840 --> 34:10.840
This June, I'm headed to Japan for 10 days, not me.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.840
I'm a question asker and two of the four people going with me

34:13.840 --> 34:15.840
have decided not to go.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.840
Cool friends.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.840
After I already purchased the plane tickets.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.840
Super cool friends, holy shit.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.840
That's got to be cheap, right?

34:23.840 --> 34:26.840
The flight tickets to Japan, 20 bucks, 30 bucks.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
The tickets are non-refundable,

34:27.840 --> 34:29.840
but I think if I really put in some effort,

34:29.840 --> 34:31.840
I might be able to get some back.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.840
I'm starting to think the extra space

34:33.840 --> 34:37.840
on the international flight is more valuable.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.840
Please advise, it's from Chase Robinson of,

34:39.840 --> 34:43.840
is this Portland or some other place, I guess.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
God, that's good.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.840
Chase, are you here?

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
Wow, you took a while, Chase.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.840
Now, Chase, are you really here or are you an imposter?

34:53.840 --> 34:55.840
Okay, so it's not really Chase.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.840
You all just can't handle silence, huh?

34:58.840 --> 34:59.840
Is that what it is?

34:59.840 --> 35:01.840
It's okay, it's fine.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.840
If Chase isn't here, our feelings aren't hurt,

35:03.840 --> 35:07.840
but I will ask one more time and just please complete silence.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.840
Chase, are you here?

35:09.840 --> 35:13.840
All right.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.840
I think maybe we've gone a little too hard.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.840
Is a Chase here?

35:18.840 --> 35:21.840
Mike, can you just shout out a number

35:21.840 --> 35:26.840
of how much the tickets cost?

35:26.840 --> 35:29.840
That is not where the voice came from.

35:29.840 --> 35:30.840
Ticket prices fluctuate.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.840
Chase.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.840
450, what the fuck?

35:34.840 --> 35:35.840
That is not true.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
You are not Chase.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.840
That's a good deal though, Chase.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.840
450 is like, there's a tugboat I found

35:41.840 --> 35:43.840
that is going to go to Japan.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.840
Some weird old lady is letting me dress up like her dog

35:46.840 --> 35:49.840
and she's going to crate me for 450.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.840
They let me just sleep in the overhead compartment to get there.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.840
I'm mailing myself like in a fucking flat Stanley novel.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.840
I'm flat Stanley-ing myself.

35:58.840 --> 36:06.840
I'm getting nurmalled to Tokyo.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.840
Mike, I went to Japan for my honeymoon in 2013.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.840
It was $1,300.

36:10.840 --> 36:14.840
That's a lot of money to put up your legs, kind of.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.840
Yeah, he's saying if you bought the extra ticket.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.840
If you bought the extra ticket and just ate it

36:19.840 --> 36:22.840
so you could have a seat for your backpack to chill on.

36:22.840 --> 36:26.840
At that point, you could just fly first class.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.840
I know you've already bought the tickets.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.840
Yeah, you can't trade two bad ones for one good one.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.840
Okay, but can you?

36:34.840 --> 36:37.840
Could you find an eccentric millionaire sitting in first class

36:37.840 --> 36:39.840
to be like, you ever know what it's like?

36:39.840 --> 36:43.840
One cheek on one seat, one cheek on the other.

36:43.840 --> 36:48.840
You look like a person who appreciates exotic experiences.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.840
In one fucking screen, you can have Miss Peregrine's Home

36:51.840 --> 36:52.840
for Peculiar Children.

36:52.840 --> 36:59.840
In the other one, you can have Don't Breathe, just like Christmas.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.840
You get the fucking quiche and you get the fruit plate for breakfast.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.840
You'll lose your mind.

37:05.840 --> 37:11.840
When I was flying here from Dulles.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.840
Guys, he knows where he lives.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.840
Kind of a one way thing.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.840
When I was flying here from Dulles, it's in Virginia.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.840
It's near DC.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.840
I was flying here and there was another gentleman

37:23.840 --> 37:26.840
of large carriage in the row with me.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.840
He had the window and I had the aisle.

37:28.840 --> 37:32.840
The whole time, when we first sat down, there was nobody in the middle.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.840
We were both just staring at that fucking thing,

37:35.840 --> 37:39.840
staring at the door, willing no one else to come in.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.840
You could tell we were thinking it, that we didn't acknowledge it.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.840
Then they made the boarding things like,

37:46.840 --> 37:49.840
we're about to start pulling out or whatever we say here.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.840
I don't really listen.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.840
What was it?

37:52.840 --> 37:53.840
Yeah, whatever.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.840
We're about to fly through the sky like a bird or a dragon.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.840
What the fuck?

37:58.840 --> 37:59.840
I'm a pilot.

37:59.840 --> 38:00.840
I've been doing this for 20 years.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
I still think it's fucking crazy.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.840
We're like dragons up here.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.840
How's this magic work?

38:04.840 --> 38:05.840
This is Dylan.

38:05.840 --> 38:08.840
He's going to stand in front of you and hold a mask

38:08.840 --> 38:10.840
and show you how to put on a seat belt.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.840
You're going to play Zelda on your Switch and pretend to pay attention.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.840
All right.

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
Oops.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
Uh-oh.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
Justin broke.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.840
Me and this other gentleman were in the row.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.840
When they made that announcement,

38:25.840 --> 38:29.840
he wordlessly reached over and just extended the pound.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.840
It's so fucking choice.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.840
We did not talk the rest of the flight.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.840
But as soon as that door shut,

38:40.840 --> 38:43.840
we're like bags on the seat, coats on the seat,

38:43.840 --> 38:45.840
pull the thing down, put our drinks on it.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.840
We're just like kings of this row.

38:48.840 --> 38:49.840
That's nice.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.840
That's like you're at a really...

38:50.840 --> 38:52.840
He's the best friend I ever had.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.840
It's like you're at a classy bar.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.840
Read it before it goes away.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.840
Okay, I got it because I paired to my fucking phone.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
Wait, wait, wait.

39:00.840 --> 39:01.840
Can we answer that person?

39:01.840 --> 39:02.840
I forget what the question was.

39:02.840 --> 39:03.840
I'm too excited about this.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.840
I want to answer Chase real quick.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.840
Oh, that's a lot of money.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.840
That's like so much money probably.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
It's like so much money, Chase.

39:10.840 --> 39:11.840
So try to get some of your money back

39:11.840 --> 39:13.840
because it's the worst investment you can make

39:13.840 --> 39:14.840
because the moment you touch down,

39:14.840 --> 39:16.840
you'd be like, oh, fuck me.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.840
I could have had $600.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.840
And I don't know how standby works,

39:21.840 --> 39:25.840
but that feels like something where they give your ticket away

39:25.840 --> 39:26.840
because there's just like an empty seat

39:26.840 --> 39:28.840
and they'd be like, oh, yeah, here you go.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.840
It's like, oh, my $1,300 is just gone.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.840
Hey, what is the deal with standby?

39:32.840 --> 39:33.840
Yeah, what's the deal?

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
Hey, what's going on?

39:34.840 --> 39:37.840
There it is.

39:37.840 --> 39:38.840
There he goes.

39:38.840 --> 39:44.840
There he goes.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.840
My dreams have come true.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.840
In case you're listening,

39:47.840 --> 39:48.840
my brother was just dancing around

39:48.840 --> 39:55.840
in the fashion of Gerald Seinfeld doing some of his classic material.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.840
No, but really, are those people just showing up

39:57.840 --> 39:59.840
and hoping they can get on a plane?

39:59.840 --> 40:00.840
Fingers crossed.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.840
Got on my back, back two weeks off work.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
Here we go.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
Rolling dice, baby.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
Rolling bones, mama.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.840
Okay.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.840
Hit me.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.840
Get your money back.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.840
This one was sent in by, I think, John Thomas Mason,

40:11.840 --> 40:14.840
but that name disappeared about 35 minutes ago,

40:14.840 --> 40:15.840
so I'm kind of boring from the rain.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
I think that's who it was.

40:16.840 --> 40:17.840
Thank you, John.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.840
It's Yahoo Answers user sexyjanitor asks.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.840
D-J-I-N-N?

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
What?

40:24.840 --> 40:26.840
Sexy gin like a genie?

40:26.840 --> 40:29.840
Janitor, pay attention.

40:29.840 --> 40:35.840
Because I got excited.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.840
I was about to make a whole run on sexyjanitor stuff,

40:37.840 --> 40:38.840
and you've been over there like,

40:38.840 --> 40:41.840
that's not genie stuff.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.840
I've been over here just working that punch.

40:43.840 --> 40:44.840
You're like, oh.

40:44.840 --> 40:52.840
And you're like, that's not a...

40:52.840 --> 40:57.840
This fucking hot-ass janitor asks.

40:57.840 --> 41:04.840
This fucking bonerific custodian.

41:04.840 --> 41:10.840
Why are you so mad at me?

41:10.840 --> 41:13.840
Accidentally watched a legal movie.

41:13.840 --> 41:16.840
I walked in on my brother watching a movie.

41:16.840 --> 41:17.840
I had not seen this movie.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.840
It was Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiarity.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.840
I watched it over someone's shoulder

41:23.840 --> 41:25.840
sitting across from me on the plane, and...

41:25.840 --> 41:28.840
I bet it made as much sense doing that as watching it.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.840
I watched it on a plane.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.840
There's a lot of spooky imagery,

41:32.840 --> 41:35.840
and a lot of like, that made kids kind of weird.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.840
And I was like, I saw that, and I was like, whoa.

41:38.840 --> 41:42.840
I walked in on my brother watching Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiarity.

41:42.840 --> 41:43.840
Is it kids or children?

41:43.840 --> 41:44.840
Who knows?

41:44.840 --> 41:47.840
I had not seen this movie, so I watched it too.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.840
He told me later, he downloaded it, in all caps,

41:50.840 --> 41:55.840
off of a website.

41:55.840 --> 42:00.840
Our fucking audience was just like, revolted.

42:00.840 --> 42:05.840
I did not know they told such a hard line against cyber piracy.

42:05.840 --> 42:10.840
No, God.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.840
Why?

42:13.840 --> 42:18.840
But I wouldn't rob a bank.

42:18.840 --> 42:22.840
You know, you laugh,

42:22.840 --> 42:25.840
but put up a television show that isn't available internationally,

42:25.840 --> 42:28.840
you'll start to take a pretty hard line against piracy too.

42:28.840 --> 42:29.840
Don't you dare!

42:29.840 --> 42:30.840
It's fun!

42:30.840 --> 42:31.840
Do it to Billy Zane!

42:31.840 --> 42:32.840
Do it to Tom Hanks!

42:32.840 --> 42:35.840
Not to me!

42:35.840 --> 42:36.840
Steel claiming the cube!

42:36.840 --> 42:38.840
It's hard to find!

42:38.840 --> 42:39.840
Not to me!

42:39.840 --> 42:41.840
You do a lot of bits on your podcast

42:41.840 --> 42:45.840
about how shoplifting is not only cool,

42:45.840 --> 42:48.840
but basically not a big deal at all,

42:48.840 --> 42:50.840
and you sort of accumulate this persona

42:50.840 --> 42:52.840
where people think they can come to you

42:52.840 --> 42:53.840
and just be like,

42:53.840 --> 42:55.840
hey, I stole all your shit!

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
And you're like, okay.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
All right, I see where we went wrong.

42:59.840 --> 43:00.840
That's fine.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.840
I guess they do have repercussions sometimes.

43:02.840 --> 43:03.840
I'm sorry.

43:03.840 --> 43:07.840
My name is Derek Best Buy and Checkmate.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.840
I stole your thing.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
I downloaded a movie off a website.

43:11.840 --> 43:12.840
This is illegal.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.840
How do I hide this from the police

43:13.840 --> 43:18.840
so we do not have to go to jail?

43:18.840 --> 43:22.840
So one more question.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.840
All right, it makes total sense.

43:24.840 --> 43:25.840
I'm sorry.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.840
I just got to ask one more thing.

43:29.840 --> 43:33.840
How does Zootopia end?

43:33.840 --> 43:35.840
What particular movie snacks did you enjoy

43:35.840 --> 43:37.840
when you saw Zootopia?

43:37.840 --> 43:38.840
Butter Crunch.

43:38.840 --> 43:39.840
Do you mean popcorn?

43:39.840 --> 43:40.840
Yeah.

43:40.840 --> 43:41.840
Checkmate.

43:41.840 --> 43:42.840
Boo Boo Cheese.

43:42.840 --> 43:43.840
What is it?

43:43.840 --> 43:47.840
It's Juju Beans, but I said it funny.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.840
That sounded like a racist thing,

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
and I know it wasn't,

43:50.840 --> 43:54.840
but it sounded racist to someone.

43:54.840 --> 43:55.840
Minu Gents.

43:55.840 --> 43:56.840
God damn it.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.840
Whoa, is there a fucking movie candy

43:58.840 --> 44:01.840
that doesn't sound racist when you say it backwards?

44:01.840 --> 44:03.840
Senior Mints.

44:03.840 --> 44:04.840
Snowcaps are good.

44:04.840 --> 44:05.840
Snowcaps are safe.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.840
Thank you.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.840
One time this reminds me of a different crime

44:09.840 --> 44:10.840
that I committed.

44:10.840 --> 44:12.840
I ran a red light in L.A.,

44:12.840 --> 44:14.840
and there was red light cameras,

44:14.840 --> 44:16.840
and there were like four of them in all of L.A.,

44:16.840 --> 44:19.840
and it's really fucked up

44:19.840 --> 44:21.840
because it's not actually the police.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.840
It's like a whole separate agency,

44:23.840 --> 44:26.840
and it costs like $800 for the ticket.

44:26.840 --> 44:27.840
Oh, shit.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.840
And the thing is, you can just not pay it.

44:30.840 --> 44:31.840
This is true.

44:31.840 --> 44:35.840
They won't follow up on it unless...

44:35.840 --> 44:37.840
Unless...

44:37.840 --> 44:40.840
You get arrested for something else.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.840
And if you get arrested for something else,

44:42.840 --> 44:44.840
they'll be like, oh, cool, so you shoplifted.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.840
And also, I see here, you ran a red light,

44:47.840 --> 44:50.840
and at that point, you have to pay like $1,600.

44:50.840 --> 44:53.840
So you're kind of rolling the bones on like,

44:53.840 --> 44:57.840
I just hope I never get arrested for anything ever.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.840
I heard that you don't have to pay those fees

44:59.840 --> 45:02.840
because you have the right to face your accuser in court,

45:02.840 --> 45:04.840
so if you challenge it, then they can't...

45:04.840 --> 45:06.840
They have to cut the red light off and bring it.

45:06.840 --> 45:07.840
Yeah.

45:07.840 --> 45:08.840
Like fucking...

45:08.840 --> 45:11.840
There is no joke, like a laundry list,

45:11.840 --> 45:14.840
a hundred item long of things you can do to get out of it,

45:14.840 --> 45:16.840
and one is to just say, wasn't me.

45:16.840 --> 45:17.840
Yeah.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.840
And they're like, gah!

45:19.840 --> 45:23.840
They bring the light in like fucking, what is it, Spark 343?

45:23.840 --> 45:26.840
It's just like, you talk to it?

45:26.840 --> 45:27.840
Halo?

45:27.840 --> 45:28.840
Halo, yeah!

45:28.840 --> 45:29.840
It's the one...

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
Woo!

45:30.840 --> 45:32.840
Bungie's classic shooter.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.840
All fucking amped now, thinking about all my good times.

45:35.840 --> 45:39.840
Shooting guys with Master Chief, my best friend.

45:39.840 --> 45:40.840
Fuck yeah, dude.

45:40.840 --> 45:41.840
What's your favorite?

45:41.840 --> 45:42.840
Halo 4 for me.

45:42.840 --> 45:43.840
Fuck yeah, dude.

45:43.840 --> 45:44.840
Jetpacks?

45:44.840 --> 45:45.840
Let's get into it.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.840
I'm an assault rifle man.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.840
Yeah, dude.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.840
I turn on my Xbox with my friends

45:50.840 --> 45:53.840
and I just go at it with Master Chief.

45:53.840 --> 45:57.840
And I see the floods show up and I'm like, too scary.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.840
I didn't know there was a scary alien game.

46:00.840 --> 46:01.840
What?

46:01.840 --> 46:05.840
What?

46:05.840 --> 46:08.840
I tried to play Call of Duty, but it was like,

46:08.840 --> 46:11.840
where's Master Chief?

46:11.840 --> 46:14.840
Turn off, throw disk back into GameStop.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.840
I don't want it.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.840
What did you want?

46:17.840 --> 46:21.840
I want Halo 4 and 5.

46:21.840 --> 46:23.840
My good buddy, Master Chief.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
What about a Halo 3?

46:25.840 --> 46:26.840
Halo 3 was all right.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.840
Just kidding.

46:27.840 --> 46:30.840
It kicked ass.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.840
What about that part of Halo 2

46:32.840 --> 46:34.840
where you played as the Arbiter?

46:34.840 --> 46:35.840
That was actually in Halo 2.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.840
Did you even play the fucking Halo games?

46:37.840 --> 46:38.840
I thought you were 100%.

46:38.840 --> 46:39.840
What about that part of Halo 2

46:39.840 --> 46:40.840
where you were the Arbiter?

46:40.840 --> 46:42.840
I'm going to go.

46:42.840 --> 46:43.840
Travis.

46:43.840 --> 46:44.840
Uh-huh.

46:44.840 --> 46:45.840
Travis.

46:45.840 --> 46:46.840
What's your Halo?

46:46.840 --> 46:47.840
Master Chief kicks ass.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.840
Yeah, dude.

46:48.840 --> 46:49.840
Fucking green armor.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.840
He can carry two guns at a time.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.840
Are you some kind of wuss?

46:52.840 --> 46:57.840
I just play Dragon Age.

46:57.840 --> 47:00.840
That's not real gamers.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.840
Master Chief only...

47:02.840 --> 47:08.840
No, Master Chief's the only good game.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.840
Shortly after.

47:11.840 --> 47:15.840
Master Chief's my favorite game of all time.

47:15.840 --> 47:17.840
I like Master Chief Jr.

47:17.840 --> 47:18.840
Hey.

47:18.840 --> 47:22.840
I was just...

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
Hold on.

47:23.840 --> 47:24.840
Let it land.

47:24.840 --> 47:25.840
Master Chief Jr.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
I was like Master Chief Jr.

47:27.840 --> 47:28.840
It's a thinker, folks.

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
Yeah.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
You'll get it.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.840
Drive home.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.840
Don't check your brains at the door.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.840
We got a lot of slow burns here.

47:35.840 --> 47:46.840
I was just possessed by the zeal of working in the video games industry for a decade.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.840
Folks, the Max Fun Drive is over,

47:49.840 --> 47:52.840
and you're enjoying our Portland live show.

47:52.840 --> 47:53.840
I hope you're enjoying it.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.840
I look back on it favorably,

47:55.840 --> 47:58.840
because that was before me and Henry both just got sick

47:58.840 --> 48:00.840
and will just always kind of have a cold, I guess,

48:00.840 --> 48:03.840
until he leaves for college or whatever.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.840
So it's nice to look back and be like, ah, health.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.840
Ah, the vitality.

48:08.840 --> 48:09.840
The spring of youth.

48:09.840 --> 48:10.840
Vitality. How nice.

48:10.840 --> 48:12.840
Before we get to our ads this week,

48:12.840 --> 48:16.840
I do want to say thank you to everybody who donated in the Max Fun Drive.

48:16.840 --> 48:20.840
I cannot believe that so many people stepped up and supported the show.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.840
It just means the world to me.

48:22.840 --> 48:26.840
And if you are a donor, just in case you missed it,

48:26.840 --> 48:30.840
we put up part two of the Adventure Zone bonus,

48:30.840 --> 48:32.840
featuring special guest Lin Manuel Miranda.

48:32.840 --> 48:34.840
And I'm very proud of it, and I want to tell everybody about it.

48:34.840 --> 48:35.840
It fucking rules.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
It was great.

48:36.840 --> 48:40.840
Yeah, we broke 24,000 donors, which is like, what did we do last year?

48:40.840 --> 48:43.840
I think we did like 9,800 last year.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.840
How the fuck?

48:44.840 --> 48:46.840
Hey, y'all, what the fuck, though?

48:46.840 --> 48:47.840
You're amazing.

48:47.840 --> 48:51.840
Griffin, how have you celebrated post-Max Fun Drive?

48:51.840 --> 48:52.840
Ah, dude, I'm glad you asked.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.840
I laid perfectly still on a couch

48:54.840 --> 48:57.840
and watched almost two whole seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

48:57.840 --> 48:58.840
Nice, nice.

48:58.840 --> 49:04.840
I'm taking a two-week Twitter hiatus and watching a lot of Psy videos.

49:04.840 --> 49:05.840
Psy?

49:05.840 --> 49:06.840
Yeah.

49:06.840 --> 49:08.840
Oh, the musician?

49:08.840 --> 49:12.840
Yeah, I've watched like Gangnam Style, and I got it from my daddy,

49:12.840 --> 49:13.840
just like on repeat.

49:13.840 --> 49:14.840
It just makes me really happy.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.840
I know it's not like the best music.

49:16.840 --> 49:17.840
You got the Psy videos from our dad?

49:17.840 --> 49:19.840
Our dad sent you Psy videos?

49:19.840 --> 49:21.840
No, it's the name of the song.

49:21.840 --> 49:22.840
I got it from my daddy.

49:22.840 --> 49:23.840
It's not important.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.840
This is not your main this week.

49:26.840 --> 49:27.840
No.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.840
Should we talk about our advertisements?

49:29.840 --> 49:31.840
Please do.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.840
I've got to load it up first because here they are.

49:34.840 --> 49:38.840
First advertisement is from a product, a service that is near and dear to my heart.

49:38.840 --> 49:39.840
That is Blue Apron.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.840
We've been using Blue Apron for a long time now,

49:42.840 --> 49:44.840
and what they do is for less than $10 per person per meal,

49:44.840 --> 49:48.840
they send you seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

49:48.840 --> 49:49.840
to make delicious home-cooked meals.

49:49.840 --> 49:52.840
Talking about stuff like spinach and fresh mozzarella.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.840
Nice. Nailed it.

49:54.840 --> 49:55.840
Got it in one.

49:55.840 --> 50:00.840
Pizza with olives, bell peppers, and ricotta salata.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.840
All right. Didn't quite get that one.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
Henry's favorite show is Curious George,

50:05.840 --> 50:09.840
and we accidentally watched nine seasons of it over the course of like two and a half weeks.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.840
And there's a guy on it named Chef Piscetti,

50:12.840 --> 50:15.840
and I don't know how this show isn't like under fire

50:15.840 --> 50:18.840
because it's sort of a hateful caricature, Chef Piscetti.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.840
Now Griffin, you say that it's his favorite show.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.840
That fool is four months old.

50:23.840 --> 50:24.840
What do you mean it's his favorite show?

50:24.840 --> 50:26.840
He's not like demanding it.

50:26.840 --> 50:29.840
He doesn't wake up and he's like Curious George now.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.840
He gets these like fever waves,

50:32.840 --> 50:36.840
and he gets really upset and like cries a lot very, very hard,

50:36.840 --> 50:40.840
and the only thing that will make this boy like chill out and stop crying

50:40.840 --> 50:43.840
and making himself sicker is plopping down in front of Chef Piscetti

50:43.840 --> 50:48.840
to get some of his good just caricature of a person wisdom.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.840
And so yes, Travis, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.840
Curious George saved my life.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.840
Saved my life in the war.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.840
Sweet and sour salmon with bok choy, carrot, and ginger fried rice,

50:58.840 --> 51:05.840
parmesan crusted chicken with creamy fettuccine and roasted broccoli.

51:05.840 --> 51:09.840
And so you're going to get all those really, really tasty.

51:09.840 --> 51:13.840
Rachel and I love Blue Apron and we cook all the time using these tasty boxes.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.840
And you can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals for free

51:16.840 --> 51:19.840
with free shipping by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.840
You're going to really enjoy it.

51:21.840 --> 51:22.840
I guarantee it.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.840
It's blueapron.com slash my brother.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.840
I want to talk this week about Lyft.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.840
So Lyft, you know, the ride sharing app.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.840
Lyft is my favorite.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.840
I don't know it.

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
They dipped on it.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.840
This is no judgment on Lyft, but they bounced on me.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.840
And so now it's like, baby, come back.

51:39.840 --> 51:41.840
To be fair, Griffin, we do travel a lot.

51:41.840 --> 51:44.840
So I'm sure you'll get an opportunity to Lyft once again.

51:44.840 --> 51:45.840
Someday I'll Lyft again.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.840
I use it not only for traveling.

51:47.840 --> 51:52.840
When Teresa and I lived in LA, it was just so much more convenient to like call a Lyft

51:52.840 --> 51:56.840
and not have to worry about parking or traffic or anything like that, you know,

51:56.840 --> 52:00.840
especially if you know you're going someplace where you're going to be imbibing alcohol.

52:00.840 --> 52:05.840
Taking a Lyft there and back is so much more responsible and I would say cooler.

52:05.840 --> 52:09.840
And, you know, it's an interesting combination because you do Lyft

52:09.840 --> 52:13.840
and you both get kind of the luxurious feeling of having a driver,

52:13.840 --> 52:16.840
but you also like are making a new friend.

52:16.840 --> 52:22.840
When I went to San Francisco for Sketchfest and I had a Lyft driver

52:22.840 --> 52:26.840
and I asked him if we could like go completely out of the way

52:26.840 --> 52:30.840
to stop at the Golden Gate Bridge before he took me to the airport.

52:30.840 --> 52:33.840
And he not only was like happy to oblige,

52:33.840 --> 52:36.840
he like talked to me about San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge

52:36.840 --> 52:42.840
and his experience of living there for I think about an hour and 15 minutes of travel.

52:42.840 --> 52:46.840
And it was just incredible and he was a really cool dude.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.840
And, you know, Lyft is affordable and it's…

52:49.840 --> 52:50.840
And he's the only driver.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.840
If you get a Lyft, it's going to be this guy.

52:52.840 --> 52:54.840
In San Francisco, I think he's the only adopter.

52:54.840 --> 52:59.840
No, it's a really great option and nothing against taxis.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.840
I've had a lot of great experiences in taxis too,

53:01.840 --> 53:06.840
but I have often found Lyft to be way more affordable.

53:06.840 --> 53:10.840
And I'm just a big fan and I'm not just saying that because they're a sponsor.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.840
I use Lyft all the time.

53:12.840 --> 53:17.840
And right now Lyft is offering our listeners a special deal for new users.

53:17.840 --> 53:21.840
You get three free rides up to $10 each.

53:21.840 --> 53:25.840
It's a $30 value when you enter the promo code BROTHER.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.840
Just download the free Lyft app today,

53:27.840 --> 53:30.840
enter the promo code BROTHER in the payment section

53:30.840 --> 53:33.840
and you'll get three free rides up to $10 each.

53:33.840 --> 53:34.840
It's a great deal.

53:34.840 --> 53:35.840
Go check it out.

53:35.840 --> 53:37.840
If you haven't tried Lyft, do it now.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.840
Use the promo code BROTHER.

53:39.840 --> 53:40.840
Get it.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.840
I have a couple of Jumbotron spots here.

53:42.840 --> 53:47.840
This one's for Chris with a K, a.k.a. Kromsler, a.k.a. Acid Burn.

53:47.840 --> 53:53.840
And it's from L, like the letter, a.k.a. Pinskidan, a.k.a. Lady Nikon.

53:53.840 --> 53:57.840
Do you think that these are like their graffiti tags?

53:57.840 --> 53:58.840
Yes.

53:58.840 --> 54:01.840
Also, they are, oh yeah, I mean the last ones are.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.840
The other ones are my bim bam sweet refs.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
They are?

54:05.840 --> 54:06.840
Wait, hold on.

54:06.840 --> 54:07.840
They are?

54:07.840 --> 54:08.840
Yeah.

54:08.840 --> 54:09.840
I don't know this.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.840
Justin was trying to come up with a name for a human being

54:11.840 --> 54:14.840
and he said Kromsler and Pinskidan because he's a mutant.

54:14.840 --> 54:15.840
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

54:15.840 --> 54:16.840
Why isn't Justin…

54:16.840 --> 54:18.840
Oh, Justin went taekwondo.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.840
Thanks for fulfilling my ridiculous pre-knowing you tweet

54:21.840 --> 54:25.840
of only accepting a proposal if it came at a live my bim bam show.

54:25.840 --> 54:28.840
We've gotten pretty hitched by the time that you hear this.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.840
If so, we've probably gotten hitched.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.840
Yeah, we've gotten pretty hitched.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.840
Listen, we've watched Hitch.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.840
We hitched up some horses.

54:36.840 --> 54:37.840
We are so hitched.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.840
We've probably gotten hitched by the time you hear this.

54:40.840 --> 54:42.840
If so, it was the best day of my life.

54:42.840 --> 54:46.840
Thank you for being attentive, affectionate, playful, six foot one,

54:46.840 --> 54:48.840
and of course atheist.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.840
Happy anniversary and birthday sugar booger.

54:50.840 --> 54:51.840
Hack the planet.

54:51.840 --> 54:52.840
Nice.

54:52.840 --> 54:56.840
Yeah, that's congratulations on your wedding maybe.

54:56.840 --> 55:00.840
If it has happened, I'm sure it was wonderful.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.840
If not, then happy tidings.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.840
Happy tidings and goodwill to all.

55:06.840 --> 55:08.840
This next message is for…

55:08.840 --> 55:12.840
It might be Anastasia, but I'm going to go with Anastasia.

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
Perfect.

55:13.840 --> 55:14.840
Because I like that better.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.840
And it could be Joey, but I'm going to go with Joey.

55:16.840 --> 55:18.840
Joey.

55:18.840 --> 55:20.840
By now, we are happily married.

55:20.840 --> 55:21.840
What the fuck?

55:21.840 --> 55:22.840
Wait, what's going on?

55:22.840 --> 55:23.840
What?

55:23.840 --> 55:24.840
Hold on.

55:24.840 --> 55:25.840
These are different people?

55:25.840 --> 55:26.840
Yeah.

55:26.840 --> 55:27.840
Probably.

55:27.840 --> 55:28.840
Oh, it's just spring, you know?

55:28.840 --> 55:29.840
It's wedding season.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.840
Everybody's getting hitched.

55:30.840 --> 55:31.840
Watching Hitch.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.840
I guess so.

55:32.840 --> 55:33.840
Oh, isn't that ironic?

55:33.840 --> 55:34.840
That joke's so nice.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.840
I had to tell it twice.

55:35.840 --> 55:39.840
Well, here's the thing, if you think about it, his name is Hitch,

55:39.840 --> 55:42.840
but he also helps people find relationships.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.840
So he's like hitching people up, which is not…

55:45.840 --> 55:46.840
Oh.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
I don't think people have used that gerund in that way.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.840
Like we're hitching people up when you introduce people to each other.

55:50.840 --> 55:51.840
Oh, yeah.

55:51.840 --> 55:54.840
But if you think about it, it works on two different levels,

55:54.840 --> 55:55.840
because it's both his name…

55:55.840 --> 55:59.840
His name is also the verb that means to attach to people in love.

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
Exactly.

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
So just think about it.

56:02.840 --> 56:06.840
We're stalling right now because the rest of this podcast is actually an hour of silence,

56:06.840 --> 56:08.840
and we don't want anybody to get to that part.

56:08.840 --> 56:11.840
By now, we are happily married, and what better way to celebrate

56:11.840 --> 56:14.840
than to announce it on our favorite podcast.

56:14.840 --> 56:16.840
You make me a better man, and I am lucky to have you.

56:16.840 --> 56:20.840
I can't wait to travel the world with you and spend the rest of our lives together.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.840
If you're still unsure if the brothers are talking about you,

56:23.840 --> 56:27.840
our dog's rap name is Lisa Lefty or Lopez.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.840
Somebody just lost their minds.

56:29.840 --> 56:30.840
They're like, but…

56:30.840 --> 56:31.840
Yeah.

56:31.840 --> 56:32.840
My dog.

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
It's me.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.840
I'm the Anastasia that they mentioned.

56:36.840 --> 56:38.840
That's me.

56:38.840 --> 56:42.840
Congratulations on your wedding again, maybe.

56:42.840 --> 56:43.840
Maybe?

56:43.840 --> 56:44.840
Probably, right?

56:44.840 --> 56:45.840
Yeah.

56:45.840 --> 56:46.840
Sure.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.840
And just on your love.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.840
Hey, congratulations on being hitched.

56:51.840 --> 56:52.840
Yeah.

56:52.840 --> 56:53.840
Oh, man.

56:53.840 --> 56:54.840
Will Smith.

56:54.840 --> 56:55.840
Like the movie.

56:55.840 --> 56:56.840
I want to thank…

56:56.840 --> 56:59.840
I don't know if we did it in the podcast, but John Roderick and the Long Winters

56:59.840 --> 57:02.840
for your use of our theme song instead of Parchoff putting the album…

57:02.840 --> 57:04.840
putting the album to bed.

57:04.840 --> 57:05.840
Exactly.

57:05.840 --> 57:09.840
And I want to thank all of our Max Fun listeners and all…

57:09.840 --> 57:10.840
Yes, thank you.

57:10.840 --> 57:12.840

57:12.840 --> 57:14.840
And go check out all the other amazing Max Fun shows.

57:14.840 --> 57:16.840
I will say that the…

57:16.840 --> 57:21.840
Flophouse is already one of my favorites, but every year, at least for the last two,

57:21.840 --> 57:24.840
they've had John Hodgman on for a special episode.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.840
And they did in 1941.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.840
And it was just an absolute treat.

57:28.840 --> 57:29.840
Highly recommend.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.840
Go check it out.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.840
And thank you to everybody who came to this Portland show.

57:33.840 --> 57:35.840
It was a buck wild audience.

57:35.840 --> 57:36.840
We hadn't done a live show in like six months.

57:36.840 --> 57:39.840
And so it was a really great thing to come back to.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.840
So thank you so much.

57:41.840 --> 57:42.840
Now enjoy the rest.

57:42.840 --> 57:43.840
Let's get back to it.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.840
Yeah.

57:44.840 --> 57:45.840
See you later.

58:22.840 --> 58:25.840
When my roommate orgasms, he yells at the top of his lungs.

58:25.840 --> 58:26.840
Continue.

58:26.840 --> 58:27.840
Okay.

58:27.840 --> 58:28.840
Just keep going.

58:28.840 --> 58:48.840
When my roommate orgasms, he yells at the top of his lungs.

58:48.840 --> 58:50.840
It's very loud.

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
No, yeah.

58:51.840 --> 58:54.840
And can happen at any time of the night.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.840
Good for your fucking roommate, I guess.

58:57.840 --> 58:59.840
And, Griffin, I can't hear you very well.

58:59.840 --> 59:00.840
You gotta sit up.

59:00.840 --> 59:01.840
And watch your head.

59:01.840 --> 59:02.840
Watch your head.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.840
Careful.

59:03.840 --> 59:04.840
Oh, thanks.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
Okay.

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
Oh, sweet.

59:06.840 --> 59:07.840
Yeah.

59:07.840 --> 59:08.840
You say aww.

59:08.840 --> 59:09.840
I'm not gonna sit up here with a fucking bloodied brother.

59:09.840 --> 59:11.840
It's like I care about him very much.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.840
I don't think he'd not black out while we're performing.

59:13.840 --> 59:14.840
Okay.

59:14.840 --> 59:17.840
I gotta start this at the beginning because there's a really good…

59:17.840 --> 59:19.840
He yells at the top of his lungs.

59:19.840 --> 59:21.840
It's very loud.

59:21.840 --> 59:26.840
And can happen at any time of night and day during weekends.

59:26.840 --> 59:31.840
It's a little afternoon delight.

59:31.840 --> 59:37.840
He does not care if anyone else is home and does nothing to mask the sound.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.840
I find his yelling a mix of hilarious, absurd, and inconsiderate.

59:41.840 --> 59:42.840
Very sexy.

59:42.840 --> 59:43.840
Very erotic.

59:43.840 --> 59:44.840
Very sexy.

59:44.840 --> 59:45.840
Very erotic.

59:45.840 --> 59:48.840
I like to get back at him with something of a similar tone.

59:48.840 --> 59:51.840
Hopefully, they mean metaphorically, not literally.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.840
Oh, I'm right here.

59:54.840 --> 59:55.840
I'm right here.

59:55.840 --> 59:56.840
I'm right here.

59:56.840 --> 59:57.840
You are right here.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.840
Since my baby orgasmed, I want to get him back with something of a similar tone before

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.840
we part ways when our lease ends in a few months.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840
What should I do?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:13.840
That's from Tone Down the Bone Down in Boulder.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840
Okay.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840
First off, are you here?

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.840
That would be weird.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.840
Yes, I am.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840
Is your roomie?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840
Okay.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840
Okay.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.840
No, wait.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840
Stop, stop, stop.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.840
This is the most important question possibly of all time.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840
Yes.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840
Is your roommate here?

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840
No.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.840
Yes.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840
All right.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840
Okay.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840
No, wait.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.840
I need you.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.840
You're told for answering this question.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.840
Please come down to this microphone.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840
Yeah.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
Come on down.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:47.840
You did not include in the email, what does he yell?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.840
I have another question, by the way, that I need you to address after you address Travis's

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840
question.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.840
Is he going to yell solo or?

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.840
Because that would be buck wild.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.840
He's like, you did it again, Dylan.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.840
Another great search.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.840
Oh, wait.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840
We just got another email and it's from somebody here in Portland.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.840
It's like, I got this dude I bone and he shouts a lot.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840
Okay.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840
So what's up?

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
It's just a wordless yell.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
Okay.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840
How?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840
I got a yell.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840
He does a barbaric yell.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.840
I know this is wack, but like, can you break us off a piece?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.840
I'm going to stop.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.840
We're all going to be very professional about this.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840
This is a scientific setting.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.840
We just need to know if you can break us off a piece.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
Okay.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840
It's just like this.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840
No.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:02:02.160
Okay, so if I read this correctly, when your roommate makes love, he sounds like Randy

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.840
Quaid flying into the spaceship in an opinions bill.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.840
That's what you're telling me.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.840
And you have to live with that.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.840
So how'd your date go?

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.840
Well, good for the first, about 98.5%.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840
Yeah.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.840
Right at the end there though.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.840
It had a weird finish when he turned into Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840
But like-

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.840
Have you addressed this before?

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840
No.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.840
What's your name?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.840
Well, actually, maybe you don't want to say your name on the podcast.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.840
No, it's cool.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
My name's Allie.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Hi, Allie.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.840
Allie.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.840
And what's your roommate's full name?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.840
I want to say two things, Allie.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.840
First off, I want to thank you so much for coming up to the mic.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.840
Secondly, I will ask you to take your seat now because we're about to say some things

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.840
that might be weird to say to your face.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.840
Thank you very much.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.840
Thanks, Allie.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.840
Everybody, a big hand for him.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:01.840
There is a very real possibility that if you address this with your roommate, they have

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.840
no idea they're actually doing it out loud.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.840
Yeah.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.840
You can lose yourself in that orgasm if they will.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.840
What's the deal with orgasm?

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840
When that-

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
Please tell me.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840
There's very-

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840
Please, God, someone tell me.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.840
There's very little I hate more than talking about sex stuff with my brothers.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.840
And I don't know why we always choose to do it in front of a crowd of a thousand people.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.840
But this is when we do it.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.840
I was not expecting this question to take such a Count of Monte Cristo revenge tale

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840
twist at the end.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840
It's weird.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840
It's sort of like, how could I bring it up in a polite way?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840
No.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.840
Allie was like, how could I get back at this motherfucker and nail him to the fucking wall?

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:50.840
You're going to need to start some kind of tally mark count because I just think that

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:58.840
would be a really good look if he comes out and you're just turning back from like-

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.840
I scored another one, Dylan.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Here's what I think.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.840
And hang with me because it's going to get worse before it gets better.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:14.840
Get out the app on your phone or iPad called GarageBand and you say, it's going to get

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.840
worse before it gets better.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.840
You can't come with me halfway through the fucking swamp of sadness.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840
You're going to come with me and we're going to get through it together.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.840
He did warn you ahead of time.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840
Nobody ran for the door.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.840
There's a thing on there where you can record a sample that you can then inject into a keyboard

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.840
and then play.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:39.840
So you record it and then you lay down a fucking sick hook, you record it and it's like, ow.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.840
And then you send that to DJ Khaled.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840
Then you send it to Rishikesh here.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.840
You send it to DJ Khaled and he puts it in this fucking next summer jam.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.840
And then this roommate is listening.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.840
So you're suggesting kind of like a-

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.000
you'll have to do their base on your

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.820
own and probably that unless things are

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.600
going bad in there my can I can I

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.880
Did I count her over?

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.680
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.760
Eh...

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.160
AHH!

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.720
Laughing

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.140
Laugh

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.100
Cheering

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.340
I'M GONNA KNIGHT!

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.620
AHHHH!

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.220
Show me that smile again...

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:32.040
I'M GONNA KNIGHT!

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.040
No, wrong! Wrong read!

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.040
Nut Squad can't become anything.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.540
We had a segment on our show called Nut Squad for a long time, and it was our extreme restraints advertisement.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.540
That era has sadly come to an end.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.040
Which one of these did I open? This one?

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.040
They both look pretty full of water, so go nuts.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.040
No, I'm just saying you can have either one. You can have either one.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.040
No, I opened the other one. I had a little drink of poo when I was choking.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.040
How are you all doing?

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:21.040
I can't make out anybody individually. Just one at a time, just say how you're doing at the same time.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:27.040
There's a better way of doing this. I think we maybe want to do some audience questions.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.040
Time for audience questions. Can we get the house lights up?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.040
House lights will take some questions to the audience.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Rachel, there's a microphone right behind you. There's microphones there. There's microphones up there.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.040
We'll try to get to as many people as you can.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.040
Folks, Rachel Rosen.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.040
Rachel Rosen, everybody.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:53.040
If we could just get the house lights just a little bit more.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.040
Wait, I don't think it just stays in the sand. There we go.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.040
Is it on? Hold on, wait.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.040
Is there a button on it? Oh, it's on now. All right, shit.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.040
All right, well, they told me it would come out.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.040
Hey, guys. Andy lied to you.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:13.040
Portland has a really cool surprise for you, and they asked me to tell you about it,

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.040
but first we have to go to the Money Zone.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040
Okay.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.040
They're rushing the stage.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.040
They're rushing the stage. This is our last transmission.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:39.040
Listen, if you lose us after this, the McElroy brothers, we're so sorry that we let you astray.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.040
What's up?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040
Hey, guys.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.040
Hey, what happened?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:47.040
All right, so you brothers have built an amazing community

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.040
that takes inspiration from your caring and generosity,

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:55.040
and in the spirit of that generosity, Portland Mbim Bambinos has spent the last few weeks

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:01.040
raising funds and items for Portland Homeless Family Solutions, a local nonprofit agency.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.040
Generous Mbim Bambinos.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.040
God, that's hard to say.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.040
Yeah, no kidding. Sorry.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.040
They've raised $869.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.040
That's awesome.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.040
Nice.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.040
For this good cause through donations and selling raffle tickets.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040
We have an amazing raffle pack.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.040
We were hoping that you guys could draw a winning name.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040
Yes, of course.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:32.040
Winner, meet—now's the time to get your tickets out and look at them.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.040
I know some of you guys bought a lot of tickets.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.040
Meet by the raffle table after the show.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.040
Don't rush the stage or anything crazy like that.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.040
All right, the winning ticket is $273,000.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040
It's probably—just read the numbers.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.040
Two, seven, three, two, nine, eight.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040
Yes!

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.040
A silent hand goes up in our audio podcast.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.040
After the show.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040
We'll get you after the show. They'll hook you up.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040
Here are some of the amazing things in that basket.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040
There's a Portland walking tour.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:11.040
There is $100 worth of services from Bessie Day Salon and Pretty Sweet Sugaring.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.040
There's a haunted doll, you guys.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040
Yeah!

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040
As made famous by this episode.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040
And now take it back.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.040
That's close enough. Thank you.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.040
There's a ticket to the annual Portland Queer Comedy Festival.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.040
There's a gift basket from New Seasons Market.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.040
And there is an official Trolls movie poster.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.040
Fuck yeah!

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.040
Signed by all your favorite trolls.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.040
There is something else going on tonight, too.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.040
Inspired by Travis's I Am Holding Your Hand campaign,

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.040
there are boxes in the lobby for anyone who wants to give a letter, take a letter.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.040
People writing letters of support, positivity, or just fucking goofs

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.040
to a random bambino and get one in return.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.040
So if you've written a letter to a bambino—I'm saying that word too many times tonight—

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.040
then grab one on your way out and, you know, kind of make a love connection.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040
It's super great.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.040
And my bim-bam-binos have also written you brothers letters of love and thanks.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.040
Oh my god.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.040
Thank you.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.040
I don't know how much we appreciate you.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:17.040
You're so sweet. Thank you.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.040
All of this great stuff was organized by the Sweet Baby Sisters,

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.040
Alice, Jenna, Carrie, Tori, and Emily.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:31.040
I recognize her game.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.040
And a big, great job to Andy the producer for bringing you guys here.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040
And happy birthday to Andy!

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.040
Happy birthday, Andy!

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.040
This is so great. Thank you all so much.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.040
Yeah. It was inspired by you brothers.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.040
You make the world a nicer place.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.040
Aww.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.040
Thank you.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040
Cheers.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.040
Get up here.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.040
Put you on the line.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.040
The rest of the podcast is hugging.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Those hugs are for us, too.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.040
That's us, too. We're in those, too.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.040
Those hugs are for us.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.040
Yeah.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040
Yeah. Jesus.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040
Nice.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.040
Now, Griff, go one more again.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040
This one's for me.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040
Because I'm already seated and it's like a whole thing.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040
You have a story.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040
Oh, god.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040
I still want it.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Thank you, creepy doll.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Thank you, Rachel.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.040
Thank you.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.040
Thank you.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.040
I just want to say, these ladies did everything.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.040
And then just fucking contacted me and they were like,

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.040
you're the name. Will you get up on stage?

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.040
You're the heat.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.040
I got like a fucking sweet ride on their hard work.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.040
Well, thank you all.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.040
And there's a giant check.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040
Can I just hold on to it?

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.040
Yeah.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.040
I've always wanted one of these bad boys.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.040
I'll just hang on to it.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.040
I'm not going to keep it.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.040
Do I mail this?

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040
Endorse the back of it.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.040
It's going to take a fuck ton of stamps.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.040
I think we have a stamps.com membership coming up.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:57.040
Can you hold on to this until we get that cool sponsorship thing?

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.040
Yeah, these ladies can super hang on to it.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040
Thank you very much.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040
Thank you all.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040
Let's give a big hand for them.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.040
They're amazing.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.040
Thank you all.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040
I still have an actual question for you guys.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040
I sent it in, but you didn't read it.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040
Hit me.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040
Oh, come on.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.040
I did my best.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.040
No, like an actual, like an audio.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040
Oh, really?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040
Yeah.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040
I need advice.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040
Hit it.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.040
Okay.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.040
So I have a lot of dick pics in my phone.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.040
I'm going to do you a favor then.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.040
No, you can't fucking stop now.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.040
No, no, no.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.040
That's a teaser of what's to come if you want to head back down so you don't have to

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040
stand up here in front of people the whole time.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.040
Yeah, that's right.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040
Careful, careful, Rachel.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.040
Something happens to you.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040
The show is over.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040
Charlie after.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.040
And thus ended my brother, my brother and me when Rachel Rosen tragically tumbled off

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.040
the stage.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.040
All right.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040
Okay.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.040
Here it comes.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.040
Here it comes.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.040
I have a lot of dick pics in my phone.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.040
Just over a year and a half ago, I was doing a lot of online dating.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.040
I think any lady who's done online dating has a lot of dick pics.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.040
What?

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.040
What?

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.040
I saved them in order to send back to gentlemen who sent them to me.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.040
Wait, wait, wait.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040
Same or different gentleman?

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040
Here's what Doug's working with.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.040
Basically.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.040
Okay.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.040
That's a fun service you provide.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.040
Uh huh.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.040
That's sort of like the write a letter dick.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.040
Yeah.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:31.040
Have the worst possible version of that.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.040
Have a penis, give a penis, need a penis, take a penis.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.040
But also just like a lot of them are really funny.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.040
Like what dudes consider to be maybe sexy or artistic or attractive.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.040
It's the googly eyes that get it every time.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.040
No, no, there's a black and white one that never fails to make me giggle.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.040
Very artsy.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:57.040
The thing is that I'm now about a year and a half into an amazing, serious, loving, and happy relationship.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:04.040
And I wonder, do I need to delete my dick pics?

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040
No.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040
Okay.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.040
You worked so hard for them.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:17.040
Do you have enough that you could make them very small and do like a pointillism picture?

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040
It makes Darth Vader's face.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.040
I do not have that many.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040
Okay.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
All right, everybody.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.040
We're all going to work together tonight.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.040
Do you guys want to see any of them?

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:35.040
No.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:40.040
All right, Griffin is currently going to Rachel and checking out the dick pics on her phone.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.040
I don't doubt you.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.040
I know.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.040
There's one dude who sent me like six within the space of two minutes.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.040
She's passing a wide net.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.040
I know.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.040
They're not on my camera roll.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040
They're in my text.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.040
Hold up.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040
You got to save this on your camera roll.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.040
They're definitely in here.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.040
Make them permanent.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.040
Or to Instagram.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.040
This dude.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.040
All right.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.040
Hold on.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.040
Here we go.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.040
Here we go.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.040
We got a bite.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040
That's my favorite one.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040
All right.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.040
He's got one.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.040
Travis is going over to look at the dicks.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040
It's so fucking funny.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040
He's got one.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040
He's kind of just laid it out on an end table like it was sleeping.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040
Yes.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.040
Yes.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.040
Like an afterthought.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.040
Like an afterthought.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.040
He might be like, what?

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040
Oh.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040
Wait.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040
Wait.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040
That's a lot.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.040
Yeah.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.040
All right.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.040
That's a lot.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.040
Okay.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:35.840
I know.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.840
Let me ask you this.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840
Please.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.840
And I've actually just answered this question, like, is there anything about your Pokédex.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840
Wait.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.600
Griffin, if I may.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.000
Pokédicks.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.640
That brings you like some level of joy or novelty.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640
And I think the answer is yes.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640
Right?

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640
Yes.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640
You are asking about it in front of a room full of strangers.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.640
And here is my boyfriend.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.640
So he doesn't mind.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.640
And you're cool.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.640
You're cool.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.640
Yeah.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.640
I don't like it.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.640
Huge hog.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.640
For sure.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640
Listen.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.280
The thing is, Rachel, from this point on, when people see you, they're going to ask

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.280
you, can I see some of the dicks on your front?

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280
Totally fine.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.280
Specifically the one.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.280
I'll show any of y'all.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280
Have you heard the story of the...

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.280
Grandma Mom, show me the scrapbook again.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:29.920
Well, child, I was doing online dating for a brief time, and well, you know.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.400
Have you heard the story of the chicken that worked very hard before the winter and everybody

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400
else...

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.400
I thought it was a grasshopper.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400
It was definitely a grasshopper.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400
Grasshopper.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400
Or maybe an ant.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400
No, it's like a chick.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.400
It's an ant.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.400
It's a grasshopper and an ant.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400
Like who will help me get the wheat?

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.400
Who will help me save the bitch?

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.400
Anyway, here's what I'm saying.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400
The winter gon' come.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.400
I love you.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.400
You're cool.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400
The winter gon' come.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400
No, you're fine.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400
You're fine.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.400
You're fine.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.400
You're cool.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400
You may just go out of town.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400
The winter may be you going out of town.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400
That's what I'm saying.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400
But Rachel, the winter gon' come.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.120
Is that what they're talking to you about in Game of Thrones?

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120
The winter gon' come.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.120
Winter is coming.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.120
Dick pic winter is coming, Rachel.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.120
You need to hoard your stores.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.120
Hoard those dick pic reserves.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.120
I actually...

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.120
You know what, Justin?

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:15.360
I'm going to say you're being a little too stringent.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.560
Maybe open some kind of Etsy shop where you sell the pictures to people.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.560
I think that's a federal crime.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.560
Friend?

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.560
They were all of age, Justin.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.560
All right.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.560
That was never a question.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560
But I'm glad that it's...

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560
All right.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560
I think we've helped.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560
Yeah.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.560
I think we've helped.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.560
Rachel, thank you so much.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.560
Thank you.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
Okay.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560
Let's see.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560
Nobody's at this mic.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560
So let's look...

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560
No.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560
I mean, there's a mic right there.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560
You just line up at the mic.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560
If you want to ask a question, just get in line.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:46.560
That is not the case.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Go back to your seat.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560
He spoke out of turn.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.560
That was wrong.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.560
I was wrong.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560
Justin made a bad call there because he's had a little too much of that.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.440
People have done that in prior years.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.440
It's been six months.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440
No.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440
I hate that idea.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440
Let's...

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440
Yeah.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440
We met you at lunch today.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440
Yeah.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440
Yeah.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.440
Reyes, Max Reyes?

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.440
Yeah.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.440
Whoa.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440
You...

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440
Wait.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.440
I put him on blast.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.440
I hope your question is not embarrassing at all.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.440
No.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440
So I killed a guy.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.440
Okay.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.440
Max, what's up?

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.440
Max, what's the deal?

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.440
Okay.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.440
So I work at a Chipotle back in California where I live.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.440
I'm a cashier and...

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.240
Can we tell the story real quick, Max, before you get started?

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.240
Yeah.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.240
We were eating at a Thai restaurant and Max and Amy just walked past the window and they're

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.240
like, hey, there they are.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:43.840
Well, actually, I did saw two human beings do this and I was like, what happened?

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840
We happened.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840
That's the answer.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840
So we brought them in.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.840
Max is from California and he said...

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:48.840
And he said he's from California.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.840
I was like, well, it's certainly coming to the show, right?

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840
He's like, no, we didn't get tickets.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:59.120
I was like, well, then you should still come to the show, but it was like absolutely the

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.780
most random, like literally walking past the window.

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:06.000
So if you want to know how to get tickets to a show, it's a secret, you got to visualize

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
it hard enough.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Yeah.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Yeah.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It's like a weird geocache.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Yeah.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It's like a weird geocache.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Find Thai places near arcades.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Yeah.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
That's the secret.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
All right, Max.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
We're going to Chipotle.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You're looking for new burrito recipes.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
You've come to the right place.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Try meat and cheese.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Next question.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Maybe some sort of sauce.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
A cheese pizza.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:35.880
Cheese pizza, Max.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.880
A cheese pizza burrito.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.880
You know what that sounds like?

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880
TM.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880
TM.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880
TM.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.880
TM.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880
TM.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.880
TM.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880
I want a munch.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880
Yeah.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880
Okay, it's fine.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880
Jesus, with the fucking machine has become like...

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880
Max, what's your question about Chipotle?

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880
All right.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880
I want to get to yours first.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.880
Okay.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880
Well, my day...

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.880
How do you maximize topics?

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880
No.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880
Max.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:19:59.880
Sorry.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880
All right.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:01.880
Okay.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.880
So my day starts mostly the same.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.120
I go in, clock in, put on my apron and then...

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120
Slot of the cows.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.080
Slot of the cows, yeah.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.760
And then we enter this thing called peak period where I have to stay completely still in my

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:16.520
cashier position for the next hour and I cannot move.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.880
Not even to type stuff into the machine?

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.880
No, no, no, no.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880
I stay in front of the machine.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880
Statuesque.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880
Statuesque.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.880
To scare away the...

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.880
Welcome to Chipotle.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.880
This is our living art, Max.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.520
We get a lot of crows in this Chipotle.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.520
We have Max here to scare them off.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.520
This is our scare, Max.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.520
You just...

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.520
Okay.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:41.240
So whenever I get exact change in complete bills, no coins, I don't just rip a big fat

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.160
wet one, but several in a row.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160
Wait.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.880
This has happened four times and there is no explanation for it.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.840
Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max,

01:20:51.840 --> 01:21:01.520
Max, Max, are you telling me when you get exact change, you fart four times in a row?

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.520
Yes.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.600
I shit you not.

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600
Max.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.140
Oh, let's, let's hope so.

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.140
Sit down.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:08.140
Sit down, Max.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.140
You sit down, Max.

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.140
Sit down, Max.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.140
You're done.

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:12.140
You've been bad.

01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.140
Max, you are like the solar eclipse.

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.800
I cannot look directly at you, Max.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.200
How could you do this to us on our special day, Max?

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.200
We brought you in.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.200
Also, I'm proud of you.

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.180
I'm also proud of your control.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:29.680
You're like Le Petit Mane with your ability to control your flatulence.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680
I'm very impressed.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680
Who?

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.680
Le Petit Mane, the fartest.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.080
You can listen to last year's Max Fun Drive bonus of Schmanners to hear all about the

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.080
fartest.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.080
Max.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.080
Max.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080
Max.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080
You're not.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.080
No.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.080
You're not good, Max.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.080
Because.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080
You're not good.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.840
Max, I have terrible news.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.840
You have been hypnotized.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:22:01.200
No, not like this, baby.

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.200
Not like this.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200
No.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:10.040
Max, does this literal stage setup look familiar to you?

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.440
Maybe you were lying on a couch like this and a person said, exact change is pretty

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.440
cool, huh?

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.800
You're going to fart a quartet of times.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.360
That's the weirdest version of the Cold Stone Creamery Tip song I've ever heard.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.520
All right, we promised we were going to do a bunch of these.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.080
Let's do left section this time.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.960
No, let's do balcony.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960
Let's do balcony.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.960
Let's do very back.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960
Very back balcony.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960
White t-shirt.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960
White t-shirt right here.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960
Jumping up.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960
Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.960
Okay.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:41.960
Yes.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960
I can see.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:43.960
We can see up there super good, but.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:44.960
Hi.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.960
Hi.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960
Can we lower our arches for a second just so we can see?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960
Yes.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960
Yes.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.960
Thank you.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960
Okay.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:51.960
Yeah.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960
It says Munch Squad.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960
Nice.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.960
Oh, cool.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.960
I had one of that.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960
You know, I almost wore it and I thought that's a bit much.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:00.880
It said you wore your Hakuna Matata t-shirt.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:01.880
And you know what?

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.880
It looks great.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880
It looks really good.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.880
What's your name?

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880
It's actually Swahili.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880
My name is Aiden.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880
Aiden, hi.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880
Hi.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880
Hello.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:16.960
So for the last 12 years or so, I thought, hey, I'm going to be a doctor.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.280
And so I knew that's what I was going to do for With My Life.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.280
I promise this isn't a bummer.

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.280
It's not a bummer.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.280
Oh, fuck.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280
You know how close you're on though.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.280
You're on that razor wire.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.280
It's not.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.280
I don't need to ask if I'm good because I'm very good.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280
Good.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.280
Oh.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.280
That's all I care about.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.280
Damn.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280
So I had this life plan.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.280
I was going to be a doctor.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:42.360
And about, so I've gone to school for that and well, not the med school part, but planned

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.360
for this.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.360
Okay.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.360
Anyway.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.360
Yeah.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.880
And I was like, you know what?

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.840
This isn't for me.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.480
And so I gave up on that sort of whole life plan.

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.480
It's great.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.480
No, it's great.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.480
It's not a bummer.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.760
This is the best decision I've ever made.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.120
But my question is, I haven't really told anybody about this.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120
Okay.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:12.040
How do I break this news to my friends and my family?

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.040
Let me help.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.040
Here's the good news.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.040
Yeah.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.680
If someone's going to be in a medical emergency and they're going to look at you expectantly

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.720
and you're going to have to look back at them and say, actually, you got to wait for someone

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.720
to shout.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.720
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:28.720
And you go, no.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:29.720
No.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:30.720
And I'm glad you asked, actually.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.120
It's a funny story, actually.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.400
So how do I tell people about this in the best way possible?

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.400
You're going to have to get a Ph.D. in something.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.980
That's the plan.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:43.980
That's the new plan.

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:44.980
Oh, really?

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:45.980
That's the new plan.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:46.980
Yeah.

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:47.980
What about honorary?

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:48.980
You can get an honorary Ph.D.

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:49.980
Billy Joel has one.

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.600
Billy Joel has one, for fuck's sake.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:59.560
If you get fucking shot, Billy Joel can get that bullet out of you because of his honorary

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560
doctorate.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560
In letters.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.760
And also, he's seen some shit.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.760
And when he was in Saigon writing that song.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.640
Scenes from an Italian restaurant is a song about a lot of shootings that happen in Italian

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640
restaurants.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.240
I don't think so.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.320
A near would be my advice.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:22.120
And I don't know if this is good advice because I've been hitting the Hennessy, okay?

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:27.760
But I think you should probably, I would say, before you talk to anybody about it, I would

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.560
probably formulate a plan as to what you want to do.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.560
Like figure that out for yourself.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.560
It sounds like you've got it.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:34.560
Yeah, you're good.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.560
What?

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.560
It's a plan.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.560
It's just telling people, hey, surprise.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.600
Okay, as long as you have another plan, I think that that's what you lead with.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:46.120
Not like I'm not going to be a doctor, but I am going to be, I don't know, you didn't

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.120
tell us that, but like whatever that is.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120
A magician.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.120
A magician.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120
Yeah, a juggler.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120
A juggler.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120
No, no, no.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120
Watch it.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120
Come on.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.160
Someone escort this person out.

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.560
Oh, I know.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.840
The next time you're talking to someone about it, begin explaining the multiverse theory.

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:14.880
And say that in one universe, I am a doctor, and then leave.

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.520
I am on the edge of my seat.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520
You really are.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.520
I can't wait to see.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:24.280
I don't have that many people in my, this might sound cruel, I don't have that many

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:33.120
people in my life where if they're like, I've changed careers, I'd be like, oh, man.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.800
I'm kind of busy just being me.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.840
You haven't stayed close with your high school guidance counselor?

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.680
I guess not.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.680
So I think you're good.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.680
I think you're just good.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680
Just do it.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.680
Yeah.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.680
I guess if nothing else, I've just announced it on a podcast.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.680
Yeah, there it is.

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.680
Thank you.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.680
Did we help at all?

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680
Thank you.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.680
Did that help?

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.680
Yeah, that's great.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.680
Okay, cool.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.680
All right.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:56.680
I'm going to do left side this time.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.840
I'm seeing, by the way, I'm seeing a lot of people go in the bathroom and kind of say

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.160
that must be nice because I would love to go to the bathroom.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.120
I see a pink shirt about Midway.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.120
Yes, yes, yes.

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.120
No, no.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.120
Pink shirt.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120
No.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120
No.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.120
Sir, no.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.120
Sir.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.120
Sir.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.120
Sir.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.120
That is a salmon colored tee with gray arms.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.360
It's not even close.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:23.320
But I did like how you just went for it and body checked this person.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:24.680
I guess it's salmon.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.160
Listen, your next salmon shirt.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160
Don't let us forget.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160
Okay.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160
Hi.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.160
I'm Courtney from Vancouver.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160
Hi, Courtney.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.160
Oh, hey.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.360
Courtney from Vancouver, if you don't know, am I right, Courtney?

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360
Yes.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.240
Courtney from Vancouver is the person who sent the letter that inspired the fourth episode

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.800
of My Brother, My Brother and Me, the CISO television show about teens.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.800
Oh.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:58.480
Since you have journeyed to our great land, have you been able to indulge in the episode?

01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480
Yes.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.600
Yes, my mom put it on and she was really confused.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.040
She lives in Mount Vernon, Washington.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.040
Okay.

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.040
I was about to put your mom in prison.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040
No, no, no.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:12.040
She's American.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:17.280
I want to thank you for your advice because I'm actually now a really popular teacher.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280
Excellent.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.280
You just dabbed a lot.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.280
Yeah.

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:21.280
Hey, everybody.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.280
Actually, one more time, just because I don't think everybody had their phones out.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.280
Wait, hold on.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.280
Hold on.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.360
If you get the phones out in case you want to tweet that Courtney from Vancouver-

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.000
Actually, if everybody in the audience could actually... If we could get the hell signs

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.180
up and everybody could just dab.

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:40.320
I want to get Justin and Griffin doing it too.

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.180
And by the way, I don't want to be- This looks fucking ghoulish.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.200
I hate this.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.200
You look like a fucking H.R.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.760
Giger painting and I hate it.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760
All right.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.700
Put the ocean of arms down.

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:57.880
My students asked me to organize prom but I don't know how to do that.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.580
Lots of free condoms next question

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.520

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.680
master chief theme

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:40.860
When really all I wanted was just a very dark big room

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:49.160
Dark enough that people couldn't see whether I danced bad or didn't dance which were my two options

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.760
I

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:57.020
Neither of which are good in the light times. I I have a theme how about this Courtney?

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.640

There will be a group of students who are like, oh, thank fuck. Oh

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.560
Thank God, I don't have to dance and even if I wanted to there's I can't so there's no pressure

Hey, and there's gonna be one bad boy. Who's like, oh, really?

And then he's gonna have the time of his life people who join in with him are going to be loving it and the kids

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.980
Who don't want to dance will have a perfect excuse not to it's against the rules and then the kids who are like

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.480
Let's just say it cool

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:41.120
We'll go ahead and dance anyway, despite your rules and then the preacher that runs the town is gonna get rid

Nope, don't want that

That's not what they're gonna use it for I'll tell you that's not that they're gonna use it for yeah

I thought you said I'm Andy and I was like, that's fine. How does that cool? I'm Andy. What's up?

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.220
You know that we can talk frankly now, right? We're buds

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.120

Is that St. Louis Cardinal shirt, it's Nike skateboarding. Oh fuck me, I guess I'm yeah

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.480
Okay, Andy, what's up?

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.640
All right, so my girlfriend lives in apartment complex, okay

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:33.720
Okay, and normally apartment complexes covered parking reserved not covered parking or buddy can have some

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:39.980
Sure her complex just decided we're just gonna mark up a bunch of the spots

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:43.500
So like 75% of the place is like no you can't park

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.860
so I

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:48.140
Got a little drunk one night

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:56.100
Had some of the drinks nice some of the part some of the parking needed to happen and wait, hold on wait, so

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.440
No, no, no, no, no

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:07.480
Some parking needed to happen from who by who did it? She was parking the car. Okay. Okay

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:12.640
You were I was inebriated and I saw the office decided to put some cones out to reserve

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:20.080
Themselves a spot. Okay when every other spot was taken. Uh-huh in my drunken state. Would you do Mad Max?

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:29.200
A little bit a little bit. I I decided to throw those cones on the roof of the office. Fuck. Yes

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.600
If your question is how rad am I the answer is very

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:43.380
So I the cones are still up there and this is like this happened on inauguration night

01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:49.280
I was ready to fight. Yeah

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.120
So the cones are still up there

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.440
So should I the cones or something should I tell the office that they're up

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.440
No

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.720
Should I cut my losses and move out? No, wait, hold on

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.040
Andy at this point

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:30.160
We're two months out. Yeah, what fucking CSI are you afraid they're gonna do now?

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.400
Hey, hey, you know where those cones go

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.860
Oh, they're on the roof. Let's fingerprint them

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:41.720
What are you fucking?

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:48.080
Reconstruct the security camera that just catches me like that. They're just now checking Andy

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:55.400
You think they just have saved two months. They're gonna start their slow on everything else

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.360
How much do you think they care about cones that two months have passed that they haven't bothered to get them down

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:08.360
But full-on investigations gonna happen when they do as soon as they find that ladder they misplaced

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.920
But they do care enough to find the responsible party and put them to justice

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.480
alternate theory alternate theory the roof is

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:24.320
Very dangerous and they were planning on putting some cones up there anyway

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:31.960
The groundskeeper comes out one morning. It's like oh time to get them what a

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.040
Fucking cobblers assistant elf has come and done my job for me

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:43.000
It does raise the question of like if I'm an administrator at that university. I do have to ask like hey

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.120
Who do we call about cones on roofs?

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.160
Hey a fire department, I think not you

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.680
Hi, can I tell you I'll tell you exactly how that scene I go

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.200
Hi, it's fine. It's time. I finally came clean. I see your cones on the roof

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.840
Okay

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.480
That's all by fine

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.680
There's like 300 people who live here, and I don't know who you are

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:11.880
Yeah, they're like well that wasn't cool. You did it was inauguration day, and I'd like ah dude

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.880
We all threw some cones on

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.880
Oh

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.920
One more about one more balcony

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.160
Person standing up well. There's like four. Yes. There's a person standing up very high. Yes

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720
This person is moving yes

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.920
Be careful though

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.240
Yes, here we go hi, what's your name?

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.280
What's up?

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.920
Fine who me yes me you yes, hi. Hey, so you're next

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800
Hi, my name is Alex

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:48.840
Hi

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.440
So I have a really androgynous voice, okay, okay?

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:57.520
The other day when I was on the phone with a cable salesman

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:05.120
They were asking about the sports package that I bought and then they were like does your husband also listen to sports

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.120
And

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.760
I told them that I was single

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.680
Nice

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.280
Nice am I good yeah, I think you're pretty fucking good

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.600
I actually want to call you out on this for a second

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:36.520
I don't think you want to ask a question so much as you just wanted to brag about an awesome. It was a good conversation

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.280
Yeah, the only the only

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.200
Better thing you could have told him is no. I don't like sports

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:53.880
Yeah, I also think if if you're asking what could I have done to have a better interaction with my cable provider

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.200
Yeah, you tell us. I think you fucking crush it honestly

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:06.040
I have had this conversation with my internet cable provider like my internet isn't working. Yeah. Yeah, no we're bad at this

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.720
What are you gonna do we're bad for a bad company make a bad product

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:22.520
I normally ask if we helped but like you're good you helped us. Yeah, you crushed it Alex everybody KT. All right

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.840
Yeah, Casey Casey Casey come down this microphone case you ran to the back of the auditorium

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:36.200
How could you do this to me? I have to be so bad. Come on. Casey's next. I'm raising your hands

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.160
I understand I get embarrassed really easy. So I had to go

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.360
Really quick I have to perform in front of people and I also have a tiny little bladder

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.860
So I thought you guys would be perfect for answering this question really quick. Here's a here's a weird catch-22 though the

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.520
The and take your time. I'm not rushing you

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.360
But the longer this question goes the longer we have before we can end the show and I can go empty my now

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.360
wild

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.240
It's a professional question

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:25.840
So I have to kind of perform my craft in front of a lot of different tourists and stuff like that

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:33.440
And I have to share the public bathrooms with all the customers that come in and I have on two occasions like

01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:37.880
Walked in and had the bathroom doors wide open while someone was using the restroom

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.300
I survived this because I thought of the legend of corn cob boys. So thank you. Oh, yes

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:49.920
Well, I often find strength in corn cob boy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. Thank you guys. You've saved my life multiple times

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:57.240
So how do I deal with the extreme like anxiety? I already have in addition to going out and like performing in front of people

01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:02.640
That I may have potential so I understand your question is you have walked into people using the restroom

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.480
Yeah, and I like I'm cool about it where I'll like shut the door for him and stuff like that

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:12.040
But I have to go back out and like face them and be like have to do my job and like then you say no

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.040
I've seen you

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.040
Do my thing

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:25.400
You should be less uncomfortable now, okay, you picture them in their underpants let me suggest one step further

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.080
All right didn't work so great for me last time, but thank you

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:38.080
There is literally nothing you can do if you walk in on someone in the bathroom leave, okay

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:44.440
Just quit the look the look the look you give them and they give you has to communicate this isn't happening

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.320
It's the closest you can get this is nothing. This is nothing

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:47.560
Yeah

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:53.580
There was like an additional element of like schadenfreude because the person that I caught like, you know with the pants down totally

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:56.720
Didn't notice and I like saved their life by shutting the door for him

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.560
The door closed. Yeah, I was like they maybe they had a plan and I can't

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.560
Yeah, Casey. I feel like you're intentionally not telling us what you do, but I bet it's really cool

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:12.880
I roast I roast coffee for a living pretty okay. Here's the thing. Here's what I love about this

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:16.120
Yeah, this person got caught in the bathroom and then was like

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:19.640
Yes, please one coffee

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:27.960
They could have left you work there. Yeah, they know the deal they could just go so if they don't you're good

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.560
If they're like, I know what happened, but I do with my Vinci latte, please

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.320
They're trading that off. I walked in. I walked in on my barber in the bathroom before my haircut once

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.860
Not exactly like that in that like I know now our interactions up to that point during my

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.400
30 monthly minutes that I shared with this person

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.120
weren't like

01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:01.080
Smooth sailing to begin with as much of a sort of like grasping for conversational straws swinging from

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:04.120
Conversational vine to vine and being like, oh no, this one's rotten

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:11.640
And now in addition to that fucking pitfall style there's crocodiles down in that river

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.800
And those crocodiles

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.280
Look like pee, I guess. I don't know the metaphor kind of fell apart. Yeah

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:25.400
Does that help? I guess just letting you know it can be so much worse. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.840
I wanted maybe to share my okay that person in the back that I accidentally called on. Yes. Yes. You did the right

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.880
Two hands in the air and you're jumping and you're running down and okay

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.280
I think this may be the last one though because I might die

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:45.560
Yeah, this is the last one. What's up? Hi, so I have a co-worker. What's your at Liz?

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:54.560
Hi, I have a good I have a co-worker who is a serious know-it-all and really likes to correct people even when he's wrong

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.460
So it's a then it's just a man

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:08.000
And the man she questions does he have an active Twitter account

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:16.640
Oh, wait a minute, I'm a man sorry Liz

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.460
What so this reached kind of a zenith when I

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.240
Prefaced a joke that I was telling to someone else with this is a really dumb joke

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.800
that doesn't make any sense and then I told the joke and

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.680
About five minutes went by and then he goes that joke doesn't make any sense. And here's why

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.160
So my question is where do you hide the body

01:43:56.300 --> 01:44:00.500
My question is other than just trolling him by refusing to correct anything

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:07.540
Uh, how how do I do that's not gonna get the job done. That's just gonna make him think like I'm King knowledge. I

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:12.100
Would Liz I would start trying to get as much shit wrong as possible

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:19.220
I would I would with as many as you can and let me actually tag on to that do that and then fill an empty

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:34.900
Soda can with pennies and tape over the top and when he says like well actually just because eventually

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.940
You won't have to shake it. You'll just have to hold it and you'll go

01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:43.260
Liz have you ever read the cast of a Montalada?

01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:56.540
I'm a winemaker. So that's actually really

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.420
