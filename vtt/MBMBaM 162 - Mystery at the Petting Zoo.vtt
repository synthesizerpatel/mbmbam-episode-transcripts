00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:48.640
Welcome, my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

00:48.640 --> 00:53.680
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:53.680 --> 00:59.520
Boy, the excitement is palpable. It's Sunday morning. We're just two and a half hours

00:59.520 --> 01:06.720
from learning the identity of the new Doctor Who. Do you know what this is? I know how to

01:06.720 --> 01:13.440
equate this for people who don't watch Doctor Who. This is like nerd draft. Yeah, but it's not

01:13.440 --> 01:19.280
really anything like what you just said. It's like nerd primaries. It's like here's the thing,

01:19.280 --> 01:24.960
though. The one thing I wanted to say is that I like my chances. Yeah. Oh, I have. I mean,

01:24.960 --> 01:31.040
have you been what? What step are you currently in in the casting process, Justin? Well,

01:31.680 --> 01:36.880
I'm telling anyone who listened that I like my chances and those that's how rumors get started.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.920
And you know what? Confidence is such is so key in this game. So key. And you took out a full page

01:42.560 --> 01:49.440
ad in the in that one British newspaper that just said for your for your consideration and

01:49.440 --> 01:56.000
for your consideration wearing a very long scarf. It just said Doctor Me question mark. Doctor Who

01:56.000 --> 02:02.480
me? Maybe it's up to you. Do it Britain. How about I had an unconventional thing where like,

02:02.480 --> 02:11.840
you know how like I wore the scarf that Tom Baker wore and I had like the coat that David Tennant

02:11.840 --> 02:20.480
wore. And then I also had the coat that all the doctors have worn. And I wore them all on top.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.040
You were wearing a fez like you sat down with the writers. You're like,

02:25.040 --> 02:30.960
guys, cast me. I have a great idea. I'm like the mashup guy. I got through time and I got

02:30.960 --> 02:36.080
all my garments. So I'm really all the doctors in one. And if you take away all my coats,

02:36.080 --> 02:43.520
then I'm just inside. I'm just not real. Not a real doctor. Who would you guys like to see

02:43.520 --> 02:50.080
as the new? Who's your ideal doctor? Oh, God. So tough. What's David Tennant doing?

02:51.600 --> 02:56.320
So he's he's otherwise occupied. I think it'd be a ball. It'd be a real baller move for them to

02:56.320 --> 03:08.480
be like, he is the 13th doctor. It does look like him. It was David Tennant. What do you mean?

03:12.800 --> 03:19.760
For me, it's a toss up between because it seems to oscillate between like sort of the austere

03:20.320 --> 03:25.600
doctor and the like playful, fun doctor. So for me, it's really between Jeff Goldblum or

03:25.600 --> 03:33.120
Zachary Ty Bryant. I would love to see ZTB get back in the mix. It can go because like his would

03:33.120 --> 03:36.160
be like a fresh. But like when people when they cast Matt Smith, they're like, this is going to

03:36.160 --> 03:41.360
be a fresh, fun doctor. And they were right. He was fresh and fun. But if they want to go a

03:41.360 --> 03:46.400
different route, something a little more a more something a little more dignified, something with

03:46.400 --> 03:53.920
more pauses in his in his speech, you know, with the bloom, right? The bloom. But if you want to

03:53.920 --> 04:00.720
keep it even fun. So you're saying if they need a 180 from Matt Smith to someone who's even more fun

04:00.720 --> 04:05.760
and even more fresh, you turn to Zachary Ty Bryant, Zachary Ty Bryant, because really,

04:05.760 --> 04:11.360
it's his fucking time to shine. What if you got an actor who already had experience as a doctor?

04:11.360 --> 04:17.760
And you got George Clooney. He was great as Batman. He was great as Batman, Batman doctor,

04:17.760 --> 04:21.680
basically the same person. You don't notice how you don't see the doctor and Batman in the same

04:21.680 --> 04:26.960
room at the same time. Not in my fanfiction. I. L-O-D-E.

04:29.680 --> 04:36.320
Geronimo. Who's the guy that people are floating right now? The real guy? Peter Capaldi. Peter

04:36.320 --> 04:48.880
McNichol. Peter McNichol. From the hit show Alley McBeal and Slave to Viggo. They haven't had a

04:48.880 --> 04:56.080
doctor with a forehead that's really like a seven or eight head. You know what I mean? Yeah. They

04:56.080 --> 05:02.480
haven't put a slap of a dignified forehead on that doctor. And then they want some space time.

05:02.480 --> 05:06.560
We've given enough advice to the people at BBC. We should help some actual people. This is still

05:06.560 --> 05:10.160
an advice program after all. I mean, for crying out loud. Although side note, if you want a three

05:10.160 --> 05:15.760
headed doctor, we will all play it together. Like in a Greek chorus. How about that art? Put it on

05:15.760 --> 05:21.040
our Facebook and we'll send you a dollar. Can we put the dancing baby as the doctor from Alley

05:21.040 --> 05:26.320
McBeal? I love that guy. Ooga chogger, right you guys? Where has he been? He's now a dancing

05:26.320 --> 05:33.680
middle aged man. He would thwart anyone. Like what are you going to do to a baby in a long scarf and

05:33.680 --> 05:41.680
11 coats that's just dancing? Do you want a jelly baby? How about a dancy baby? What about Johnny

05:41.680 --> 05:46.560
Depp? Cause he's got like, he's got a pretty distinct style. You know what I mean? Like he's

05:46.560 --> 05:51.840
already got all the scarves. He's already got, he wears mini coats. Thank you so much for having me,

05:51.840 --> 05:57.840
considering me. I really appreciate the role. Would like it to be more of like a, like a racist

05:57.840 --> 06:04.880
caricature. What can we, I was thinking what if the doctor is like, yo man, yo. What do you think?

06:04.880 --> 06:12.000
How would that go? What if he said, I saw get in my tardies like that. What do you think? I think

06:12.000 --> 06:18.160
it would be really a fresh day. It's about time for these, for these races to be represented

06:18.160 --> 06:24.080
in our culture. Let's tear down these walls. I really think that I am the vehicle. I'm the

06:24.080 --> 06:28.720
crucible through which these races will be presented. I think I could play Samoan. Am I right

06:28.720 --> 06:35.360
you guys? Just a big fat doctor. Think about it. Big fat Samoan doctor. That's racist. Think about

06:35.360 --> 06:39.040
it. That you think all Samoans are overweight. I don't think that, but that's what Johnny Depp

06:39.040 --> 06:43.520
thinks. He's a racist in this. Cause Dr. Who's a racist, so it's a great fit. Remember that little

06:43.520 --> 06:51.760
bit, that little gag he used to do about Dr. Who being a giant racist. Oh man, classic. Digging

06:51.760 --> 06:55.680
out the archives. We already did one clip show. We can't keep fucking reviving the past. No,

06:55.680 --> 07:00.400
we haven't done like a flashback clip show though, where it's like, you guys remember that time?

07:02.400 --> 07:07.280
What did everybody think of the clip shot? I didn't see the reaction. Nobody liked it. Nobody

07:07.280 --> 07:11.760
liked it. All right. Well, good, good to know. Let's do a new one then. Recently, my teenage

07:11.760 --> 07:16.800
sister has begun to claim that she is gluten sensitive. She says she gets diarrhea whenever

07:16.800 --> 07:22.480
consuming these products. This has resulted in a lot of inconvenience as we now have to screen

07:22.480 --> 07:26.480
every restaurant's gluten-free options to see if we can eat there or not. She's the only one in

07:26.480 --> 07:31.680
our family with any food allergy. However, she will often eat donuts, breads, and other snack foods,

07:31.680 --> 07:35.760
or even whole dinners, which do contain gluten with apparently few side effects.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.720
And when we were reminded of this, she said she doesn't care because she wants it.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.760
Am I right in calling her out in these situations or should I just keep quiet and let her deal with

07:43.760 --> 07:49.200
her own side effects, if any? That's from gluten trouble in Green, Texas. Oh, that's a tough one.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.640
No, it's not. Fuck that noise. When she starts eating too many donuts,

07:52.640 --> 07:55.440
you stand up, you point at her and yell, you're a gluten.

07:55.440 --> 08:02.160
Well, no, you say, I had four fucking peanuts for dinner last night because we went to a nice

08:02.160 --> 08:10.480
restaurant that catered to your delicate constitution. And now you're over here slamming

08:10.480 --> 08:15.680
super donuts? That doesn't seem fair. Am I misreading the question?

08:15.680 --> 08:20.000
No, you're absolutely correct. I think, okay, let me first and foremost state that there are

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
people in this world that are gluten sensitive and have gluten allergies and this is a real thing.

08:25.520 --> 08:30.320
That said, I think that this is one of those things that especially younger people,

08:30.320 --> 08:35.520
and it's going to become like a fad thing where people go, yeah, I'm also gluten sensitive because

08:35.520 --> 08:39.760
I put on weight when I eat a lot of bread or, you know, I get a tummy ache when I eat too many

08:39.760 --> 08:45.440
donuts. And it's just people trying to be cool and have something special about them that they're not

08:45.440 --> 08:51.760
unless they really do at which point. That shit's no joke. When you get that,

08:51.760 --> 08:56.720
what is it? Fucking the bone you get like Cialis. That's not what it is.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.400
I don't think it's the Cialis boner pills. Yes. Yeah. I don't think that's what you get. I don't

09:02.400 --> 09:07.120
think that's what you get if you eat too much like bread and pasta. No, I think that that's

09:07.680 --> 09:10.560
although I've gone to the, I've gone to the spaghetti factory before and

09:10.560 --> 09:18.960
have food that was so good that it chubbed me. I think that, I think that she can have it one

09:18.960 --> 09:25.040
of two ways. Either she can stick to her fake gluten story or you can start flipping this on

09:25.040 --> 09:28.400
her. And when she complains about going to a restaurant that doesn't have good gluten free

09:28.400 --> 09:34.640
options, you just say, well, I want it. I thought that went in this family. If she has Cialis,

09:34.640 --> 09:39.600
then like she wouldn't be eating donuts and be like, oh, I'm so bad. Special treat for me. She'd

09:39.600 --> 09:46.240
be like, ah, my bones don't work. I would say it's in all probability, it's, it's an attention

09:46.240 --> 09:50.160
getting thing where she's like, well, we need to go to the restaurant I want to go to because of

09:50.160 --> 09:55.200
my gluten sensitivity. Maybe she just loves steak. She just fucking loves it. And she'll only go to

09:55.200 --> 09:58.640
a place to have that. Listen guys, I'm sorry. We're going to have to go to Sizzler again.

09:58.640 --> 10:04.640
I don't want to go to bread born. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think has wonderful gluten free

10:04.640 --> 10:10.720
options by the way. I don't think is gluten sensitive the right term because this makes

10:10.720 --> 10:15.840
her sound like some sort of, um, some sort of psychic, some sort of S S perfect. I feel the

10:15.840 --> 10:26.880
gluten's pain. There's some sourdough nearby. I can feel it in my Cialis bones. Put both your

10:26.880 --> 10:36.960
hands behind your back. Put a scone in one of them. Okay. It's fall from NBC. There's Brad

10:36.960 --> 10:47.120
nearby. Get out of here. Seven Eastern, six central Cialis sisters Friday nights at 1120.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.920
Jeff Goldblum is a 10 minute PSA disguises the television show produced by Jeff Goldblum.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.600
Just like you used to watch in high school about basically any topic.

11:01.200 --> 11:06.000
Um, I don't think to anybody it's gluten insensitive. Whoa. If that was a real thing,

11:06.640 --> 11:12.080
I'd know. Of course people are, but I wish I was. That's what I wanted to say. Is it basically

11:12.080 --> 11:16.320
carbs? Is that what gluten is? Gluten is only in bread. So here's the thing about it though. This

11:16.320 --> 11:20.240
is where they trick you. Think like, Oh, that would be great. Cause I could stop eating bread.

11:20.240 --> 11:26.640
Maybe lose a few of these LBs, but then oops, twist beer. Yeah. That's how it's anything derived

11:26.640 --> 11:33.120
from wheat, I guess. So I think gluten, I've learned from watching Alton Brown that gluten

11:33.120 --> 11:40.400
is like the bonds that form with like wheat and stuff and bread and stuff with the sugars.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.920
You turn to my brother, my brother and me for one thing and that's nutritional. That's how you get

11:43.920 --> 11:47.920
that fucking Cialis disease is that gluten gets inside your bones and it's like, Oh, you want me

11:47.920 --> 11:53.200
to, do you want me to stick these bones together? And it's like, no gluten, gluten. I want you to

11:53.200 --> 11:57.680
be digested. And I want you to turn into energy for my body that I can use to play sports.

11:57.680 --> 12:03.520
It's okay. So I'll just stick them together. Let me just get your hip and your fibia and oops.

12:03.520 --> 12:09.440
I fucked up. Sorry. I'll do better next time. You won't. Hey, I made you have diarrhea. Sorry.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.280
I hit a button or something.

12:11.280 --> 12:18.400
I was carrying this tray and I bumped it with my hip. That was my bad. You guys.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.160
I hope you liked that donut earlier. Cause I'm, I'm really taking you to do keys out.

12:23.120 --> 12:30.240
Let me just get absorbed in your colon and up. Nope. I did it bad. Sorry guys. Try the best.

12:31.600 --> 12:37.440
Oh, gluten. Gluten. It's so dumb. Griffin. How about Yahoo? Yeah. I got some Yahoo's. Thanks

12:37.440 --> 12:42.800
everybody for sending in Yahoo's. I had two weeks worth to choose from, which is always very exciting.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.240
This Yahoo was sent in by Meredith Mahan. Thanks Meredith. It's by Yahoo answers user question

12:48.240 --> 12:53.920
mark. By the way, you guys know that when a Yahoo answers user name is question mark,

12:53.920 --> 12:57.600
that means they've been kicked off of the Yahoo answer service, but their questions remain.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.000
Somebody told me that that seems crazy to me. Like why wouldn't they delete the questions too?

13:02.000 --> 13:07.520
Well, cause the wisdom is still permeating the system. Yeah. I like to think of this as

13:07.520 --> 13:15.120
like their, their tombstone. They got who answers epitaph. Ever since I've done yoga,

13:15.120 --> 13:21.120
ladies started to really feel attracted around me like a magnet. Yeah. Does yoga release a lot

13:21.120 --> 13:27.920
of pheromones or something because females keeps staring at me and touch me as well. Also come

13:27.920 --> 13:35.600
close. Is that at the end? Like, I don't know if that's a correct command. There's one other thing.

13:37.040 --> 13:43.280
Um, it's that it opens your genital chakras. I mean, I mean, okay. All right. Let's, uh,

13:44.400 --> 13:50.560
is there, we've, we've already debunked gluten, right? That's not real. Gluten doesn't exist.

13:50.560 --> 13:56.320
Gluten doesn't exist unless it does. If you have Cialis, can we talk like, is there some shit

13:56.320 --> 14:01.200
to this? Like, can you get like, Travis, you've done, you've striked me as the only person of

14:01.200 --> 14:05.920
the three of us that has ever actually done yoga. I mean, I, I did bullshit theater yoga.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.720
I've done some yoga in my time. I got a morning routine. Helps me wake up. You do that.

14:10.720 --> 14:16.640
Sun salute. I do that. Sun salute to down face dog. Love it. Name two more.

14:16.640 --> 14:27.680
Upward facing baby. Bindo. Bindo is. Stork presses. The windmill swing. The life of pie.

14:28.800 --> 14:36.480
Jedi attack. Dragon squeeze. You do that pomegranate slider. Mm hmm. Wolf yips. Jamba juice.

14:36.480 --> 14:47.760
Pinkberry. Jamba Jovi. Um, that's just some of my yoga moves. I, uh, I, I mean, if I played

14:47.760 --> 14:52.320
Street Fighter II, if yoga could teach you to spit fire at people. Sure. And shoot your leg across

14:52.320 --> 14:56.400
the battlefield. Shoot your leg across there. I don't see why. God, we are making some gross

14:56.400 --> 15:02.400
racial misrepresentations. I didn't do it. Street Fighter and David Tennant did. Or, sorry, Johnny

15:02.400 --> 15:09.760
Depp. Yeah, David Tennant's pretty racist too. Slander, slander, slander. I, I think there's

15:09.760 --> 15:16.400
probably some shit to this. I think if you, I think, I think, okay. Meditation probably has

15:16.400 --> 15:23.200
some sort of, I mean, it definitely has some sort of psychological centering effect on you that,

15:23.200 --> 15:28.400
that I think makes your, your brain game a little healthier. I think we can all, I think we can all

15:28.400 --> 15:34.400
sort of just acknowledge that face value fact. That's why Buddhist monks laid on 24-7. Yeah.

15:34.960 --> 15:40.400
Oh, um, I think, I think there's some shit to this. I don't know about like the, you know,

15:40.400 --> 15:45.600
third eye and shit like that, but I think it probably does make you like more confident.

15:45.600 --> 15:51.360
Makes, certainly makes you limberer and God knows. But he did it once. I just want to throw out in

15:51.360 --> 15:57.280
this question, the question asker did yoga once. I mean, he doesn't, I mean, he did, he phrased

15:57.280 --> 16:02.800
it as I've done yoga. So that does kind of make it sound like a last, he's completed yoga. He

16:02.800 --> 16:08.960
solved it last Saturday. There was a free class at the JC. This is interesting because we had a

16:08.960 --> 16:16.320
question from a yoga guy who, uh, everyone he dated thought he would be like really spiritual

16:16.320 --> 16:22.480
and stuff. Right. And, and, and, and all the time. And he's not, cause he's like just a dude that

16:22.480 --> 16:30.160
like watch his Ninja warrior at night and like eats Slim Jims and jerks off. Like he's just like

16:30.160 --> 16:36.320
every other dude in that, in that those are the three things. Every other guy. There's something

16:36.320 --> 16:43.120
in his aura from doing yoga that is attracting people to him that they're led to that. I think

16:43.120 --> 16:48.960
maybe we just like anybody that'll take the time to stretch. Maybe that's it. Like if you, you are

16:48.960 --> 16:53.680
like a man who doesn't pull his hammies. You like, you took the time to really stretch and I didn't

16:53.680 --> 17:00.080
do that. And I've never done that. So I am envious of you. Yeah. I respect you. I think there's

17:00.080 --> 17:05.760
probably some sort of, I think there are these power centers inside of our body. Now stick with

17:05.760 --> 17:12.960
me. Okay. I'm in. No, I'm into it. Go on. Okay. There are power centers inside our body from

17:12.960 --> 17:19.920
which we project our, our auras, if that's what you want to call it or care bear stairs, if you

17:19.920 --> 17:24.240
will. And when, yeah, if you want to think about it that way. And then when you align that shit,

17:25.680 --> 17:31.360
like, like the planets, then your shit gets like way more powerful and people can read that shit

17:31.360 --> 17:37.920
and will want to fuck you. I actually read about that in a Malcolm Gladwell's, the outliers. He

17:37.920 --> 17:44.560
said that exact paragraph. You're just cribbing. You know, is there, let me hit you with this other

17:44.560 --> 17:48.480
thing that I have for you. This is another observation. A lot of times when you're

17:48.480 --> 17:52.000
trying to get to the bottom of something, scientifically, you got to look at X factors.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.640
What are the, what are the qualifying things that might also be causing a reaction so you

17:58.640 --> 18:08.320
can separate causation? Do you maybe have some really cool pants you wear while yoga? Do they

18:08.320 --> 18:15.040
have like maybe a sweet dragon on them? Or they say like, or an enumerated list of things that

18:15.040 --> 18:21.040
make you an attractive sexual partner. Yeah. Like, like you put on the pants and up one leg,

18:21.040 --> 18:25.680
it says like, number one, cool dick. Number two, I can't have sex for a super long time without

18:25.680 --> 18:33.360
stopping. Number three, I don't sweat very much. Is it possible that this person was just like

18:33.360 --> 18:39.280
perfectly balanced at unattractive and attractive. And then they did yoga and it was just like the

18:39.280 --> 18:44.400
feather on the scale that just tipped it over into attractive. But you're saying that as if,

18:44.400 --> 18:51.680
as if like every, every member of the opposite sex, it thinks of like people doing yoga is like,

18:51.680 --> 18:57.520
like, oh, that's yeah. Want that goes even deeper because unless he's advertising it,

18:57.520 --> 19:02.080
unless he's walking to the bar going by the way, ladies yoga guy right here,

19:02.080 --> 19:08.480
then just that the ladies can sense it. I think if anyone ever did that thing that you just said,

19:09.040 --> 19:14.640
it would clear the, clear the room. I think probably, Hey, yoga man. Hey, no big deal guys,

19:14.640 --> 19:19.120
but yoga man right here. Hey, you ever been with a genuine yoga man,

19:19.120 --> 19:25.520
the party can start right now. Folks. I'm not selling you snake oil. Although I will rub snake

19:25.520 --> 19:30.960
oil essentially on your body while we yoga together sexually. It's better than yogurt,

19:30.960 --> 19:35.680
man. That's what I try to get going for a while. That did not pan out. Sometimes I just walk in

19:35.680 --> 19:39.920
and say good humor, man. And people are like, Ooh. And I'm like, no, I just tell jokes.

19:41.920 --> 19:46.720
Yahoo answers user Maria said, it responded and said, girls, like when guys do yoga,

19:46.720 --> 19:50.720
because there's lots of yoga moves that can be incorporated into sex and lead to a massive

19:50.720 --> 20:00.160
orgasm. Two things, two points of two points of order. If I may go on, I don't think.

20:01.280 --> 20:05.760
Are they talking about the massive orgasm for the partner or for the person doing the yoga?

20:05.760 --> 20:11.680
Because I don't think any, I don't think that quote massive orgasm in quote is something that

20:11.680 --> 20:19.120
the other person is ever looking for that person to have like, Oh man, here comes a bucket.

20:20.640 --> 20:29.200
Did you just do the dragon squeeze Christ? Um, second. Oh my God. Was that a Chamba Jovi?

20:35.120 --> 20:41.360
That would be an unconventional pickup line. Hey girl tonight. I would like

20:41.360 --> 20:47.200
to have a massive orgasm and I would very much like your attendance to my orgasm.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.440
I would like you to be there. I need a witness. I need a, I need a second.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.720
There are some things I would like to incorporate into our lovemaking.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.080
I need a spotter for the massive orgasm I'm going to have.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.840
Just give me some orange juice afterwards and make sure orange juice. It'll be very,

21:05.840 --> 21:09.920
very much like after giving blood. That is how drained I will be. Hey, listen, girl,

21:09.920 --> 21:13.280
if you see me start to shake around, you just put a wooden spoon in her mouth

21:13.280 --> 21:16.720
and just try to say back. This is going to be a massive. I'll give you a list of my

21:16.720 --> 21:19.760
emergency contacts. So if you need to call my parents or something,

21:20.960 --> 21:28.880
um, secondly, I don't think people actually look at people doing yoga and try and figure out how

21:28.880 --> 21:35.920
the geometry of the shape of their bodies in those positions would, would align with a sexual,

21:35.920 --> 21:40.640
like when I see somebody with their like legs bent behind them and their elbows bent behind them and

21:40.640 --> 21:44.800
they are sticking their pelvis directly in the air, forming a circle with their bodies.

21:44.800 --> 21:49.840
I don't look at that and immediately think like that would be, that would be cool to have sex

21:49.840 --> 21:54.240
with. I think like trying to have sex with that is like when you go to the beach and your beach

21:54.240 --> 21:58.560
towel like keeps crumpling up below, beneath you and you try to like flatten it out so you can get

21:58.560 --> 22:05.680
a good sit going, but it's, it's uncooperative. You know what I mean? No. You mean it's like going

22:05.680 --> 22:09.520
to like a pool and you can't figure out the chairs and how they collapse? That's exactly,

22:09.520 --> 22:14.400
that's exactly what, thank you. That's a way, way, way better metaphor. Do you think that there are,

22:14.400 --> 22:22.880
there is one yoga pose, like you could pair them off so that for every yoga pose,

22:22.880 --> 22:28.400
there's a corresponding pose, another one that would have perfect sex. Like a complimentary,

22:28.400 --> 22:34.480
like if you do downward facing dog and upward facing cat. Oh, look out. Then you get outward

22:34.480 --> 22:42.400
facing orgasm everywhere. Oh, gross. I'm going to have to move again. What if you're in a yoga

22:42.400 --> 22:46.640
class and your instructor said, now I've been working on this position for a while. It's going

22:46.640 --> 22:52.000
to be really cool. And then he like, he folds himself up and transforms into a car and drives

22:52.000 --> 23:01.840
away. He doesn't need to eat hot food. He just does it. He just just like that. That's the noise.

23:01.840 --> 23:08.800
Okay. I got another question. I'm a guy. Okay. Whenever I see, sorry, I'm a guy. And whenever I

23:08.800 --> 23:14.320
see friends who I've not spoken to in a while, I don't have any good catching up questions.

23:14.320 --> 23:19.280
I feel like maybe this is a guy thing since girls seem to have long and excited conversations when

23:19.280 --> 23:25.200
they see someone for the first time in some time. But I just go straight back to normal conversation

23:25.200 --> 23:30.160
as if we hadn't had time away from each other. Is that normal? How do you guys catch up with friends?

23:30.160 --> 23:36.880
How have you been doing? Doesn't demand anything other than fine. Thanks in response. And any other

23:36.880 --> 23:41.760
questions I think of are too vague to generate anything worthwhile. I'm still in school, which

23:41.760 --> 23:47.520
I'm guessing is pretty relevant. It's extremely, extremely completely relevant. It is super,

23:47.520 --> 23:53.120
super Jermaine Jackson to this guy. The thing I remember most about going to school in Oklahoma

23:53.120 --> 23:58.400
is every time I would return home to West Virginia, there were two different classifications of

23:58.400 --> 24:03.600
people. There was one classification that were my actual real life friends that would be like,

24:03.600 --> 24:07.680
oh, hey, and then we would just hang out. Like I hadn't been gone for four months.

24:08.240 --> 24:13.520
And then there were people that without fail asked the question, so how's Oklahoma? Yeah.

24:14.560 --> 24:20.960
To which my response was always very flat. It's very windy. Thank you very much. I think that

24:20.960 --> 24:28.640
that you bring up the the role of gender in this. And I don't think it plays a part. No,

24:28.640 --> 24:33.840
I think I think it I think it does to an extent, but not to not in the way that you think of it.

24:33.840 --> 24:39.360
I think that everybody reaches an age where they sort of circle back around and say, man,

24:39.360 --> 24:44.480
I have not kept in very good touch with my friends. I need to like make a more concerted

24:44.480 --> 24:48.720
effort to stay involved in their lives because it's uncomfortable when I do see them and like

24:48.720 --> 24:56.960
I have no fucking idea like what they're up to. I think that women do reach that point a bit

24:56.960 --> 25:04.960
earlier than dudes do. Like I think like in most aspects of life, like women mature a bit faster

25:04.960 --> 25:11.120
in that sense where they're like, I don't know, a few years before dudes, they have the realization

25:11.120 --> 25:14.880
of like, oh, man, I need to I need to get on the phone more and like talk to my friends.

25:14.880 --> 25:21.840
This will surprise no one. But I'm I'm just abysmal at this. I mean, just the absolute worst.

25:21.840 --> 25:26.800
Because here's my fear. I mean, and I think it's legitimate. My fear is that I will.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.960
I'll ask someone the question of the thing that they absolutely don't want to talk about.

25:34.960 --> 25:41.120
So how's your girlfriend? Oh, we we broke up. Yeah, exactly. How's your family? Dead. That's

25:41.120 --> 25:46.880
Falcone. My whole family's dead. Pray to me.

25:48.400 --> 25:55.840
Yes, I think that the act of catching up is one that requires you to debase yourself on a level.

25:55.840 --> 26:01.040
It is. That's exactly what it is, Griffin. It is laying yourself at their altar and like,

26:01.040 --> 26:06.960
I am so sorry. This is my admission. I have no shit. I have no clue. I have no idea.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.280
I am a fucking it really does require you to say, like, I'm a fucking terrible friend because I

26:11.280 --> 26:15.200
didn't know that, like, you dumped this person two years ago, started dating someone else.

26:15.200 --> 26:20.000
You're married and you have five kids. Like, I fucked up. That's here's the here's the other

26:20.000 --> 26:25.600
side of that coin, though. When that happens to me, like if I say, like, so how's how's things,

26:25.600 --> 26:29.520
you know, how's what's her face or whatever? And then they say, oh, you know, we broke up.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.360
If they handle it well, if they're like, oh, you know, we broke up a while ago. I'm actually seeing

26:33.360 --> 26:37.840
someone new. She's great. Right. And it's like, OK, cool. This is the type of person I want to

26:37.840 --> 26:42.160
catch up with again the next time I see them. If they're above you, Dick, we broke up and it's been

26:42.160 --> 26:49.440
real rough in my head. I mark out their names on a giant list. Next time, no eye contact.

26:49.440 --> 26:55.280
Yep. Gave it a shot. But that one's done. You blew it. The funny thing about this is and I think

26:55.280 --> 27:01.120
it's time to be if I'm being honest, I think when we are on the reverse side of the situation,

27:01.120 --> 27:06.880
and there is a part of all of us that says, man, I hope they ask about that one thing because I'm

27:06.880 --> 27:13.120
going to fucking drop the bomb on this wall. Please, please, please. I'm going to win this

27:13.120 --> 27:16.960
catching up. You're saying that there's you're saying there's an inherent joy associated with

27:16.960 --> 27:23.040
like fucking shaming somebody like dropping the bomb on them. Oh, I haven't been doing that for

27:23.040 --> 27:32.320
like four years. What the fuck? What are you talking about? Here's here's the thing, though.

27:33.040 --> 27:41.600
I. I think that like I get I get psyched after those conversations happen like after it's if

27:41.600 --> 27:49.200
it's somebody that like I'm I genuinely like want to reconnect with them, I'm like, you have to get

27:49.200 --> 27:55.040
curious about what those people have been up to. Like you have to want to genuinely catch up and

27:55.040 --> 27:59.680
not be making small talk because after I do that, like after I catch up with an old friend, which

27:59.680 --> 28:04.800
like I've been doing a lot of, especially with like getting married, like I've been sending out

28:04.800 --> 28:09.120
invitations to people that I don't talk to other than like once a year where we have a very

28:09.120 --> 28:14.240
superficial catch up time, like I get fucking psyched to be it's like it's like catching up

28:14.240 --> 28:19.760
on a TV show that everybody's talking about. It's like, oh, I like I'm right there with you now.

28:19.760 --> 28:26.560
And now we can like talk on the reg because I I am up to date with the latest and greatest of your

28:26.560 --> 28:32.800
shit. The Griffin make a great point. And it's sort of central to this, I think, is that the secret

28:32.800 --> 28:40.320
to it is you have to be if you're having a hard time coming up with a question for a person,

28:40.320 --> 28:46.560
you maybe need to reevaluate getting interested in in that person getting getting interested in

28:46.560 --> 28:51.360
people because like that's we've talked about it a lot. And it's kind of like an old Dale Carnegie

28:51.360 --> 28:56.880
thing. But like that's how you make friends and keep them is you get you get interested in people.

28:56.880 --> 29:02.160
But if you can't think of anything you're curious about, then that that may be a sign that you

29:02.160 --> 29:07.440
maybe need to reevaluate like your approach because you should be curious if you care about somebody

29:07.440 --> 29:10.720
even a little bit, then you should kind of be curious about what's going on. But I would say

29:10.720 --> 29:14.560
that I think that there is a certain amount of that. Hey, how's it going? Haven't seen you a

29:14.560 --> 29:20.800
while. Oh, it's going great. Like there's a reason that everybody does that, because that's that's

29:20.800 --> 29:27.120
the agreed upon like exchange between two people that aren't actually close, but haven't seen in

29:27.120 --> 29:30.880
each other in a while. And it's it's letting go of the shame of being like, oh, I don't care about

29:30.880 --> 29:35.760
this person. They don't care about you. If you're going to dinner with like 13 old friends for an

29:35.760 --> 29:40.800
hour, like that's not that that's not the venue to be like, tell me everything that's happened to

29:40.800 --> 29:44.560
you. Like we lost touch in college. Tell me everything that's happened to you. Like you have

29:44.560 --> 29:50.560
to like, you know, put in the time to call them and like just swallow it. Because here's the thing,

29:50.560 --> 29:54.960
like they obviously haven't kept in touch with you either. So like if they're genuinely interested

29:54.960 --> 30:01.520
in what you've been up to, then there's no there's no like downside to swallowing your pride and

30:01.520 --> 30:07.360
admitting like, I haven't kept up with your shit. Like, let's let's let's reconnect now. And then

30:07.360 --> 30:11.280
we don't. Hopefully, if we do a better job of staying in touch, we never have to have this

30:11.280 --> 30:15.200
conversation ever again. Yeah, start walking with them before you just like start running,

30:15.200 --> 30:19.920
you know, ask the little questions first and then get into like the big shit and start or start

30:19.920 --> 30:25.040
running. They'll never catch you. They will not see it. I've got friends, you know, that I went

30:25.040 --> 30:30.960
to college with. And there are some people that I see, you know, randomly running into what I'm in,

30:30.960 --> 30:35.200
you know, a different city. And it's like, oh, hey, what's up? How's it going? And then I have some,

30:35.200 --> 30:39.360
you know, my friend Trevor, I hadn't seen in like five years. And we just instantly dropped into

30:39.360 --> 30:44.960
a conversation like, you know, we were hung out the day before, you know, it's just knowing how

30:44.960 --> 30:51.120
to interact with different friends is kind of it's a case by case basis. But just, you know,

30:51.120 --> 30:58.480
care, be friends, just care. That's all you have to do is care or are hide better. There's a part

30:58.480 --> 31:02.400
of me whenever I get in a conversation like that, it's kicking myself like I should have gone

31:02.400 --> 31:06.640
should have gone behind the winter coats. Why did I leave the house? They should have never,

31:06.640 --> 31:14.000
they would have never seen you there. Oh, that's a grim window. And my psyche. That's the new name

31:14.000 --> 31:20.800
of the podcast. I once ripped my little brother's foil Charizard Pokemon card in a fit of teenage

31:20.800 --> 31:27.920
rage. It has been 12 years and my brother still has not forgiven me. He said the card was worth

31:27.920 --> 31:33.040
$50 and I've provided him with money quite a few times over the years, but he still brings up that

31:33.040 --> 31:37.600
Pokemon card every chance he gets. How can I get him to forgive me or at least quit bringing it up?

31:37.600 --> 31:42.400
That's from Amber in Arizona. Oh, well, let me ask you this. Like Griffin, for example,

31:42.400 --> 31:47.840
how would you make it up to someone if say you reformatted a PlayStation memory card and erase

31:47.840 --> 31:53.920
someone's final fantasy seven game when they were moments away from beating the game and they'd put

31:53.920 --> 31:59.680
like a hundred hours into it? How would you make that up to someone? And say they like collected

31:59.680 --> 32:06.160
everyone's like final weapons and, and final limit breaks. Um, and they were very, very close to

32:06.160 --> 32:09.520
beating the game and you reformatted the card. How would you make that up to them? I think,

32:09.520 --> 32:15.040
I think setting them free from their Japanese role playing game prison that their mind had

32:15.040 --> 32:21.520
been in their, their, their teenage, their, their vulnerable teenage mind had been imprisoned in

32:21.520 --> 32:27.840
instead of like going around and like having sex with, with women and like, you know, making friends

32:27.840 --> 32:32.880
and forging lifelong memories and friendships and like go into the football game and tailgating and

32:32.880 --> 32:38.480
like getting in trouble and like, you know, staying out after curfew and like doing all

32:38.480 --> 32:44.240
this shit from that Jack and Diane song. I think that that's a fucking reward in and of itself.

32:44.240 --> 32:48.000
So you're saying that the action itself was a kindness.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.320
Yes. I'm saying, I'm saying you had a very serious addiction

32:53.200 --> 32:58.160
and I swooped in there like John Quinones. Maybe an option is to tell your brother

32:58.160 --> 33:03.920
that you realized that that card was an idol to him and now shall have no false idols above

33:03.920 --> 33:08.240
thy Lord God. So you were trying to save his immortal soul by destroying that card,

33:08.240 --> 33:13.280
which he worshiped. Yeah. That's, that's precisely it, man. The ending of that game is so fucking

33:13.280 --> 33:19.120
good though. I fucking hate you so much. I, you know what, man, I would still be angry too.

33:19.120 --> 33:24.800
That card is so rare. It's like the kids in my middle school who had that card,

33:24.800 --> 33:29.280
it was like a fucking status symbol. It had nothing to do with the value on a chain around

33:29.280 --> 33:35.440
their necks. It had nothing to do with the value of the card. It had to do with like

33:36.560 --> 33:41.840
the triumph. Cause cause you say it's worth $50, but it's actually worth however much money he

33:41.840 --> 33:47.920
spent on Pokemon cards to get that card. Which was, which was probably in the thousands. I think

33:47.920 --> 33:52.560
what you're going to have to do is name your first born child Charizard foil. I'm sorry.

33:52.560 --> 33:59.920
Yeah. And then let your sister tear them in half. That's the wisdom of Solomon right there, Justin.

34:01.280 --> 34:07.280
Here's okay. I can make this very easy for you. It is not a problem. Go to eBay. I just did it

34:07.280 --> 34:14.080
for you. Type Charizard card and it's $30. Okay. Just grab one for $30. Do you understand the

34:14.080 --> 34:18.240
difference? You get it. You throw it in his face and say they were square. Well, no. Tear it in

34:18.240 --> 34:26.240
front of him again. This is my card. You can tear it in half now if you want. There's a Pokemon

34:26.240 --> 34:33.760
Charizard first edition base set shadowless card graded PSA eight near mint hollow. You can get

34:33.760 --> 34:39.680
that for $750 on eBay right now. One thing I do want to say about this listing is that 15 people

34:39.680 --> 34:45.840
are looking at it an hour according to eBay, which is a great short story in and of itself.

34:45.840 --> 34:54.960
There's 15 people are like, Oh, I'm going to get you. I'm sorely tempted. I fucking cashed out

34:54.960 --> 35:05.040
way too soon. I fucking got out of this more out of this trade craft way too early, like a decade

35:05.040 --> 35:09.920
too early. You know, but Griffin for every dude who got out of Pokemon is too early. There's a

35:09.920 --> 35:14.080
dude who's just, there's like 30 dudes who are just sitting on pogs being like, they're coming

35:14.080 --> 35:18.080
back. Here they come. This sweet Wolverine slammer. It's going to be worth something when he comes

35:18.080 --> 35:23.280
out. I think I read a story in the examiner like a month or so ago about this family that spent

35:23.280 --> 35:30.160
like 50, 50 G's, like 50 large stacks on, um, on Beanie Babies. And the headline was family regrets

35:30.160 --> 35:37.440
amount of money they spend on Beanie Babies. Yeah, no shit dog. Like that's, that seems pretty,

35:37.440 --> 35:42.000
I don't think you need that in 18 point font. Like I think, I think that's pretty,

35:42.000 --> 35:46.400
I watched the little video that company that is a little documentary, uh, that accompanied that

35:46.400 --> 35:52.080
and the dad who was sort of the driving force had his t-shirt on and I said, bankrupted by Beanie's.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.480
Mm-hmm. And I think that he probably got it when Beanie's were popular and he could wear it and

35:56.480 --> 36:02.720
other Beanie fans would be like, oh you. And now it's like literal. No, no, no, no, no. Listen,

36:04.080 --> 36:07.280
I've been literally bankrupted by Beanie's. I brought so much shame to my family. It seems

36:07.280 --> 36:10.960
almost accused. We've been eating Beanie Babies. We've been eating the beans that are inside of

36:10.960 --> 36:16.800
them. It seems almost accusatory, doesn't it? That like you can't like fucking blame this on the

36:16.800 --> 36:22.400
banking bust. Like somebody, all the banks sold me these predatory Beanie Baby futures. Like no,

36:22.400 --> 36:28.320
you dumb shit. Like the Beanie Baby bubble is busted. Yeah. I can't, I can't deal with Pokemon

36:28.320 --> 36:34.080
cards right now because I'm going to get the $750 one for Griffin for the birthday. What do you do

36:34.080 --> 36:41.520
with a $750 Pokemon card after you buy it? Tear it in half and feel more powerful. You can.

36:41.520 --> 36:50.640
It's me. It's Jay Z coming over the crib tonight. We're tearing in half $750 Pokemon card. Everybody

36:50.640 --> 36:55.440
that walks in gets to tear in half a rare Pokemon card. We're using some as coasters.

36:56.080 --> 37:00.960
We're eating some. I got a, I got a holofoil Jigglypuff I got from, from the launch of the

37:00.960 --> 37:07.600
first movie back in 2001. We're going to roll a J with it. It's going to taste fucking gross

37:07.600 --> 37:11.760
because I don't know what they put in holofoil. I bet like nickel and shit. We're never going to

37:11.760 --> 37:26.480
afford these cards if we don't get rich. I want to tell you guys about my hot new podcast that

37:26.480 --> 37:32.000
I don't make, but I heard about it's called, you're taking over. I'm taking it over. Check

37:32.000 --> 37:39.680
out Justin McElroy's ninjas versus podcast on iTunes. And you can go head to arcade comedy

37:39.680 --> 37:45.680
theater.com. This ninjas versus podcast is a weekly comedy debate show and they're performing

37:45.680 --> 37:51.840
their first ever live show at the arcade comedy theater in Pittsburgh. Ninjas versus podcast

37:51.840 --> 37:56.800
consists of three friends deliberating burning queries like Mumford and Sons versus Sanford and

37:56.800 --> 38:02.400
Son and which is better, great comedic timing or great comedic miming. This show is going to be

38:02.400 --> 38:09.760
August 15th, 9 PM. You're going to have to pay five bucks and there's free beer. So that's the

38:09.760 --> 38:17.520
yeah. Mission is $5 and there's free beer. Yes. So what this is, is an ad from us to you for $5 beer

38:17.520 --> 38:21.120
that you can drink. All you can drink. Well, they didn't say that. It could just be like,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.520
like a Dixie cup. You show up and they give you like a Dixie cup of a Pilsner,

38:25.520 --> 38:30.080
but that's probably so that's either way you're going to be laughing and that's maybe that's why

38:30.080 --> 38:35.920
you can drink too. Maybe we've had like gastric bypass. Uh, maybe you're going to have a gluten

38:35.920 --> 38:42.320
sensitivity. Become a fan beforehand. Good. Uh, ninjas versus podcast on iTunes. And then when

38:42.320 --> 38:46.560
you're ready, heading over to arcade comedy theater to get some, uh, details on the show.

38:46.560 --> 38:52.560
And even if you don't like the show, $5 all you can drink. You can listen to a podcast in the

38:52.560 --> 38:57.840
background where you get blasted. Well, why not? I mean, I don't think they appreciate us saying

38:57.840 --> 39:02.000
you can drown them out over the sounds of your own gulping because then what you might find is,

39:02.000 --> 39:07.040
oh wait, I love this. You'll, you'll be too busy guzzling to laugh at the jokes.

39:09.040 --> 39:15.520
No, I'm sure it's speaking of guzzling speaking of God, worst one ever speaking of guzzling

39:15.520 --> 39:23.120
extremistrace.com is your adult super store. Oh, I don't want to guzzle up the savings. Yeah,

39:23.120 --> 39:28.800
I'm sure that's what it is. Yeah, that's what you meant. Travis, uh, extremistrace.com is

39:28.800 --> 39:34.560
my favorite website for adult toys. I personally, uh, want to recommend this to you. Here's,

39:34.560 --> 39:39.360
here's what I wanted to feature this week. The oppressor chastity device. Now what this does is

39:39.360 --> 39:47.280
it hurts your wiener, but here's the other thing. It can also hurt your butt with a little spherical

39:47.280 --> 39:55.760
ball, uh, that you, I think you sit on it and it can go in your butt and hold your wiener wherever

39:55.760 --> 40:01.440
you want to feel unpleasant. One, one word to you, one word to you, butt sphere. Good luck getting in

40:01.440 --> 40:10.240
there. Good luck. Have nice, have a good time trying, but, uh, I think you're going to find

40:10.240 --> 40:18.880
it pretty difficult there. I tell you the item that I, now that I've received some, uh, things

40:18.880 --> 40:26.160
from extremistrace.com as a, uh, in paid spokesperson, I think the one thing that they need,

40:26.160 --> 40:34.320
uh, that they don't seem to sell, at least not that I've seen is secret box, which is these look

40:34.320 --> 40:41.760
great when they're on your wiener and in your butt, but they can't always be there. So I need

40:41.760 --> 40:49.440
them to invest in like secret horror compartments that I, no one can access and no one can know

40:49.440 --> 40:54.320
about like, what if it was, what if it was just like camouflage things where it's like, this looks

40:54.320 --> 41:00.400
like a flower pot, but what's that? It's your anal beads. Yeah. What, what if little, little Susie

41:00.400 --> 41:05.520
and little Tim Tim are searching around for Christmas presents and what did they find?

41:06.320 --> 41:11.360
The opposite of Christmas presents. Oh, what if it's just a box that says vegetables then?

41:11.360 --> 41:23.280
Vegetable taxes, they sell a little box with a printed out piece of paper that says vegetable

41:23.280 --> 41:29.760
taxes. Here's the thing is that they're in my house right now in my home where I live. There's

41:29.760 --> 41:36.560
an, there's a foot long plastic dick that's four inches around and I've hidden it as best I can.

41:36.560 --> 41:41.920
But let's say this, if anybody comes by my house and they need a tote bag, I hope they don't pick

41:41.920 --> 41:46.720
that one. Or what if there's a fire and later they're cleaning up all of the stuff, the wreckage

41:46.720 --> 41:52.480
and they move, you know, a burned chair and boom, there's a big unburned dick. Yeah. Oh, by the way,

41:52.480 --> 41:59.200
everything sold at Extreme Restraints is completely inflammable. They should make airplanes out of

41:59.200 --> 42:05.440

42:10.880 --> 42:14.000
Snowden, for not leaking our shit. We really, really appreciate it.

42:15.280 --> 42:20.000
I'm Cameron Esposito and I'm the host of Maximum Fun's new podcast, Wham Bam Pow,

42:20.000 --> 42:25.680
a sci-fi movie show and action movies. Also, did I forget to say action movies?

42:25.680 --> 42:31.120
Every week I'll be joined by Mr. Ricky Carmona and Ms. Ria Butcher and we are going to chat about

42:31.120 --> 42:34.720
films. We're going to tell jokes. We're going to be hilarious. We're going to play games. We're

42:34.720 --> 42:38.560
going to have guests. We're going to give reviews. It's going to blow your mind. If you want to

42:38.560 --> 42:43.840
listen to the show, you can find it at MaximumFun.org or you can subscribe on iTunes. Can you believe

42:43.840 --> 42:53.760
how many things I just listed? So many things. Wham! That's great.

42:55.360 --> 43:01.680
Hey guys, I'm feeling kind of rural right now. Oh, good. Yeah. And you know what that means.

43:02.800 --> 43:10.080
It's time for farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Pick up your pitchfork and fork a pitch. Farm wisdom.

43:10.080 --> 43:13.840
Um, somebody accused you of stealing that shit. Did you see that? Somebody,

43:13.840 --> 43:18.240
somebody put you on blast on Twitter. What did I steal it from? One of those, uh, Perry,

43:18.800 --> 43:28.080
Perry Ellis songs. Now who's the guy who did the baby monkey riding backwards on a pig.

43:28.080 --> 43:32.960
Yeah. Like all his songs sounded like that, but it's my song. I don't think he has one called farm

43:32.960 --> 43:38.880
wisdom. I mean, no, but like the melody music melody, you can't claim music and lyrics by

43:38.880 --> 43:44.160
Justin McElroy on that anymore in the credits of the podcast. I'm, I've been meaning to put

43:44.160 --> 43:47.840
credit to the end of the podcast, but now I'm not even going to start guys. Did Travis,

43:47.840 --> 43:53.440
Travis farm wisdom hit me? I'm ready. Did you know that farmers feed magnets to their cows

43:53.440 --> 44:01.360
in order to prevent or treat hardware disease? Holy shit. Hardware disease is just like it sounds

44:01.360 --> 44:06.400
when a cow eats a piece of hardware, a nail screw, a piece of barbed wire and get sick.

44:06.400 --> 44:11.200
When you feed the cows, the magnet usually drops into the reticulum compartment of the stomach

44:11.200 --> 44:16.080
and attracts any metal. The cow ate and the stomach muscles contract to help move food around

44:16.080 --> 44:20.160
loose metal can puncture through the stomach wall and traveled to other areas of the body

44:20.160 --> 44:24.720
and have been found puncturing the heart. The magnet helps keep the metal safely in the stomach

44:24.720 --> 44:29.840
and that's from Jess. Okay. Wait a minute. Stop farmers. That's a pretty smart idea.

44:29.840 --> 44:34.080
What's not so smart is calling that a disease guys. That's not a disease.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.440
They squat. How dumb are you farmers? I thought you guys were on point.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.480
Hard diseases are terms. That's not a disease. You swallowed a nail.

44:42.480 --> 44:47.200
You just call like hardware. Oopsie. When I get stabbed, I don't say I have knife items.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.120
I can't come in today. I've got a very, very bad case of knife.

44:56.080 --> 45:01.520
Uh, this other one, I forget who actually always reads these traps. Always read them.

45:01.520 --> 45:04.000
I'll let Griffin read the second one.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.240
Mountain lions will chase down and murder anything that tries to run away from them.

45:08.240 --> 45:12.400
Fuck. If you try, uh, if you find yourself being stalked by one, stand your ground,

45:12.400 --> 45:18.320
maintain eye contact, make as much noise as possible. Start masturbating very, very, very fast.

45:20.560 --> 45:24.480
Mountain lions hate masturbators. They are scared of, they are scared of,

45:24.480 --> 45:30.400
they're scared of it. Humans do it. Never turn your back, uh, bend over or crouch down in any

45:30.400 --> 45:35.600
circumstances. All this stuff about masturbation was fake. Sorry. Why?

45:38.480 --> 45:40.560
It's a fucking dominant, it's a fucking dominant thing.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.920
I see a mountain lion. That's Jordan by the way. Thanks Jordan.

45:43.920 --> 45:49.600
I see a mountain lion and my reaction is to turn around and bend over.

45:51.120 --> 45:54.000
Is this what you want? Is this what you want, mountain lion?

45:54.000 --> 46:00.400
You like that hiding? Good luck! Super fucking tight!

46:00.400 --> 46:04.400
I wasted like $20 on SherwoodShanks.com trying to find something to go in there.

46:08.160 --> 46:12.320
I also, I feel like this is one of those pieces of advice that's like really great to hear.

46:12.320 --> 46:15.840
If I see a mountain lion, what's not going to through my, go through my brain is,

46:15.840 --> 46:17.840
now is the time to not run away.

46:17.840 --> 46:21.600
Now's the time to prove, to prove, you got something to prove to this cougar.

46:21.600 --> 46:25.840
I am not going to make eye contact with that mountain lion and I'm not going to say anything.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.240
I'm going to be running and pooping my pants.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.960
No, what you're going to do, Travis, is you're going to start taking your dick out and you'd

46:30.960 --> 46:32.320
be like, wait, which was the real thing?

46:33.840 --> 46:38.720
Ah, fuck. I just doomed Travis. Maybe, maybe mountain lions really don't like it.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.200
Another hiker claimed by mountain lion masturbation disease.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.920
You could probably, you could probably creep a mountain lion out pretty solidly that way.

46:47.920 --> 46:53.760
Hey, whoa, whoa. Oh, I didn't say stop.

46:53.760 --> 46:57.520
My, you guys want to Yahoo? Yeah, please.

46:59.520 --> 47:03.920
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray. Are you Ira Ray?

47:03.920 --> 47:06.960
Who wants to know? It's asked by Yahoo answer. She's your question mark.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.800
Another one. Another one claimed.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.800
Can a 27 year old sign up for high school again?

47:14.800 --> 47:18.400
I want to see if I can go back to high school. I have a car and bigger muscles now,

47:18.400 --> 47:23.120
so I think I'll be more popular the second time around and I've always wanted to be prom king.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.840
So what do I need to go back to high school?

47:25.840 --> 47:29.360
Is this buzz marketing for 21 Jump Street?

47:30.800 --> 47:37.120
I'm getting, I'm getting my masters in high school. I'm getting my post grad in high school.

47:37.680 --> 47:40.560
What you need is a teaching certificate.

47:40.560 --> 47:47.040
And then you can go back as a teacher. I guess that's true.

47:47.040 --> 47:51.280
Yeah, that's the only way you can go like that and then beat up all the people who are mean to you.

47:51.280 --> 47:57.360
I guess there's no loophole where you can, like, I recognize now at the age of 26 when I finished,

47:57.360 --> 48:02.560
unless I go back for some, some master's program, which doesn't seem likely, like I've done all the

48:02.560 --> 48:07.120
school I'm going to do. And it's only now that I realized like, man, I actually like learning like

48:07.120 --> 48:13.040
fuck. I wish I'd paid attention to like anything. Yeah, I feel that way too. Now I'm, now that I'm

48:13.040 --> 48:18.880
older, I'm like reading books to teach myself. I'm like trying to teach myself like complex

48:18.880 --> 48:23.280
subjects that are impossible to teach yourself. And I'm like, man, if only I had fucking like

48:24.000 --> 48:29.360
done anything, like any amount of work instead of just like the requisite shit to get by.

48:31.120 --> 48:34.400
I think college should be something you get to do in installments. Cause that way you really

48:34.400 --> 48:39.920
appreciate it. Cause as you get older, you, you want to learn. I like learning now. Back then I

48:39.920 --> 48:45.680
hated waking up more. I think that after like when you complete your sophomore year, someone should

48:45.680 --> 48:49.440
sit you down and be like, are you appreciating this? And you're like, yeah, I'm not. I'm probably

48:49.440 --> 48:54.560
not. I'm like, okay, great. Cool. Cool. Cool. Um, just go off for a while. And, uh, when you do

48:54.560 --> 48:59.920
appreciate this, we'll welcome you back. But Trav, you can't put that gene like that. If there's a

48:59.920 --> 49:05.120
definition of what adulthood is, it's realizing that you didn't appreciate stuff enough. Cause

49:05.120 --> 49:09.280
that's it. Cause if you could figure out how to turn back time and do that easy stuff again,

49:09.280 --> 49:14.640
cause like, let's be honest, going to college for all its ups and downs is a lot easier than having

49:14.640 --> 49:24.480
a job. Yeah. So what if, what if we start giving jobs to 12 year olds and then you work from 12 to

49:24.480 --> 49:32.320
21 and then you get to go back to school? What if the only jobs that we give them are college

49:32.320 --> 49:44.400
professors? I think your best bet is to procreate and then you and your child get into a very loud

49:44.400 --> 49:51.680
and public fight in front of a gypsy and they freaky Friday you. That's just one of many options

49:51.680 --> 49:55.280
you have. And then at the end of the movie, the gypsy is like, you learned your lessons,

49:55.280 --> 50:00.320
time to switch you back. And it's like, actually, you know, I'm actually like, I'm like pretty cool

50:00.320 --> 50:06.240
actually. As is our second big freaky Friday reference though. I think we referenced it like

50:06.240 --> 50:12.560
10 episodes ago. Cause I think that in reality, every adult wants to be fucking 16. That's the

50:12.560 --> 50:17.680
greatest lie of all. Cause if you're, if you're a kid again, it's like, Whoa, okay, I'm going to go

50:17.680 --> 50:28.240
on the run now and let my teenager die in my old body. Fuck you, dad. Enjoy taxes, bitch. Enjoy

50:28.240 --> 50:33.600
vegetables and or taxes, but don't look in the vegetable taxes box. Oh God. That would be the

50:33.600 --> 50:39.760
only reason to switch back. Cause you're afraid of your child adult finding your vegetable taxes box.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.760
All right, dad, son, it's tight. It's April. I really need to E file.

50:43.760 --> 50:49.120
Where are they at? Where's the documents? I'm still trying to learn about documents.

50:51.280 --> 50:58.800
Um, I don't do this. Don't go to a high school like you are as you are now as a man,

51:00.080 --> 51:05.280
you won't, you won't be allowed in. They won't let you in like you are now you're old and they'll

51:05.280 --> 51:11.680
know. They'll know that you, that you don't want to do great things there. So don't even, I wouldn't

51:11.680 --> 51:17.680
even try. It probably seems like a good idea in the brain. Um, but I'm pretty sure hindsight is

51:17.680 --> 51:22.880
going to be 20, 20 on this particular thing that you want to do. That's terrible. Especially when

51:22.880 --> 51:27.440
you're on 2020. And they're like, what were you thinking? And you're like, you know, in hindsight,

51:28.160 --> 51:32.800
this grown man tried to wear a Justin Bieber t-shirt and go back to high school.

51:33.920 --> 51:38.320
What would you do? What would it, but fucking, what if he went four years and made to senior

51:38.320 --> 51:45.440
prom and he was in the running and then like two days before, like, I don't know, some,

51:45.440 --> 51:48.720
some kid lost his legs that it was also in the running, lost his legs in some sort of

51:48.720 --> 51:53.680
industrial accident. And this guy's like, fuck, like I spent four years for this day.

51:55.040 --> 51:59.280
And this is the worst day of my life. And this kid's going to fucking swoop in at the last

51:59.280 --> 52:03.040
second. He probably won't be swooping. Like some sort of legless Tarzan.

52:03.040 --> 52:09.360
Yeah. Son of a bitch on the plus side. Got to do it again. Do it again. Start all over in a

52:09.360 --> 52:14.720
different town plus side. I'm sick at times tables and my cursive is off the chart. It's fucking

52:14.720 --> 52:20.400
insane. They don't do cursive actually anymore. I don't think in schools. That's why no one writes

52:20.400 --> 52:24.480
checks anymore. Yeah. It's state by state. Actually, I think that's no, that's no bullshit.

52:24.480 --> 52:30.080
I think it's state by state. I was terrible. I got seat at why did that have to drag down my,

52:30.080 --> 52:35.280
my GPA that I had a bad handwriting grade. I don't think that that is, I don't think that

52:35.280 --> 52:40.480
factored in. It did. Justin is a mathematical genius, but he has some trouble with the cursive

52:40.480 --> 52:48.800
lowercase z. 2.2. I just don't think that because I was bad at math and writing and Jim. Oh man,

52:48.800 --> 52:56.880
was I bad grades in gym. When you say bad at gym, you mean you don't, you like weren't so psyched

52:56.880 --> 53:01.680
about like having your dick out around other kids, right? That's right. I, you were supposed to dress

53:01.680 --> 53:05.760
out every day and I didn't want to cause I was fat. So what I did was I wore sweatpants to school

53:05.760 --> 53:10.080
every day. Cool. That was, that was, that was playing the short game. That's what they call

53:10.080 --> 53:15.440
that. That was the short game I was playing. Hey, let's ask another question before. Ain't that

53:15.440 --> 53:19.920
fucked up that your GPA was dependent on your ability to get your dick out around other people.

53:19.920 --> 53:24.000
That's kind of fucked up, isn't it? Like, Hey, Hey McElroy, go take your dick out in a room

53:24.000 --> 53:28.320
full of your peers. Though I will say that was the only thing that trained me for any real life

53:28.320 --> 53:33.840
situations in adulthood where you had to get your dick out. I mean, it trained me in sense that like

53:33.840 --> 53:37.600
when I'm an adult now and somebody says, Hey McElroy, take your dick out. I know now to say

53:37.600 --> 53:43.360
like, no bad touch. No, no, thank you. Absolutely not. I don't think also I'm better at badminton.

53:43.360 --> 53:48.080
That's true. My boyfriend and I wanted to know what is the socially acceptable age group for

53:48.080 --> 53:52.880
visiting a petting zoo. We don't have any kids, but he really likes animals. They have reindeer.

53:52.880 --> 54:00.720
That's from Zany and Zaftig at the zoo. Don't reindeer give you a... Reindeer disease? No,

54:00.720 --> 54:05.520
they give you a, like their, their, their horns have, ah fuck, what's it called? When your skin

54:05.520 --> 54:12.400
falls off. What? Fertilizing fasciitis? Um, no. Leprosy. Leprosy. Yeah. The Bible shit.

54:13.600 --> 54:17.680
Are you telling me reindeer have leprosy on their horns? They're just carriers? I don't

54:17.680 --> 54:21.040
think it's like, I don't think it like they're affected by it or else fucking

54:21.040 --> 54:27.840
every Christmas tale ever would be like a horrifying saw-esque experience. Um, but yeah,

54:27.840 --> 54:32.320
I think they have, I think they give you leprosy if you like touch their, their antlers are coated

54:32.320 --> 54:38.800
in leprosy. So, okay, let's assume that the reindeer antlers have been de-leprosied and try

54:38.800 --> 54:42.240
to answer the question. I don't think you can. I think it's like a natural excretion.

54:44.720 --> 54:49.360
I don't think when they're born, somebody comes, the fucking leprosy fairy gives them their only

54:49.360 --> 54:55.840
coating of leprosy. Like what kind of fucking sense does that make? Idiot. That's our reindeer

54:55.840 --> 55:02.400
like moose in that every season, like their antlers fall off and regrow. I don't think that's

55:02.400 --> 55:08.160
real either. That that's true with moose every year. That's why they have leprosy. It's what

55:08.160 --> 55:12.560
causes their shit to fall off. Oh, it makes their horns fall off their antlers, please.

55:12.560 --> 55:18.240
That's why reindeer are known as God's funniest joke. These things are beautiful. I'm going to

55:18.240 --> 55:27.600
put leprosy in them somewhere. Good luck, Santa. Why does God hate Santa so much? He's trying to

55:27.600 --> 55:33.200
like take over. That's true. Do you think every animal has a place where it can get leprosy?

55:34.480 --> 55:43.200
Where's your leprosy compartment? Oh God. Yeah, you can't. If it's a regular zoo,

55:43.200 --> 55:48.560
mm hmm. If it's a if it's a petting zoo inside of a regular zoo and like you're an adult there,

55:48.560 --> 55:52.240
I think it's OK because like parents will see you and be like, oh, they're being ironic.

55:52.960 --> 56:01.200
Here's the thing. I think that the answer is as long as you are paired off, there is no problem.

56:02.080 --> 56:08.480
If you are by yourself, that's yeah, that's a completely different case. Like because here's

56:08.480 --> 56:15.840
the thing. OK, real life experience. Me by myself, like, you know, making faces at a baby

56:16.560 --> 56:20.080
creeps people out. I'm a grown man with a beard and I'm making faces of their children.

56:20.080 --> 56:26.160
But if Teresa's standing next to me, it's adorable. But isn't that true for literally any situation?

56:26.160 --> 56:32.000
Like any time you see a dude by himself anywhere, don't you just like and like instinctually like,

56:32.000 --> 56:36.720
oh, he's fucking creeping on someone. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's like as long as

56:36.720 --> 56:41.200
you're coupled out, you're safe. I think that's part of our fucking I think it's part of the

56:41.200 --> 56:46.960
genetic human experience. I think that's why we seek out partners to like make it through life.

56:46.960 --> 56:52.240
So when people see us, they're not instantly skis. Now, that's a hundred percent true. If I

56:52.240 --> 56:57.440
that's we we try to talk about I think we try to tear down gender walls here on my brother,

56:57.440 --> 57:02.560
my brother and me. The one I can't help is that if I see a woman standing by herself, I think,

57:02.560 --> 57:07.680
well, she's probably working or waiting for someone or just relaxing. If I see a guy by

57:07.680 --> 57:12.160
himself, I immediately who is he trying to fuck? Is he trying to fuck me? I hope not trying to

57:12.160 --> 57:16.800
kill somebody or fuck somebody or steal something or. Yeah, I just assume he's going to punch me.

57:16.800 --> 57:21.440
I don't know why, but like every time I see just like a random dude, I'm like, I'm going to get in

57:21.440 --> 57:25.840
a fight with you. Do you know why? Do you know why? It's because that like speaking from experience,

57:25.840 --> 57:29.840
like whenever I'm out somewhere alone, the only thing I'm thinking about is, man, I hope nobody

57:29.840 --> 57:35.040
thinks I'm going to fuck somebody or kill someone. And when you do that, you put on a grimace on your

57:35.040 --> 57:41.040
face that just like screams like, here it comes. Get ready. I think there is one circumstance in

57:41.040 --> 57:46.480
which being coupled out does not protect you from judgment. What's that? And it is if you are at a

57:46.480 --> 57:52.320
children's playground, coupled out, no kids. Then that's an easy fix, though. That's no problem.

57:52.320 --> 57:55.760
Just all you got. And this I was actually going to suggest this for the petting zoo.

57:55.760 --> 58:02.240
When you're at the petting zoo, every three minutes or so, just go Dylan and then look around.

58:02.240 --> 58:06.720
Don't put your fingers in its mouth, Dylan. Just like you don't know where he is. Dylan,

58:06.720 --> 58:10.560
get back here. Don't do that if you're the only two people there, though, with the farmer.

58:11.600 --> 58:15.840
Or if there's like two parents and two kids and you're like, Dylan, and they're like,

58:15.840 --> 58:20.480
I can clearly see. If the law of large numbers is not in your favor, then don't.

58:20.480 --> 58:24.960
If that happens, you have to carry out the con and keep screaming and just lose your mind

58:24.960 --> 58:29.120
and call the police. There's only one other family there with one kid. They're like,

58:29.120 --> 58:34.800
man, their kid is super lost. I haven't seen that kid in the whole time I've been here.

58:34.800 --> 58:43.440
Fuck. How did you fuck up this bad? I haven't seen another kid in like three hours.

58:44.640 --> 58:50.000
What have you been fucking doing? Why have you not widened the perimeter of your search?

58:50.000 --> 58:54.800
So we got super into this goat for like three hours. Oh, we fucked up so bad.

58:56.960 --> 59:01.600
What if our kid got leprosy so bad he just dissolved? Ah, fuck, man.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.720
Listen, we didn't find him this week. We'll have to come back next weekend

59:04.720 --> 59:07.920
at approximately the same time, pet some more animals, just hope for the best.

59:07.920 --> 59:11.840
Also, how much is that vending machine that gives you pellets you can feed this in?

59:11.840 --> 59:15.600
Just a quarter? That's a really good deal. Do you have some kind of season pass

59:15.600 --> 59:18.960
so we can just keep coming back here unrestricted to look for our sweet Dylan?

59:18.960 --> 59:21.360
This is the last place he saw us. He'll return here.

59:21.360 --> 59:24.080
Oh, we're so exhausted from looking for our Dylan for like three hours.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.520
We're just going to pet this goat for a bit.

59:26.640 --> 59:29.600
We're really stressed out. Do you guys have any like treats or anything you could give us?

59:29.600 --> 59:35.680
Don't you fucking judge us for giving up on the search so quickly. We're tired.

59:36.400 --> 59:40.880
And these animals are soft. Let me just touch this goose for a second.

59:40.880 --> 59:45.120
I'm just going to touch it for a second. Can you get off? Sorry, I'm not Miss Perfect.

59:45.120 --> 59:51.440
Sorry, you know where your kids are, okay? Pet dad of the year.

59:52.720 --> 59:58.480
What if this same family is there every time you're there, every weekend, and they're like,

59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.800
yeah, yeah. After two years, like, yeah, fucking sure, there's a Dylan.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.480
And then on like year five, a pre-teen with a stubbly beard comes running out of the woods,

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:14.480
like, mom, dad. I was in the bathroom.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.520
I was in the bathroom for five years. Got a goat in there.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.760
I've been living off toilet paper. He taught me, taught me to read.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.800
Not like raised by toilet paper. I mean, like he ate it.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.240
No, I meant like there's a goat. So you're saying he would become sort of

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.920
like a Tarzan figure. Yeah.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.840
But the only thing he'd be great at is peeing and watching people pee

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.960
and not be seen watching people pee. This family would eventually put it together like,

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:46.800
like what if the bathroom monster is Dylan? Hey guys, have you been in the bathroom?

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.120
Cause there's like a totally crazy kid in there.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.040
How you've been here every weekend for five years and you haven't gone to the bathroom.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.680
We go before the goats know the goats know where you have to go.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.640
And like, they don't like it. We should have checked the bathroom though.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.480
In retrospect, that was our fault. That was our fault.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.000
It's like the only building here. It's like the only building.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.440
Now if you'll skewer this, we have to try to re indoctrinate our son

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.560
in the society, keep him out of the back. Has anyone seen him?

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.680
We're going to restart the search, I guess.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.280
Let me just go over to the reindeer pen for like two or three hours more.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.000
But then that family catches you in the parking lot paying off the actor.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.120
You've paid to live in a bathroom for five years. Wait a minute.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.160
I wonder what happened to Zachary Ty Bryant.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.840
He would make a great doctor who now that he's fucking feral.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.440
Now he's a feral bathroom monster. Hey, listen, everybody.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.520
Thank you so much for listening to our, our program. We hope, uh, we hope you enjoyed it.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.360
Um, thanks to so many people tweeting about the show.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.960
Uh, uh, faded glory, our old buddy rabbit, uh, Mitch reader, Elizabeth, uh, Brendan Brown,

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.240
Matt Calder, James Childs, uh, Luther, Mario Peng.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.000
Panagetti. That looks good. Panagetti. Yeah, sure.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.800
Nikki the rat, bourbon ghost, everybody. Thank you so much.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.960
I sure appreciate you tweeting about the show and sharing it.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.200
But if you get a chance to read a link to our sampler, it's bit.ly forward slash NB

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:40.320
and BAM 2013. Um, and if you have a birthday shout out or if you have like a product or your

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:46.320
own show or anything you think everyone should listen to, uh, just go to, uh, maximum fun.org

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.600
forward slash jumbotron and you could be in the money zone and we'll talk about your shit.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:58.000
Um, seriously, everybody, thank you for the warm response to the, um, to the, to the clip

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.240
we did last week. I think people seem to enjoy it because a lot of that shit is like apocryphal

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.720
at this point. Um, we may do, we make the good news is if we do another one, the sound quality

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.400
will be better. Man, seriously, like how the fuck did anybody start listening? Like it sounded so,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.200
so awful. Um, yeah, we made, I'm glad you guys replaced the original Travis.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.280
Yeah, I sound totally like, I sound like, like a hundred times nerdy here. I don't know what

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:31.600
happened. Um, we may, we may do more of those. Maybe there's going to be a lot of traveling and

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:37.360
wedding shit over the next few months. So I hope we don't because what started out as a clever plan

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:45.200
to save myself from having to, uh, work on a new episode turned into like a 10 hour project where

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:51.120
I was going through every old episode, trying to find something not awful. Yeah. Trying to find

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.360
something worthwhile. Um, so, so thank you. I'm glad you liked it. Um, I want to remind everybody

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:04.480
that this is the last week to help out our buddy Trist in the Marine. Uh, we are working with, uh,

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:12.000
operations supply drop to, uh, bring him and his, uh, his, his fellow soldiers, his brothers in

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.320
arms and sisters in arms, if you will, uh, some, some games and cool stuff. Uh, this is the last

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.320
week to donate. We really want to make a big push, big showing a huge thanks to James Bromwell. Who's

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:32.480
going to ship out a game cube and, and controllers, uh, to, uh, to, to the guys. They, they were very

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.440
much wanting some retro stuff. So we're getting that in their hands. We've got $380 raised right

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.760

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:59.600

fucking freedoms. So just, I don't want to guilt you, but they're fighting for your fucking freedom.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:19.760

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.680

Oh, it looks like we got another one. Uh, DJ Lockhead, uh, from, uh, said on the Facebook

So, um, I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song,

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.840
which is the song. It's a departure, which is off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:09.920
Um, go buy it, buy it on Amazon, then buy it on iTunes. Um, and then erase it and then buy it

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.480
