00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
It's better it's better

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
It's better it's better

01:10.260 --> 01:15.340
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

01:15.340 --> 01:21.980
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Well me. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby brother

01:21.980 --> 01:28.460
I'm a grown-up man, and I'm Griffin McElroy. Now. Why did you feel the need to specify that you're a grown man?

01:28.460 --> 01:34.900
I just feel like it's sort of my thing this year and as I step into 2023 stepping into my adult power

01:35.380 --> 01:38.860
It is into anytime. I post a picture of us when we were younger

01:38.860 --> 01:45.460
Yeah, we'll talk about how different I look and and how much more mature Justin looks and people are like that

01:45.740 --> 01:49.460
Griffin didn't even age. I'm like guys. He had look at the bags around his eyes

01:53.540 --> 01:55.540
When they released the video for

01:56.220 --> 02:00.780
Montaigne did the video for my life's better with you, and we were all in it

02:00.780 --> 02:03.780
I don't read the comments on stuff, but that was somebody else's video

02:03.780 --> 02:09.660
So I read the comments because I was curious and the one that I read that stuck with me really bad is like they all

02:09.660 --> 02:11.660
Look so old. Yeah

02:14.380 --> 02:18.020
You look old I love a picture you look at me right now

02:18.020 --> 02:22.300
I don't know how my face has done this it does look like I've died my like

02:22.580 --> 02:28.500
Van Dyke around my face, but my cheeks are completely gray, and they just like yeah, I look older shit

02:28.500 --> 02:31.820
I don't know what's happening people are like you look more and more like your dad

02:31.820 --> 02:34.060
I'm like yeah, my dad's old, and I don't know

02:35.060 --> 02:36.860
I love

02:36.860 --> 02:42.740
When people use us as a yardstick for how old they must be getting oh yeah, whoa if the macro is at this old

02:42.740 --> 02:46.300
I must be old and it's like that's a valuable service. I can provide your

02:46.740 --> 02:53.560
Guys, but BuzzFeed has made a cottage industry of that by showing you what what beans from even Stevens looks like today

02:54.780 --> 02:58.780
Let me save you a few hundred clicks. He looks like an adult be

02:58.780 --> 03:05.020
It looks like it's all beans grown adult beans a big adult energy this weekend boys. I went and saw the glass onion

03:07.660 --> 03:11.300
I don't want to talk about that because there's so many spoilers, but it's very good

03:11.380 --> 03:15.540
Why did you fucking mention it then because if it's if you like the first one see ya

03:17.180 --> 03:21.780
There was 22 minutes of trailers and within those trailers boys. There's a trailer for a movie and

03:22.380 --> 03:27.460
It got me pumped now. Don't look up. Don't look up anything about this movie. Okay done. I will tell you

03:27.460 --> 03:29.060
Tell me so

03:29.060 --> 03:34.540
This is a Gerard Butler vehicle. Okay, and he is a commercial some badass flicks

03:34.540 --> 03:36.540
We're like he has to get out of prison and kill the press

03:36.540 --> 03:40.700
he punches so many things in movies even when he's not supposed to and

03:41.220 --> 03:47.500
He is a commercial airline pilot and they're about to take off and then some police show up, and they're like hey

03:48.020 --> 03:51.820
We we're gonna do a prisoner extradition on your airplane

03:51.900 --> 03:56.980
Which I don't I didn't know that was a surprise thing that you could drop on something like oh by the way

03:56.980 --> 04:01.260
Yeah, and he's like what I'm not wild about that and like too bad

04:01.260 --> 04:03.940
You are Butler's not up to you, and he's like what's this dude's deal?

04:03.940 --> 04:09.900
And he's like ah he murdered somebody 15 years ago or whatever and he's like okay, so then they fly through an electrical storm

04:10.020 --> 04:17.460
Yeah, and they end up crash landing in scary jungle part of a country and oh no like a cartel shows up or whatever and takes

04:17.460 --> 04:22.740
All the passengers hostage, and then it's up to Gerard Butler and the escaped convict guy

04:22.740 --> 04:28.660
The two of them have to work together to rescue everybody it's fucking cool travel. They play by their own rules

04:28.660 --> 04:31.820
Yeah, and the name of the movie is plane

04:34.620 --> 04:36.980
That's great, I can't be right yeah

04:37.500 --> 04:45.000
Call plane. It's like if they may is that you've described like Die Hard, and then it's like this movie's called feet

04:45.500 --> 04:47.500
Yep, this movie's building

04:48.180 --> 04:50.180
This one's called Bruce

04:50.180 --> 04:56.220
I'm I'm so excited about this is a new naming convention because I think we've had it before you know sometimes

04:56.220 --> 04:59.740
You're like gladiator. I mean my man my man M night Shyamalan

04:59.740 --> 05:05.500
I would say crush the movie title and game with his I believe his most recent feature film

05:05.500 --> 05:08.660
Which was just called old yeah, and in this one

05:08.660 --> 05:14.220
And that's I guess kind of to tie back into the intro of the podcast welcome to M night Shyamalans old, too

05:14.220 --> 05:19.820
This but it's slower this time. Yeah, it's slow. We age one day for every day. Yeah

05:19.900 --> 05:22.720
So instead of a child walk on a beach turn to a grandpa

05:23.020 --> 05:28.220
It's like a 22 year old becomes a 35 year old over the course of 12 years

05:28.220 --> 05:31.940
I just remember when I worked at a movie theater

05:31.940 --> 05:37.140
I remember watching people come up and these people still to this day befuddle me people who come to the theater

05:37.140 --> 05:42.780
And then stand before the posters and pick out which movie they're going to watch at that moment

05:42.780 --> 05:49.620
And I remember people walking up to the Ewan McGregor film the island and deciding

05:50.300 --> 05:57.020
Impulsively knowing nothing about this film. Yeah, that's what they were in the mood to watch that day. I like his face. Oh, yeah

05:57.020 --> 06:04.180
Yeah, okay, and you escape sounds good. Let's do it and now I think if we can enter into an age of singular

06:05.620 --> 06:11.840
Non-specific nouns. Yeah, it's just like what what's this movie's whole deal. It's mostly about a plane. Yeah, okay

06:11.840 --> 06:13.140
I like planes

06:13.140 --> 06:16.020
We could see plane or we could say boat or elevator

06:16.020 --> 06:20.140
Which I want to watch or old or old back feet for feet

06:20.140 --> 06:26.660
Oh before for with Justin long gotta get there for feet for long feet long feet

06:27.380 --> 06:29.980
Justin long feet. They thought they could break me

06:30.660 --> 06:33.060
They didn't know I was long feet

06:33.060 --> 06:40.700
He ties the bandana around his head. Yeah, it's a short film cool. I saw Justin long one time. Yeah

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
I did too and we were at that thing

06:42.700 --> 06:47.060
We were at the entertainment weekly thing and man, I wanted to go say hi to Justin long so bad

06:47.060 --> 06:53.660
Yeah, my connection to Justin long is so tenuous. It is like it's too hot. It's two Hodgman's removed

06:53.660 --> 06:56.460
it's like Audrey I know current Hodgman and

06:56.460 --> 07:02.540
Hodgman of today new PC Hodgman and if you knew that Hodgman, that's

07:04.340 --> 07:10.620
The moment I texted Hodgman I said we're in the same room as Justin long and Justin wants to go introduce himself based slowly on

07:10.620 --> 07:13.720
The fact that they're both named Justin and he wrote back. He should do it

07:13.720 --> 07:17.720
Oh

07:23.080 --> 07:29.600
For all you know, that's Justin long's favorite thing in the world is to meet other justice. He's never met another one

07:29.600 --> 07:33.720
Oh, yeah, like he knows about Bieber, but they're fans never met him

07:33.800 --> 07:37.900
Yeah, and if you're wondering why I'm not better connected or more successful

07:37.900 --> 07:41.080
I think you have a pretty succinct wrap-up in that little anecdote

07:41.080 --> 07:48.560
I'm just saying if Travis Barker was at the same place. I was oh would you now Travis? No, maybe Travis Pastrana?

07:49.560 --> 07:56.760
We have no way of knowing which Travis's but those are the only three or the band Travis Justin take us to another segment

07:56.760 --> 07:59.460
We're just well, I'm happy to I was trying to look we were

08:00.360 --> 08:04.800
Recording late, so I'm trying to find other areas. Thanks Trav. Thanks for these questions, buddy

08:04.800 --> 08:08.260
Hey, you're welcome. Travis actually writes all the questions

08:08.260 --> 08:13.740
We don't we haven't gotten an email in our inbox in like two and a half years probably because we don't mention it anymore

08:14.040 --> 08:18.600
The hardest part is thinking of different cities and stuff that people can be from yeah

08:18.600 --> 08:23.400
There's only so many cities and if you use one twice people are gonna be on to the other grift

08:25.000 --> 08:28.920
Before we ask a question. Yeah, and I do want to do this. Yeah the question

08:28.920 --> 08:31.800
Yeah, of course. Can I can we talk about the elf on the shelf for a second?

08:31.880 --> 08:36.260
Yeah, is that like a way of saying like the elephant in the room? No, no, that would be that

08:36.260 --> 08:38.260
TNT

08:39.620 --> 08:42.100
Can I say that we did a face or a

08:42.460 --> 08:46.340
Face time so our kids could play Pokemon together over the weekend

08:46.340 --> 08:51.220
Which was delightful and Henry had never seen elf on the shelf before and when Charlie showed it to him

08:51.300 --> 08:55.420
She was like yeah, he's pretty creepy. So like who's it for Justin?

08:55.420 --> 08:58.740
Yeah, BB asked me if we could do up on the shelf this year and I said no

08:59.020 --> 09:02.220
Alpha the shelf is just designed to horrify you into being good

09:02.220 --> 09:03.760
And she goes, but Charlie has one.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.660
And I was like, well, I can't speak to Justin's mind.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.620
I don't know how it happened.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.760
I think Mary got one first and the kids loved it.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.260
So then we got one.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.480
And the elf on the shelf, if you don't know,

09:13.480 --> 09:15.840
the elf on the shelf is a toy that you buy

09:15.840 --> 09:18.180
and you put him up on, or him,

09:18.180 --> 09:20.220
they got all kinds of different ones, him or her.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.300
Oh, woke culture, am I right?

09:22.300 --> 09:26.460
Okay, so you hide the elf on the shelf

09:26.460 --> 09:29.060
and the elf watches the kids

09:29.060 --> 09:31.060
and then reports back to Santa every night.

09:31.060 --> 09:31.900
Yeah, sure.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.540
If the kids touch the elf, this is so important.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.900
If the kids touch the elf, it loses its magic.

09:37.900 --> 09:38.740
And dies?

09:38.740 --> 09:39.740
And dies.

09:39.740 --> 09:40.620
I mean.

09:40.620 --> 09:44.300
It goes from being a magical fairy tale creature

09:44.300 --> 09:45.820
that can teleport all over your house

09:45.820 --> 09:50.820
and report on you to the government, definitely.

09:51.340 --> 09:56.020
Or a lifeless, a corpse.

09:56.020 --> 09:56.840
I mean, it is what it is.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.680
Yeah, a corpse.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.520
Basically a corpse.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.100
Just like in Toy Story, they die all the time.

10:00.100 --> 10:00.940
Yeah.

10:00.940 --> 10:01.780
Humans are around.

10:01.780 --> 10:02.620
Yeah, sure.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.340
Justin, would you say that elf on the shelf

10:04.340 --> 10:07.840
is the most commercially successful haunted doll

10:07.840 --> 10:08.780
on the market today?

10:08.780 --> 10:10.740
Wow, that's, wow, Trav.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.580
That's a good question.

10:11.580 --> 10:12.980
That's huge, actually.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.820
That's huge for our brand.

10:14.820 --> 10:18.740
But, and also, the other key thing about it is,

10:18.740 --> 10:20.080
after it reports back to Santa,

10:20.080 --> 10:23.020
it returns to a different spot in your house.

10:23.020 --> 10:23.940
Homework.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.920
As a parent, right, or guardian,

10:26.920 --> 10:28.900
you now are the one, you have to.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.540
Or home intruder.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.380
Or home intruder, thank you.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.420
Let me just, I know the kids can't touch this,

10:33.420 --> 10:34.340
let me just zoop.

10:34.340 --> 10:39.340
It's hard enough to keep the whole Santa thing going.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.340
And that's like very ephemeral, right?

10:42.340 --> 10:44.980
It's like, you know, Santa, everybody has a different.

10:44.980 --> 10:49.540
This is like concrete evidence, proof of life.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.580
This is magic that's happening every day.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.540
And if you forget that, what I'm saying is,

10:54.540 --> 10:57.660
I don't know why we had to increase the difficulty

10:57.660 --> 11:02.620
of Santa faith with this like hard, concrete,

11:02.620 --> 11:04.180
like complex mythology.

11:04.180 --> 11:07.220
Because if the bottom falls out from the elf,

11:07.220 --> 11:09.220
it's not a long walk to be like,

11:09.220 --> 11:13.500
okay, so the Santa thing, tooth fairy, all of that stuff.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.160
I don't understand why it had to be that way.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.540
Yesterday, the elf on the shelf,

11:18.540 --> 11:20.760
I had it hanging off a light fixture.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.420
And then right in front of the kids.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.760
You can't see, Justin, but it's so important to note,

11:24.760 --> 11:26.180
he's hanging by his hands.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.100
Important to note, he's hanging by his hands.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.060
It's got Velcro on his hand.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.520
I put Velcro on this thing's hands

11:30.520 --> 11:32.920
so I can make it do all kinds of wild stuff.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.340
Yeah.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.980
So you do, you're complaining for the bit,

11:36.980 --> 11:38.380
but you love it, right?

11:38.380 --> 11:40.200
When I remember it, it's good.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.940
When I don't remember, when it's 530 in the morning,

11:42.940 --> 11:45.300
and I sit up and I'm like, fuck!

11:45.300 --> 11:46.140
Then it's bad.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.020
You just throw them in the washing machine.

11:48.020 --> 11:49.980
Today, I jammed it behind the air fryer.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.760
It took the kids 15 minutes.

11:52.900 --> 11:53.740
That's awesome.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.100
But yesterday, this doll fuckin' falls

11:56.100 --> 11:58.440
right in front of the kids, onto the ground.

11:58.440 --> 12:03.020
So now I'm looking at it like, well, fuck me.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.140
And they're like, you can't touch it.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.600
Like, I know I can't touch it.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.140
And then the cat instantly is like, hell yeah,

12:08.140 --> 12:10.580
I've been wanting to fuck you up for years.

12:10.580 --> 12:11.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.380
This is my day.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.220
I'm gonna own this to you.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.900
This is your day, bud, it's coming.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.500
The cat's about to pounce.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.300
And I'm like, I think, I get some,

12:21.300 --> 12:23.360
I start looking for rubber gloves,

12:23.360 --> 12:25.260
because I feel like I could maybe sell that.

12:25.260 --> 12:26.100
Yeah.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.300
But then Charlie's like, get the tongs.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.620
Like, okay, tongs, that's even better.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.700
So I get tongs and I pick up this.

12:32.700 --> 12:37.540
Like a bird that has been dragged into the house.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.380
Yep.

12:38.380 --> 12:43.380
And I put it face down on a serving tray

12:44.860 --> 12:46.540
up on top of the fridge.

12:46.540 --> 12:47.620
And it's just lying there like,

12:47.620 --> 12:49.260
we'll let her rest there.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.340
It's fine.

12:50.340 --> 12:51.920
I'm sure she'll get her magic back.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.960
I'm sure the tongs were okay.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.420
Last night, as I mentioned,

12:55.420 --> 12:57.080
we forgot to move the elf,

12:57.080 --> 12:59.060
because it was very out of sight, out of mind.

12:59.060 --> 13:01.300
It was lying on top of a serving tray.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.100
And Sydney's like, text me while I'm just out of the shower.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.580
She's like, quick, I've got Charlie distracted.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.960
You've got to move the elf.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.800
Like, okay.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.220
Okay, so I run.

13:12.220 --> 13:15.460
And then I had this really brief moment where I was like,

13:15.460 --> 13:18.620
I don't know what we're teaching our kids with the elf,

13:18.620 --> 13:22.060
but this could be a teachable moment

13:22.060 --> 13:25.660
that gets me having to do the elf forever.

13:25.660 --> 13:29.860
So it's basically just like, that's a tough break, kids.

13:29.860 --> 13:33.260
But that's what life is like sometimes, right?

13:33.260 --> 13:35.060
That's like that sometimes.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.180
So what did you do?

13:37.180 --> 13:38.100
He air fried it.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.740
I stuffed it behind the air fryer.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.520
I stuffed it behind the air fryer.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.660
Didn't use the tongs, used my bare hands.

13:43.660 --> 13:45.260
Well, you broke the magic.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.020
Could you not have sold like,

13:47.020 --> 13:49.740
the elf spirit is still in there.

13:49.740 --> 13:52.800
But if we scale the thing out,

13:52.800 --> 13:56.540
he had, she had like an eight-story fall yesterday

13:56.540 --> 13:57.660
onto her, onto her.

13:57.660 --> 14:00.420
She has a long road to recovery ahead of her.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.320
She's gonna be laid up on the fridge for a while,

14:03.320 --> 14:07.300
which honestly, kids, is a bad behavior pass for you

14:07.300 --> 14:09.140
for as long as they are convalescing.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.060
You can do whatever you want and Clarice can't report.

14:11.060 --> 14:14.380
Well, there's an animated series, it's absolute horseshit.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.780
It's like a 22-minute movie of garbage.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.300
And this one kid's like, I don't believe in this idiot.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.460
He knocks it off a shelf.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.860
And they do even increase the mythology

14:23.860 --> 14:26.900
to now where he has to be flown by other elves

14:26.900 --> 14:30.140
back to the North Pole and get bed rest.

14:30.140 --> 14:31.580
To get resuscitated.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.420
Wow.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.260
It's so heinous.

14:33.260 --> 14:34.340
We got that dog,

14:34.340 --> 14:37.260
because I think somebody, some family member sent us

14:37.260 --> 14:40.140
the dog, elf on a shelf has a dog too.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.620
And it's a St. Bernard with a little keg around its neck,

14:42.620 --> 14:45.580
but the keg contains Christmas cheer.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.420
Sure.

14:46.420 --> 14:50.780
And on Christmas Eve, a beam of light shoots out

14:50.780 --> 14:54.020
of the dog's keg that has a heart on it.

14:54.020 --> 14:58.220
And that goes to the North Pole to make Christmas happen.

14:58.220 --> 14:59.300
Christmas would die.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.540
Christmas would fade from the earth

15:00.540 --> 15:03.580
if we stopped believing in it.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.780
Which is cool, because then on Christmas Eve,

15:05.780 --> 15:08.180
my son stays up to watch his stuffed animal dog

15:08.180 --> 15:09.180
that comes with the book.

15:09.180 --> 15:12.260
And it's like, a beam hasn't come out yet.

15:12.260 --> 15:13.580
I'm pretty worried that Christmas

15:13.580 --> 15:14.980
is not gonna come this year.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.140
And it's like, man, what's the game?

15:17.140 --> 15:20.300
Unless you have some sort of beam laser technology

15:20.300 --> 15:22.620
that you can put inside of your dog dolls,

15:22.620 --> 15:25.220
maybe don't build that into the mythos.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.060
Dad tried to introduce-

15:26.060 --> 15:27.580
But think about how much Hanukkah

15:27.580 --> 15:29.100
could get to shine that year.

15:29.100 --> 15:29.940
Oh wow.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.900
If your house didn't come, Hanukkah would be

15:31.900 --> 15:34.140
in your house, it could finally get center stage.

15:34.140 --> 15:37.380
Dad tried to introduce elf on a shelf into our home

15:37.380 --> 15:41.940
by getting my kids each one Bengals themed.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.540
Oh, we got one of the, holy shit,

15:43.540 --> 15:44.380
we got one of these too.

15:44.380 --> 15:45.620
Thank you, we got it too.

15:45.620 --> 15:46.820
And all I can think is like,

15:46.820 --> 15:49.300
it's already a complicated enough mythos

15:49.300 --> 15:52.180
without introducing, and also they love football.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.420
They love one team, they have a preference.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.980
Mine, the one that dad sent us,

15:56.980 --> 16:00.100
ended up being the elf on the shelf in aisle five

16:00.100 --> 16:02.300
of Goodwill, because that's where he went,

16:02.300 --> 16:03.820
because no thank you, dad.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.300
I don't wanna have to explain that.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.500
Nope, no thank you.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.500
I'm just saying I really pray that there is no magic

16:09.500 --> 16:11.940
in the dolls, because I never remove them

16:11.940 --> 16:14.260
from what must now be their coffins.

16:14.260 --> 16:17.100
Except for me, if the doll is alive,

16:17.100 --> 16:19.540
I've done the most kick-ass job ever hiding it

16:19.540 --> 16:23.300
from my child, he'll never see it.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.660
That's some other family's problem.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.620
Okay, we're not gonna do one of those.

16:26.620 --> 16:27.820
They can touch him all he wants.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.300
I stuck a note on him that says,

16:29.300 --> 16:33.140
this is my cross to bear, you touch this guy, go nuts,

16:33.140 --> 16:33.980
I said.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.540
I just discovered a large spider web in my hotel room.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.420
It's too high to reach it by jumping,

16:38.420 --> 16:40.580
and also I don't like killing spiders.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.780
Would it be crossing some social boundary

16:42.780 --> 16:45.860
to ask the front desk to send someone to kill it for me?

16:45.860 --> 16:47.460
I'm staying here for a whole month,

16:47.460 --> 16:49.100
and I think it's moving closer.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.260
Help, brothers, big bad bug in Blythe.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.020
Listen.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.460
I don't know how spiders run in Blythe.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.300
Like this.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.340
Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.

16:59.340 --> 17:02.300
Yeah, they make a fun sound like that.

17:02.300 --> 17:07.100
You shouldn't kill spiders is what I'm supposed to say.

17:07.100 --> 17:07.940
Whoa.

17:07.940 --> 17:12.300
But they can be poisonous and very, very scary,

17:12.300 --> 17:15.660
and we are so much bigger than they are.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.140
It seems like if you would goosh it,

17:19.140 --> 17:20.940
that stuff would come out.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.820
That's my usual boundary for,

17:23.820 --> 17:25.940
okay, you are big enough to deserve

17:26.980 --> 17:30.100
some sort of primal dignity,

17:30.100 --> 17:32.860
and I will usher you outside in a solo cup.

17:33.740 --> 17:37.180
But if they don't goosh out when they explode,

17:37.180 --> 17:38.860
is that even really alive?

17:38.860 --> 17:40.060
Does it have feelings?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.860
Griffin, I've both seen and read Charlotte's web.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.380
They've got feelings.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.900
Well, but Charlotte is big enough.

17:45.900 --> 17:48.900
Charlotte's big enough that if you squished her,

17:48.900 --> 17:49.940
stuff would come out.

17:49.940 --> 17:53.860
So yes, that's a living creature right there,

17:53.860 --> 17:54.940
and we have to respect that.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.340
Look, can I ask you guys a judgment call?

17:57.340 --> 17:58.180
Yeah.

17:58.180 --> 18:01.420
Which of these do you think is more acceptable?

18:01.420 --> 18:04.820
Calling the front desk and asking them to send someone up,

18:04.820 --> 18:07.340
or going down to the front desk and saying like,

18:07.340 --> 18:10.180
hey, there's a spider in my room,

18:10.180 --> 18:11.660
if someone could go take care of that?

18:11.660 --> 18:13.020
Neither one of those is great.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.460
I think the best case scenario,

18:15.460 --> 18:17.780
and the one that sort of gets you off scot-free,

18:17.780 --> 18:19.140
is you call the front desk and say,

18:19.140 --> 18:22.020
hello, it's me again.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.460
I know I've called about a lot of bugs today,

18:24.460 --> 18:28.700
but this one's a doozer.

18:28.700 --> 18:32.860
I have a spider in my room, and that is scary to me.

18:32.860 --> 18:36.380
What happens next, I'm your customer.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.380
You tell me.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.700
I'm scared of the spider in my room.

18:39.700 --> 18:40.820
Yes.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.060
Whatever happens, maybe you do something about it,

18:43.060 --> 18:47.980
maybe you don't, but I'm an active Yelp power user.

18:47.980 --> 18:51.780
I am always ready to burn your shit down.

18:51.780 --> 18:56.660
Okay, I think it can't be the sole focus of the call.

18:56.660 --> 18:59.220
Like if you said like, oh, could I get an extra pillow

18:59.220 --> 19:02.220
and a couple of towels, and while they're in here,

19:02.220 --> 19:05.780
there's a big scary spider, if they have time.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.100
If they have time.

19:07.100 --> 19:10.620
Just get it on a magazine and chuck it in the hallway.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.300
I don't kill spiders, I don't kill a spider.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.180
No, any one of them could create Spider-Man,

19:15.180 --> 19:16.860
and I don't wanna take that away from the world.

19:16.860 --> 19:17.700
May I?

19:17.700 --> 19:19.860
You don't kill spiders, it's bad luck.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.100
I don't extend this courtesy

19:21.100 --> 19:22.900
to all living things, obviously.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.420
If I see a stink bug in my house,

19:24.420 --> 19:27.180
which I do every year for a couple months.

19:27.180 --> 19:28.460
The same one?

19:28.460 --> 19:30.700
No, oh no, certainly not,

19:30.700 --> 19:32.620
because I'll smush those dead.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.820
That makes the stink come out, Justin.

19:34.820 --> 19:35.660
I love the stink.

19:35.660 --> 19:36.820
That means one less stink bug.

19:36.820 --> 19:37.820
I hate these guys, okay?

19:37.820 --> 19:39.700
Wait, hold on, that doesn't,

19:39.700 --> 19:40.980
the worst thing about the stink bug

19:40.980 --> 19:41.940
is the stink they make.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.500
You make the stink come out, and you're like,

19:43.500 --> 19:44.900
ah, now it can't stink.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.060
I'm actually, I'm with Justin on this one.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.580
The worst part of the stink bug is their presence.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.140
Yeah, it's the being a bug in the house.

19:52.140 --> 19:53.660
Now, normally I'll try to chuck them outside,

19:53.660 --> 19:54.500
because the kids don't like it,

19:54.500 --> 19:55.780
but if I see one of the kids around,

19:55.780 --> 19:59.140
they're big, tough guardians, I will send them to hell.

19:59.140 --> 20:00.340
I won't do that for a spider.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.980
Spider, that's part of the fun of spiders.

20:02.980 --> 20:05.500
You gotta get it on a napkin, or a paper towel,

20:05.500 --> 20:07.500
or something, and gotta get it outside.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.020
Before it get on your hand.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.740
If this helps you,

20:10.740 --> 20:14.060
there's five or six other spiders in your room, guaranteed.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.020
Not just one.

20:15.020 --> 20:16.060
If this makes you feel any better,

20:16.060 --> 20:17.100
and it probably shouldn't,

20:17.100 --> 20:18.460
there are probably six or seven,

20:18.460 --> 20:20.660
or eight or nine, or a dozen spiders in your room.

20:20.660 --> 20:21.500
For sure.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.260
That's just the life that you live.

20:24.260 --> 20:27.980
The spider you can see, that's a good one.

20:27.980 --> 20:30.340
Good, I got tabs on that one.

20:30.340 --> 20:31.540
Don't worry about that spider.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.180
He's out there, he's like, are we, is this okay?

20:34.180 --> 20:35.620
I'm here, I know you can see me.

20:35.620 --> 20:36.460
This is fine, right?

20:36.460 --> 20:37.380
That's polite.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.220
That's polite.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.820
The other spiders, oh, they're nasty dogs.

20:40.820 --> 20:41.660
They're everywhere.

20:41.660 --> 20:43.020
They're underneath your bed, they're everywhere.

20:43.020 --> 20:47.060
But the spider you can see, you don't need to kill him.

20:47.060 --> 20:48.700
He's going about his business, he's fine.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.700
Providing a service, as well.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.540
Listen, I don't like them.

20:52.540 --> 20:54.620
Famously, I do not care for spiders.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.420
However, we need them.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.780
They're good, they're good spiders.

20:58.780 --> 20:59.620
They kill the genie mosquitoes.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.020
So just move rooms.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.100
That's the spider's room.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.940
You walked in, somebody was already in that room,

21:03.940 --> 21:04.980
and it's a spider.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.340
You're in the wrong room.

21:06.340 --> 21:07.300
Yeah, it's a spider.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.420
The spider has to admit.

21:08.420 --> 21:09.700
I wouldn't call somebody,

21:09.700 --> 21:12.100
because they might not handle it ethically.

21:12.100 --> 21:12.940
Yeah.

21:12.940 --> 21:14.700
They would probably kill the spider.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.060
They're probably not gonna go through the work

21:16.060 --> 21:17.580
of scooping up the spider and then walking it

21:17.580 --> 21:18.420
to the elevator.

21:18.420 --> 21:19.260
No.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.460
They won't apologize to the spider and say,

21:21.460 --> 21:24.220
I know you were here first, I'm sorry about this.

21:24.220 --> 21:25.820
What you gotta hope for, the best you can hope for,

21:25.820 --> 21:28.060
is that they have one of those old-timey mail shoots.

21:28.060 --> 21:29.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:29.780 --> 21:34.700
Have an incredible adventure, Jason Schwartzman-voiced spider.

21:34.700 --> 21:35.940
Have a wonderful adventure.

21:35.940 --> 21:37.660
Oh, he would do so good.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.500
It looks like I've got mail.

21:43.020 --> 21:46.580
And then Dunstan just picks him up and fucking eats him.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.180
And then the baby's day out, eats Dunstan.

21:49.180 --> 21:50.860
What a perfect film.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.220
What an amazing, what an amazing idea.

21:54.220 --> 21:55.820
And so culturally relevant.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.460
It's not, but it's like,

21:57.460 --> 21:59.900
what if a monkey got loose in a hotel mail room?

22:01.340 --> 22:02.180
Yeah.

22:02.180 --> 22:03.020
Rights itself, baby.

22:03.020 --> 22:03.860
Sure, yeah.

22:03.860 --> 22:05.980
And also Jason Alexander's there and he's befuddled.

22:05.980 --> 22:07.940
He could not be more confused.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.780
Hey, can we go to the wizard?

22:09.780 --> 22:10.620
Yeah, I'd love that.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.460
I wish we would.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.580
Let's bow our heads in prayer.

22:13.580 --> 22:15.180
This was sent in by Siobhan.

22:15.180 --> 22:16.540
Thank you, Siobhan.

22:16.540 --> 22:20.700
It is written by a bunch of authors, it seems like.

22:20.700 --> 22:25.700
Wow, this one only has a 39% out of 100% of goodness.

22:25.700 --> 22:29.700
So this may not be some of the wizard's best work.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.420
38 co-authors, few too many cooks in the kitchen

22:32.420 --> 22:35.460
on how to trash talk on Xbox Live.

22:35.460 --> 22:40.460
I suppose this would work for PlayStation Live,

22:41.500 --> 22:43.060
Nintendo Live.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.180
No, Sony cronies respond to things differently.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.180
Oh, is that true?

22:47.180 --> 22:48.020
Yeah.

22:48.020 --> 22:48.840
They're built different.

22:48.840 --> 22:49.680
Yeah, built different.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.780
Yeah, they probably don't call themselves Sony cronies

22:51.780 --> 22:52.620
when they talk about how cool they are.

22:52.620 --> 22:53.900
No, we do.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.220
Oh, okay, you've taken that.

22:56.220 --> 22:57.580
They prefer Sony cronies.

22:57.580 --> 22:58.420
Yeah.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.980
Well, it depends on if we're into

22:59.980 --> 23:02.540
the Friendship is Magic universe or not.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.700
This is gonna flay the flesh off our bones.

23:05.700 --> 23:10.040
Being good at a game is a sure way to own mad noobs.

23:10.040 --> 23:10.880
Yep.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.700
But if you didn't do so good or you just like to argue,

23:13.700 --> 23:16.100
then trash talking can make the match funnier.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.040
Well, I don't know about funnier.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.580
Step, well, step zero.

23:22.580 --> 23:23.420
Keep your grades up.

23:23.420 --> 23:24.860
If your grades go too bad,

23:24.860 --> 23:27.340
your parents will cancel your Xbox Live account

23:27.340 --> 23:28.840
and then you can kiss Master Chief

23:28.840 --> 23:30.300
on his helmet mouth goodbye.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.940
He's never coming back.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.540
Justin, did you put glasses on?

23:34.540 --> 23:37.380
I was looking at another window in Chrome

23:37.380 --> 23:39.620
and then when I looked back, you had glasses on.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.260
Oh, I think I've always been there.

23:41.260 --> 23:42.400
I think I've always had glasses.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.660
No, these are my blue blockers.

23:43.660 --> 23:45.780
I'm starting to feel a little bit of eye strain set in.

23:45.780 --> 23:47.460
I'm old.

23:47.460 --> 23:51.380
I'm starting to feel a little bit of co-opting

23:51.380 --> 23:52.500
the glasses brand.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.020
Yeah, man.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.460
And the beer brand.

23:55.460 --> 23:57.580
You know that for a while I was the glasses one

23:57.580 --> 24:00.260
and Travis was the beards one and you were the nothing.

24:00.260 --> 24:01.460
You had nothing on your face.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.380
You were the nothing.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.860
You consumed all of Neverending Story.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.060
But now you have both of them.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.980
So now it's glasses, beards guy, glasses, beards guy,

24:08.980 --> 24:11.100
glasses, not Scruff.

24:11.100 --> 24:11.940
Scruff.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.620
Maybe the bad guy is you for not.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.020
Having a beard?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.540
Having a beard?

24:17.540 --> 24:20.780
Okay, well, it looks weird and bad when I do it.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.940
So I guess I didn't get those jeans.

24:22.940 --> 24:25.140
But anyway, just something to think about.

24:25.140 --> 24:26.780
Step one, be brave.

24:28.820 --> 24:31.020
Who cares that you came in last place?

24:31.020 --> 24:33.740
Yeah, trash talking after owning everyone in the room

24:33.740 --> 24:35.780
gives you a clear advantage, but so what?

24:35.780 --> 24:37.300
Brag about your kill death ratio

24:37.300 --> 24:39.500
or point out someone for camping the whole time.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.340
Cool.

24:40.340 --> 24:41.240
Yeah, there you go.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.080
Good work, you fucking scrubs.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.820
No one's ever said kill death ratio

24:43.820 --> 24:45.060
and you're not allowed to say that.

24:45.060 --> 24:47.360
Yeah, you're not allowed to spell the whole thing out.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.860
Nice work capturing the flag, you fucking idiots.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.700
Yeah, you died 100 times.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.280
You lost 15 points.

24:53.280 --> 24:58.280
Like, yeah, I know, but you died a couple times too, idiot.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.140
In the history of video games,

25:01.140 --> 25:04.380
the best trash talking comes from a place of whining, right?

25:04.380 --> 25:06.900
Of like, well, my controller's glitched.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.860
You were using the turbo button.

25:09.860 --> 25:11.460
I said no odd job.

25:11.460 --> 25:12.280
That kind of thing.

25:12.280 --> 25:15.020
My parents were yelling like so loud.

25:15.020 --> 25:18.060
So loud I couldn't hear the sound of the gun

25:18.060 --> 25:20.180
going bang, bang, bang.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.060
The ratatouille that was piloting me

25:22.060 --> 25:24.260
wasn't very good at this match.

25:24.260 --> 25:26.180
Yeah, a lot of things.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.820
I think this article also submits in

25:27.820 --> 25:29.880
that most good online trash talking

25:29.880 --> 25:31.700
comes from a place of real courage.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.160
Be brave, who cares?

25:34.160 --> 25:36.100
Don't be too loud.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.740
Just because you want to tell someone how much they suck

25:38.740 --> 25:41.880
doesn't mean you have to hog the sound waves.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.380
That's a really powerful term for people in our profession.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.580
Is this what Alien did this?

25:45.580 --> 25:46.900
What is, who wrote this?

25:46.900 --> 25:48.300
There's only so many sound waves

25:48.300 --> 25:51.380
that the human ear can detect at any time.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.460
That's the secret of music mixing,

25:53.460 --> 25:55.060
mastering, production, all that stuff.

25:55.060 --> 25:55.900
Don't use too much.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.260
So you don't want to use too many of them

25:57.260 --> 26:00.220
just by being like, you died twice, bleh!

26:00.220 --> 26:02.740
And then making that long, sustained sort of

26:02.740 --> 26:03.580
sick noise. You ever wonder

26:03.580 --> 26:04.760
why we stopped at eight track?

26:04.760 --> 26:06.740
That's it. That's all the tracks we got.

26:06.740 --> 26:08.040
I would go one step further and say

26:08.040 --> 26:09.540
if you really want to fuck with someone,

26:09.540 --> 26:11.180
trash talking ASMR.

26:11.180 --> 26:12.180
I think that would really fuck.

26:12.180 --> 26:13.500
Oh, that's good.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.580
I just want to let you know, psst, psst, psst,

26:15.580 --> 26:18.340
that you're kind of a fucking noob.

26:18.340 --> 26:21.780
And I'm just going to squat on your face

26:21.780 --> 26:24.040
and squat and squat and squat and squat.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.220
Fucked your dad.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.340
And this is-

26:29.340 --> 26:31.260
Griffin, I don't think he's ever watched an ASMR video.

26:31.260 --> 26:33.580
He thinks it's Jimmy Stewart insulting-

26:33.580 --> 26:35.900
Oh, well, I fucked your dad.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.540
I'm going to cut your hair on this side.

26:38.540 --> 26:39.380
That's the worst-

26:39.380 --> 26:41.140
Master Chief is my best friend.

26:41.140 --> 26:45.620
That was, that was among the worst Jimmy Stewart impressions

26:45.620 --> 26:47.420
that have been done.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.460
Don't hog the sound waves.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.140
Let other people make their lame comeback

26:50.140 --> 26:53.700
so you can spike it at them showing your true ownage.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.580
Yeah, man.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.420
Yeah.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.240
Fuck yeah.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.080
Point out someone.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.620
If someone sat around and camped the whole time,

26:58.620 --> 26:59.760
say something.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.420
Most people, other people,

27:01.420 --> 27:03.580
most likely other people are going to back you up

27:03.580 --> 27:05.620
if they were really doing something wrong.

27:05.620 --> 27:08.300
So this is an interesting form of trash talk.

27:09.140 --> 27:09.980
Try to like,

27:09.980 --> 27:12.180
hey, I know you're tempted to trash talk me,

27:12.180 --> 27:13.780
but let's talk about Dylan.

27:13.780 --> 27:14.740
Yeah.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.860
You're a scrub and an idiot and I fucked your dad,

27:17.860 --> 27:20.940
but I'm going to take a sort of moral position here.

27:20.940 --> 27:21.780
Mom?

27:23.140 --> 27:24.300
Say that,

27:24.300 --> 27:27.540
say that Charter was kicking it behind his bush

27:27.540 --> 27:28.380
this whole time.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.100
He stayed in one place for like big portions of the game.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.980
It's capture the flag.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.700
Yeah, but he was, well, I don't know what you mean.

27:35.700 --> 27:36.900
Well, he was just in the zones.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.260
He had to capture the zones and then defend the zones.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.500
Yeah, but he wasn't like running around like I was.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.900
You died 700 times.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.540
So do it for the laughs.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.460
You could invent other jobs that you were doing

27:49.460 --> 27:50.740
while they were doing the fighting

27:50.740 --> 27:52.820
because the military is not just the shooting people.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.100
That's interesting.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.900
You could be like, I had KP.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.420
I had to kill potatoes.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.980
I couldn't help you today.

27:58.980 --> 28:01.420
My KP ratio is off the charts.

28:01.420 --> 28:06.020
If the commercials for army and Navy

28:06.020 --> 28:08.740
and Marines recruitment have taught me anything,

28:08.740 --> 28:13.740
the jobs in military are shooting ones, drones ones,

28:15.020 --> 28:19.980
which they make seem like flying like a cool hobby plane,

28:19.980 --> 28:21.460
which I appreciate.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.540
And then the other one is you can build bridges

28:24.540 --> 28:27.620
because they need bridges for industry

28:27.620 --> 28:32.140
and for us to get those cool big drones up somewhere

28:32.140 --> 28:34.620
to a takeoff pad.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.460
I think there's also a job where like four people

28:36.460 --> 28:40.100
look at a radar and then point at a bigger radar.

28:40.100 --> 28:40.940
That's us.

28:40.940 --> 28:41.780
That's us.

28:41.780 --> 28:42.620
Don't get confused.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.660
Now look, it's up there now.

28:43.660 --> 28:45.100
I moved it up to the big screen.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.140
Pretty cool, huh?

28:46.140 --> 28:47.180
Where's our dot finder?

28:47.180 --> 28:48.540
Right here, sir.

28:48.540 --> 28:49.500
This is us right here.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.340
That's us.

28:50.340 --> 28:52.260
I'm gonna put a little arrow there so we don't forget.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.820
Blow up every other dot.

28:53.820 --> 28:54.660
Oh no.

28:55.820 --> 28:56.900
Do it for the laughs.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.380
As much as you wanna dominate someone,

28:58.380 --> 28:59.860
make it funny because everyone likes

28:59.860 --> 29:01.660
that one hilarious kid in the lobby.

29:01.660 --> 29:02.740
That's true.

29:02.740 --> 29:07.180
Everyone really likes when a bunch of ones are fighting

29:07.180 --> 29:10.980
for that incredible honor is the best part

29:10.980 --> 29:15.220
because then it's like I'm on Last Comic Standing

29:15.220 --> 29:19.460
every day, every time I play COD and Halo

29:19.460 --> 29:20.780
with my best friends.

29:21.940 --> 29:23.340
Don't be obnoxious.

29:23.340 --> 29:24.180
Don't be-

29:24.180 --> 29:25.020
Sorry?

29:25.020 --> 29:26.540
Don't be agnostic.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.340
Don't be agnostic.

29:28.340 --> 29:32.140
Christ is gonna get you there or he won't.

29:32.140 --> 29:34.020
But don't fall in the middle.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.100
Make a fucking choice.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.380
You gotta decide.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.220
If you're alone-

29:37.220 --> 29:39.220
If there's one thing game lobbies love,

29:39.220 --> 29:41.300
it's strong religious beliefs.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.660
One way or the other.

29:42.660 --> 29:43.700
One way or the other.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.340
Either God's gonna help you get the Battle Royale

29:47.340 --> 29:49.820
and take the crown in this big Fortnite match

29:49.820 --> 29:52.900
or we're all alone and it's you

29:52.900 --> 29:54.900
and it all comes down to you.

29:54.900 --> 29:58.420
And one of those two extremes is the way you gotta go.

29:58.420 --> 30:00.180
Avoid being obnoxious.

30:00.180 --> 30:01.820
Don't whine and be annoying

30:01.820 --> 30:03.740
because chances are you're the one

30:03.740 --> 30:05.500
that's gonna get dominated.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.300
This article's all over the fucking place, man.

30:08.300 --> 30:11.340
This is what happens when you have like 28 different authors.

30:11.340 --> 30:12.980
There's one author who's like, be obnoxious.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.860
It's like, all right, no, don't, hey,

30:14.860 --> 30:15.700
don't listen to what he said.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.620
Don't actually listen to that one.

30:17.620 --> 30:18.540
Make friends.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.260
You don't have to friend request them,

30:20.260 --> 30:22.780
but making some lobby friends is always good,

30:22.780 --> 30:24.740
especially if a lobby fight breaks out.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.580
You want them to have your back.

30:26.580 --> 30:27.980
Lobby fight!

30:27.980 --> 30:31.540
Oh shit, why is your collarbone broken?

30:31.540 --> 30:34.740
Yeah, man, you know how it is, lobby fight.

30:34.740 --> 30:35.700
Lobby fight.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.900
Not friends on there.

30:36.900 --> 30:37.980
I don't friend people.

30:37.980 --> 30:39.140
It's serendipity.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.420
I let them go.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.420
I blow, I say, thanks for the teamwork.

30:42.420 --> 30:43.580
Send them back into the breeze

30:43.580 --> 30:45.740
if our paths cross again, it was meant to be.

30:45.740 --> 30:48.940
What about, hey, guys, what about instead of trash talk,

30:48.940 --> 30:51.420
we focus on some treasure talk and just say like,

30:51.420 --> 30:54.020
hey, everybody did really good this match

30:54.020 --> 30:55.020
and I appreciate it.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.300
I've never gotten a compliment

30:56.300 --> 30:57.380
while playing an online video game.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.220
That would be huge for me.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.940
Yes, I have also experienced that, Justin, as well.

31:00.940 --> 31:02.700
Nice, nice kill, J, man.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.380
But you want to hear the most effect,

31:05.380 --> 31:06.820
I've only been affected by trash talk

31:06.820 --> 31:09.980
once in my entire illustrious gaming career.

31:09.980 --> 31:12.660
I was playing Gears of War online

31:12.660 --> 31:16.100
and in Gears of War, to finish, this is gross.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.900
This is yucky stuff, guys.

31:17.900 --> 31:22.900
That iteration of it, you had to stomp on the enemy's head

31:23.300 --> 31:24.960
to finish the fight.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.380
They'd be downed, but then it's like in Fortnite,

31:27.380 --> 31:28.580
somebody gets downed like this,

31:28.580 --> 31:30.960
except you run over to them and have to smash their head.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.340
But whoever smashes the head gets credit for the kill.

31:33.340 --> 31:36.860
So this guy next to me, he shoots someone really dead,

31:36.860 --> 31:38.660
but he doesn't run over as fast as I do

31:38.660 --> 31:39.620
because I was close to the bite.

31:39.620 --> 31:42.100
So I run over there and I squish his head.

31:42.100 --> 31:45.620
And this guy says to me in the most disappointed

31:45.620 --> 31:49.580
parent voice possible, you have to get your own kills, man.

31:49.580 --> 31:53.260
Oh, no. Devastating.

31:53.260 --> 31:56.180
And man, I did feel like trash.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.900
That was some good trash talk.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.580
I remember it 10 years later.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.420
Yeah, man.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.660
I felt like trash.

32:01.660 --> 32:02.940
Wow.

32:02.940 --> 32:04.180
It was, it was-

32:04.180 --> 32:05.020
Did you leave?

32:05.020 --> 32:08.180
Did you just turn, did you turn the Xbox off immediately?

32:08.180 --> 32:10.300
I don't think I could have hung in the rest of the match.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.140
I don't think I kept playing.

32:11.140 --> 32:14.240
Like, I was like so, I think I probably shut it off.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.660
But like, I remember that.

32:15.660 --> 32:16.540
That's trash talk.

32:16.540 --> 32:17.380
I mean, that's like-

32:17.380 --> 32:18.200
Yeah.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.420
That works out, that's deep.

32:19.420 --> 32:20.880
That's going deep for trash talk

32:20.880 --> 32:23.040
that I will still recount 10 years later.

32:25.220 --> 32:26.460
Know when it's appropriate.

32:26.460 --> 32:28.020
If no one is talking when you enter a lobby,

32:28.020 --> 32:30.900
it's probably not a good idea to trash talk, okay?

32:30.900 --> 32:31.940
It's my experience.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.060
Someone's gotta start it.

32:33.060 --> 32:34.620
Yeah, be careful what you say.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.460
There are people who report trash talkers

32:36.460 --> 32:38.220
if you use overly swear-filled language.

32:38.220 --> 32:39.700
So trash talk all you want.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.440
Just lay off the F bombs.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.940
Yeah, use like really archaic-

32:42.940 --> 32:45.700
I don't think that's, I don't think that's true.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.380
I don't think they're policing that.

32:47.380 --> 32:48.220
I don't.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.740
I do not believe that fucking Master Chief

32:50.740 --> 32:53.660
is like listening in like, he said fuck once.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.340
That one is okay.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.700
It's PG-13 rules.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.700
That's PG-13 rules.

32:57.700 --> 32:58.980
They can show all booth.

33:00.060 --> 33:00.900
Be funny.

33:00.900 --> 33:02.940
You don't have to trash on other people.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.180
Didn't they already say be funny?

33:05.180 --> 33:07.180
In most cases, you will find that the subject matter

33:07.180 --> 33:08.600
is far away from video games.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.760
In general, just don't talk about racist

33:10.760 --> 33:14.220
or controversial subjects unless you are

33:14.220 --> 33:16.740
in that sort of company.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.140
Wow.

33:18.140 --> 33:18.960
Hey, WikiHow.

33:18.960 --> 33:19.800
Wow.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.920
WikiHow.

33:20.920 --> 33:21.760
WikiHow.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.000
Holy shit, guys.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.060
Read the room for bigotry

33:27.060 --> 33:29.020
and then dive right in.

33:29.020 --> 33:31.060
Listen, man, if everyone's being racist,

33:31.060 --> 33:34.100
if everyone's having a racist old time,

33:34.100 --> 33:37.740
you don't want to stand out as the not racist in the room.

33:37.740 --> 33:38.780
Holy shit.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.220
WikiHow.

33:40.220 --> 33:41.060
WikiHow.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.820
They will single you out for your unwillingness

33:44.820 --> 33:46.780
to participate in the bigotry.

33:46.780 --> 33:48.340
Do you think that this article

33:48.340 --> 33:50.880
or this subsection of the article

33:50.880 --> 33:54.660
will still be active by the next time we record?

33:54.660 --> 33:57.980
Or will one of the 38 original authors be like,

33:57.980 --> 34:02.620
I do not want my username on this one.

34:02.620 --> 34:03.460
Boop.

34:03.460 --> 34:04.300
Oh, boy.

34:05.940 --> 34:07.460
One Q&A, why is my friend acting

34:07.460 --> 34:09.380
like she does not want to be my friend anymore?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.340
That is not your main to the subject.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.260
What you did has certainly had nothing to do

34:14.260 --> 34:15.220
with this article.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.900
You fucked up IRL.

34:16.900 --> 34:21.900
These are clinically proven ways to just have a funny time

34:22.140 --> 34:24.060
on a Xbox Live platform.

34:24.940 --> 34:26.340
And what's wrong with that?

34:26.340 --> 34:27.180
A lot.

34:27.180 --> 34:28.020
Yeah.

34:28.020 --> 34:28.860
Ha ha!

34:28.860 --> 34:31.860
It's better, it's better with you.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.060
Hey, do you have an exciting idea for a website?

34:40.060 --> 34:41.780
An idea that you want to share with your brothers

34:41.780 --> 34:44.340
but then they make you wait on that idea

34:44.340 --> 34:46.540
until after the break?

34:46.540 --> 34:48.700
And you're so excited to share it

34:48.700 --> 34:51.020
and then they're like, well, we gotta go make money first

34:51.020 --> 34:52.220
so you have to wait.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.300
Well, you don't have, I'd love to hear your idea

34:54.300 --> 34:55.700
because I did promise that I'd listen to it,

34:55.700 --> 34:57.580
but first, can I take just one more second

34:57.580 --> 34:59.780
just to tell you about Squarespace first?

34:59.780 --> 35:00.900
Completely underwired as note,

35:00.900 --> 35:05.420
Squarespace is a website creation tool

35:07.500 --> 35:08.820
and it's so much more than that,

35:08.820 --> 35:10.940
but really you can use Squarespace

35:10.940 --> 35:13.200
and all their incredible resources to make a website

35:13.200 --> 35:16.500
even if you don't know anything about making a website.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.340
And you know, like Travis, for example,

35:18.340 --> 35:20.540
he's got this great idea he's gonna share with us soon.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.940
You know my idea is so much as it's just like

35:22.940 --> 35:25.060
a reinvigoration of our brand maybe.

35:25.060 --> 35:25.900
And we'll get there, we'll get there for sure.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.300
We'll get there, we'll get there, we'll get there,

35:27.300 --> 35:28.620
but you know, it's not gonna take long

35:28.620 --> 35:29.540
to make this website, Travis,

35:29.540 --> 35:30.820
so you don't even need to worry about it

35:30.820 --> 35:32.860
because they've got all these incredible templates

35:32.860 --> 35:35.580
that are created by the best designers in the biz.

35:35.580 --> 35:36.620
You pull these in and-

35:36.620 --> 35:38.700
Did they get, wait, they got Jerry website?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.260
They got Jerry website, the man for whom-

35:40.260 --> 35:42.340
This dude definitely knows how to cyber.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.180
Yeah.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.000
And you can sell products.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.940
Okay.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.700
You can sell products with the Squarespace website

35:49.700 --> 35:51.100
and they've got blogging tools.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.740
You can share your photos, videos, recommendations.

35:53.740 --> 35:55.820
Like it is a very powerful tool.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.740
I've used it to make websites and now you can too,

35:58.740 --> 36:03.700
even if you like me haven't edited since the WYSIWYG days.

36:03.700 --> 36:06.080
Can I use it to share my Grinch fan art?

36:07.180 --> 36:08.380
Is that your website idea?

36:08.380 --> 36:10.820
It actually says, I'm looking at the Squarespace

36:10.820 --> 36:15.780
terms of conditions and it says here that's forbidden,

36:15.780 --> 36:16.740
only from Travis.

36:16.740 --> 36:19.300
But it's only implied erotica.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.900
Yeah, no, they said they hate it.

36:20.900 --> 36:23.100
They said they hate it in the terms of condition.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.620
They went explicit?

36:24.620 --> 36:25.460
Yeah.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.020
Oh, I don't know if I could do that

36:27.020 --> 36:28.260
to my hero of the Grinch.

36:30.540 --> 36:35.380
Check out squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial

36:35.380 --> 36:36.300
and when you're ready to launch,

36:36.300 --> 36:38.380
use offer code my brother to save 10%

36:38.380 --> 36:40.700
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.300
Sometimes we cross the finish line of an advertisement

36:43.300 --> 36:46.820
and one of us is just sort of dragging the like

36:46.820 --> 36:51.580
sort of whole riddled sack of the ad copy behind us

36:51.580 --> 36:54.060
as it sort of just tumbles out the back.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.860
Well, it's just like, imagine if you were watching

36:55.860 --> 36:59.260
like a relay race and between like racer three and four

36:59.260 --> 37:01.540
instead of a baton, they just handed them a dildo

37:01.540 --> 37:03.540
and then they were like, oh, okay.

37:03.540 --> 37:06.100
They just had to carry that across the finish line.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.960
This is what they gave me, man, I don't know.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.300
The grocery bags are torn and I'm just picking

37:10.300 --> 37:12.220
the cans of peas up from the parking lot.

37:12.220 --> 37:14.180
Yeah, and Justin's like, Justin's like,

37:14.180 --> 37:15.380
don't worry guys, I got it.

37:15.380 --> 37:18.380
And me and Travis are just leg wrestling in the grass.

37:22.660 --> 37:25.300
You probably already have a favorite animal.

37:25.300 --> 37:28.180
Maybe it's a powerful apex predator like the tiger

37:28.180 --> 37:29.900
or a cute and cuddly panda.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.820
And those are great, but have you considered something

37:31.820 --> 37:34.300
a little more unconventional?

37:34.300 --> 37:37.620
Could I perhaps interest you in the Greenland shark,

37:37.620 --> 37:39.980
which can live for nearly 400 years

37:39.980 --> 37:43.100
or maybe the jewel wasp who performs brain surgery

37:43.100 --> 37:45.620
on cockroaches to control their minds.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.820
On Just the Zoo of Us, we review animals

37:47.820 --> 37:49.220
by giving them ratings out of 10

37:49.220 --> 37:51.540
in the categories of effectiveness, ingenuity

37:51.540 --> 37:52.660
and aesthetics.

37:52.660 --> 37:54.980
Listen with friends and family of all ages

37:54.980 --> 37:57.740
to find your new favorite animal with Just the Zoo of Us

37:57.740 --> 38:01.580
on maximumfun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

38:01.580 --> 38:06.580
Hello, I'm a stuffy Dowager Countess.

38:09.900 --> 38:10.740
Travis?

38:10.740 --> 38:13.260
I'm judging everybody's manners.

38:13.260 --> 38:14.100
Oh no.

38:14.100 --> 38:16.020
Schmaners isn't judgy, it's about teaching you

38:16.020 --> 38:18.860
to be your best self and be a little more confident

38:18.860 --> 38:21.420
when you enter social situations that you don't understand

38:21.420 --> 38:24.060
and maybe also teach you a little bit about history

38:24.060 --> 38:26.340
you didn't know or give you interesting things

38:26.340 --> 38:27.540
to talk about at parties.

38:27.540 --> 38:29.860
Yeah, like the secret life of Emily Post.

38:29.860 --> 38:33.380
Or like why wristwatches are the way that they are.

38:33.380 --> 38:36.580
We can talk about table manners from the Victorian era.

38:36.580 --> 38:39.180
Sure, or what it's like to attend a Regency ball.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.020
Yeah.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.940
You can find all that and more

38:41.940 --> 38:44.820
if you listen to Schmaners on Maximum Fun

38:44.820 --> 38:48.220
or wherever your podcasts come from, I guess.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.500
Manner Schmaners, get it?

38:54.380 --> 38:56.940
Now, Travis, I believe that before we were so rudely

38:56.940 --> 38:59.860
interrupted by this capitalist hellscape,

38:59.860 --> 39:01.540
which we are in prison,

39:01.540 --> 39:03.460
that you were about to play along at home.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.020
I was about to play along at home,

39:05.020 --> 39:08.140
but what I've done, and I worked really hard on that,

39:08.140 --> 39:09.500
I took some time away from my family

39:09.500 --> 39:11.300
during the holiday season.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.300
Have you polished up this bit?

39:13.300 --> 39:15.900
I love a lot of your bits, I can admit now,

39:15.900 --> 39:17.580
because of lots of therapy.

39:17.580 --> 39:18.420
Thank you.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.460
But this one, I still don't know if it's there yet.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.300
I have-

39:21.300 --> 39:23.500
I think what's so energizing about this show-

39:23.500 --> 39:24.340
I have two sets of questions.

39:24.340 --> 39:27.020
We're able to workshop things as we do them.

39:27.020 --> 39:28.540
I have two sets of questions.

39:28.540 --> 39:29.380
Okay.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.820
One set of questions is about Disneyland

39:32.820 --> 39:34.300
or Disney theme parks.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.140
Right.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.460
One set of questions is about Pokemon.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.300
We've done-

39:38.300 --> 39:39.140
Griffin-

39:39.140 --> 39:39.960
I think we've done this exactly-

39:39.960 --> 39:42.900
Yes, I know, but this time I've carefully balanced it.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.420
I've gone through, I focus tested these

39:45.420 --> 39:46.500
to make sure they were balanced.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.580
Griffin, I'll be asking you the Disney questions.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.300
Justin, I'll be asking you the Pokemon questions.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.060
We should call this the chuckle lab.

39:52.060 --> 39:53.060
Okay, you ready?

39:53.060 --> 39:55.740
When Travis has a bit, we'll call it the chuckle lab

39:55.740 --> 39:57.980
and it's the experiment and we're all in it.

39:57.980 --> 39:59.060
You're in it if you're listening.

39:59.060 --> 39:59.900
We're all in it.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.020
We're all scientists.

40:01.020 --> 40:04.420
Griffin, in 2006, Disney regained the rights

40:04.420 --> 40:08.700
to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit by trading NBC what?

40:13.740 --> 40:17.940
One of the Huey, Dewey, Louie duck nephews.

40:17.940 --> 40:18.780
No, I'm sorry.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.900
They used to be Huey, Dewey, and Greg.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.540
Yeah, got rid of him, checked him out

40:22.540 --> 40:23.380
because he didn't rhyme.

40:23.380 --> 40:27.140
It was the services of sports commentator, Owl Michaels.

40:27.140 --> 40:29.580
Okay, that's wild.

40:29.580 --> 40:32.980
That's really cool that they were able to do that.

40:32.980 --> 40:33.820
Yes.

40:33.820 --> 40:34.860
Who is that good for?

40:34.860 --> 40:36.880
Who's ego does that boost?

40:36.880 --> 40:38.580
I have to know.

40:38.580 --> 40:41.300
Cause like on the one hand, it seems like, wow,

40:41.300 --> 40:44.720
that's to trade a whole IP just for this one guy.

40:44.720 --> 40:48.000
But then from Owl Michael's perspective, it's like,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.140
I'm who?

40:49.140 --> 40:50.180
I'm equal to what now?

40:50.180 --> 40:51.020
Apparently Bob Iger-

40:51.020 --> 40:53.060
I'm moving my beautiful family.

40:53.060 --> 40:56.980
I'm moving my beautiful wife and three children

40:56.980 --> 41:00.460
to Santa Clara, California, across the country.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.540
So you could have Oswald the Lucky Rabbit

41:02.540 --> 41:04.320
and put him in Epic Mickey?

41:04.320 --> 41:07.980
Apparently the dude from ESPN, when they wanted Owl Michael,

41:07.980 --> 41:12.620
called and it was like, hey, it's me from ABC.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.980
We would like, Owl Michael's his contacts going.

41:14.980 --> 41:16.860
And Bob Iger was like, cool, you got it.

41:16.860 --> 41:18.540
But we want Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.580
And the dude from ESPN was like, who is that?

41:20.580 --> 41:23.480
And Bob Iger said, time for you to do some research.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.460
Awesome.

41:26.460 --> 41:27.900
They probably could have just done it

41:27.900 --> 41:30.980
and no one would have been like, hey, do we own that?

41:30.980 --> 41:33.840
Justin, in the original Pokemon game,

41:33.840 --> 41:34.680
the three-

41:34.680 --> 41:35.500
Can I see the other ones?

41:35.500 --> 41:38.180
The three starters to choose from were Trimander,

41:38.180 --> 41:40.580
Bulbasaur, and what squirting turtle?

41:40.580 --> 41:41.860
Fuck off Travis.

41:41.860 --> 41:42.900
Squirtle.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.440
Okay, that's one for Justin.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.840
That's dog shit.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.300
Okay, Griffin, Disney parks have been home

41:48.300 --> 41:50.140
to a lot of famous rides.

41:50.140 --> 41:53.420
These rides include Space Mountain, Haunted Mansion,

41:53.420 --> 41:55.740
and a swashbuckling dark ride.

41:55.740 --> 41:58.300
What was the name of the miniature railroad

41:58.300 --> 41:59.700
in Walt Disney's backyard?

42:01.220 --> 42:02.580
The Zephyr.

42:02.580 --> 42:06.220
No, I'm sorry, it was Carrollwood Pacific Railroad.

42:06.220 --> 42:08.780
He had a miniature railroad in his backyard.

42:08.780 --> 42:09.620
Okay.

42:09.620 --> 42:10.660
You think we're gonna be able to ride the train

42:10.660 --> 42:11.700
at Disney World again soon?

42:11.700 --> 42:12.740
It feels like it's coming up.

42:12.740 --> 42:14.460
They finished the tunnel through Tron.

42:14.460 --> 42:18.500
Justin, in the animated series, Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum

42:18.500 --> 42:20.640
was accompanied by his buddy Pikachu.

42:20.640 --> 42:23.220
What was Pikachu's catchphrase on the show?

42:24.260 --> 42:25.100
Pika P?

42:25.980 --> 42:26.820
We'll accept that.

42:26.820 --> 42:28.580
It was Pikachu, but we'll take it.

42:28.580 --> 42:29.420
Yeah, okay.

42:29.420 --> 42:30.240
I think that this sucks.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.420
I think it sucks for a lot of reasons.

42:32.420 --> 42:36.180
Griffin, arguably the most creative Disney Imagineer,

42:36.180 --> 42:39.860
visionary Tony Baxter was born on what day?

42:39.860 --> 42:40.960
Christmas.

42:40.960 --> 42:44.420
No, I'm sorry, he was February 1st, 1947.

42:44.420 --> 42:49.420
He had a hand in the creation of Star Tours,

42:49.660 --> 42:50.500
Big Thunder Mountain.

42:50.500 --> 42:51.500
Really Griffin?

42:51.500 --> 42:53.700
The journey into imagination and many others,

42:53.700 --> 42:57.260
including what would have been a Jules Verne themed land

42:57.260 --> 43:00.900
called Discovery Land or Discovery Bay.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.420
That's interesting, that's interesting.

43:02.420 --> 43:04.900
Justin, name a Pokemon.

43:04.900 --> 43:05.740
God.

43:08.380 --> 43:09.500
You can do this.

43:09.500 --> 43:10.580
Mr. Mime?

43:10.580 --> 43:12.840
We'll accept that, yes, Mr. Mime.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.260
That's three for three, Justin.

43:14.260 --> 43:15.620
You kicked Griffin's ass.

43:15.620 --> 43:16.620
Woo!

43:16.620 --> 43:17.580
You don't have any more for me?

43:17.580 --> 43:18.500
Because I feel like now I'm all out.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.900
Justin, you sure know a lot about Pokemon.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.940
I feel like I'm kind of a renaissance dude.

43:22.940 --> 43:25.540
Like I know Pokemon and Disney, you know what I mean?

43:25.540 --> 43:27.460
Griffin, you don't know shit.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.660
That's like unnecessarily cruel.

43:31.660 --> 43:33.460
I was trying to trash talk.

43:33.460 --> 43:36.540
Here's the thing, here's the thing what sucks.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.620
That Justin's questions were a lot easier than mine.

43:40.620 --> 43:43.460
No, I worked very carefully to balance them out.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.100
They were objectively much easier.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.300
And last time we did it,

43:46.300 --> 43:48.740
I feel like my questions were easier

43:48.740 --> 43:50.540
and Justin's was harder.

43:50.540 --> 43:55.540
And I'm wondering if maybe we need a fourth party

43:56.420 --> 43:59.340
who can step in and do a little game balance

44:00.780 --> 44:03.540
before the next time we do the segment.

44:03.540 --> 44:06.620
Well, we don't have a fourth brother.

44:06.620 --> 44:08.820
So I don't know how that would work.

44:08.820 --> 44:13.100
Yeah, no, but dad just did just text us literally

44:13.100 --> 44:15.180
this exact moment.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.420
Does anybody want to learn Yooker?

44:17.420 --> 44:18.860
I already fucking know Yooker.

44:18.860 --> 44:21.180
We all already know Yooker, but regardless,

44:21.180 --> 44:23.660
I think dad's our fourth brother.

44:23.660 --> 44:25.140
Just from the text messages.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.140
Sometimes we get texts from Dan

44:27.140 --> 44:30.020
and it feels like we haven't spoken to him in six years.

44:30.020 --> 44:32.020
No, okay, he is referencing the fact

44:32.020 --> 44:34.660
that we were chatting about Marvel Snap.

44:34.660 --> 44:35.820
It was a good goof.

44:35.820 --> 44:36.660
Oh yeah, that is a great goof.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.420
We're talking about Marvel Snap in that chat.

44:38.420 --> 44:40.260
I'm actually quite good at Yooker already, fuck.

44:40.260 --> 44:42.060
Dad plays a lot of Marvel Snap, y'all.

44:42.060 --> 44:44.820
Travis plays a lot, dad plays a lot.

44:44.820 --> 44:47.180
I play just a regular amount.

44:47.180 --> 44:52.180
And I go on card dates with the babes.

44:53.660 --> 44:55.340
Whoa, that's a big thing to admit,

44:55.340 --> 44:58.100
you're philandering and you're cheating on your wife.

44:58.100 --> 45:01.140
Oh babe, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

45:01.140 --> 45:02.660
No, not me.

45:02.660 --> 45:06.140
They're gonna find out about my babe-based card dates.

45:06.140 --> 45:07.180
Griffin, turn off your camera.

45:07.180 --> 45:08.020
Okay, okay.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.540
And be quiet.

45:10.540 --> 45:12.700
Hey guys, it's Justin and Travis

45:12.700 --> 45:13.900
from the McElroy brothers.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.460
God, I never thought we'd have to do this one.

45:16.460 --> 45:17.300
It's so hard.

45:18.780 --> 45:21.140
As you know, No Dude Wife guy, Griffin McElroy,

45:21.140 --> 45:23.900
and our former brother has been,

45:24.740 --> 45:26.340
Trav, how would you say it, I mean?

45:26.340 --> 45:29.900
Revealed, has been unmasked.

45:29.900 --> 45:31.100
Unmasked, unmasked.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.060
God.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.180
It's a real piece of shit.

45:34.180 --> 45:36.180
He's been going on card dates with babes.

45:36.180 --> 45:37.980
With babes, multiple babes.

45:37.980 --> 45:38.820
Multiple babes.

45:38.820 --> 45:39.820
Multiple card dates.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.860
Probably multiple cards.

45:41.860 --> 45:43.100
Oh, he's on one right now.

45:43.100 --> 45:44.140
He's on right.

45:44.140 --> 45:45.940
Hey guys, I just got, hold on guys.

45:45.940 --> 45:48.380
I just drove my car into my third story window

45:48.380 --> 45:49.860
and parked it.

45:49.860 --> 45:51.540
Were you talking something about me?

45:51.540 --> 45:52.940
I'm just doing normal shit.

45:52.940 --> 45:54.180
Grocery store shit.

45:55.220 --> 45:58.500
Griffin, Griffin, you still have a whole card date

45:58.500 --> 46:00.380
with babe vibe around you.

46:00.380 --> 46:03.020
I'm not on a card date with six babes right now.

46:03.020 --> 46:04.820
Stop it.

46:04.820 --> 46:07.420
Hey, it's multiple babes at the same time, Griffin?

46:07.420 --> 46:09.980
That's not even fair to the babes.

46:09.980 --> 46:11.740
Do they know about each other?

46:11.740 --> 46:16.140
Even this bit makes me hugely,

46:17.620 --> 46:20.660
deeply uncomfortable, hugely.

46:20.660 --> 46:21.660
Take the glasses off.

46:21.660 --> 46:23.780
Yeah, you did a costume change for this bit.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.860
He did a costume change.

46:25.860 --> 46:28.340
I mean, it's a great, don't get me wrong, man.

46:28.340 --> 46:30.220
I don't regret the bit,

46:30.220 --> 46:31.060
because I think it's pretty-

46:31.060 --> 46:33.580
You look like Blue Beetle from DC Comics.

46:33.580 --> 46:34.780
I think it's pretty funny.

46:34.780 --> 46:37.020
I thought it was a pretty, post-game,

46:37.020 --> 46:38.620
I thought it was a pretty funny bit.

46:38.620 --> 46:41.060
It made me feel deeply uncomfortable while doing it.

46:41.060 --> 46:42.740
You're still wearing the sunglasses.

46:42.740 --> 46:45.540
They're prescriptions, so they're fine.

46:45.540 --> 46:46.380
It's fine.

46:51.340 --> 46:52.180
Hey.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.700
I wanna munch.

46:56.700 --> 46:58.260
Squad.

46:58.260 --> 46:59.780
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

46:59.780 --> 47:01.780
I want to munch.

47:01.780 --> 47:02.700
Squad.

47:05.580 --> 47:06.420
Welcome to Munch Squad,

47:06.420 --> 47:07.420
Podcast within podcast,

47:07.420 --> 47:08.820
profiling latest, greatest brand eating

47:08.820 --> 47:12.100
at two, two, two, two scoops of news for you today.

47:12.100 --> 47:15.540
One is KFC is giving the gift of $5 famous bowls

47:15.540 --> 47:18.380
and limited edition holiday buckets.

47:18.380 --> 47:23.380
Sorry, Starbucks, but the Colonel has his own thing.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.100
It's chicken time for the holiday season.

47:27.100 --> 47:30.380
KFC is debuting, I always get confused about it.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.220
Debuting?

47:31.220 --> 47:32.220
Debuting.

47:32.220 --> 47:33.060
Debuting.

47:33.060 --> 47:33.880
Debuting.

47:33.880 --> 47:34.720
New bargains and buckets

47:34.720 --> 47:37.220
to make it easier to enjoy all of your celebrations.

47:37.220 --> 47:38.940
Whether you're looking to sneak away

47:38.940 --> 47:42.020
for a quick bite to fuel your holiday shopping.

47:42.020 --> 47:42.860
Hell yeah.

47:42.860 --> 47:43.720
Sneak away from your family?

47:43.720 --> 47:44.560
Is that what you mean?

47:44.560 --> 47:45.400
You need a whole bucket of KFC.

47:45.400 --> 47:46.240
You need a whole bucket of KFC.

47:46.240 --> 47:50.380
They say sneak away from your family.

47:50.380 --> 47:54.420
For a bucket of chicken.

47:54.420 --> 47:57.660
To eat a bucket of chicken by yourself in private.

47:57.660 --> 47:58.500
Yeah.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.960
Just silent nodding to the other patrons like,

48:00.960 --> 48:02.340
yeah, me too, buddy.

48:02.340 --> 48:05.420
Yeah, I think that there was another box of decorations

48:05.420 --> 48:06.700
in the garage and I missed it.

48:06.700 --> 48:07.580
I gotta go look.

48:07.580 --> 48:08.420
What are you talking about?

48:08.420 --> 48:10.020
It's December 22nd.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.580
I gotta just, I'll be back in about 15 minutes.

48:13.540 --> 48:16.860
Hey, when I drove the kids to school this morning,

48:16.860 --> 48:19.620
it smelled like, and there was a big empty bucket

48:19.620 --> 48:21.020
of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

48:21.020 --> 48:23.320
Did you maybe eat a whole one of those

48:23.320 --> 48:25.380
while sitting idling in the car

48:25.380 --> 48:27.700
in the Target parking lot yesterday?

48:27.700 --> 48:29.020
Raccoon must've gotten in the car again.

48:29.020 --> 48:31.620
Raccoons, damn, they bring chicken into cars

48:31.620 --> 48:32.980
and eat it and leave it.

48:32.980 --> 48:37.860
Three-time Grammy-nominated rap superstar Jack Harlow

48:37.860 --> 48:42.860
teams up with acclaimed comedian and entrepreneur Drewski

48:43.420 --> 48:45.540
to promote the $5 deal.

48:45.540 --> 48:46.360
Okay.

48:47.300 --> 48:51.100
Based on a childhood memory of being in his dad's truck

48:51.100 --> 48:53.580
and picking up a KFC in the drive-through,

48:53.580 --> 48:58.100
the press release says picking up a KFC in the drive-through.

48:58.100 --> 49:03.100
So I don't, he's got some serious towing capacity.

49:03.100 --> 49:06.900
It's gotta be a Ram 1500, maybe even a 25.

49:06.900 --> 49:08.180
It's got a Hemi.

49:08.180 --> 49:09.260
This one's got a Hemi.

49:09.260 --> 49:10.740
Picking up KFC in the drive-through,

49:10.740 --> 49:13.100
Harlow's nostalgia for the famous bowl

49:13.100 --> 49:16.380
transports him to an animated world of memories

49:16.380 --> 49:18.460
of enjoying the iconic bowl.

49:18.460 --> 49:20.340
How old is Jack Harlow?

49:20.340 --> 49:22.460
Is this the, this is what I'm,

49:22.460 --> 49:23.740
this kind of threw me, right?

49:23.740 --> 49:27.880
Because has the famous bowl been a goof for long enough

49:27.880 --> 49:30.020
that it went around?

49:30.020 --> 49:33.000
Okay, Jack Harlow is only 24 years old.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.980
So I can believe that he has nostalgia,

49:36.980 --> 49:38.380
but how do you have nostalgia

49:38.380 --> 49:39.980
for a thing that still exists?

49:39.980 --> 49:41.140
I'm confused about that.

49:41.140 --> 49:43.260
And is gross.

49:43.260 --> 49:44.100
Also that.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.780
Bigger question.

49:45.780 --> 49:46.620
I just wanna point out,

49:46.620 --> 49:48.560
Young Gravy is older than Jack Harlow.

49:48.560 --> 49:52.180
So a little bit of mislabeling, more like Old Gravy.

49:52.180 --> 49:55.180
My favorite part of the famous bowl

49:55.180 --> 49:57.740
is the thick and gelatinous layer of Young Gravy.

49:57.740 --> 49:58.580
Exactly.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.580
Sprinkle on top of it.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.540
Let's see if there's anything.

50:04.540 --> 50:08.560
They have a new sharing is caring themed holiday bucket.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.540
Here's the quote.

50:10.540 --> 50:13.140
The holidays in KFC go hand in hand.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.260
There's no better way to satisfy a craving

50:15.260 --> 50:16.860
for comfort and connection

50:16.860 --> 50:18.340
than by sharing a bucket of KFC

50:18.340 --> 50:19.220
with family and friends.

50:19.220 --> 50:20.380
There's no better way.

50:20.380 --> 50:21.220
That's it.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.040
Pinnacle.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.300
Our holiday bucket with free cookies

50:23.300 --> 50:25.740
and $5 famous bowls are two gifts

50:25.740 --> 50:28.260
that are sure to feed the joyful moments

50:28.260 --> 50:29.560
that surrounds this season.

50:30.660 --> 50:32.300
The other thing I wanted to mention to you guys,

50:32.300 --> 50:33.140
as long as I have you here,

50:33.140 --> 50:34.220
if I could borrow a moment,

50:34.220 --> 50:38.420
one more moment of your time is Panera Bakery Shakes.

50:38.420 --> 50:40.580
And I'm gonna hold off on showing you the picture of these

50:40.580 --> 50:42.860
because the picture is really important here

50:42.860 --> 50:45.620
and maybe we'll upload it somewhere, certainly.

50:47.140 --> 50:48.100
Or we won't.

50:48.100 --> 50:51.100
They could see a national rollout in 2023

50:51.100 --> 50:53.500
and the chain began to test them in Texas.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.180
They're leveraging, Panera is leveraging core bakery items

50:56.180 --> 50:58.100
and transforming its existing offerings

50:58.100 --> 51:01.100
to capture younger audiences, drive visitation

51:01.100 --> 51:04.080
and strengthen attachment across day parts.

51:04.080 --> 51:04.920
Yeah, for sure.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.340
Says the robot currently running Panera Bread.

51:07.340 --> 51:09.260
Day parts?

51:09.260 --> 51:11.680
On November 16th, Panera launched a test

51:11.680 --> 51:14.900
in its Texas market of its first bakery shakes.

51:14.900 --> 51:16.560
And then it says in parenthetical,

51:16.560 --> 51:18.460
think frozen blended shakes.

51:18.460 --> 51:19.300
Yeah.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.140
That was.

51:20.140 --> 51:25.140
Yeah, man, like a shake, like a shakery,

51:25.140 --> 51:25.980
be a better name.

51:25.980 --> 51:27.820
Panera may roll out this beverage item nationwide

51:27.820 --> 51:29.500
during the warmer months of 2023.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.060
This new frozen blended beverage platform

51:32.060 --> 51:33.960
is the latest example of Panera expanding

51:33.960 --> 51:35.340
into new menu offerings

51:35.340 --> 51:37.380
after launching grain bowls in 2019

51:37.380 --> 51:39.540
and flatbread pizzas in 2020.

51:39.540 --> 51:41.160
And then I guess taking three years off

51:41.160 --> 51:42.420
to pat themselves on the back

51:42.420 --> 51:44.600
for how good things are going at Panera.

51:44.600 --> 51:47.700
Now, this is the actual reason

51:47.700 --> 51:50.460
I wanted to draw your attention here.

51:50.460 --> 51:51.340
And let me see if I can.

51:51.340 --> 51:52.180
Yeah, here we go.

51:52.180 --> 51:53.220
I'm gonna zoom this in a little bit

51:53.220 --> 51:54.660
so you have a better view.

51:56.140 --> 51:58.380
So, huh.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.700
So look at this for a second, guys.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.180
Oh, it's a bit.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.420
What you see, no, it's not a.

52:04.420 --> 52:05.800
Well, but I mean, it's a bit.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.100
Like when you go, like, you remember that time

52:08.100 --> 52:10.420
we went to Junior's Cheesecake Place in New York

52:10.420 --> 52:15.220
and it was like, this is a New York style milkshake.

52:15.220 --> 52:17.820
And it had, much like the one on the right there,

52:17.820 --> 52:19.740
a whole hunk of cheesecake on top.

52:19.740 --> 52:24.200
But, yeah, but.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.540
So if you're not looking at these right now,

52:26.540 --> 52:28.500
it's a chocolate milkshake,

52:28.500 --> 52:31.060
like a blended cookie milkshake, a strawberry milkshake.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.860
Then stacked on top of the chocolate one

52:32.860 --> 52:36.340
is two brownies with whipped cream.

52:36.340 --> 52:38.420
And then there's another one that's two cookies

52:38.420 --> 52:42.020
with pretzels in between them with whipped cream.

52:42.020 --> 52:44.180
And then there's a third one that's strawberry.

52:44.180 --> 52:45.460
But these are created.

52:45.460 --> 52:46.300
Strawberry and cheesecake.

52:46.300 --> 52:47.420
Strawberry cheesecake.

52:47.420 --> 52:49.900
These are entirely created in Photoshop.

52:49.900 --> 52:51.540
Look at the strawberry one.

52:51.540 --> 52:52.980
There is a strawberry balancing

52:52.980 --> 52:54.980
on top of another strawberry.

52:54.980 --> 52:56.340
They've never done this.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.340
They've never constructed one of these ever.

52:59.340 --> 53:00.180
Now, Justin.

53:00.180 --> 53:01.060
They have not made these.

53:01.060 --> 53:01.900
Never.

53:01.900 --> 53:03.060
This is a joke.

53:03.060 --> 53:04.220
They have not made them.

53:04.220 --> 53:06.180
Is it clear in the press release

53:06.180 --> 53:09.100
whether or not the drinks actually come balanced

53:09.100 --> 53:10.500
with these things on top?

53:10.500 --> 53:12.660
Or is this just a representation?

53:12.660 --> 53:14.620
You know what's so confusing to me, Trav?

53:14.620 --> 53:16.100
If it's a representation,

53:16.100 --> 53:18.420
then this art is like hugely misleading.

53:18.420 --> 53:21.540
I mean, the art is not meant to say like, it's like this.

53:21.540 --> 53:23.820
It's meant to say this will come on top of it.

53:23.820 --> 53:24.660
For sure.

53:24.660 --> 53:27.460
But it is also so clumsy and precarious

53:27.460 --> 53:29.620
that this can't be it.

53:29.620 --> 53:31.460
Also Photoshopped on here,

53:31.460 --> 53:34.180
the Panera Bread labels on the cup.

53:34.180 --> 53:35.020
About to point that out.

53:35.020 --> 53:36.260
You guys didn't have those?

53:36.260 --> 53:37.100
Yeah.

53:37.100 --> 53:38.540
Andy?

53:38.540 --> 53:43.540
I am scared to think of what any of these would look like.

53:45.220 --> 53:47.500
What is going to slide across the counter to me

53:47.500 --> 53:52.500
when I order one of these for me and each of my children is-

53:52.740 --> 53:54.460
So you want me to moosh the cookies right in there?

53:54.460 --> 53:55.300
You want me to moosh?

53:55.300 --> 53:56.140
I know.

53:56.140 --> 53:56.980
Careful.

53:56.980 --> 53:57.820
Here's your drinks.

53:57.820 --> 53:59.220
Oop, all six cookies fell down.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.140
Like, yeah, man.

54:00.140 --> 54:00.980
For sure.

54:00.980 --> 54:02.380
Sometimes when we moosh them in there,

54:02.380 --> 54:05.220
the drink tends to slurp right onto the counter

54:05.220 --> 54:06.660
and the whole drink slurps out.

54:06.660 --> 54:07.940
It's just messy cookies.

54:07.940 --> 54:09.140
And then I got fired.

54:09.140 --> 54:10.860
It's easier this way.

54:10.860 --> 54:12.420
Take the milkshake in this hand

54:12.420 --> 54:13.500
and hold out the other hand.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.420
I'm just going to put the whole slice of cheesecake

54:15.420 --> 54:16.260
right in there, pal.

54:16.260 --> 54:17.660
Have fun.

54:17.660 --> 54:19.460
Squish them together at the table

54:19.460 --> 54:21.620
like you're making a guacamole.

54:21.620 --> 54:23.020
It'll be $13.

54:23.020 --> 54:24.620
Thank you.

54:24.620 --> 54:25.660
This is good though.

54:25.660 --> 54:26.660
Thanks, Panera.

54:26.660 --> 54:28.860
You're always keeping it real.

54:28.860 --> 54:29.700
Keeping it real.

54:31.180 --> 54:32.740
We got time for another question or what's up?

54:32.740 --> 54:33.700
Yeah, let's do it.

54:33.700 --> 54:34.900
All right.

54:34.900 --> 54:37.020
My friend just became a high school theater teacher

54:37.020 --> 54:37.980
and we just went to the place

54:37.980 --> 54:39.140
she directed with her students.

54:39.140 --> 54:39.980
It was good.

54:39.980 --> 54:41.300
And I told her I liked it,

54:41.300 --> 54:43.500
but I feel like she was looking for more feedback,

54:43.500 --> 54:45.420
but I still don't really know what the director does.

54:45.420 --> 54:49.340
Even after she's explained it multiple times.

54:49.340 --> 54:51.140
I know some of it is managing the kids.

54:51.140 --> 54:53.220
So the best compliment I could come up with was

54:53.220 --> 54:54.620
it seems like everyone was doing

54:54.620 --> 54:56.140
what they were supposed to be doing.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.260
Great.

54:57.260 --> 54:59.060
What does a high school play director do

54:59.060 --> 55:01.260
and how do I compliment them?

55:01.260 --> 55:04.980
Okay, so hearing it.

55:04.980 --> 55:07.820
Can I say as somebody who has directed multiple plays

55:07.820 --> 55:11.180
with kids in it, you're not entirely wrong.

55:11.180 --> 55:13.020
You're very close actually.

55:13.020 --> 55:15.300
Have we all directed plays with children in them?

55:15.300 --> 55:16.140
No.

55:16.140 --> 55:17.340
Why would I ever?

55:17.340 --> 55:18.380
Why would I ever?

55:18.380 --> 55:20.500
I forgot Griffin hates the theater.

55:21.980 --> 55:25.100
I would say that there's an equal chance

55:25.100 --> 55:27.820
that they want a compliment, sure.

55:27.820 --> 55:32.780
But also a chance to complain about the entire process

55:32.780 --> 55:33.820
with another adult.

55:33.820 --> 55:35.820
They want a chance to justify the failings

55:35.820 --> 55:36.900
and blame it on the children.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.420
I think you would actually be better served

55:38.420 --> 55:41.020
if you could pick out who was the real stinker of there

55:41.020 --> 55:43.980
and just be like, but can we talk about

55:43.980 --> 55:45.900
newsy number three or whatever?

55:45.900 --> 55:48.340
Cause that kid was fucking phoning it.

55:48.340 --> 55:50.060
Guarantee they'd be like, thank you.

55:50.060 --> 55:51.300
Yes, thank you.

55:51.300 --> 55:53.940
The worst, worst kid.

55:53.940 --> 55:56.460
A bad adult, I will ghost that far.

55:56.460 --> 55:58.420
They will be a bad adult when they get older.

55:58.420 --> 56:00.180
They're the worst.

56:00.180 --> 56:02.420
That I think is like, hey, it seems like everyone was doing

56:02.420 --> 56:03.900
what they're supposed to be doing.

56:03.900 --> 56:06.220
Kids were having fun up there.

56:06.220 --> 56:07.300
The story made sense.

56:07.300 --> 56:10.060
That's a triumph when you have children delivering lines.

56:10.060 --> 56:10.940
All good.

56:10.940 --> 56:15.460
But a chance to be like, did you see her pirouette

56:15.460 --> 56:16.460
in the second act?

56:16.460 --> 56:18.620
That was the best I could get out of her.

56:18.620 --> 56:19.820
I know.

56:19.820 --> 56:22.980
Why would a director be in charge of that?

56:22.980 --> 56:25.060
Because it's a high school production Griffin

56:25.060 --> 56:27.460
and not fucking Broadway.

56:27.460 --> 56:29.700
You don't think they have a choreographer?

56:29.700 --> 56:31.980
Well, it might end up being like our high school productions

56:31.980 --> 56:33.860
where there was like five different adults

56:33.860 --> 56:36.500
all claiming to be equal parts in charge.

56:36.500 --> 56:40.660
Which made for some real solid continuity

56:40.660 --> 56:41.940
to the entire show.

56:41.940 --> 56:45.740
Man, every children's theater show we ever did

56:45.740 --> 56:49.700
felt pretty strict in terms of you can't just make shit up

56:49.700 --> 56:52.260
and change the play whenever you want.

56:52.260 --> 56:54.900
But all the high school shows we did were like,

56:54.900 --> 56:57.220
have fucking fun, man.

56:57.220 --> 56:58.740
I was just thinking about the other day,

56:58.740 --> 57:03.740
our high school put on a production of Great Expectations

57:03.820 --> 57:07.300
and the director, who I will not name,

57:07.300 --> 57:11.380
the director of the show thought it would be a badass idea

57:11.380 --> 57:13.620
if the main character of Great Expectations

57:13.620 --> 57:16.700
after the show ends, and I think there's like a fire

57:16.700 --> 57:20.260
and maybe the old lady dies, Miss Havisham, I don't know,

57:20.260 --> 57:21.860
but thought it'd be badass

57:21.860 --> 57:24.020
if before the main character walked off the stage,

57:24.020 --> 57:25.420
before curtains drew,

57:25.420 --> 57:30.420
looked at the audience and went, great expectations.

57:32.580 --> 57:36.020
Just like toss that shit right there on the end.

57:36.020 --> 57:39.100
In that way, great expectations.

57:39.100 --> 57:41.860
Just like they do it in the book, though.

57:41.860 --> 57:43.100
Have you read the book?

57:43.100 --> 57:46.700
Well, because at first, the expectations, they're great.

57:46.700 --> 57:48.820
And your expectations, they go down.

57:48.820 --> 57:51.740
Realize in the middle of saying the title of the play

57:51.740 --> 57:55.660
that you are now sad because of the events that unfolded.

57:55.660 --> 57:56.900
That's a kick-ass note.

57:56.900 --> 57:58.180
Thanks, director.

57:58.180 --> 57:59.380
And that's double cool

57:59.380 --> 58:03.780
because that director had that idea and then stuck to it.

58:03.780 --> 58:05.980
And it's like, they heard the kid say it that way

58:05.980 --> 58:08.940
and went, yes, control S, save.

58:08.940 --> 58:11.540
To his credit, that the guy who was playing that role

58:11.540 --> 58:13.780
didn't deliver that, did deliver the line

58:13.780 --> 58:17.020
more in a mumbly way and every night got the same note

58:17.020 --> 58:18.780
of like, hey, you're doing great

58:18.780 --> 58:21.220
and it's a heavy load that you carry up there,

58:21.220 --> 58:22.620
but do remember at the end,

58:22.620 --> 58:24.500
that light is supposed to be delivered.

58:24.500 --> 58:27.780
Great expectations.

58:27.780 --> 58:30.220
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

58:30.220 --> 58:31.060

58:32.540 --> 58:34.100

58:34.100 --> 58:36.020

It felt right.

will be required.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.740
Did I already say that?

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:08.260
I don't remember, but now I've done and said it twice,

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.580
if so.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.220
Thanks to Montaigne for the Use of Our Theme Song.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.860
My life is better with you.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.980
It's a jammer and a slammer,

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:19.700
and you should get the album making it

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.660

It is a lot of stuff.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.540
I think, who is it gonna be this time?

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.060
We gotta come up with something.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.260
Yeah, I think Justin,

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.540
I feel like Justin has something important

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.860
to say to the audience.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:48.980
It felt like it.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.500
That was mine.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.780
We gotta come up with something?

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.740
Gotta come up with something.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:57.460
Is that a sort of general, like for everyone?

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.100
Just everybody like, we gotta come up with something.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.180
So just like a general blue sky opportunity for humanity

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.020
to come up with something.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.700
We gotta come up with something.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.540
Yeah.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.360
What does that mean to you?

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.340
That's the power of it, right?

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.700
It can mean anything.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.260
No, it means probably one of two things.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.040
I don't think there's that many interpretations

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.140
of what you just said.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.180
Yeah, okay.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.260
Agree to disagree.

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.580
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.860
My name is Travis McElroy.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.580
My name is Griffin McElroy.

This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me,

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.700
and we gotta come up with something.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.140
Hey, get your dad's gargoyles.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:49.140
It's better with you.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.140
Is it true?

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.140
It's better.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.140
It's better with you.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.140
