00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:46.880 --> 00:53.920
A wonderful Candle Nights countdown is on to Candle Nights. We've got just ten more

00:54.480 --> 01:02.080
Candle Nights days till Candle Nights. A lot of people seem to be asking when it starts

01:02.640 --> 01:06.880
and when it stops. There are obviously more than one day involved in Candle Nights. Can you guys

01:06.880 --> 01:11.280
offer any insight? By the way, this is my brother, my brother-in-law, I'm Justin, that's Travis and

01:11.280 --> 01:18.400
Griffin. Hi! I think that the beauty of Candle Nights is that it starts when you feel like it,

01:18.400 --> 01:23.680
and it ends when you don't feel like it anymore. The way that I track Candle Nights, and it's an

01:23.680 --> 01:29.440
elusive beast, is with my handy Candle Nights Advent Calendar, which oh, I need to actually

01:29.440 --> 01:35.280
pop open the current day on. Let me give it just, sorry, one sec. It's another condom.

01:35.280 --> 01:44.160
Oh man. This is like the 22nd one. This is Candle Nights, this is on our Candle Nights show,

01:44.160 --> 01:48.240
we'll be recording that live in Huntington, West Virginia. You can tell the difference. December

01:48.240 --> 01:53.760
21st. You can tell the difference because we're not fucking cussing this one. It's one week away,

01:53.760 --> 01:58.640
less than six days now. By the time you're listening to this, if you want to come out,

01:58.640 --> 02:03.120
come down to Huntington. There's some tickets left. Go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights live.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.880
Come on out. It's going to be a real special time. Everybody's going to be there. Literally

02:06.880 --> 02:13.920
everybody. O.J. Simpson. O.J. Simpson? That was the first one. That was the first name. Yeah, but

02:14.800 --> 02:21.360
O.J. Simpson too. What's wrong with me? That was like my poll. You're broken inside. I think I

02:21.360 --> 02:25.600
might be broken. O.J. Simpson's going to be there. Kato Katelyn's going to be there.

02:25.600 --> 02:37.040
All the hits. All the great folks are going to be there. Orenthal, James Simpson. He's O.J.

02:37.760 --> 02:44.240
also. He's also O.J. Simpson. And the Simpsons. We're going to have people dressed as the Simpsons.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.000
And J.O. Simpson. I hate that dude. He's my least favorite of the Simpsons.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.760
He's worse than the double murderer. Wow. Not a cool dude. You can at least be in the same room

02:57.760 --> 03:03.520
as the double murderer. You know what I mean? With J.O. Simpson, there's a lot of detritus.

03:04.800 --> 03:11.520
This is our advice podcast. This has been such a thrilling week. Before we get too much further,

03:11.520 --> 03:21.360
I want to thank everybody who... We had a sort of an impromptu charity drive called NBNB AM Angels,

03:21.360 --> 03:28.720
where we tried to fill a bunch of empty stockings from the Herald Dispatch. They

03:28.720 --> 03:35.440
published the thing called empty stockings. And we got it in our heads that maybe we could help

03:35.440 --> 03:44.720
some of those folks. And You Find people really rose to that call. There were 101

03:46.160 --> 03:57.520
people on the list. And at this point, 93% of them have had their needs met by You Find folks.

03:58.080 --> 04:03.280
So thank you so much to everybody who participated in that. You're awesome.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.160
I don't understand people who make... Because here in Austin, everybody makes a career out of working

04:08.160 --> 04:14.880
at a nonprofit. But as far as I can tell, it really just takes eight minutes to change the

04:14.880 --> 04:21.200
lives of an entire city. So what the hell are you guys doing with the other... Stop wasting your time

04:21.200 --> 04:26.320
and just fix these problems. Just fix them. It takes eight minutes. Just fix all the cities.

04:26.320 --> 04:31.040
The MBM family did. They looked at this issue and they're like, let's fix this together.

04:31.040 --> 04:36.240
Next year, we're going worldwide. Huntington's great, but we're gonna see if we can't shine...

04:36.240 --> 04:39.520
No, I wanna make Huntington even better. I wanna really...

04:39.520 --> 04:45.120
Next year, we're gonna get all the MBM Angels together to fix the roads in Huntington.

04:45.760 --> 04:51.360
Next year, just come out with a shovel. That's the new thing. But anyway, thank you to all of

04:51.360 --> 04:57.200
you folks. We're gonna record some thank yous after we're done recording here. And if you don't

04:57.200 --> 05:03.680
get yours in a week or so, you probably didn't email us. So email us at mbm at maximumfund.org.

05:03.680 --> 05:08.640
And we'll fix you up. And sit around for... After halftime of this episode,

05:08.640 --> 05:13.200
we have a very special guest. Oh, man. Do you wanna say who it is?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.640
They probably figured it out, because it was in the show notes.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.440
Oh, yeah. If not, it's Bill Corbett. He is a wonder.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.480
He was really funny, too. Yeah, he was funny. Anyway, that's a big show we got coming for you.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.880
But first, we're gonna do some of our classic stuff.

05:31.520 --> 05:36.800
Real patented MBMBA and goofs. Get ready for some classic material,

05:37.360 --> 05:41.120
because we're gonna take your questions and turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom. Here we go.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.280
I recently visited a friend of mine who just bought his first house.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.360
I know Justin and Griffin are homeowners and Travis moved to LA, but I don't know if he rents.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.280
I do. It's none of your damn business.

05:51.280 --> 05:56.000
How different is home ownership from renting an apartment? Is it worth it? And what should

05:56.000 --> 06:02.240
I know beforehand? That's Jeremy in the Seventh Circle of Dwell, which is pretty good.

06:04.480 --> 06:10.880
I've never been a homeowner, so I cannot speak to this. I can speak to the renter side of it.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.280
I enjoy renting immensely. Okay.

06:16.480 --> 06:24.400
But see, we can smoke all fucking day long in our house. We can just rip open a carton of marbles

06:24.400 --> 06:30.800
and just crush the whole box in one day and be like, fuck it. The windows are yellow,

06:30.800 --> 06:34.240
and it stinks in here. It smells like an Elk's Lodge.

06:34.240 --> 06:39.600
Griffin, have you ever thought of just tearing open both ends of the carton and just lighting

06:39.600 --> 06:43.280
all of them at once and smoking a giant harmonica?

06:43.280 --> 06:46.000
Well, I don't do that, no, but I will just rip it,

06:46.560 --> 06:50.400
ignite it, and then just have a grandma potpourri. You know what I mean?

06:50.400 --> 06:59.760
Mm-hmm. It's really the final level of adulthood, and you may think that you are ready for it when

06:59.760 --> 07:06.160
you actually buy a house. You are not ready for it, because it's still very bizarre to me that

07:06.160 --> 07:12.160
there are whole areas in my house, if I open a door to them and I look at them, I don't know

07:12.160 --> 07:18.160
what they do. I don't even know what they are or why they are. I had a thing-

07:18.160 --> 07:22.320
Do you live in the Winchester house? What are you talking about? You open a door to a closet,

07:22.320 --> 07:23.520
you're like, what is this?

07:23.520 --> 07:27.760
No, I'm talking, okay, I'll give you an example. A couple of weeks ago, I went down to turn the

07:27.760 --> 07:31.680
furnace on for the first time. I guess it would have been a month or so ago now. I go down and

07:31.680 --> 07:37.680
turn the furnace on for the first time, and I see this thing called a humidifier that's sort of built

07:37.680 --> 07:44.480
into the system there, that as far as I know, I've never used. And I was like, whoa, I could be

07:44.480 --> 07:48.720
having more humid air this whole time, but I didn't really know how it works, so I kind of

07:48.720 --> 07:56.160
turned some things and opened a valve and did all that kind of business, and I was like, hmm, okay,

07:56.160 --> 08:03.280
humidity, oh boy. I go down three days later, my basement carpet is fucking soaked, like literally

08:03.280 --> 08:08.400
standing water in my basement carpet, water everywhere, because this thing just, apparently

08:08.400 --> 08:14.480
it's like humidifying jam, it's just spitting water randomly, and so I ruined my house. So you

08:14.480 --> 08:18.720
just boarded up the basement and you called that one a loss? Yeah, I don't have that room anymore.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.240
It really is a weird- It's like we're in an island.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.440
It really is weird, like, how many times have you been in your attic, Justin?

08:27.520 --> 08:31.200
Twice a year, once to get the Christmas lights out and once to put them back.

08:31.200 --> 08:38.160
Okay, I've been in our attic twice, once when we, like right when we moved in, and then again when

08:38.160 --> 08:42.480
our HVAC unit up there stopped working, and that was after that we had roofers come and replace

08:42.480 --> 08:46.640
every single shingle on our roof a month after we moved in. Home ownership fucking rules, you guys.

08:47.520 --> 08:55.600
And I realized that in nailing those new shingles in, they had turned our attic into a fucking

08:55.600 --> 09:03.200
hellraiser pain box, because there are infinity nails coming through the ceiling. It's like a

09:03.200 --> 09:08.160
goddamn Iron Maiden up there. So no, I don't think I will ever be going into that room again, thanks.

09:08.160 --> 09:14.240
What on earth were you planning to do about your broken HVAC unit when you went up there?

09:17.040 --> 09:21.920
Did you think there would be a switch that said broken and you would just flip it to fixed?

09:21.920 --> 09:25.280
Like, is that what you were hoping for? He was gonna reason with it.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.800
I went up there, I was using my phone's flashlight, and I had a fucking

09:28.800 --> 09:34.800
hex wrench from an IKEA cabinet I had bought. Were you ready to do battle with it?

09:34.800 --> 09:39.040
I was seeing what I could do up just surveying the, you know what?

09:39.600 --> 09:43.680
Yeah, honey, I tightened a couple of hex bolts and it started working again. Apparently just all

09:43.680 --> 09:47.360
the hex bolts were loose. You're laughing? I used that fucking hex wrench to fix our

09:47.360 --> 09:53.680
garbage disposal. So you don't know anything about shit, do you? It is the universal nano tool.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.480
So what does this person need to know before they get a house?

10:00.880 --> 10:06.160
Please realize, like, you don't know. Be prepared to be reverted to baby state,

10:06.160 --> 10:12.080
especially with buying a house. That process is inscrutable. I still don't know if I bought this

10:12.080 --> 10:15.680
house. No one's gotten rid of me yet. Our realtor would just come to us like,

10:15.680 --> 10:21.520
hey, I need $300 for the... And I'd be like, yep, here you go. Take it. It's yours now.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.680
I never had that money, I guess. Were you buying the house from the ancient ones?

10:25.680 --> 10:32.560
Yeah, it was a deep tongue. I got a really great deal on this house,

10:32.560 --> 10:37.120
but except for that the walls are full of rats. Yeah, and the seeping floors.

10:38.240 --> 10:44.000
Well, that's Justin's. Oh yeah, I would say from my money, I'm so happy being a renter.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
Teresa and I have often considered home ownership, but I don't know. I think what's always scared

10:50.000 --> 10:53.600
me most about it is the permanence. And I know you can always sell your house,

10:53.600 --> 10:55.840
but in this market, it seems like such a permanent decision.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.360
Oh, this market. The problem with renting is that you're just putting your money into a shitter,

10:59.360 --> 11:03.040
and you're shitting on it, and then you're flushing it. It's insult to injury.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.600
How were you paying your rent? Huh?

11:05.600 --> 11:09.360
Is that how you were paying your rent? I pay it to my landlord, Mr. Toilet.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.680
Yeah, it's an investment, Travis, in yourself and your family.

11:17.680 --> 11:23.520
Yeah, now I live in Los Angeles, where it costs $2 million to get the smallest home ever.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.600
Right, but you get that, and then next year's worth $3 million. You just need that initial

11:27.600 --> 11:31.200
investment. And if you need help with money, Travis, I've always told you this, you can come

11:31.200 --> 11:33.040
to me. You'll give me $2 million?

11:33.600 --> 11:36.720
I will give you, I could probably break you off a couple Gs.

11:36.720 --> 11:41.520
Okay. But that's, you know what? You put that in a jar. You guys want a Yahoo?

11:42.080 --> 11:45.680
Absolutely. This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

11:45.680 --> 11:51.040
Rachel Sperling, recognize that game. Take your game, take a minute, and recognize it.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.520
Thank you, Rachel. Ladies, get to know your game.

11:54.160 --> 12:01.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Mahalkita, Mahalkita, I think that's a Pokemon, who asks,

12:02.400 --> 12:06.720
should men start wearing cock pieces as a fashion accessory again?

12:07.360 --> 12:10.960
I think you've missed it. I think you missed the word a little bit.

12:10.960 --> 12:17.360
A little bit. You were off by a little bit. Additional details, would you wear one?

12:17.360 --> 12:18.720
A cock piece?

12:18.720 --> 12:19.360
A cock piece?

12:19.360 --> 12:21.440
Should men start wearing dick flaps again?

12:22.080 --> 12:22.720
No.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.640
No, you shouldn't. But should we?

12:24.640 --> 12:30.560
I will say this, having worked at the Shakespeare Company, like, every time, there's something

12:30.560 --> 12:36.640
about it that when you wear one of those, you tend to strut. Like, it's hard not to just leave.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.880
Wow, that's because your gait has an extra flap there that you didn't plan for when you woke up

12:40.880 --> 12:41.520
that morning.

12:41.520 --> 12:46.080
You do have to have very wide thighs, or else you will chafe on your codpiece.

12:47.680 --> 12:54.480
One of my favorite examples, Jeremy Dubin, every time we had a student matinee in a show that had

12:54.480 --> 12:59.920
codpieces, he would have to get up first thing, just go out and give everyone a solid minute and

12:59.920 --> 13:04.880
a half to laugh and just get it out of their systems so then they could enjoy the show.

13:04.880 --> 13:11.440
But he had, I don't want to put him on blast on our incredibly popular radio broadcast,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.960
but he had, let's call it, an abnormal cod.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.920
Yeah, and the things he could do with it, it was like puppetry of the penis.

13:19.920 --> 13:24.880
Did you guys know that cod is actually Middle English for scrotum? It's not a joke,

13:24.880 --> 13:25.600
that's a real thing.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.000
Wow, learned something new today.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.120
Something really useful.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.840
So when you call someone a codfish, like Peter Pan does, you're calling them a scrotum fish.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.040
Basically, yeah.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.400
Oh, Peter Pan.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.440
Peter Pan, how could you?

13:38.720 --> 13:48.400
Can we bring this, listen, the new school of thought for manliness, which is such garbage

13:48.400 --> 14:00.000
bullshit, with fucking fashion axes, everything is so terrible and so dumb, I could see, listen,

14:00.000 --> 14:06.720
if you really want to accentuate your masculinity, put this little parachute over your dick.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.320
I could totally see that becoming an actual thing.

14:10.320 --> 14:15.440
And if you think about our current dress, am I gonna have a codpiece on my jeans?

14:15.440 --> 14:19.120
On my jean shorts? Oh, fuck, that's a look right there.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.480
Yeah, that's a lot of look.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.640
I sewed a codpiece on my utilikilt.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.320
That wouldn't even work because then it would become pants again.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.000
I accidentally turned my utilikilt into pants.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.640
Into pants with a weird dick part on it.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.360
I feel bad.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.440
What is a codpiece?

14:37.440 --> 14:39.280
Oh, Justin, we've been doing the whole bit.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.400
You should have asked us.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.240
We've been doing this for two and a half minutes.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.440
You were too embarrassed.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.800
I was hoping that through your context clues, I could weave a picture.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.360
It kind of looks like a canoe of fabric that you put over your junk.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.280
Men used to wear hose, right, hosiery.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.240
Yeah.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.560
But it didn't really do a great job in that zone.

15:01.760 --> 15:06.480
And so, like, when dudes started to, like, when they would sit...

15:06.480 --> 15:07.120
I'm reading a...

15:08.000 --> 15:10.720
This is from Art of Manliness, which, like, great.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.360
I love that I've given this website my business.

15:15.200 --> 15:22.640
When dudes would sit down with these hos, their tunic would ride up.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.360
And it's like, hey, ho, my cod is out, is what they would say.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.320
Oh, goodness, my...

15:28.320 --> 15:29.520
Oh, goodness, my cod.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.200
Huzzah, my dick.

15:31.200 --> 15:31.700
Huzzah.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.600
Behold, my cod.

15:37.280 --> 15:42.240
And so they began to cover up their cod with a little dick tunic.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.360
And it was just a little piece of linen that just sort of wraps around it like a little...

15:48.640 --> 15:49.280
A pup tent.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.640
Okay.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.640
Can I just jump back real quick to say that if on the website, the Art of Manliness,

15:54.640 --> 15:58.640
like, if it doesn't just say, like, I don't know, be like a person,

15:58.640 --> 16:02.240
just do whatever you want, then that website is dumb.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.760
Man, my Art of Manliness, you know, my secret to the Art of Manliness,

16:09.760 --> 16:13.200
you just flex when people aren't expecting you to.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.240
Now, Jaisalyn, could you name a situation in which you would flex,

16:18.240 --> 16:23.520
in which people were not expecting you to, and suddenly it would be very positively all about you?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.080
DMV.

16:24.640 --> 16:24.960
Okay.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.440
Why the DMV?

16:27.440 --> 16:30.320
Because people walk past you, like, that dude is stacked.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.760
That dude's ripped for days.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.680
That dude is manly as hell.

16:33.680 --> 16:34.960
And look at that cod piece.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.400
Oh, there's a...

16:36.400 --> 16:37.600
He's selling it.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.960
There's a picture on this article.

16:40.640 --> 16:44.960
There's a picture on this article from Batman and Robin.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.520
No, okay.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.880
Do you think that it's like, you know how when people get really flashy,

16:50.880 --> 16:53.840
like sports cars and everyone's like, oh, compensating for something.

16:53.840 --> 16:58.240
Do you think, like, the baller move with a cod piece is to get, like, just...

16:58.240 --> 16:59.440
A really little one?

16:59.440 --> 17:01.760
Yeah, the smallest cod piece, like, I don't even care.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.120
I don't fucking care, whatever.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.800
Yeah, this is my tiny dick.

17:04.800 --> 17:11.040
One that is so small that you actually have to tuck your actual physical material zone.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.800
It's a false flag zone.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.240
Your corporeal zone.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.440
Right, and then someone comes up and stabs you in it, and you're like, nothing.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.400
You did nothing.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.560
Better luck next time.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.080
Where did his dick go?

17:26.080 --> 17:26.880
You'll never know.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.240
Smooth like a Ken doll down there.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.960
Check my butt, and then you look at the butt.

17:32.960 --> 17:33.600
What is that?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.360
It's a rear cod piece.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.480
You fool.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.400
You've fallen for my false flag.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.240
I've got cod pieces for days.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.360
My false flag cod.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.320
I'm gonna stab that one.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.240
Right armpit.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.480
Holy shit.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.760
He's cod's toe to tip.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.400
This guy's all cods.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.680
It's like a house of mirrors.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.680
You just keep shattering them, and there's more.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.720
It's like a house of lies with Kevin Spacey's cod piece.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.120
House of lies is not the name of this.

18:01.120 --> 18:01.840
I think it is.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.960
I think that's the Don Cheadle show.

18:04.960 --> 18:05.360
Damn it.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.200
Man, I could have made a reference to Don Cheadle's cod piece, and it would have been great.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.360
You could have made so many references.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.040
I could have made all the references.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.320
Another question, hit it.

18:15.040 --> 18:20.640
A coworker of mine recently started sporting a single black glove on her left hand every day.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.120
Is there a polite way for me to find out why?

18:23.120 --> 18:26.800
Fashion statement, medical issue, aspiring magician?

18:26.800 --> 18:27.840
I need to know.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.440
Initial details.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.320
It looks like a one size fits all cotton glove.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.720
No embellishments or markings.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.800
As from ANSI in Austin.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.600
Can I tell you what this coworker is doing right?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.640
Create an air of mystery.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.760
Yeah, for sure.

18:43.760 --> 18:48.240
Is it possible that somewhere under that glove is a cod?

18:49.120 --> 18:49.680
Possibly.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.360
For days.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.160
For days.

18:53.680 --> 18:58.240
I love this idea because if it was flashy and showy, if it was like a sequined glove

18:58.240 --> 19:01.200
or like covered in rhinestones or shit, like you wouldn't be that in,

19:01.200 --> 19:04.560
but there's something about just the plainness, the unadornment.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.320
Like you're not trying to draw attention to it.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.880
You're like, I have to know why are they doing it?

19:08.880 --> 19:12.720
Because it's clearly not to draw attention and yet it is drawing attention to me.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.320
Take a lesson, everyone.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.080
This is how you do it.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.000
This is how you affect something.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.240
This is a real like gateway to becoming fully a mysterious person.

19:27.200 --> 19:33.600
And some people have already gone so far down this road that a glove wouldn't raise an eye.

19:33.600 --> 19:38.880
If you saw Prince walking around LA, perhaps shopping in a candle store,

19:38.880 --> 19:42.160
and you saw that he was wearing a black glove on one hand,

19:42.160 --> 19:44.640
you would not give it a second thought.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.320
You would think, oh, it's Prince.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.800
But there's another dude who could also just start wearing a codpiece

19:48.800 --> 19:50.400
and no one would be surprised.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.280
Well, yeah, he could start wearing a codpiece and probably-

19:53.280 --> 19:56.400
Start wearing a codpiece?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.200
I mean, you gotta ask, right?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.560
That's why they're wearing it.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.600
Well, there's two situations.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.600
They're either wearing it because they want you to ask

20:05.600 --> 20:09.600
or because they explicitly don't want you to ask.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.360
Are they trying to hide the fact they have six fingers?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.960
Can I just say, like, wouldn't it be crazy if this person was like,

20:14.960 --> 20:18.080
oh, I got engaged last night, so I'm going to wear this glove

20:18.080 --> 20:20.320
and then someone's going to ask and it's going to be a big reveal.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.040
And this has been going on for three weeks and no one's asked.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.080
Someone please just ask, my pinky smells terrible.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.840
Please just ask me so I can do the review.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.360
Why is everyone so afraid of asking?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.640
I feel like you have to ask now or it may already be too late

20:32.640 --> 20:33.920
because if you wait too much longer,

20:33.920 --> 20:35.840
you're just going to walk up and go, what's with the glove?

20:35.840 --> 20:36.960
What's with the glove?

20:36.960 --> 20:38.640
Because you've held it back for too long.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.280
They're dying for you to ask.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.720
Oh, they want you to ask so bad.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.920
Just ask them.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.080
Just ask this one question about the glove.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.240
What if they've been waiting this whole time to ask

20:48.240 --> 20:50.720
and on the, like, the palm of the glove is written,

20:50.720 --> 20:52.480
talk to the hand and they're just waiting.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.280
Oh shit, like what?

20:55.280 --> 20:56.480
It's a great bit.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.360
It's a power play.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.120
It's a long, it's a long game.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.120
Is it a power glove, perhaps?

21:01.120 --> 21:02.480
Is it maybe a power glove?

21:02.480 --> 21:05.520
Are they going to maybe play some rad racer after work?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.200
Or catch ball.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.400
That was an NES game, I think.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.000
I think it was called catch ball.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.960
Catch ball.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.480
How about another Yahoo?

21:14.480 --> 21:18.000
Man, what if black glove is like a thing that's like worldwide

21:18.000 --> 21:21.920
and we don't know it because we're just like not keyed into.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.160
Like it's a red hat kind of thing?

21:24.160 --> 21:26.640
No, I don't think it's red hat kind of thing.

21:26.640 --> 21:30.000
I'm saying like it's a legit protest about issues.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.560
Oh.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.280
Oh.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.000
Not an LA lady social group.

21:34.000 --> 21:34.800
Probably not.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.240
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

21:36.240 --> 21:37.120
Please.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.840
This Yahoo was sent in by several people,

21:39.840 --> 21:43.200
including Anthony Delacurty and Sean Moran.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.480
Thank you, everyone.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user whatever.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.520
Who has the most Yahoo points I've fucking ever seen.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.160
78,053 Yahoo points.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.680
Fucking get out the game.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.040
Retire, you're done.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.480
And the highest one goes to whatever.

21:59.600 --> 22:03.280
Whatever asks, what would happen to our world

22:03.280 --> 22:06.080
if all of a sudden potato chips stop being made?

22:07.440 --> 22:07.760
Whoa.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.000
I'm saying that this is going to lead to a complete and total

22:13.200 --> 22:13.840
shutdown.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.080
Just a decimation of our society.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.640
Sometimes you just need that crunch.

22:19.200 --> 22:23.600
And no corn products, no rice products are gonna fill the bill.

22:23.600 --> 22:27.120
I mean, the fact of the matter is, as soon as one thing goes away,

22:27.120 --> 22:28.800
even if you're like, there's still pretzels,

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
but as soon as you tell everyone like,

22:30.800 --> 22:33.920
everything else still fine, still plenty of everything else,

22:33.920 --> 22:35.360
but there's no more potato chips,

22:35.360 --> 22:40.400
everyone then is going to instantly want potato chips so badly.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.480
You're disrupting the ecosystem, right?

22:42.480 --> 22:46.240
Like we have to eat potato chips.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.120
Humans do.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.680
Because the potato chips eat the M&Ms.

22:49.680 --> 22:49.920
Right.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.800
And if there's no more potato chips, first of all,

22:52.800 --> 22:55.840
M&M of our population is going to kill us all.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.560
But that won't matter because we're all going to die anyway

22:58.560 --> 23:01.680
because our main food source is now gone.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.880
You know what that means?

23:02.880 --> 23:06.720
That the leopard seal is gone because we're fucking dead.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.720
And they eat us.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.840
They have to eat us.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.080
Yeah.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.120
Because of that, they also eat penguins.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.040
Penguins are going to be all over the place.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.320
Going to be penguins and M&Ms.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.160
It's going to be the best apocalypse ever,

23:18.160 --> 23:19.840
but we're not going to be around to enjoy it.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.240
Because we ran out of potato chips.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.840
Because we ran out of crisps?

23:25.840 --> 23:27.600
We don't have any more vitamin Pringles.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.880
Now, here's a question that I would have for you.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.200
If potato chips in this world-

23:33.200 --> 23:33.440
Crisps?

23:33.440 --> 23:37.200
If potato chips aren't crisps, sorry, are no longer made,

23:37.200 --> 23:39.680
are we to assume that french fries are still extant?

23:39.680 --> 23:40.800
And if so-

23:40.800 --> 23:41.440
Ooh.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.080
Aren't people like smashing them with a hammer

23:44.080 --> 23:46.320
and then putting them in a fryer later and just-

23:46.320 --> 23:47.440
They do that.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.120
This is such a good question, Justin.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.520
Is it that we've suddenly forgotten the existence

23:51.520 --> 23:53.440
of like how to make potato chips,

23:53.440 --> 23:55.680
or is it like they've all been beamed off the surface

23:55.680 --> 23:56.000
of the planet?

23:56.000 --> 23:56.400
No.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.560
Because if we fucking forgot how to make potato chips,

23:58.560 --> 24:01.920
somebody would fucking figure it out in like half of a second.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.240
Like, ah, these french fries are too thick.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.360
I gotta fry these things.

24:06.880 --> 24:07.600
But that's the question.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.440
Are we talking like they're no longer being made

24:09.440 --> 24:10.880
or they no longer exist?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.960
Oh, you're talking about in this situation

24:12.960 --> 24:14.400
where you stomp down some french fries,

24:14.400 --> 24:15.120
throw them in a fryer,

24:15.120 --> 24:17.360
you pull up the fryer basket and it's empty.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.160
It's empty.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.040
Where did they go?

24:19.040 --> 24:22.160
The Happening 2, starring nobody.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.280
Nobody agreed to do it.

24:24.480 --> 24:24.960
What is it?

24:25.760 --> 24:26.480
No actors.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.760
Just no chips?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.600
No, I have to turn this one-

24:29.600 --> 24:31.120
I have to turn this one down.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.040
Did you guys hear about the Sony leak

24:33.040 --> 24:35.680
where they were thinking about making The Happening 2

24:35.680 --> 24:38.880
where we did all the potato chips?

24:38.880 --> 24:40.960
Nicolas Cage was like, this is-

24:44.400 --> 24:46.000
Sorry, this is my first time saying the word.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.520
The word, no.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.160
I'm gonna Morse code tap it out of the table.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.480
Potato, just, I love potato chips,

24:52.480 --> 24:54.960
but this is just too, this is a bridge too far.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.160
I probably said I'm too busy doing Drive Angry shot in 4D.

24:58.160 --> 24:58.880
So-

24:58.880 --> 24:59.920
Where you can smell it.

24:59.920 --> 25:00.800
You can smell it.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.320
And we have potato chips in the picture,

25:02.320 --> 25:04.160
so I'm gonna do that.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.360
I signed a non-compete.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.000
It's produced by Lays.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.880
How fast would technology evolve

25:12.880 --> 25:16.080
if the potato chip didn't exist?

25:16.080 --> 25:16.960
How fast-

25:16.960 --> 25:18.400
Because we have so much time in our hands

25:18.400 --> 25:20.000
because we're not just fucking chomping?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Well, we've been dropping stuff constantly

25:22.000 --> 25:23.360
because of the grease and the salt,

25:23.360 --> 25:25.360
and now we can actually hold our Bunsen burners

25:25.360 --> 25:26.240
and beakers and such.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.480
Science accoutrement.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.640
My fingers are delightfully non-bloated.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.000
Let me type out some code.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.760
Oh, world hunger's gone,

25:33.760 --> 25:35.440
which is weird because there's no chips.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.800
So like, what's the point?

25:36.800 --> 25:39.600
But I guess if you want to eat shitty garbage-

25:40.240 --> 25:42.160
Would taro chips still exist?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.080
Would you still be able to eat taro chips

25:44.080 --> 25:44.720
and like-

25:44.720 --> 25:46.880
No, Justin, that's how you tell the future.

25:46.880 --> 25:47.600
It's stupid.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.320
Okay, what about this?

25:50.320 --> 25:53.120
Would Tato skins, the potato chip-

25:53.120 --> 25:54.000
Those would survive.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.840
From potato skins, would that still exist?

25:57.840 --> 26:00.640
Those would survive and let's just say,

26:01.200 --> 26:03.120
invest in Tato skin stock right now.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.240
What about Pringles?

26:04.240 --> 26:06.480
It's just like compressed potato flakes.

26:06.480 --> 26:06.960
Come on.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.000
Yeah, actually, legally speaking,

26:10.000 --> 26:11.840
they can't call those potato chips.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.280
They have to call them crisps

26:13.280 --> 26:16.560
because of Big Potato made it so they had to do that.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.080
So they would probably survive and uptick.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.720
Melissa Pringle, heiress to the Pringles empire,

26:22.720 --> 26:25.440
is actually doing 25 to life in jail

26:25.440 --> 26:28.480
because she just wouldn't stop calling them chips.

26:29.200 --> 26:29.600
That doesn't-

26:29.600 --> 26:30.320
Then they got her.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.360
They found her in a spider hole.

26:31.360 --> 26:31.920
They fucking got her.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.160
It was a sting operation.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.440
Recently, a good friend has rapidly become my best friend.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.400
He's like a brother to me now and vice versa.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.200
As such, I've gotten him a book and a t-shirt for Christmas.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.480
Nothing extravagant.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.880
Do I need to give him advance notice

26:46.880 --> 26:48.240
that I had gotten him something?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.080
I don't want him to feel bad if I give him a gift

26:50.080 --> 26:51.520
and he has nothing to give me.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.160
Of course, getting presents is always fun,

26:54.160 --> 26:56.400
but this really does come from a place

26:56.400 --> 26:59.440
of wanting to avoid awkwardness and not greed.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.520
Brothers, how can I give my friend a gift

27:01.520 --> 27:03.040
without making him feel shitty?

27:03.040 --> 27:04.880
That's from Altruistically at Sea.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.440
You gotta tell him.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.360
Yeah.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.320
Okay, but how?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.440
Hey, no big deal.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.560
I just want to let you know that I got you a couple of things.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.600
They're not super expensive,

27:17.600 --> 27:19.200
but I just wanted to give you the heads up.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.040
For me, where my anxiety tends to rear its ugly head

27:25.040 --> 27:26.640
is in situations like this

27:26.640 --> 27:30.000
where something that seemed like such a normal good idea,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.880
but then I'm confronted with having to voice it out loud

27:32.880 --> 27:33.760
to someone.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.080
I guess the fear for me would be saying like,

27:36.080 --> 27:38.640
hey dude, just no big deal, I got you a Christmas present.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.240
And then their response being, why?

27:41.680 --> 27:43.920
No, that's not, you're not gonna do that.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.320
The best feeling in the holiday season

27:46.320 --> 27:47.680
is getting somebody a good gift.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.840
The worst feeling is receiving a gift

27:49.840 --> 27:53.360
and not having that feeling of getting them a gift.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.160
So don't do that.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.400
Once you reach a certain age,

27:56.400 --> 27:57.840
you gotta start thinking like that.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.160
The gift you are giving them is the feeling of satisfaction

28:00.160 --> 28:02.240
and giving you a stellar Christmas present.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.560
We have emergency gifts on hand.

28:04.560 --> 28:08.720
Just try that, have like a nice bottle of vino wrapped up

28:08.720 --> 28:11.680
like you cared and then just get ready to give it to them.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.200
But is there not something to be said

28:13.200 --> 28:16.000
for like the idea of just if you feel this way

28:16.000 --> 28:17.280
and you guys have become this friends

28:17.280 --> 28:19.200
and you felt like getting him a gift,

28:19.200 --> 28:21.600
like the faith and trust that maybe he felt the same way?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.760
No, absolutely not.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.480
No, that's the different society that you're living in.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.480
You just described utopia, Travis,

28:28.480 --> 28:29.760
and that show got fucking canceled

28:29.760 --> 28:31.600
because of freewheeling ideas like that.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.680
What if you made it a little more cash

28:33.680 --> 28:34.720
than Griffin's suggestion?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.240
You were like, I'd love to,

28:36.240 --> 28:38.000
we need to get together sometime.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.080
I've got a couple of things to give you in a big deal.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.320
That just gives them some advanced notice.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.120
You know what I mean?

28:43.120 --> 28:44.160
I like that.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.360
Thank you, I thought that was pretty good.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.560
I like that a lot.

28:46.560 --> 28:47.360
Can I elevate it?

28:48.080 --> 28:48.640
Elevate it.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.320
Why don't you tell them,

28:51.120 --> 28:52.800
I feel like we are best friends now.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.280
I feel like we have been elevated to best friend status

28:55.280 --> 28:57.120
and I looked online and they said the best friends

28:57.120 --> 28:58.320
get each other Christmas presents.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.720
And you're human society.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.640
And then you have elevated it

29:02.640 --> 29:05.440
because then you've also given them the gift of saying,

29:05.440 --> 29:06.320
I'm your best friend.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.160
When was the last time either of you said to anybody,

29:10.160 --> 29:11.280
I'm your best friend?

29:12.240 --> 29:16.000
I rarely tell other people where my status is in their life.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.080
Hey, listen, buddy,

29:18.080 --> 29:21.360
I'm the best fucking friend you've got in this situation.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.640
Look around you.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.560
This is the best deal you're gonna get.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.880
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

29:26.880 --> 29:29.520
you know what we need right now?

29:30.240 --> 29:32.480
To tell each other that we're each other's best friends.

29:32.480 --> 29:32.960
Yes.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.160
Let's go in a circle.

29:34.160 --> 29:34.400
Okay.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.320
I'm both of your best friends.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.200
Well, you can't have both.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.960
No, you can only have one, choose.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.960
It's not how the superlative works.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.080
I'm Travis's best friend.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.560
God damn it.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.600
I'm Justin's best friend.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.480
That sucks.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.000
No, you messed up.

29:48.000 --> 29:48.880
No way.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.240
I'm just being honest.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.440
I like Griffin a lot.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.440
Griffin's like my second in command.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.880
Oh, but that's second best friend.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.440
Oh, that's good

29:55.440 --> 29:57.920
because I didn't get either of you guys any fucking Christmas presents.

29:57.920 --> 29:58.880
You're my third best friend.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.240
Griffin, you're my third best friend.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.680
My first one is Hank Mardukas.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.600
Hate that dude.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.800
Although, can I tell you something?

30:06.800 --> 30:07.840
He's also my best friend.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.240
That dude's gonna be swimming in Christmas presents.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.040
Let's go in a circle.

30:11.040 --> 30:25.520
Fucking Hank Mardukas. I hope you die, Hank Mardukas.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.040
You're my best friend, but I hope you die.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.040
Two words.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.320
Hank Mardukas.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.440
Mardukas.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.480
No, two different.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.200
Going on Safari on you, Hank.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.320
Hank Safari, two words.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.240
No, the two words are free snacks.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.720
Did you guys ever play the Nintendo 64 game Hank Safari?

30:45.520 --> 30:46.800
The gameplay was a little bit rote,

30:46.800 --> 30:48.400
but the graphics were really ahead of their time.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.760
They really realized Hank in a lot of really great polygons.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.000
But potato chips don't exist anymore.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.120
You've got to eat something delicious and wholesome.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.720
And you can get exactly that from naturebox.com.

31:00.720 --> 31:04.800
These are snacks with no artificial flavors or colors or sweeteners.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.400
There's no trans fat, no high fructose corn syrup.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.280
It's wholesome.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.720
Salt of the earth type stuff.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.200
You can feel good about giving your family

31:13.200 --> 31:16.960
or hiding individual pieces in an advent calendar.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.320
I just got a new box yesterday.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.120
Dang it.

31:21.120 --> 31:21.440
Yeah.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.120
And I got some Kung Pao pretzels.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.560
What does that even mean?

31:26.560 --> 31:30.960
Oh, they got like, what they taste like is like really good,

31:30.960 --> 31:34.400
really like quality ramen on pretzels

31:34.400 --> 31:35.920
with a little bit of Asian spice.

31:35.920 --> 31:36.560
So good.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.520
That sounds delicious.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.480
Just awesome.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.000
These are, there's even snacks on there

31:40.000 --> 31:43.440
that don't have added sugar or gluten ingredients.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.880
I know we're always talking about the peanut butter nom noms,

31:46.880 --> 31:49.040
but it's as fun to say as it is to eat

31:50.080 --> 31:52.880
and bake sweet potato fries since potato chips don't exist anymore.

31:52.880 --> 31:53.600
You can eat those.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.840
That's available to you.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.520
That's a good stop gap.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.920
Justin, how much would one of these boxes cost our listeners?

32:02.480 --> 32:05.360
Free, you impeccable man, you free.

32:05.360 --> 32:07.360
Free, not a red dime.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.320
Free snacks.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.160
Those are the two words I want you to keep in mind.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.800
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.080
Every single week we hear from listeners who said,

32:16.080 --> 32:18.320
thank you, I'm sorry I waited so long.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.600
Fuck these snacks are good.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.480
Thank you for hooking me up with these free snacks.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.160
We packaged these ourselves.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.880
We hand packaged these free snacks just for you.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.280
I coat each nom nom in delicious peanut butter one by one.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.880
Each one takes me six minutes.

32:32.880 --> 32:33.840
So do the math.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.440
Hey, here's an idea.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.800
You should sign up for this.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.640
Get it in time for your holiday party.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.200
Put them out as like little snack nauseous.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.200
We have no way of knowing that's possible.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.040
Well, I mean, I'm just saying if you could

32:45.040 --> 32:46.240
or for a new year's party.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.040
Yeah, or for a mid January party.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.720
But put them out, you're gonna look

32:50.720 --> 32:52.560
and people are gonna be like, you get these at Trader Joe's?

32:52.560 --> 32:53.120
Where did you get?

32:53.120 --> 32:55.520
And be like, nope, I got them at nature box.

32:55.520 --> 32:58.880
And then you can tell them to go to naturebox.com slash my brother

32:58.880 --> 33:02.320
and then you're just spreading the word, the good word.

33:02.320 --> 33:06.080
If every person on earth went to naturebox.com slash my brother

33:06.080 --> 33:08.160
and got a free box of delicious snacks,

33:08.160 --> 33:10.000
that's the kind of worldwide change

33:10.560 --> 33:14.480
that I want to bring to the world all the wide around it.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.320
It's time we take down big potato.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.160
If you wanna take down big potato, you're gonna need some money.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.840
They have a lot of lawyers on hand,

33:23.040 --> 33:26.000
but you decided you're gonna put a stop

33:26.000 --> 33:31.520
to their starchy shenanigans and you're gonna need a war chest.

33:31.520 --> 33:34.720
So it's hard to get money.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.640
It's hard to borrow it.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.480
Nobody's got any money in the world,

33:38.480 --> 33:42.240
but if you need to borrow money, somebody else might have some

33:43.040 --> 33:46.240

33:58.720 --> 34:01.440
It's weird that they put that.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.200
It's weird that they put that in the notes.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.480
That's prescient of them.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.360
Wait a second.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.760
They've also mentioned Frankenstein's dick.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.720
They are the one.

34:46.240 --> 34:46.740
Justin?

34:48.240 --> 34:49.680
He's having an asthma attack.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.400
Kevin, do you have some messages?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.200
Yeah, real quick.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.680
Got a message for Alex and Aubrey.

34:55.680 --> 34:57.200
Double your pleasure.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.680
That's a little stinger I came up with

34:59.680 --> 35:01.360
for when a message is for two people.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.360
Perfect, a stinger.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.080
That's what we need.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.160
We need to direct more music in this show.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.560
Okay, well, this is great because it's from Jazz.

35:09.760 --> 35:10.240
Who says,

35:12.320 --> 35:13.200
that's a saxophone.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.880
Jazz says, happy birthday, Alex and Aubrey.

35:18.880 --> 35:22.000
Here's a list of out of context inside jokes.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.440
Entrepreneurial.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.880
Wow, that's a fucking word, isn't it?

35:24.880 --> 35:26.560
It's more than a half, man.

35:26.560 --> 35:27.680
Entrepreneur.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.440
God, entrepreneur.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.280
Now you're thinking about it.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.320
I am, aren't I?

35:32.320 --> 35:34.000
Entrepreneurial.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.120
Did I get it?

35:35.120 --> 35:36.480
Yep, got it in one.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.960
Entrepreneurial pirate, mouth winking.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.480
You're a stone cold fox.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.960
The old man who talks about dead teens.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.440
The colonies are in revolt.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.560
Geno, or perhaps gino, gets in the pizza with you.

35:50.560 --> 35:54.400
I'm so sorry everyone else, but hey, these are the jokes.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.200
Love Jazz.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.400
That's probably what it's like listening to my brother.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.280
I skipped one.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.400
Frankenstein's dick.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.560
Got a message from Mr. Kelch from Kat.

36:09.360 --> 36:13.040
And Kat says, Eric, ketchup needs to be refrigerated.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.560
Why did you need a message for that?

36:14.560 --> 36:15.600
Of course it does.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.880
Eric, ketchup needs to be refrigerated.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.320
Stop saying it doesn't.

36:20.320 --> 36:23.840
And that it is better warm or there will be some divorce.

36:23.840 --> 36:24.320
There we go.

36:25.200 --> 36:29.840
Love your wife, PSJK on the divorce, but seriously.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.680
Cold ketchup is the right ketchup.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.080
I got some bowling alley french fries last night

36:34.080 --> 36:36.240
because my life is a garbage.

36:37.920 --> 36:38.320
And they-

36:38.320 --> 36:39.120
Garbage body.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.640
I have a garbage body.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.320
I'm garbage all over.

36:42.320 --> 36:46.400
I played foot golf yesterday and my glutes, my whole butt-

36:46.400 --> 36:47.280
Excuse me.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.240
It's called soccer.

36:48.240 --> 36:48.480
Yeah.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.680
Is foot golf just kicking the ball because you don't have a club?

36:51.680 --> 36:54.320
You kick a soccer ball into the hole, like golf.

36:54.320 --> 36:54.720
Okay.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.600
But my glutes, my butt is garbage right now.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.440
What was I saying?

36:59.440 --> 37:00.160
Oh, right.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.400
I had to eat warm ketchup and I wanted to die.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.360
I'm saying the divorce, it sounds sad

37:05.360 --> 37:07.440
because it sounds like you've worked a really hard time

37:07.440 --> 37:12.160
on your guys' love and it's an investment and it's special.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.920
But you got on the right thing.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.640
You got to toe a hard line against these fucking monsters.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.240
Oh my God, guys.

37:18.240 --> 37:22.480
Guys, we have talked about potato-based products

37:22.480 --> 37:24.800
in literally every second of this show

37:24.800 --> 37:27.840
and I'm so hungry for potatoes right now.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.160
I would do terrible things to some potato.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.920
A raw potato, I would eat like a golden delicious apple right now.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.920
Would you pluck off the eyes?

37:37.920 --> 37:41.120
I would bite off the eyes, chew them up, swallow them,

37:41.120 --> 37:43.760
and then I would eat the potato whole raw.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.160
Okay.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.400
Would you just, you would swallow it in one go?

37:46.400 --> 37:48.560
Because right now we're in a big golf territory.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.720
Trademark infringement.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.080
I would just, hold on, wait.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.640
Can we get, would it be a Mr. Potato head?

37:56.640 --> 37:58.960
Because then that's some good for dog.

37:59.920 --> 38:00.640
Yummy, yummy.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.400
That's some good, good for.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.200
This is all things considered.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.440
This is 99% invisible.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.360
We're listening to Pop Culture Happy Hour.

38:09.360 --> 38:10.240
It's bull's eye.

38:10.240 --> 38:14.800
The podcast Song Exploder does pretty much what its name suggests.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.800
Musicians break apart songs so you can hear the pieces.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.440
Track by track, instrument by instrument.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.960
How they were imagined, created, and built into a composition.

38:24.960 --> 38:29.200
And all of these artistic decisions are packed into this 11 or 12 minute show.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.800
It's really fascinating to hear them explain how they fit these pieces together.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.200
The concept is simple but brilliant.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.680
Subscribe to Song Exploder at songexploder.net.

38:39.680 --> 38:44.720
You can also find it on iTunes or wherever you download podcasts.

38:44.720 --> 38:49.600
Folks, your friends and my brother, my brother and me like to play experts on the podcast.

38:49.600 --> 38:56.640
But sometimes our own knowledge, our own expertise has limits, believe it or not.

38:56.640 --> 39:01.600
Even after 230 episodes, there are still things we don't know.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.080
And in those situations, we call upon what we have cleverly titled,

39:06.080 --> 39:09.440
in a handy bit of neologism, a guest part.

39:09.440 --> 39:13.520
230 episodes, I think one thing that we don't know is when to stop.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.280
Just when to like get out on top.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.640
Just get out of the intro.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.080
Our guest today is Bill Corbett from RiffTrax, MST3K.

39:21.040 --> 39:26.640
Many other, a current playwright, songwriter, cruise director.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.240
I'll keep going.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.440
Power lifter.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.560
Power lifter.

39:30.560 --> 39:34.560
Comic, comic book, funny, funny book, man.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.320
What is the funny boy?

39:36.320 --> 39:37.440
Comic book funny boy.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.000
I like it, guys.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.520
Bill Corbett, welcome to this program.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.000
Thank you.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.840
I am a comic book funny guy.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.360
I'll embrace that.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.040
We have questions.

39:49.040 --> 39:49.920
Let's get right to them.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.120
Let's help people.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.640
Thank you, of course, so much for joining us.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.760
Oh, my pleasure, you guys.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.120
I love your podcast.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.640
Your many podcasts.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.400
Read it and weep, Ms. Williams.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.680
Said we wouldn't amount to anything.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.040
Aside from, I've been haranguing her lately.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.720
I think three episodes I've mentioned Ms. Williams.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.080
And I don't think she exists.

40:06.080 --> 40:06.960
I think she's fiction.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.720
No, because I believe she told me the same thing.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.320
I remember her saying to me, do you

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
know how many people from Huntington, West Virginia

40:12.320 --> 40:14.880
have ever gone on to succeed in the entertainment industry?

40:14.880 --> 40:15.600
And I said, no.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.000
How many?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
She said, none, which is not true.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.200
Not 100% true.

40:19.200 --> 40:19.600
Yeah.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.100
No.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.520
She needs to be your next guest pert.

40:24.240 --> 40:25.040
She's dead.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.000
She's shaming.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.120
Oh, is she dead?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.160
She's dead, Bill.

40:28.800 --> 40:29.360
Thank god.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.040
How could you?

40:31.600 --> 40:33.280
She can't get to you guys anymore.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.960
Our most inspiring teacher.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.880
I remember being in third grade.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.040
She said, you'll never be on a podcast.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.560
And that's a pretty good pull.

40:40.560 --> 40:41.680
Yeah, 1993.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.160
Wait, hold on.

40:42.160 --> 40:42.720
Think about it.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.320
I think we just found the evidence that we need

40:44.320 --> 40:45.920
to overturn that one patent.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.280
So let's circle back to that.

40:47.280 --> 40:47.840
Now we got it.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.480
We can't forget to circle back to that when we're done recording.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.240
We'll be certain to email that patent troll.

40:52.240 --> 40:52.800
Here we go.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.440
Questions.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.960
Aside from continuing to, quote, circulate the tapes,

40:57.600 --> 41:00.480
what can I do to help foster the skill of riffing movies

41:00.480 --> 41:03.280
in any future children I may have?

41:03.280 --> 41:05.840
It's a skill that has carried me and less enthusiastic friends

41:05.840 --> 41:08.160
through many a bad movie, whether in my school days,

41:08.160 --> 41:10.640
dealing with my mom's hallmark movie binges,

41:10.640 --> 41:13.200
or just because laughing at a bad movie seemed like fun.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.720
Is the art of riffing something we can pass on,

41:16.720 --> 41:18.960
or should I not worry about it

41:18.960 --> 41:22.320
and just hope my kids take to it naturally?

41:22.320 --> 41:24.880
That's from Zap Rausdauer.

41:24.880 --> 41:29.280
Who, for those of you who know, that's a MST3K deep cut.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.920
He was the hero of one of our movies.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.240
I'm not even sure that qualifies as a deep cut.

41:34.240 --> 41:38.400
That seems like the, that's that primo stuff.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.560
I'm being modest on behalf of the old show.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.480
Yeah, the future children.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.240
Let's talk about the future children.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.760
The potential, the at this point hypothetical maybe kids.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.760
The twinkles in this man's eye.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.600
This guy's priority, by the way,

41:53.600 --> 41:56.000
for like of all the parent inquiries,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.560
this is gotta figure out how to teach the kids to riff.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.440
Maybe he's nailed down all the more important ones

42:01.440 --> 42:04.480
and he's moving on to the refinement.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.080
He knows how to talk to him about sex.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.600
He knows how to talk to him about drugs.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.840
But how do you talk to him about bad movies?

42:09.840 --> 42:10.320
Got it.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.040
Has the college education all lined up?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.640
You know, I always think, you know,

42:16.640 --> 42:18.240
it's just something to take to naturally.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.160
I think he answered his own question here.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.920
It depends on your goal really.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.120
If you just wanna have a couple of laughs with your family

42:25.120 --> 42:28.000
and you know, kids will pick up on your wise assery,

42:28.000 --> 42:28.880
no doubt about it.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.800
But if you're trying to get your career in movie riffing,

42:33.600 --> 42:37.120
they don't exist really outside of about a dozen of us.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.600
And it is a weird thing to do.

42:39.600 --> 42:44.240
It's a weird thing to just sit there and painstakingly write.

42:44.240 --> 42:47.760
You know, I flatter ourselves, but we do write

42:47.760 --> 42:51.440
like an alternative comic soundtrack to a movie.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.080
So it's more than just kind of hanging around

42:54.080 --> 42:55.840
and making jokes, which is fun too.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.960
We tried to do it for an educational short as like

42:58.960 --> 43:02.000
a max fun bonus material that I think is still out there.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.320
And Jesus Christ, that thing was like a minute and a half long

43:04.320 --> 43:05.600
and it took us like a month.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.880
It was like pulling teeth.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.240
It is a bit laborious.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.200
We are masochists first and foremost.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.800
Do you take a dry run first?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.040
That's basically just all of you shouting at each other

43:15.040 --> 43:16.240
and then hone from there.

43:16.240 --> 43:21.520
You know, we used to when during the old show days,

43:21.520 --> 43:23.680
I feel like an old vaudevillian here,

43:23.680 --> 43:28.800
back in the 90s, lads, at the height of vaudeville.

43:28.800 --> 43:31.360
Comedy Central, also the comedy channel.

43:31.360 --> 43:34.080
Well, we actually used to just sit in a room together

43:34.080 --> 43:37.200
and look at the movie and just blurt out whatever.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.360
It was like a mass tourette syndrome.

43:39.360 --> 43:43.760
While one poor sap, one of us had to kind of just record

43:43.760 --> 43:44.560
as we went.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.200
And we took turns doing that to spread the pain around.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.240
But now for riff tracks, we just kind of each write

43:50.240 --> 43:53.600
about a quarter to a sixth of the movie in a first draft

43:53.600 --> 43:56.720
and take a run at it and then try to mash it all together

43:56.720 --> 43:59.040
in some Frankenstein-like first draft.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.600
Over your years of riffing on terrible films,

44:01.600 --> 44:03.200
whether it be Misty 3K and riff tracks,

44:03.200 --> 44:06.320
are there any particular mistakes or just bad ideas

44:06.320 --> 44:08.800
that you see repeated frequently?

44:08.800 --> 44:11.680
And that's from Bevan Blocker, who

44:11.680 --> 44:14.640
says that his name is pronounced Bevan like Kevin.

44:14.640 --> 44:18.480
OK, Bevan, or Beevan, if I might.

44:18.480 --> 44:22.000
OK, if we may be familiar for a moment.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.560
I feel like we've grown close enough, Bevan.

44:25.760 --> 44:26.640
Yeah, there's one.

44:27.280 --> 44:30.160
I don't know if my colleagues are as obsessed about it

44:30.160 --> 44:33.120
as I am, but the idea of the kind of do-nothing,

44:33.760 --> 44:38.080
personality-less main hero, the protagonist,

44:38.080 --> 44:42.880
usually a chunky white dude who's considered good-looking

44:44.400 --> 44:47.840
by some standards of mostly like 1950s Hollywood.

44:47.840 --> 44:51.920
I guess I'm thinking of that time in movie history

44:51.920 --> 44:54.400
where you could just put a sort of bland-looking guy

44:54.400 --> 44:57.760
in front of a screen, a six-foot-one white guy,

44:58.320 --> 45:00.720
and just have him be the lead in your movie

45:00.720 --> 45:02.960
and not have him really have any qualities

45:02.960 --> 45:04.720
that are appealing in any way.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.240
Except that he's there.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.360
Except that he's there.

45:07.360 --> 45:09.360
He occupies physical space.

45:09.360 --> 45:09.600
Sure.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.480
And he doesn't trip over his feet.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.200
I mean, that's about it.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.560
It's got to be the producer's like,

45:14.560 --> 45:15.920
who's the most handsome guy we know?

45:15.920 --> 45:18.960
Like, the most handsome guy we know in real life.

45:18.960 --> 45:19.600
Right, right.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.760
I always think it's who's the least weird-looking.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.320
Like, no one's going to say anything.

45:24.320 --> 45:27.120
They don't have that nose or those weird ears.

45:27.120 --> 45:28.640
No one's going to be upset by his face.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.840
I think that is well put.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.360
Yeah, just a blank slate.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.800
In the case of Zapp Rousder, though,

45:32.800 --> 45:35.120
some casting director dropped the goddamn ball.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.920
Oh, but he's great.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.440
I mean, he's comparatively great.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.600
At least he does something.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.120
He drinks a lot of beer, first of all.

45:43.120 --> 45:43.440
Sure.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.400
Yes, but he also runs around and shoots guys.

45:47.120 --> 45:51.520
I wonder if people who make and write video games

45:51.520 --> 45:55.920
get a lot of their inspiration from that very bland,

45:56.720 --> 45:58.640
milk-toast protagonist.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.760
Because I don't know, you also just accurately described,

46:02.720 --> 46:04.320
maybe without realizing it,

46:04.320 --> 46:06.560
every video game protagonist is just like,

46:07.120 --> 46:09.840
a dude who is just like,

46:09.840 --> 46:11.440
that's the thing that holds the gun

46:11.440 --> 46:12.640
that you shoot the guys with.

46:12.640 --> 46:13.120
Right, right.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.960
That's about all that you get out of it.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
Somebody asked the question on Twitter,

46:16.960 --> 46:20.000
and it wasn't, sorry, quite good enough to make the cut,

46:20.000 --> 46:21.200
but the question was good.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.080
Take that.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.680
The idea was great, which is,

46:23.680 --> 46:26.320
now that watching bad movies has become

46:26.320 --> 46:28.320
such a thing that people do,

46:28.320 --> 46:31.280
there are directors and studios trying to make bad movies,

46:31.280 --> 46:33.200
like a shark potato, that kind of idea.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.360
And do you think that that is kind of like,

46:35.360 --> 46:37.520
ruining, spoiling the recipe?

46:37.520 --> 46:39.840
Because it's like, no, it has to be accidentally bad.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.040
Yeah, I think you can tell the difference.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.800
And I think people who go to Sharknado,

46:44.800 --> 46:47.520
or Sharknado 2, know the difference.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.840
We actually did a live show of Sharknado,

46:49.840 --> 46:51.920
and we'll probably go on to Sharknado 2.

46:51.920 --> 46:55.360
But we have to sort of switch our gears a little bit,

46:55.360 --> 46:56.960
and sort of acknowledge that, yeah,

46:56.960 --> 47:00.800
they are trying to make a bad movie,

47:00.800 --> 47:03.040
and trying to have one over on us.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.840
So we just try to find a way around the edges there.

47:07.840 --> 47:11.760
But yeah, I mean, there are these pure uncut bits

47:11.760 --> 47:15.200
of bad movie making, like The Room, or Birdemic,

47:15.200 --> 47:18.880
that are just so great in the way that they're bad.

47:18.880 --> 47:21.920
Because you really, you almost could not imagine that.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.800
Someone just tried so hard, and failed so bad.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.240
And so beautifully.

47:26.240 --> 47:28.960
The Room, especially, I've probably watched that movie,

47:28.960 --> 47:31.840
no joke, and I think I'm in good company here,

47:31.840 --> 47:33.280
probably like 30 times.

47:33.280 --> 47:36.000
Yeah, I'm usually like half and half with riff tracks,

47:36.000 --> 47:38.480
and without, they're both really excellent.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.160
But I can watch without riff tracks,

47:40.160 --> 47:43.280
and it's like, I'm enjoying it.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.160
I don't know when my friend Dwight, one summer,

47:46.160 --> 47:48.240
got really into Billy Joel as a joke,

47:48.800 --> 47:50.240
and then the next year,

47:50.240 --> 47:52.960
he was super into Billy Joel like legitimately.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.080
It's the Billy Joel flip.

47:54.880 --> 47:57.040
And I think I made that switch with The Room,

47:57.040 --> 47:59.840
like I enjoy every second of it, it's terrible.

47:59.840 --> 48:04.240
Did you just compare Tommy Wiseau with Billy Joel?

48:04.960 --> 48:05.440
You monster.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.560
Is he Austrian Billy Joel?

48:07.680 --> 48:09.600
He's the something foreign Billy Joel.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.000
Let's not pin him down.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.840
Let's not pretend like we've solved

48:13.840 --> 48:15.520
the grand mystery of life.

48:17.200 --> 48:20.560
Mr. Corbett, you guys have done a lot of movies

48:20.560 --> 48:23.440
that would traditionally, with riff tracks,

48:23.440 --> 48:26.800
I think be traditionally considered to be good.

48:26.800 --> 48:28.640
Good films, even some great films.

48:29.200 --> 48:32.640
Is that a lot harder to write gags around those,

48:32.640 --> 48:34.880
or is it the same sort of form?

48:34.880 --> 48:35.760
Are you talking about The Apple?

48:37.280 --> 48:38.800
No, The Apple's another one, man.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.840
I love The Apple.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.720
Love it so much.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.040
I have to say, I'm with you.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.000
I watched that enough times, The Apple, enough times

48:46.000 --> 48:48.320
that I just fell into its spell.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.600
Some of the songs are really good.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.080
Yeah, they're super good.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.120
They actually are not bad.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.120
Wow, you have it right there, don't you?

48:59.120 --> 49:00.160
He really loves The Apple.

49:00.960 --> 49:01.760
He made me watch it.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.440
We watched that the night before Griffin got married.

49:03.440 --> 49:07.360
Yeah, I was like, no, it wasn't that.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.560
I was like super nervous.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.040
I was like nauseous for being so nervous.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.240
And Jess was like, I got what you need.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.120
It was that and beer, just like a lot of it.

49:15.120 --> 49:15.760
There you go.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.960
Anyway, good movies.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.720
Writing jokes about good movies.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.080
It took a while to adjust to that

49:20.080 --> 49:21.920
because we were never able to do them on the show.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.800
And people were kind of clamoring for us

49:24.800 --> 49:26.640
to do at least more mainstream movies.

49:28.400 --> 49:31.920
But then we decided to try a few that we actually kind of like,

49:31.920 --> 49:32.800
like The Lord of the Rings.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.400
I mean, collectively, we have more or less taste for them.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.280
But Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

49:39.280 --> 49:43.600
And then we really tried to underline it three times

49:43.600 --> 49:45.520
by doing what we called a riff tracks challenge

49:45.520 --> 49:46.880
by doing Casablanca.

49:46.880 --> 49:50.080
And what we wind up doing really is just joke, of course,

49:50.080 --> 49:52.800
joking less about the quality of the movie being bad

49:52.800 --> 49:53.920
because that would be a lie.

49:55.440 --> 49:59.440
And just sort of roasting it in the old Hollywood fryer style.

50:00.720 --> 50:05.600
And just finding almost like alternative narratives going on

50:05.600 --> 50:08.240
in the moment, just imposing it on them,

50:08.240 --> 50:09.200
whether they like it or not.

50:10.880 --> 50:11.600
Here's a question.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.560
I'm a writer myself, but I often find it hard

50:14.560 --> 50:17.360
to transfer rudimentary ideas from my brain to paper

50:17.360 --> 50:18.320
to be fleshed out.

50:18.320 --> 50:24.480
Do you have any specific process to get ideas out from within?

50:24.480 --> 50:26.960
That's from finding a flourish in Florida.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.720
Oh, well, you're already on your way

50:28.720 --> 50:30.800
with your mastery of alliteration.

50:30.800 --> 50:31.200
Nice.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.400
That's three Fs right in a row.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.120
There you go.

50:33.120 --> 50:35.280
Just keep up that, pal.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.600
That's a do a whole book of F words.

50:42.160 --> 50:45.120
There are so many writing teachers out there,

50:45.120 --> 50:47.440
and there's just so much nonsense.

50:47.440 --> 50:50.880
And I will probably give nonsense here as well

50:50.880 --> 50:53.200
because I just don't think it's one size fits all.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.360
But I can give you a general guideline,

50:55.360 --> 50:59.440
which is do it regularly.

50:59.440 --> 51:03.120
Just do it every day if you can or five days a week.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.400
And don't do it for long.

51:04.400 --> 51:06.880
If you're struggling with the real basics,

51:06.880 --> 51:09.520
like how do I sit my ass down and write,

51:09.520 --> 51:12.480
then just be disciplined, but be kind to yourself

51:12.480 --> 51:15.280
at the same time, which is the discipline part is making sure

51:15.280 --> 51:16.640
you show up every day and do some.

51:16.640 --> 51:21.120
The kind part is don't expect to do whatever that acronym is,

51:21.120 --> 51:22.800
the NaNoWriMo month.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.080
That was fun to watch you say.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.320
It felt really good.

51:29.120 --> 51:31.680
Travis, you're in the studio with Bill.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.520
Did he put some licorice in his mouth

51:33.520 --> 51:34.960
when he tried to say that?

51:34.960 --> 51:37.680
He looked like a dog that you put peanut butter in his mouth

51:37.680 --> 51:38.800
to make it look like he was talking.

51:38.800 --> 51:39.280
It was great.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.960
I quickly put peanut butter in my mouth

51:40.960 --> 51:42.400
while you were not looking.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.040
It was delicious.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.960
Yeah, I guess my point is just regular practice.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.720
There's nothing, there's no substitute

51:48.720 --> 51:49.600
for actually writing.

51:49.600 --> 51:50.960
You can't wait for ideas.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.160
You can't wait for inspiration.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.440
You just have to kind of do it.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.440
And the inspiration will come faster through that,

51:55.440 --> 51:57.360
which a lot of writers have said.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.760
My little part of it is that don't try

51:59.760 --> 52:02.720
to do eight or 10 hours at a stretch.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.520
You'll hate it.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.000
That's great.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.040
I mean, I need that advice.

52:05.040 --> 52:05.760
Thank you very much.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.080
More peanut butter, please.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.320
That's his reward.

52:10.320 --> 52:10.820
Thank you.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.240
We had Elizabeth Gilbert on the show,

52:14.240 --> 52:17.040
the author of Eat, Pray, Love, who said

52:17.040 --> 52:20.880
that you should never try to write in sweatpants

52:20.880 --> 52:23.120
and a shitty t-shirt.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.200
You should dress like a serious...

52:25.760 --> 52:26.800
Is that something that...

52:26.800 --> 52:29.440
Can you write in sweatpants and cozy wear?

52:29.440 --> 52:31.440
Or do you feel like you need to be

52:31.440 --> 52:32.960
a professional businessman?

52:32.960 --> 52:38.400
I have to dress in full tuxedo and tails.

52:39.040 --> 52:42.000
No, I respectfully disagree with Ms. Gilbert.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.040
I write in the shittiest clothes in the world.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.400
You weren't here first, folks.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.960
Beef between Bill Corbyn and Elizabeth Gilbert.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.720
Threadbare garbage clothes for me.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.560
The garbagerier, the better.

52:54.560 --> 52:56.560
I do like her eating and her praying and her loving.

52:56.560 --> 53:02.240
Travis, you know, as you were saying that,

53:02.240 --> 53:06.080
I looked down, I am wearing sweatpants

53:06.080 --> 53:08.880
and a Greetings from Tybee Island t-shirt

53:08.880 --> 53:10.240
with baby vomit on it.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.400
Yeah, that's just the Justin.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.080
It's actually not his baby, Bill.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.680
It's designer baby vomit.

53:19.680 --> 53:20.240
It just came that way.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.600
You pay extra for that.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.400
Pay a lot for this.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.680
Jock strap and a t-shirt.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.600
That's all you need to write.

53:25.600 --> 53:28.000
I meant to mention, I love your jock strap today, Bill.

53:28.000 --> 53:28.400
Thank you.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.280
I have a friend who absolutely hates the concept

53:33.280 --> 53:35.120
of laughing at bad movies.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.240
For instance, he considers watching a movie like The Room

53:38.240 --> 53:40.560
to be a massive waste of time when he could be watching

53:40.560 --> 53:43.760
something better, quote, like Transformers.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.520
Oh, come on.

53:45.520 --> 53:47.200
That's the whole of this, dude.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.920
You know, like Trans Brothers and Mr. Corbyn.

53:51.920 --> 53:55.760
How can we get this farcical flick Debbie Downer

53:55.760 --> 53:57.040
in the right frame of mind?

53:57.040 --> 53:58.480
Or is this a lost cause?

53:58.480 --> 54:00.640
That's from bad movie Buff in Brooklyn.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.600
Oh my God, with the alliteration in your listeners.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.400
We have a pretty savvy audience.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.480
This actually, this reminds me of the first time Griffin

54:08.480 --> 54:11.760
and I watched The Room with my now wife, Teresa.

54:11.760 --> 54:16.640
The look on her face was like a combination of like confusion

54:16.640 --> 54:17.600
and frustration.

54:17.600 --> 54:21.040
She didn't know why we did that to her.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.800
Yeah, she just kept saying, what is this?

54:22.800 --> 54:23.360
Why are we?

54:23.360 --> 54:23.920
No.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.040
I'm testing you, darling.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.080
Yeah, and it was like, get it.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.760
And she's like, no, no, it's bad.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.240
She's bad.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.400
And then we made her watch it like eight more times

54:30.400 --> 54:31.200
and now she loves it.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.640
Oh, sort of Stockholm syndrome.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.320
Yeah, I was very much like, you'll get it, honey.

54:38.160 --> 54:39.200
He's from Stockholm.

54:40.880 --> 54:41.760
We've cracked it.

54:43.600 --> 54:48.800
There is a real problem with the premise of this question

54:48.800 --> 54:50.560
in the Transformers message.

54:50.560 --> 54:52.880
I mean, I don't know where to go with that.

54:52.880 --> 54:54.720
Because if you don't enjoy The Room

54:54.720 --> 54:57.040
and you do enjoy Transformers, I don't

54:57.040 --> 54:58.960
understand you as a human being.

54:58.960 --> 55:01.600
It seems to me like maybe his through line,

55:01.600 --> 55:04.240
he doesn't like really good movies or really bad movies

55:04.240 --> 55:06.560
and he just wants it right down the center there,

55:06.560 --> 55:08.160
like milk toast, nothing.

55:08.160 --> 55:12.560
He likes the movie protagonist of 1950s version of movies.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.520
Sure, yeah.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.840
And he wants to be beat up by Michael Bay.

55:15.840 --> 55:19.040
Well, I mean, I guess there's, why would you try to force

55:19.040 --> 55:19.760
someone to do that?

55:19.760 --> 55:22.960
I guess to marry them if Travis is to be believed.

55:22.960 --> 55:26.640
But that's the only reason, as a weird dourer.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.960
I forget what the actual question was.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.240
I snagged on Transformers.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.600
How do you fix this broken person?

55:31.600 --> 55:33.680
The question, if you really break it down to like really

55:33.680 --> 55:36.240
parse it, is how do you get someone to like bad movies?

55:36.240 --> 55:40.320
And I think it's a little questionable as a premise.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.400
I mean, you're not supposed to, right?

55:42.400 --> 55:43.520
Well, but here's the thing.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.920
Because I was thinking about this on the way over when I got

55:45.920 --> 55:49.280
stuck in traffic, is the idea of I

55:49.280 --> 55:50.880
didn't start liking bad movies.

55:50.880 --> 55:53.600
I started as a kid watching MST3K with dad.

55:53.600 --> 55:54.080
Sure.

55:54.080 --> 55:56.560
And then through that, transitioning

55:56.560 --> 55:58.080
into liking bad movies.

55:58.080 --> 56:00.000
And I think that it's an acquired taste.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.560
It's a thing that's like, you can't show someone who's

56:02.560 --> 56:07.120
only seen current blockbuster quote good or bad movies

56:07.120 --> 56:10.560
and then expect them to like The Room and Manos Hands of Fate

56:10.560 --> 56:11.360
and get it.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.920
Like, you kind of got to like clue them in with,

56:13.920 --> 56:16.480
we're going to watch something that frames it like,

56:16.480 --> 56:18.560
isn't this fun to make fun of?

56:18.560 --> 56:20.720
I think you are really onto something.

56:20.720 --> 56:24.240
And when I was working on the show,

56:24.240 --> 56:26.480
my parents would watch and they could not,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.320
they just couldn't get past the movies.

56:28.320 --> 56:31.600
They would just go like, man, that movie was really bad.

56:31.600 --> 56:33.280
That was just a terrible movie.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.680
So I couldn't watch anymore.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.120
That's sort of the point.

56:37.120 --> 56:39.920
We hope we could sort of take you through it a little bit.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.320
We'll take you through it a little bit, mom and dad.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.440
But yeah, and I don't, I would never force that on people

56:45.440 --> 56:47.120
unless I wanted to marry them.

56:47.120 --> 56:52.080
Do you feel like you guys like provided a really valuable

56:52.080 --> 56:54.960
service to the movie industry, the filmmaking industry

56:54.960 --> 56:58.960
where if a movie studio, I feel like made a really terrible

56:58.960 --> 57:01.280
movie before you guys came around,

57:01.280 --> 57:02.680
it was just a total loss.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.120
It was a disaster for them.

57:04.120 --> 57:05.920
But now if somebody makes a really bad movie, it's like,

57:05.920 --> 57:09.120
well, at least somebody is going to get some sort of like

57:09.120 --> 57:12.240
twisted pleasure at like, like there is a,

57:12.240 --> 57:15.040
there has been cultivated among people and appreciation

57:15.040 --> 57:17.080
for bad movies that wasn't there before.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.560
So at least we've got that.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.960
At least we'll bring some modicum of joy to people.

57:20.960 --> 57:23.520
Especially now with podcasts and like YouTube.

57:23.520 --> 57:25.760
And it's like, everybody talks about bad movies now

57:25.760 --> 57:27.640
in a way that like people weren't doing, you know,

57:27.640 --> 57:29.040
in the 90s.

57:29.040 --> 57:32.040
So for example, I was a teenage strangler was filmed

57:32.040 --> 57:33.800
in our hometown, Huntington, West Virginia.

57:33.800 --> 57:36.720
So when it was on MSD3K, it was like this huge thing

57:36.720 --> 57:38.560
of like, it's back, we've done it.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.080
And it also puts the lie to your old teacher's thing

57:41.080 --> 57:42.960
about nobody ever making it.

57:42.960 --> 57:43.920
Take that, Mrs. Williams.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.640
Well, no, because we're all getting strangled.

57:48.120 --> 57:50.960
By a fellow native though, right?

57:50.960 --> 57:51.800
There you go.

57:51.800 --> 57:52.840
Yeah, so.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.360
It's our town in the best light.

57:54.360 --> 57:55.880
Just culling the herd.

57:55.880 --> 57:59.480
We're building a staircase of human bodies

57:59.480 --> 58:00.320
for him to climb on.

58:00.320 --> 58:01.160
There you go.

58:01.160 --> 58:03.600
Well, you know, I don't know, we've wanted Hollywood

58:03.600 --> 58:06.240
to appreciate that service we provide them for years,

58:06.240 --> 58:09.280
but so far, so far, nothing.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.960
No fungible.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.920
You know, we're just not big enough problems

58:12.920 --> 58:15.040
to affect their sales and that's all they care about.

58:15.040 --> 58:19.240
And when we have actually negotiated them via riff tracks

58:19.240 --> 58:22.860
for bigger titles, it's like diffusing a bomb.

58:22.860 --> 58:24.120
They're very sensitive about it.

58:24.120 --> 58:26.800
And we eventually have shook a few, you know,

58:26.800 --> 58:30.560
90s to early 2000 titles away from them with money,

58:30.560 --> 58:32.320
just with Kickstarter money.

58:32.320 --> 58:35.560
But they're just very concerned about the relationship,

58:35.560 --> 58:37.880
the trail of relationships they have in general.

58:37.880 --> 58:39.740
I'm imagining that conversation, like,

58:39.740 --> 58:43.320
you wanna make fun of Casablanca.

58:43.320 --> 58:44.160
Right.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.000
No.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.880
No, no, you can't.

58:46.880 --> 58:47.720
You can't do that.

58:47.720 --> 58:48.540
Come on, they're all dead.

58:48.540 --> 58:49.380
Come on.

58:49.380 --> 58:50.280
Yeah, you're right.

58:50.280 --> 58:53.000
My girlfriend and I live about 1500 miles apart

58:53.000 --> 58:55.720
and one of our favorite pastimes is watching MST3K

58:55.720 --> 58:58.020
and Riff Tracks together over Skype.

58:58.020 --> 59:00.400
Which MST3K episode of Riff Tracks VOD

59:00.400 --> 59:03.680
would you recommend for a young couple in love?

59:03.680 --> 59:05.560
Amorous in Austin.

59:05.560 --> 59:08.040
I don't, you know, I guess if he's asking me

59:08.040 --> 59:10.200
if it's something that would enhance their love

59:10.200 --> 59:14.760
or sexual pleasure, I'm a little scared of that question.

59:14.760 --> 59:15.680
Frankly.

59:15.680 --> 59:18.680
What's the most erotic MST3K episode?

59:18.680 --> 59:21.040
The apple, hands down.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.160
The Roger Daltrey looking guy

59:23.160 --> 59:25.040
running around in a loincloth.

59:25.040 --> 59:25.880
It doesn't get any more erotic than that.

59:25.880 --> 59:29.780
Can you just repeat the chapter with the sex song in it?

59:29.780 --> 59:32.000
The song that takes place in the sex.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.880
I was drunk at that point of the movie

59:34.880 --> 59:36.420
the time that I watched it,

59:36.420 --> 59:40.240
but I do distinctly remember there being a sex song

59:40.240 --> 59:41.800
that somebody sang while having sex.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.640
Which I think is-

59:42.640 --> 59:43.740
I'm guessing one of your brothers can sing it.

59:43.740 --> 59:45.360
Sex song from the apple.

59:45.360 --> 59:47.380
Oh man, it's gonna make me mad.

59:47.380 --> 59:48.220
I'm gonna-

59:48.220 --> 59:50.760
It's a double entendre, I believe.

59:50.760 --> 59:52.840
It is a single entendre.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.960
It's 1.2 entendres.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.640
I'm coming.

59:56.640 --> 59:57.480
There it is.

59:57.480 --> 59:58.300
It's the one.

59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.040
Oh, I'm, it's very subtle.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.200
Oh, I'm coming.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.760
Bill, do you think, just like if an actor often says

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.320
if they're gonna play a serial killer or a terrible person,

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.000
they have to find something within them

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.800
that they can relate to.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.000
When you guys watch bad movies or choose bad movies,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.640
there has to be a level on which you like it

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.240
in order to make fun of it.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.040
Yeah, I mean, we have to enjoy watching it.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.160
I don't know whether that means we like it or not,

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.840
because there are definitely ones

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.960
that are on our reject pile

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960
that we just have no fun at all watching.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.320
And we just, we realize that'll be the experience

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.200
no matter how many jokes we sling.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.480
Is that because they're so bad

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.080
or just because there's not the opportunity

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.240
or like, oh, this is so bad that there's nothing?

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.080
A little of both.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.200
Sometimes it's just technical.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.680
Sometimes it's just really, really, really boring.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.160
And we don't find a way to make some fun

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.120
around the boringness.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.960
I think that's, I actually think that those movies

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.700
outnumber the good, bad movies.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.120
I don't know if you have listened to the Flophouse,

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.660
a podcast that actually very recently joined Maximum Fun,

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.600
but they talk about bad movies.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.240
And they have a scale of movie qualities.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.640
Is the movie good?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.600
Is the movie good, bad?

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.960
Or is it just like, not?

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.520
There are so many movies that just lack any redeeming value,

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.680
whether it be, you know, genuine or ironic.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.100
Oh yeah, well put, yep.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.320
Bill Corbett, thank you so much for joining us

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.400
on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.240
It's been a genuine thrill and dare I say, an honor

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.280
to have you on the program. Shucks, guys.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.160
What a pleasure talking to you guys.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.520
Where can people find your holiday themed comic book

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.600
Superpowered Revenge Christmas?

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.040
You just put all those words together that you just said

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.560
and add.com and there's all sorts of ways to get it there.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.480
Superpoweredrevengechristmas.com.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.280
And of course, if you've never seen Riffrax or MS-23K,

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.560
then you're dumb and you should go do that.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.140
Those people don't, I don't think there is a Venn diagram

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.120
between those things in this show.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.480
I think that it's just a big circle.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.320
I tend to agree.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.720
Is there anything else you want to plug?

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.640
Plug anything.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.500
No, thank you.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.440
That's what I like to hear.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.360
Bill Corbett, thank you so much for joining us

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.280
and have a great rest of your week.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.120
You too, guys.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.520
I guess it's something people say at the end of the day.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.360
Never!

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.640
I'm gonna do it.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.040
I'm taking you seriously.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.200
I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.980
He was fully planning on having a super shitty Friday

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.840
and you just turned it around for him.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.680
I'm going for it.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.360
I'm Terry's brother, Jerry Gross,

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.440
and this has been our interview.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.700
Trav, we got a lot of, well, first we should say thank you

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.040
to Bill Corbett for joining us.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.920
What a treat it was to have that cat on.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.460
Travis, we got a lot of live shows coming up.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.300
That's great.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.120
Announced a lot this week.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:35.960
What's the haps?

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.000
Give me the 411.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.920
Okay.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.760
Well, we already talked about-

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.600
Give me the 311.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.420
Okay, great.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.260
We already talked about the-

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.100
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:43.920
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.760
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.580
Emma is the color of our energy.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.620
Okay, you guys are the worst.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.460
Whoa!

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.980
We already talked about the Candlelight's live show.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.020
Crazy game of poker.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.280
Bit.ly forward slash Candlelight's live.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.000
Also, if you're going to be at the show

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.440
or if you just have a Candlelight's question,

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.880
make sure you email that to us

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.660
and put Candlelight's in the subject line

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.000
so we know that that's what it's about.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.600
We also just announced a Los Angeles live show

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.300
with my brother, my brother, me, and Sawbones

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.600
on February 6th at 9.30 at the Masonic Temple

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.920
in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.880
Tickets for that go on sale the 16th,

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.740
and that's bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M-L-A.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.600
And we will also be at San Francisco Sketch Fest

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.640
with Jordan Jesse Goh on February 7th.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.700
And tickets for that go on sale,

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.400
well, they're going on sale right now.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.900
And that is bit.ly forward slash M-B-M-B-A-M Sketch Fest.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.700
And make sure you grab all those tickets

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.960
and then also January 6th at UCB Franklin

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.020
here in Los Angeles at 11 p.m.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.840
Bunker Buddies is gonna do a live show

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.880
with Jordan Jesse Goh.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.920
Tickets for that will be going on sale soon.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.800
And we'd love to see you there.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.440
It's gonna be mine and Andy's first live show.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440
We're very excited about it.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.120
And if you wanna go to a live show for the Adventure Zone,

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.360
it'll never happen because I will never be confident enough

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.000
to make that happen.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.800
And we would have to swear you to silence

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.320
because we record for four hours

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.800
and then edit it down to an hour.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.760
And then, yeah.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.800
You must never know the terrible rules

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.840
discussing what happens.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.520
All the dull dice rolling that Griffin has edited out.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.120
All the dullest complaints.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.080
I actually leave the sound of the dice in

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.200
because people like get off on that shit.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.480
They got their ASMR.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.280
Speaking of, go check out the Adventure Zone

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.140
if you haven't yet.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.720
And then also, which is our D&D podcast

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.820
that we do with our dad.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.920
And then go listen to Sawbones,

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.760
which is Justin and Sydney's podcast.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.440
And go listen to Bunker Buddies,

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.960
which is mine and Andy's podcast.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.080
And then go listen to Big Gulp if you can find it.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.920
Here's a little taste of the Adventure Zone

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.920
just for people who haven't tried it out

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.200
and maybe want a little sampler box.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.400
It's basically just like,

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.440
mm, I cast the magic spells at the orchid.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.020
How many points do I get?

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:58.860
That's what our dad sounds like.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.700
And that's what our dad.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.640
If you haven't heard our dad, he is a-

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.200
Now, can we have a sample of Big Gulp

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.640
as long as you're giving out free samples?

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.480
Yeah, sure.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.360
This week on Big Gulp, Monstro.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.740
Sexiest whale yet?

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.120
Thanks to Nature Box.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.480
Speaking of free samples,

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.400
go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.880
Sign up to get your free sampler box

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.680
of great tasting, healthy snacks.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.360
Snacks.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.440
It's a fun word.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.040
As we head into 2015,

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.240
it's a good time to think about

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.560
when you want a birthday message

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.880
because we'll probably end up doing it two months late.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.480
So if you want to wish someone a happy birthday

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.520
or get your Kickstarter or website or something

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520
talked about on the show,

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.640
go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.060
and all the instructions on how to get

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.240
into the money zone are there.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.760
So go do that and we'll see you in 2015.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.520
Do you guys think that 2015 is going to be better

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.840
than this fucking dumpster of a year?

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.880
Do you want to know?

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.480
I had a thought as to what the title for 2015 should be.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.460
Yeah, you told us and it didn't really set our asses on fire

01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.300
like it did for you.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.200
You didn't like it?

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.040
Well, just go and say it.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.200
I was a 2015 and it's all about giving to others

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.240
and taking care of the planet and shit.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.560
That's really good, Trav.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.400
Thank you.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.900
I have one other suggestion.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.700
20 Drifting, fire it up.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.400
Get behind the car in front of you.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.600
Go faster as a result of air pressure reduction.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.420
20 Drifting.

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:21.580
Let me hit you with this though.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.800
20 Gulpting.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.280
That's a little promotional for my taste.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.400
We got a YouTube channel, nbmbam.com slash YouTube.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.240
No.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.080
No?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:33.900
No?

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.740
No?

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.120
I went, we bought YouTube so fuck you.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.640
You want to get YouTube, you got to go to my

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.560
Where's my Rhyme of Gotham sound though?

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.160
Slash Studio City slash GeoCity slash Tripod

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.000
slash Angel Fire slash YouTube

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.960
and you'll find all your videos there.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.800
Where's all my Beyonce songs?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.700
They're all at YouTube.com slash nbmbam

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:56.960
is our actual address.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.600
Thanks again to Bill Corbett, by the way,

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.440
for joining us on the show.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.480
That was a lot of fun and what an honor

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.440
to have that guy on.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.620
Next week is our,

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.960
next week's our Candle Nights Live show, Spectacular.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.360
It might be up late because we're recording it

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.200
late Sunday night and that is way later

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.960
than I usually edit the show.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.840
So maybe a Tuesday episode.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.280
Sorry for the lateness.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.480
You will get it before Christmas.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.320
Oh, you'll get it, yeah, definitely, definitely.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.080
And again, like our other Candle Nights shows,

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.040
that'll be clean so you can listen to it with family

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.320
and not feel uncomfortable about it.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.800
And we want to say thanks to John Roderick

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.760
and the Long Winters for the use of their theme song.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.240
It's a departure from the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.640
Well, it's our theme song, not really theirs.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.120
So if you're gonna steal my fucking game, then just-

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.400
Well, you weren't doing it.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.440
You weren't doing it.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.640
You should listen to John Roderick's Christmas album too.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.480
Who's Rod Ruck?

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.400
Oh yeah, One Christmas at a Time.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.400
Him and Jonathan Colton did a great Christmas album

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.840
you should listen to.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.780
That's gonna do it for us.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:51.620
We're done.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:52.440
We're done, final yahoo.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.280
We love you.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.160
We love you very much.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.920
This final yahoo was sent in by Connor Stuxlager.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.520
Hell of a name.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.360
Thank you, Connor.

It's by Yahoo Answers User.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.080
They are suspended.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.660
But when they were living, they asked,

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.760
do you think Santa Claus is opposed

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.120
to Obama's death panels?

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.800
Wow.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.800
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.200
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.760
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.920
Kiss your dad.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.940
Square on the lips.

Welcome to Oh No!

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.800
Ross and Carrie.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800
Ross.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.800
Hi Carrie.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.800
What do you think is creepier?

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.800
Okay.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.800
If you go into a swimming pool, all of a sudden, the water goes away and instead of water,

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:04.960
there is the bones of your dead ancestors or our show.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.320
That's pretty tough because we visited a live exorcism.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.040
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis where we had to worship a naked lady.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.960
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960
They were scary.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.960
Super creepy.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960
We joined the Ethere Society.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.360
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.840
Oh boy, I tried breast enlargement.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.960
We have basically done every creepy, weird, fringe thing except for thousands more, which

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.680
we will get to if you listen to our show.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.160
I'd still say the swimming pool of my ancestors' bones.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.120
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.120
I guess they shouldn't.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.440
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun and the show's called Oh No!

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:52.520
Ross and Carrie.
