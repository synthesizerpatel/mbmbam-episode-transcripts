WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.120
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.120 --> 00:50.720
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.720 --> 01:01.520
And I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.160
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:12.160 --> 01:22.720
Hello, hello. You must be the city beautiful.

01:24.480 --> 01:30.800
O-town. O-town? O-town. The band, not you. You all cheesing.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.760
Are you all O-town the band? I'm just seeing if O-town is here.

01:33.760 --> 01:38.320
I left them tickets at will call. They're a 2,000 person super group, O-town.

01:38.320 --> 01:43.040
And they're a militia. Did you know O-town is a militia now?

01:44.480 --> 01:49.120
90s kids, remember them? You'll never believe where they are now.

01:49.120 --> 01:54.240
They're a militia. Oh, they live in the Everglades.

01:56.480 --> 02:02.960
So we have spent the last, it feels like goddammit, a year at Disney World.

02:02.960 --> 02:13.040
Yeah. Okay. It's so choice. I've been there with my many children for two years in a row.

02:14.640 --> 02:21.200
Paul asked me, did you have fun? And I told him, well, I'm a parent. So it's not so much

02:21.200 --> 02:28.960
like having fun as is dying on the cross for the entertainment of your children.

02:28.960 --> 02:37.120
Because I can't do any of the good stuff anymore. And they just, it's so hot.

02:37.120 --> 02:44.240
And they don't care. They don't care. It's my problem that it's hot is my fault.

02:44.240 --> 02:51.840
My favorite thing. So my daughter is almost two and it's really fun. No. And it's really fun

02:52.480 --> 02:56.160
to watch as our personality develops. And like, there's something, because when

02:56.160 --> 03:01.680
they're a baby, you project a lot and you say like, oh, they love jokes.

03:01.680 --> 03:05.200
But then when they actually form a personality, you're like, oh, I know what they like and don't

03:05.200 --> 03:09.120
like now. And we were at a breakfast this morning, which unbeknownst to us,

03:09.120 --> 03:16.720
turned out to be a character breakfast. And Rapunzel showed up and BB was like,

03:16.720 --> 03:24.960
kind of like, okay. And then later Ariel showed up and BB was way into Ariel.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.600
Much like teenage Travis.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.040
And adult Travis.

03:34.640 --> 03:41.520
And then, but in between, in between Rapunzel and Ariel and after Ariel,

03:41.520 --> 03:47.520
Flynn Rider showed up and Prince Eric showed up and she was not into them.

03:47.520 --> 03:54.960
This is, this is her with Rapunzel. Hmm. This is her with Flynn Rider and Prince Eric.

03:56.720 --> 04:01.760
By the way, I hope Prince Eric just picked up a frying pan and was Flynn Rider.

04:01.760 --> 04:07.280
Cause there ain't no fucking difference. They're the same dude. Okay. Sorry.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.080
Them and post-transformation beasts.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.480
Have we, have.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.480
Who isn't as attractive as pre-transformation beasts. So furries. I get it.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.080
Sure. I get it.

04:18.080 --> 04:18.880
He's way more.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.680
Pre-transformation beasts fights off like 12 wolves.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.840
So beefy and diesel.

04:23.840 --> 04:24.560
Here's my one.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.280
Oh my God.

04:25.280 --> 04:31.280
Here's my one about Disney. Here's my one. We all went to the animal kingdom, got wild

04:32.720 --> 04:36.560
over there. And we got on the train over to Rafiki's Planet Watch.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.720
Oh fuck. This is so choice.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.840
Griffin, will you actually tell. Okay. I'll tell the first half.

04:41.840 --> 04:46.160
So there's a guy there and he's like, there's a guy named Rick. He's an old man in front of us.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.840
And Rick's like, and.

04:47.840 --> 04:51.360
He's actually 25. He just worked with kids for the last five years.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.920
He's like, and also no smoking is permitted on the train.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.200
And I start asking him in increasing volumes, like, can we vape?

05:02.960 --> 05:03.760
Can we vape?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.120
At this frequency.

05:05.120 --> 05:11.360
Rick, can we vape? Hey Rick. Hey Rick. Rick, can we vape? Rick, can we vape?

05:11.360 --> 05:12.320
At which point.

05:12.320 --> 05:18.320
At which point the woman sitting next to Justin says, no.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.240
So fucking choice. So tight.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.400
Feed it to me slowly like grapes.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.920
That's my shit right there.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.400
That's my shit.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.440
Cause Justin immediately went.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.240
For the whole fucking train ride.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.880
We went to the petting zoo, touching goats and shit.

05:40.880 --> 05:46.240
And Justin was still like, fucking paralyzed by the, oh man.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.040
It was so tight.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.760
Here's my Disney thing.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.120
Can we talk about how every fucking attraction at that park,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.880
which I had a beautiful, wonderful time in.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.240
This is the Walt Disney theater.

05:59.440 --> 06:05.040
Every single attraction at that park has a scary part in it.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.600
It's got a scary dubstep drop somewhere in the middle of it,

06:09.600 --> 06:14.080
which isn't so good when you're there with a 20 month old and you're like,

06:14.080 --> 06:15.440
oh, it's the Winnie the Pooh ride.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.720
It's going to be great.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.600
And then you've got like one room where you're going through the hundred acre wood

06:19.600 --> 06:22.800
and there's Piglet like playing tug of war with Roo or some shit.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.480
And you're like, this is so nice.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.160
And the baby's like, this is so nice.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.120
And then you turn the corner and you're in like Tigger's abyss

06:30.880 --> 06:35.280
where it's fucking pitch black and he crawls out of the void and it's like,

06:35.280 --> 06:36.880
time to bounce motherfuckers.

06:36.880 --> 06:46.000
And then your cart rocks back and forth for what feels like 20 minutes.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.280
And then you go into like the Heffalump nightmare zone

06:51.280 --> 06:55.600
where these neon elephants scream like, I'm going to kill your son, Griffin.

06:57.920 --> 07:02.080
It's the longer portion of the ride than the 100 acre wood part.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.960
Like acid flashback is the long part.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.360
During the Kilimanjaro Safari in Animal Kingdom,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.280
it's like there's a zebra, there's a giraffe.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.920
Uh oh, this bridge looks pretty rickety.

07:11.920 --> 07:12.640
Whoa, whoa.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.160
Why did there need to be a fucking scary part on this safari?

07:17.120 --> 07:20.080
It's like Walt Disney was like, pleasure and pain.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.160
Hot and cold.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.880
We will have both.

07:24.880 --> 07:29.200
So on this show, we talk about Disney and take your questions

07:29.200 --> 07:31.280
and turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.960
We got a bunch of questions from you, the gathered audience.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.560
Uh, so we're going to get to them now.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.600
We got some other stuff.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.160
Okay.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.560
Oh, did you just turn on some speakers up there or something?

07:45.120 --> 07:45.680
Nice.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.400
So, all right, let's start over.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.760
We did a Disney bit.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.280
Oh, I didn't even get to the figment thing.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.560
Oh, the figment broke down.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.480
Oh, the figment broke down.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.920
We are stuck on that shit for 45 minutes.

07:59.920 --> 08:04.480
I want to say, I will say, I want to say one more bit about this.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.520
Figment broke down and it was a ride.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.080
My daughter was already like, I don't fucking think so, old man.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.240
It seems whack as shit.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.240
I know it's probably dope when dream master's there.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.160
Now it's an old man from Monty Python shouting at me about my imagination.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.520
I don't know about this.

08:19.520 --> 08:25.280
Halfway through, it like fully, fully breaks down to where like lights are on.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.520
They are coming and getting us off the ride, walking through.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.240
Oh, my God.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.280
Brutal.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.560
Like talk about the fourth wall just like tinkly shattering.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.640
And the worst imaginable ride.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.040
Think use your imagination as you see.

08:39.760 --> 08:45.120
We get back to the gate and there's a good natured cast member there

08:45.120 --> 08:47.360
who scans our little magic band.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.640
He's like, and we just put a free fast pass on there

08:50.640 --> 08:53.920
and that's good for any ride in the park except for Soarin'.

08:53.920 --> 08:58.320
And I asked him exactly how long would I have to be trapped on this ride

08:58.320 --> 09:04.720
to get on the Soarin' because that must be one very good ride, mon frere.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.320
Anyway, so that was an example of the kind of Disney stories

09:08.320 --> 09:11.040
we've been telling for 30 minutes or so.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.240
My friend has always had difficulty understanding boundaries

09:14.240 --> 09:18.960
and she has often invited herself to things that she probably should not attend

09:19.520 --> 09:24.960
such as my doctor's appointment and dates out with my super hot boyfriend.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.160
OK, all right.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.320
All right, how can I tactfully tell her that I'd like to be alone

09:30.320 --> 09:34.000
with my gynecologist and also with my super hot boyfriend?

09:34.560 --> 09:35.520
And that's from Jamie.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.320
Jamie, are you here?

09:37.840 --> 09:38.400
Nice.

09:38.400 --> 09:38.640
Nice.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.800
Jamie's, Jamie's boyfriend just sat up a little straighter.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.000
See?

09:44.000 --> 09:44.560
Oh, nice.

09:45.120 --> 09:45.680
Oh, cool.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.640
I guess so.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.280
That's me.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.160
Yowza.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.240
That's rough.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.520
How does that go?

09:55.520 --> 09:58.880
Like, do you like you're with the friend and you're like,

09:58.880 --> 10:01.120
well, I got to go to a doctor's appointment and they're like,

10:01.120 --> 10:03.520
cool, room for a little school.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.320
Shotgun.

10:07.440 --> 10:14.400
Is it possible, is it possible that they're in the market for a new gynecologist

10:15.840 --> 10:18.560
and they just want to see how they work it?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.240
Just want to see how they do it.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.560
How do they do it? How does your gynecologist do it?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.480
Maybe you're like, sit in the back.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.600
Your friends like judging and praising like, hmm, pretty good.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.480
Other side of that coin.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.800
Are they in the market for a super hot boyfriend?

10:35.360 --> 10:35.920
Right.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.000
And they just want to see how your super hot boyfriend works.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.480
I've been thinking about getting a super hot boyfriend myself.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.400
Let me see how it's, let me kick the tires on this relationship.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.520
See if it's worth the effort.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.440
Oh, kissing.

10:47.440 --> 10:47.760
Good.

10:48.880 --> 10:49.600
I heard of that.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.320
I like it.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.960
Yeah. Nice.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.760
Smooch it out.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.280
Is your friend at all supportive when they're there at these places with you?

10:57.280 --> 10:58.320
He's asking rhetorically.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.920
Of course you're a thousand years away.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.520
Is there that much variety in the gynecologist game?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.080
I have no way of answering this question.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.120
Neither do you two.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.680
Nobody on this stage knows how to answer that question.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.160
Oh no.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.920
Oh, who was that for?

11:21.920 --> 11:25.680
My wife is backstage like screaming like, yeah, some are terrible.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.400
Yeah, probably.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.280
And some super hot boyfriends are also pretty, pretty bad.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.520
Not, not that one though.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.560
You're all right.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.840
Jamie, is your super hot boyfriend here?

11:38.960 --> 11:39.280
Yeah.

11:42.720 --> 11:43.840
I did hear a second.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.280
Yeah, there where I might say kudos on the confidence.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.400
Can we get actually silenced?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.200
Obviously we can't see you and we wouldn't want to put you on blast like that.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.320
But just like we can tell from the voice, if you can just say like, yeah, I'm here.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.000
That's a good bank, Mary.

12:04.000 --> 12:04.560
Damn.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.280
Damn, Mary.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.560
Damn, Mary.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.400
That's a good bank.

12:08.400 --> 12:08.640
Damn.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.960
That shit proved just long enough, Mary.

12:10.960 --> 12:11.200
Damn.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.720
Look at that crumb.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.160
No soggy bottom on that one.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.360
Damn, Mary.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.240
Damn.

12:18.240 --> 12:18.960
Good bank.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.240
Shit.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.960
Let me get like something else.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.600
Like, hey, come hop in my Jaguar.

12:28.880 --> 12:29.520
Hold on, wait.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.480
One, two, three, go.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.960
We've got a star baker right here.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.080
Damn, I'm about to get the vapors up here.

12:42.080 --> 12:42.400
Shit.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.960
That's a beefy guy you got there.

12:44.960 --> 12:45.360
Dang.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.600
Can you, maybe she just thinks he's sexy and wants to be around him.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.840
Maybe your friend is just trying to steal your boyfriend.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.600
No problem at all.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.520
Maybe she's Mr. Steal Your Man.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.080
No, listen.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.080
What if, I mean, can you blame her though?

13:04.080 --> 13:05.200
That's kind of where I'm at.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.840
He's just a disembodied voice in the darkness to me,

13:07.840 --> 13:10.320
and I already want to take him to Chunky Cheese.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.400
Shit.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.800
It sounded like you said Chunky Cheese.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.480
That's a different place where we are going.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.960
How about a Yahoo?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.960
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.160
Thank you, Adrian.

13:28.160 --> 13:32.480
It's Yahoo Answers user, Amen, who asks.

13:32.480 --> 13:32.960
Hey, wait.

13:32.960 --> 13:33.680
Quick timeout.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.920
Before I forget, can you please record yourself saying that stuff

13:37.920 --> 13:40.160
and email it to us so we can put it in the episode?

13:40.160 --> 13:40.640
Oh, yeah.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.760
We have to edit it in later.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.680
We're going to edit it in in post, so if you could do that.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.440
And I'll say Justin just wants it for a reason.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.200
You could just, shut up.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.880
You can just use voice memos.

13:49.440 --> 13:49.920
Yeah.

13:49.920 --> 13:50.800
Figure it out.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.400
Amen is your chance to start them.

13:52.400 --> 13:57.200
Amen asks, there's an important surfing competition in September.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.000
Dad, I want to go to that before I graduate college.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.920
Please, Dad, please say yes.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.840
Please, Dad, please say yes.

14:07.360 --> 14:07.860
Huh.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.520
That's the narrowest cast I've ever seen.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.120
That's like saying, I want to catch that fish.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.220
What?

14:19.600 --> 14:20.720
Is it your son?

14:20.720 --> 14:21.680
Is it your son?

14:21.680 --> 14:22.480
It's my son.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.120
He's 20 months old.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.240
He's got some time till college.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.280
Unless he's a real Doogie Howser.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.960
Have you heard of Baby Freshman?

14:33.760 --> 14:34.800
He's so cool.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.200
Skateboards to class on his knees.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.560
Can't walk super good yet.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.560
He's doing so bad.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.160
Can't read.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.040
Can't read or talk.

14:45.040 --> 14:45.840
So bad.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.800
So bad.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.000
He is a college student.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.400
Failure at all of it.

14:52.400 --> 14:59.920
At all of it, yeah, so that's a hard no from me to my son,

14:59.920 --> 15:01.600
but that's probably not what they're asking.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.480
That's how your son is trying to get in touch with you.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.440
That's how Griffin tells his son he has to contact him.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.200
Yeah, Griffin's son walks in and says,

15:09.200 --> 15:10.800
hey, Dad, I have a quick question for you.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.600
And I say, holy shit, you're talking so good.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.100
How?

15:14.800 --> 15:15.200
No, you said-

15:15.200 --> 15:16.080
Put it in the bit.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.200
Okay, I'm in the bit.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.000
Go in the bit.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.680
Hey, Dad, I have a question for you.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.360
Okay, yes, yes.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.400
But you know how to do this, though.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.960
You know the correct way to file a question with your father.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.040
Dad, please, I'm in the room.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.560
The only means of communication that mean fucking anything to me anymore

15:32.560 --> 15:33.680
is Yahoo Answers.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.080
I've been on this website for 20 some odd years now.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.520
Yes, type away.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.020
Send.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.080
Any responses?

15:42.640 --> 15:45.040
There's one from Lucifer Morningstar.

15:45.040 --> 15:45.540
Okay.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.440
Okay, not a given name.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.600
Lucifer Morningstar did say,

15:51.600 --> 15:56.400
seems you have skipped classes before, mahalo.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.920
Do you mean mahalo?

15:59.920 --> 16:02.080
Like if you're trying to dunk on somebody?

16:02.080 --> 16:05.280
What a weird way to end that, like, seems like you skip classes.

16:05.280 --> 16:05.780
Mahalo.

16:07.120 --> 16:07.620
Mahalo.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.240
Also, how do you know they've skipped class?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.320
Oh, because they spelled September with two Ps.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.280
I'm looking at it now.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.320
It's my son, Travis, can you not?

16:19.840 --> 16:20.800
So what do you say?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.600
Yeah, I mean, no, you definitely can't.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.480
Because that means I have to go to the surfing competition

16:26.480 --> 16:28.320
and I've got stuff to do in September.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.120
Wait, hold on, there's something.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
I just found something on the news, sir.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.760
Riddled me piss!

16:35.760 --> 16:46.240
Riddled me piss!

16:46.240 --> 16:49.360
I found a riddle beneath the table.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.280
I've never had to look at you do it before.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.040
Do you do the eyes when you're at your house?

16:57.040 --> 16:57.680
Yes, I do.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.480
It's a whole thing.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.320
Sure.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.440
So as I'm sure everybody knows, riddle me piss.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.280
If you've listened to the last two episodes,

17:07.280 --> 17:08.480
if you've been skipping lately,

17:08.480 --> 17:10.160
which I totally don't blame you for.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.280
You're probably very confused.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.560
We do riddles now.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.880
Travis does this whole green goblin thing.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.600
It's dope.

17:19.360 --> 17:22.880
This was a submission by Hal.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.520
There are people finding these for us now?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.080
Yes.

17:26.080 --> 17:26.880
It's a bummer.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.480
Now listen closely.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.920
There are very many elements at play here.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.420
Shit.

17:32.420 --> 17:36.580
Riley has four dogs.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.500
Ben has seven dogs.

17:41.780 --> 17:45.380
Ashley with an E has two fish.

17:46.020 --> 17:50.180
Ashley without an E has six fish.

17:50.900 --> 17:55.620
How many fish does Ashley with an E have?

17:55.620 --> 18:04.100
Wait, is this just a...

18:04.100 --> 18:05.620
Can you read it again like a human?

18:05.620 --> 18:06.580
No, because it's a memory challenge.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.660
Riley has four dogs.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.540
Ben has seven dogs.

18:12.260 --> 18:15.860
Ashley with an E has two fish.

18:15.860 --> 18:16.900
This is Travis' normal voice.

18:16.900 --> 18:20.500
Ashley without an E has six fish.

18:20.500 --> 18:25.140
How many fish does Ashley with an E have?

18:25.860 --> 18:26.360
Two.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.340
Nah, y'all dumb.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.380
Eight.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.340
Ashley with an E and Ashley without an E are sisters.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.580
That is no exaggeration.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.540
The worst hurdle I've ever heard in my entire life.

18:51.540 --> 18:52.340
Yes, okay.

18:52.900 --> 18:57.460
Because it also assumes that there are parents who named both their daughters Ashley,

18:57.460 --> 18:58.420
but with varying...

18:59.380 --> 19:00.580
Maybe they're twins.

19:02.020 --> 19:07.620
But also, she doesn't.

19:07.620 --> 19:12.260
Because what we've established is two belong to one and six belong to the other.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.220
She doesn't.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.220
She has two.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.620
There are two fish.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.220
There are four lights.

19:19.220 --> 19:27.140
Also, why did we need to catalog the dogs at the beginning of the riddle?

19:27.780 --> 19:29.620
That was a red herring.

19:29.620 --> 19:30.820
No, it was a dog.

19:33.620 --> 19:34.660
That sucked.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.940
That sucked a lot.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.220
That fucking sucked, dude.

19:38.420 --> 19:39.060
Damn.

19:39.060 --> 19:40.660
And that was Riddle Me Please.

19:40.660 --> 19:41.060
Thank you.

19:43.220 --> 19:44.260
You deserve that.

19:44.260 --> 19:44.660
Thank you.

19:44.660 --> 19:46.820
Oh, thank you.

19:47.540 --> 19:50.660
I live in Orlando, which means by default, I work in a theme park.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.100
Oh, he gives one to Justin, takes Travis's away.

19:56.740 --> 19:58.660
That's just whiskey and ice, Paul.

19:58.660 --> 19:59.460
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:59.460 --> 20:00.740
Oh, that explains a lot.

20:00.740 --> 20:03.700
Ladies and gentlemen, while I love working in...

20:03.700 --> 20:04.020
Hold on.

20:04.020 --> 20:05.380
Start this question over, please.

20:05.380 --> 20:12.340
I live in Orlando, O-Town, which means by default, I work in a theme park.

20:12.340 --> 20:16.500
While I love working in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios...

20:17.380 --> 20:18.260
You've heard of it.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.340
It's sometimes hard to stay in character.

20:20.340 --> 20:24.580
About once a week, a child will point their wand at me and say, Avada Kedavra.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.980
Which, that's the killing curse.

20:30.180 --> 20:33.460
How do I keep in character while dealing with homicidal children?

20:37.300 --> 20:37.780
Robbie.

20:37.780 --> 20:41.220
No, it says in parenthesis, P.S. Travis, your hair looks great today.

20:44.020 --> 20:47.380
The parenthetical, I assumed, was just not for public consumption.

20:47.380 --> 20:47.860
Oh, maybe.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.180
I think if you get hit with a...

20:52.180 --> 20:53.540
Sorry, I'm a...

20:53.540 --> 20:54.340
If you don't say it right, it doesn't...

20:54.340 --> 20:55.460
I'm more of a sports guy.

20:55.460 --> 20:55.940
Yeah.

20:55.940 --> 20:56.440
Hold on.

20:57.140 --> 21:01.940
Avada Kedavra, I think you lay down on the ground, and it's break time.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.060
It's break time for you.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.380
It's break time for you.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.820
Josh or me, get back to work.

21:08.820 --> 21:09.540
I can't.

21:09.540 --> 21:10.500
I'm dead.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.540
I'm dead.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.460
That little muggle killed me.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.220
I'm amazed because...

21:17.220 --> 21:19.940
Okay, here's the sad truth.

21:20.900 --> 21:26.100
I thought about what would happen if you did this when I was at Harry Potter on Wednesday,

21:26.100 --> 21:28.180
and I had a wand that I bought.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:30.980 --> 21:34.660
Wait, you thought about killing somebody at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter?

21:35.220 --> 21:38.580
Hey, I don't know if you've been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter recently.

21:38.580 --> 21:40.660
I thought about killing a lot of fucking people.

21:44.180 --> 21:44.660
Thank you.

21:45.460 --> 21:48.900
And here's what I no joke assumed would happen.

21:48.900 --> 21:53.780
If I said Avada Kedavra, everybody that was working and maybe some other people too would go

21:55.380 --> 21:58.900
and then I would be arrested and put in a wizard jail.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.980
I would be sent to Azkaban, i.e. outside the park.

22:03.940 --> 22:08.500
That's how you start the ARG where you get thrown into the wizarding jail of Harry Potter.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.980
Or if they were just like, that fucking sucks.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.140
What if that worked?

22:15.140 --> 22:15.780
Get out of here.

22:15.780 --> 22:16.900
Hey, wait, are you here?

22:17.780 --> 22:18.580
Cool.

22:18.580 --> 22:23.060
I would lean into the role play and just look at them and be like, are you a wizard?

22:23.060 --> 22:24.020
No, I thought not.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.780
You bought a ticket to get in here, idiot.

22:25.780 --> 22:29.940
That's a stick of wood in your hand and you're talking a bunch of baby talk

22:29.940 --> 22:33.140
and then snap the wand over your knee and they'll go get another one

22:33.140 --> 22:36.180
and you'll get fired and there's not an end to the paragraph.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.540
They'll be in a lot of trouble for no reason.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.980
So don't do what Justin said.

22:40.980 --> 22:41.940
Don't do what I said.

22:41.940 --> 22:44.260
Is there a jail at Universal Studios?

22:45.220 --> 22:45.700
Yes.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.220
It's probably not fun.

22:47.220 --> 22:48.500
Like, poor kids.

22:48.500 --> 22:53.860
There's probably not dementors floating around and old wizards like Bellatrix Lestrange,

22:53.860 --> 22:56.020
like, what are you?

22:56.020 --> 22:58.100
And it's probably just kind of jail.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.260
Just people who got drunk at most have.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.140
Hey, P.S.

23:01.860 --> 23:03.380
One, it's called The Brig.

23:03.380 --> 23:11.460
Two, way too many of you were able to confirm the presence of a jail at Universal Studios.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.220
How's it going?

23:13.780 --> 23:17.140
A lot of people trying to step on Krusty's feet, it would seem.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.460
Dag.

23:19.460 --> 23:24.260
A lot of y'all went to Universal Jail.

23:24.260 --> 23:25.060
How about a Yahoo?

23:27.860 --> 23:29.620
Here's one sent in by Graham Roebuck.

23:29.620 --> 23:30.180
Thank you, Graham.

23:30.180 --> 23:34.980
It's from Yahoo Answers user Magical Hats, who asks,

23:34.980 --> 23:39.540
have any of you ever used a video game slash movie fight move in real life?

23:39.540 --> 23:41.700
If so, please tell me how it went.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.500
One time I inhaled a guy.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.620
A guy like Kirby.

23:50.820 --> 23:51.780
Like Kirby?

23:51.780 --> 23:52.020
Yeah.

23:53.380 --> 23:55.540
Like he came at me fist swing and I just went.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.700
And you got him, you got him down.

23:59.700 --> 24:00.580
I inhaled him.

24:00.580 --> 24:00.980
Cool.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.260
Did you get his powers?

24:02.260 --> 24:02.980
I did.

24:02.980 --> 24:03.460
Awesome.

24:03.460 --> 24:04.900
He had purple hair.

24:04.900 --> 24:05.220
Yeah.

24:07.060 --> 24:09.460
And that's, that's.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.060
I nailed him.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.020
I nailed him.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.060
That's my defense.

24:15.060 --> 24:15.860
All right.

24:15.860 --> 24:16.820
Doesn't seem likely.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.900
I did a booger man to a guy once.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.420
I did a booger man.

24:24.420 --> 24:25.700
I did a matrix jump.

24:27.220 --> 24:28.100
So cool.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.460
I did both at once once.

24:30.500 --> 24:34.500
When I was in seventh grade, the kids would fall over every time I had Duke.

24:34.500 --> 24:38.100
And then I found out at the end of the year, they all thought I was really sick.

24:38.100 --> 24:43.380
So they were just, they were just humoring me.

24:43.380 --> 24:43.860
What?

24:43.860 --> 24:45.300
Is that a real story?

24:45.300 --> 24:47.700
No, Griffin, it's a fucking grand fabrication.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.540
A beautiful crystalline egg.

24:51.540 --> 24:54.180
A lovely lacy decolletage.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.860
That's not the right word.

24:55.860 --> 24:56.980
That's not the right word at all.

24:56.980 --> 24:58.020
Like a lacy.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.460
Just like a beautiful fabrication.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.100
Yeah, no.

25:02.100 --> 25:02.740
No, and you tricked.

25:02.740 --> 25:03.060
It's a good trick.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.620
Porcelain, porcelain, you know.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.780
There's some really good answers on this.

25:07.780 --> 25:09.380
Gossamer Daydream.

25:09.380 --> 25:09.700
Sure.

25:11.060 --> 25:11.460
Bane.

25:11.460 --> 25:18.420
Yahoo Answers Bane and you know it's going to be tight already says, kind of.

25:18.420 --> 25:21.140
Total War games made me a better driver.

25:21.140 --> 25:22.420
I became, yeah.

25:23.700 --> 25:28.020
I became very tactical in busy parking lots and became a master of traffic lights.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.020
Are there a lot of those in Total War?

25:32.020 --> 25:32.660
Uh huh.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.860
I can avoid cluster fucks and red lights like a champ.

25:35.860 --> 25:40.740
I got so good at strategic driving in my area that I let people road rage already knowing

25:40.740 --> 25:44.980
that they're going to get jammed up and I will pass them at the speed limit with a smile.

25:46.660 --> 25:51.620
Lots of flanks and figuring out what drivers are going to do before they do it.

25:51.620 --> 25:53.940
I mix this with the knowledge of the traffic light.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.780
I'm a real force to be reckoned with.

25:55.780 --> 25:57.860
I apply this when I'm on foot as well.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.540
In addition, I have not been pulled over by police in nine years.

26:01.540 --> 26:02.820
Total War did this.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.060
Powerful.

26:07.060 --> 26:11.700
I guess my question to that is what knowledge of the traffic light besides like,

26:11.700 --> 26:12.660
ah, that's red.

26:12.660 --> 26:14.020
I can't go anymore.

26:14.020 --> 26:14.500
Yeah.

26:17.140 --> 26:22.340
Yahoo Answers user Stallion says, let's just say trying shadow clone jitsu in a fight is

26:22.340 --> 26:23.380
not a good idea.

26:23.380 --> 26:24.580
It's not my fault.

26:24.580 --> 26:25.620
I got crushed.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.460
His power level was over 9,000.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.260
What was I thinking?

26:28.260 --> 26:29.300
How could I be so careless?

26:29.300 --> 26:31.140
I need to practice my chakra.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.340
So good.

26:33.780 --> 26:35.540
Yahoo Answers user question mark says,

26:35.540 --> 26:38.100
Yahoo Answers user question mark says, not yet.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.700
Thank you for weighing in.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.860
But I have big plans.

26:43.860 --> 26:45.300
Thanks for getting in there.

26:48.020 --> 26:51.380
It occurred to me we didn't explain the name tags.

26:51.380 --> 26:54.580
So people probably think that we're kind of jokesters and pranksters.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.460
Are you not wearing your script?

26:55.460 --> 26:56.180
I was on my hoodie.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.940
I took it off when we were talking about the BG boyfriend.

26:57.940 --> 26:58.340
All right.

26:58.900 --> 27:04.500
We have played at probably over 60 videos of this great land of ours all across the nation.

27:04.500 --> 27:10.660
We have never been gifted venue-specific name tags backstage in our dressing room.

27:10.660 --> 27:14.260
There's this name tag that says Justin on it, which I think is very nice.

27:14.260 --> 27:21.620
And we all three decided we would wear them as kind of like a fun bit of whimsy.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.260
Now, we do have to clean up afterwards.

27:24.260 --> 27:27.700
So please take your trash out with you.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.060
How about a new question?

27:29.060 --> 27:39.940
Yeah, here's one, let's get right the fuck into it.

27:39.940 --> 27:43.220
You do get the doll in this listing.

27:46.740 --> 27:48.420
It's a haunted doll watch, folks.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.740
You do get the doll in this listing, all caps.

27:50.740 --> 27:54.100
How has there ever been confusion about that ever?

27:55.620 --> 27:56.180
You'll see.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.500
You do get the doll in this listing.

27:58.500 --> 28:02.820
You get in your possession this spiritual doll vessel from our dead zone.

28:03.620 --> 28:11.860
And then it says, in quotes, Stacey is not a toy for children to play with, end quote.

28:11.860 --> 28:15.140
Which as far as toy slogans go, is the worst one.

28:16.260 --> 28:21.060
Stacey's not a toy for children to play with, by Hasbro.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.940
We are not responsible for the activity or actions of this doll once it is in your hands

28:25.940 --> 28:29.780
and due to eBay rules, I must post this.

28:31.220 --> 28:35.060
All paranormal dolls and stories are for entertainment purposes only.

28:35.780 --> 28:39.460
And they don't have a giant wink here, but like, wink.

28:39.460 --> 28:41.300
Wait, does it really have a wink?

28:41.300 --> 28:42.420
No, they don't have a giant wink.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.380
Fuck, you've got me again.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.460
Justin, can I ask you a question?

28:45.460 --> 28:46.820
Just a little spoiler alert.

28:46.820 --> 28:47.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:47.540 --> 28:50.820
Do they ever go on to explain what the dead zone is?

28:50.820 --> 28:52.020
No, sir, maybe.

28:52.020 --> 28:53.860
We have way, like I read all these.

28:53.860 --> 28:59.300
We have way over 1,450 spirit dolls here in my home.

28:59.300 --> 29:00.180
That's too many.

29:02.900 --> 29:03.860
Too many.

29:03.860 --> 29:06.580
But how far is way more?

29:06.580 --> 29:06.900
Way more.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.740
We're now going into 1,500.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.260
Six, more than six.

29:10.820 --> 29:15.060
We are having way too much paranormal activity in our home,

29:15.060 --> 29:18.820
so I must pass some of these spiritual dolls onto others

29:18.820 --> 29:21.700
that will take care of them and give them a great new home.

29:21.700 --> 29:24.660
Sounds like you have 1,450 reasons

29:24.660 --> 29:28.580
why you can't be too choosy about where the dolls end up, huh?

29:29.460 --> 29:32.420
Maybe they don't need to pay just any other home other than yours.

29:33.380 --> 29:38.100
I am one of the first that started listing spiritual items here on eBay.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.940
That's right, an OG.

29:40.580 --> 29:44.500
I am one that you can trust to get the real thing.

29:45.140 --> 29:46.100
My shit is good.

29:48.260 --> 29:50.900
Please feel free to check out all my feedback.

29:50.900 --> 29:54.020
You will get this spooky spiritual doll named Stacy.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.700
She is one of my favorite.

29:55.700 --> 30:00.020
All caps, the Ouija board and rocking chair is not included.

30:04.740 --> 30:05.940
Look at the picture.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.460
Enjoy the picture.

30:07.460 --> 30:10.420
Make peace with the fact that the Ouija board and rocking chair

30:11.380 --> 30:14.180
will not come to your home.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.780
Does the doll come with it, though?

30:17.220 --> 30:20.740
Stacy, you do get the doll.

30:20.740 --> 30:21.700
In this listing.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.140
Hi, let me introduce myself to you.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.660
Damn, Terry.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.860
That's her name, Terry.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.460
That was quite a preamble, eh?

30:32.020 --> 30:34.100
Ah, I've gotten ahead of myself.

30:34.100 --> 30:34.580
Allow me.

30:37.140 --> 30:38.420
A thousand apologies.

30:40.260 --> 30:41.060
I am Terry.

30:41.060 --> 30:42.100
Where are my manners?

30:42.100 --> 30:43.620
Oh, but where are my manners?

30:43.620 --> 30:45.860
I've rambled on too long once again.

30:45.860 --> 30:46.580
Have a seat.

30:46.580 --> 30:47.460
Enjoy the tea.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.780
Of course, my name is Terry

30:49.780 --> 30:51.780
and I'm a paranormal investigator.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.980
You can call me a terra-normal investigator.

30:59.700 --> 31:04.500
I've been collecting spiritual dolls and items for over 35 years.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.140
I travel to many different areas in the United States

31:07.140 --> 31:10.020
in search of paranormal items and activities.

31:10.020 --> 31:12.580
People on here are always asking me

31:12.580 --> 31:15.220
how do I have so many spiritual dolls to sell here on eBay?

31:16.340 --> 31:18.580
So I thought I would give you all some background on me.

31:18.580 --> 31:22.420
I also live by a very old and large cemetery

31:22.420 --> 31:23.860
that backs up to my home.

31:23.860 --> 31:24.500
Of course.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.860
She brings the dolls.

31:25.860 --> 31:27.220
She's cutting out the middle bit.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.420
Bring the dolls directly to you.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.780
So I have no problem attracting spirits and entities

31:31.780 --> 31:33.940
to attach themselves to my items.

31:33.940 --> 31:36.180
Okay, enough about me.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.820
Now let's get to the spiritual item here up for bid.

31:38.820 --> 31:42.660
Stacy the Haunted Doll is not a toy to play with.

31:42.660 --> 31:45.060
Says it again, this time in all caps.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.140
I don't want you to get it twisted.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.180
Stacy is not to play with.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.660
And then right after that, I'm shit you not,

31:50.660 --> 31:52.180
it says in all caps,

31:52.180 --> 31:56.260
the Ouija board and rocking chair is not included.

31:59.300 --> 32:02.020
If you really want to have some fun with a spiritual haunted doll,

32:02.020 --> 32:03.460
here is Stacy.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.940
Wait, you just said it's not a toy to fucking play with.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.620
No, like a doll fun, like watching Jeopardy together.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.020
Yeah.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.380
Oh, I enjoy this.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.660
Here's spiritual haunted doll vessel.

32:14.660 --> 32:18.340
She is a very old soft like plastic doll.

32:18.340 --> 32:21.940
Soft like, what's that thing that's like soft,

32:21.940 --> 32:23.620
but not all right, nothing.

32:24.820 --> 32:28.020
She is one of my spookiest spiritual vessel I have.

32:28.020 --> 32:30.740
Stacy gets really active around nighttime.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.460
She has the most spookiest eyes I've ever seen

32:33.460 --> 32:35.220
in any haunted doll vessel ever.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.580
They are so tantalizing.

32:36.580 --> 32:41.220
Oops, oops, oops, oops, whoops.

32:41.220 --> 32:41.940
Not the word.

32:41.940 --> 32:42.740
Ah, no.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.940
Violet blue looking as though she is looking inside you.

32:45.940 --> 32:46.500
No, thanks.

32:47.060 --> 32:47.380
Yeah.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.820
You can just feel her presence all around you.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.700
I've never seen eyes like this.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.140
Your voice is getting a little too.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.180
Yeah, it's a little husky.

32:58.340 --> 33:01.780
She's a very active spiritual 24 inches long,

33:01.780 --> 33:03.300
spooky haunted doll vessel.

33:04.020 --> 33:05.860
If the doll, I've said it before,

33:05.860 --> 33:07.060
if the doll is haunted,

33:07.620 --> 33:10.500
what the fuck does it matter how tall it is?

33:10.500 --> 33:16.020
Like, do you have a 22 and a 25 and a 23 and a 26?

33:16.020 --> 33:17.460
And man alive.

33:17.460 --> 33:20.420
If you could get one very haunted 24 inch doll,

33:20.420 --> 33:21.380
you'd just be set.

33:21.380 --> 33:23.140
You could play doll xylophone.

33:23.140 --> 33:26.900
You need to know the height so you know your chances

33:26.900 --> 33:28.980
when it comes alive to try to kill you.

33:30.180 --> 33:31.700
Could you punt this doll?

33:31.700 --> 33:34.500
24 inches, I could get out the window.

33:34.500 --> 33:40.020
It goes on like this for many pages.

33:41.140 --> 33:43.860
Let's circle back up at the end together.

33:43.860 --> 33:46.660
Stacey will bring you lots of company to your home.

33:46.660 --> 33:49.380
She is one spirit vessel you will love to watch.

33:49.380 --> 33:52.100
She will do many things to let you know she's around you,

33:52.100 --> 33:53.460
like opening and closing doors,

33:53.460 --> 33:54.340
whispering in your ear.

33:54.340 --> 33:56.100
No, you will hear bumps in the night.

33:56.100 --> 33:56.740
No, thanks.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.020
She will come to you in your dreams.

33:58.020 --> 34:00.260
Okay, so keep your mind clear

34:00.260 --> 34:02.340
and she will communicate this way with you as well.

34:02.340 --> 34:05.460
But do not worry, it is only Stacey watching you.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.300
Please leave your feedback for me

34:07.300 --> 34:10.500
and tell me what all of you have seen her do around you.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.740
And I will put it in my ads if that's okay with you.

34:14.740 --> 34:17.460
Here are a few feedbacks from some of my buyers.

34:18.980 --> 34:22.020
Already active, very sweet, excellent seller.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.220
Fully recommend, thank you.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.980
I am so happy with this great seller, an angel.

34:27.700 --> 34:29.060
I am already a repeat customer.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.900
The dollar, the seller.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.460
The dollar, the seller, it's just so different ways.

34:34.660 --> 34:35.940
Received my doll today.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.220
Thanks for the speedy shipping.

34:37.220 --> 34:38.260
She is really cute.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.100
This doll is haunted.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.700
It better not get here after Thursday.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.220
I'm really in the mood for it right now.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.940
I really hope it gets here before Thursday.

34:49.620 --> 34:50.900
I love Billy the doll.

34:50.900 --> 34:51.700
He is cute.

34:51.700 --> 34:52.740
Thank you very much.

34:52.740 --> 34:53.940
Great seller, A++++.

34:54.980 --> 34:55.860
Wonderful seller.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.980
I love this cute little clown dolls, Spot and Pat.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.300
Thank you, A++++.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.140
Big Bo, he's so cute.

35:03.140 --> 35:04.180
Perfect seller.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.300
He will be loved.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.780
And then it closes out by saying the Ouija board

35:09.780 --> 35:12.500
and the rocking chair are not included.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
A third time I shit you that.

35:14.500 --> 35:15.700
There's your $100 watch.

35:20.580 --> 35:24.020
My very favorite part of that is the part where she said,

35:25.460 --> 35:27.060
my house backs up to a graveyard.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.380
So I get all the spirits and ghouls from there.

35:30.180 --> 35:31.860
That doesn't seem like a cool place

35:31.860 --> 35:34.500
to get your spirits for your dolls.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.940
Because if like a little kid goes,

35:35.940 --> 35:37.860
he's like time to visit grandpa's ghost.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.780
Wait a minute, where grandpa's ghost go?

35:39.780 --> 35:43.140
And you find out the fucking like ghost type Pokemon trainer

35:43.140 --> 35:44.900
that lives in the house next to the cemetery

35:44.900 --> 35:46.580
just captured his spirit in a doll.

35:48.660 --> 35:49.620
That stinks.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.620
I also really like the part where it says

35:51.620 --> 35:53.380
that the ghost will whisper in your ear

35:53.380 --> 35:54.820
to let you know it's there

35:54.820 --> 35:57.140
as if a doll crawling up to your ear

35:57.140 --> 35:59.860
isn't a clear indication like, hey, lean over.

36:02.900 --> 36:03.860
How about, do you wanna read it?

36:03.860 --> 36:05.300
You close your iPad.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.020
Yeah, I'm done.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.140
All right, I'll do a Yahoo.

36:08.580 --> 36:09.860
There's 25 minutes left.

36:09.860 --> 36:10.900
Yeah, here's a Yahoo.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.700
Hit me.

36:11.700 --> 36:16.500
This Yahoo was sent in by Andrew who sent it in.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.140
He didn't ask it.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.980
It's from an anonymous Yahoo answers user,

36:18.980 --> 36:24.180
but I'll say it's from Dennis asks,

36:24.180 --> 36:27.220
what is some good, strong fighting food?

36:29.860 --> 36:32.820
Obviously like sausage links in a chain.

36:34.340 --> 36:35.140
Nunchucks.

36:35.140 --> 36:37.540
Oh, like nunchucks, very good.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.700
Do you remember in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2

36:39.700 --> 36:42.260
when Michelangelo had the sausage links on a chain

36:42.740 --> 36:46.100
and Leonardo had the large sausage link

36:46.100 --> 36:47.460
that was like a katana?

36:47.460 --> 36:47.940
Uh-huh.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.620
And Donatello had the very, very long sausage link.

36:51.620 --> 36:52.740
It was like a bo staff.

36:52.740 --> 36:53.700
Like who made that one?

36:53.700 --> 36:54.820
It was his first day.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.300
And Raphael had the two sausage links

36:57.300 --> 36:59.140
with smaller ones sticking out.

36:59.140 --> 36:59.780
Yeah.

36:59.780 --> 37:00.740
They all had sausage links.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.020
You know the second Ninja Turtles movie,

37:02.020 --> 37:03.140
they weren't allowed to have weapons,

37:03.140 --> 37:04.340
so they all used sausage.

37:04.340 --> 37:05.140
Yeah, I remember.

37:05.140 --> 37:05.780
You remember.

37:05.780 --> 37:06.260
You remember.

37:06.980 --> 37:09.300
Yeah, they still kill Treader Good with them though, huh?

37:10.740 --> 37:11.460
Took a while.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.740
He's meat-testing tolerance.

37:14.980 --> 37:15.460
One more time.

37:15.460 --> 37:16.420
Check out Paul.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.340
He's meat-testing.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.140
Sorry, you got to say it without laughing, my friend.

37:24.260 --> 37:26.740
He's meat-testing intolerant, okay?

37:28.500 --> 37:30.580
There, I've said it three times now.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.020
Are you fucking happy?

37:32.020 --> 37:32.820
I'm not.

37:32.820 --> 37:34.580
I put up an air ball

37:34.580 --> 37:36.260
and then I had to go pick up the air ball

37:36.260 --> 37:38.340
out of the creek that it rolled into

37:38.340 --> 37:40.500
and shoot it again, an air ball again,

37:40.500 --> 37:42.660
and get it out of a deeper creek

37:42.660 --> 37:44.740
and then bring it back and shoot it again.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.380
Are you happy?

37:46.580 --> 37:46.900
Nah.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.260
What is some good, strong fighting food?

37:53.060 --> 37:55.460
I have an opponent I need to hurt today

37:55.460 --> 37:58.580
and I need to fill my body with food strength.

37:59.540 --> 38:00.580
What's that going to be?

38:01.780 --> 38:06.020
Carbs, prot, put a lot of one of those two in you

38:06.020 --> 38:08.020
and I guess you're ready to roll.

38:08.740 --> 38:11.060
Eat a lot of spicy food, transform into a car.

38:11.700 --> 38:12.740
Yeah, we did it.

38:12.740 --> 38:14.500
That's our 2018 reference.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.740
Oh shit, yeah, we almost made it through the year

38:16.740 --> 38:18.100
without a Turbo Teen reference.

38:18.100 --> 38:21.780
I would say like those really thin breadsticks

38:21.780 --> 38:22.980
that you can bite and like crunch,

38:22.980 --> 38:23.940
that feels dramatic.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.380
You know, you bite like a bone of your enemy.

38:27.380 --> 38:28.260
Like you're eating.

38:28.260 --> 38:30.100
Oh, so you're like LARPing a bone eat.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.620
Yeah, you could also do it like with a carrot,

38:33.620 --> 38:34.980
anything you could snap.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.420
Plus you could probably eat a lot of them

38:36.420 --> 38:37.860
so that feels like an accomplishment

38:37.860 --> 38:39.460
which will help you get pumped.

38:39.460 --> 38:40.980
I ate 28 of these, hell yeah.

38:40.980 --> 38:44.020
Yeah, conventional wisdom is load up on carb,

38:44.020 --> 38:45.620
load up on prot, one of the two,

38:45.620 --> 38:46.900
but that's all that you get

38:46.900 --> 38:49.780
is one of those two raw food elements.

38:49.780 --> 38:53.300
But what if actually doing a balanced diet,

38:53.300 --> 38:55.300
what if the food pyramid was designed

38:55.300 --> 38:57.300
to optimize your fighting energy?

38:59.620 --> 39:00.340
That's it.

39:00.340 --> 39:04.420
A lot of people don't know that the food pyramid

39:04.420 --> 39:07.460
was actually designed sequentially for fights.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.660
So you wake up in the morning,

39:08.660 --> 39:10.340
you eat 11 servings of grain.

39:10.340 --> 39:11.540
Sure.

39:11.540 --> 39:15.140
Mid-morning, eight grains of vegetables or fruits.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.100
And then by the time you get to the pinnacle,

39:18.100 --> 39:19.060
the butter pinnacle,

39:20.020 --> 39:22.580
and you eat that little triangle of butter,

39:22.580 --> 39:24.260
you are gonna be so ready to kick some ass

39:24.260 --> 39:26.420
this time it's gonna be remotely fair.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.460
That makes so much sense.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.620
That's why in Rocky as he runs up the steps,

39:29.620 --> 39:31.940
he's eating some bread and then he's eating a steak,

39:31.940 --> 39:32.900
then he's eating an apple,

39:32.900 --> 39:34.740
then he's just eating a stick of butter at the top.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.700
Yeah, that's right.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.460
And he loses so.

39:37.460 --> 39:38.740
Spoilers.

39:38.740 --> 39:42.580
Maybe not that good a pyramid.

39:43.540 --> 39:46.020
How'd they fuck that up so bad?

39:46.020 --> 39:48.420
How did we go from like probably the thing

39:48.420 --> 39:50.500
you should eat the most of is bread

39:50.500 --> 39:52.900
to like don't eat bread.

39:54.260 --> 39:55.620
What are you kidding?

39:55.620 --> 39:57.220
All right, we tried bread for a while.

39:57.220 --> 39:57.540
No, no, no, no.

39:57.540 --> 40:00.980
We tried a lot of bread to make sure it was bad for us.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.100
Maybe have a bunch of tortilla chips.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.460
I don't know.

40:05.460 --> 40:07.300
I think a good strong fighting food would be

40:07.300 --> 40:07.940
your enemy.

40:09.220 --> 40:11.060
Okay, like Kirby.

40:11.060 --> 40:11.860
Yeah, sure.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.780
Yeah, we're gonna talk about Kirby a little bit more.

40:13.780 --> 40:14.820
This is entrapment.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.180
Is there any way I can make the people

40:18.180 --> 40:20.900
I stab legally like me more?

40:21.700 --> 40:22.820
I'm a phlebotomist.

40:23.860 --> 40:25.060
Oh, you had it.

40:25.060 --> 40:27.860
I'm a phlebotomist and I work drawing blood

40:27.860 --> 40:29.060
from adults and children.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.140
Naturally, this does not make me very popular.

40:31.140 --> 40:32.340
So is there anything I could do

40:32.340 --> 40:34.260
to make the people I stab hate me less?

40:34.260 --> 40:38.100
And that's from the vampire link in row C.

40:38.100 --> 40:38.660
Are you here?

40:39.540 --> 40:39.860
Hello.

40:39.860 --> 40:40.580
Okay.

40:40.580 --> 40:42.340
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

40:42.340 --> 40:42.660
Okay.

40:43.460 --> 40:44.980
Here's my suggestion.

40:44.980 --> 40:46.660
Let them draw blood from you.

40:47.460 --> 40:48.020
Very good.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.580
So you say I'll draw blood from you

40:50.580 --> 40:52.100
and then you draw blood from me and what?

40:52.100 --> 40:52.820
Oh shit.

40:54.260 --> 40:54.900
This will be good.

40:54.900 --> 40:55.380
Calm down.

40:55.380 --> 40:56.020
You'll see it doesn't.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.540
No, left, left, left, left.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.740
Oh god, left.

40:59.940 --> 41:01.060
My bone.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.180
My arm bone.

41:02.180 --> 41:06.820
I should really know what it's called.

41:06.820 --> 41:07.380
Phibia?

41:16.740 --> 41:18.900
Maybe because phibia is not a bone.

41:20.900 --> 41:23.620
Well, tomato, tomato.

41:23.620 --> 41:25.380
Listen, there's like 800 bones in there.

41:25.380 --> 41:27.220
You're telling me there's not a chance

41:27.220 --> 41:30.660
that there's at least one bone we haven't found yet.

41:30.660 --> 41:34.980
Yeah, here's what I would do.

41:36.340 --> 41:38.420
Hunch over at your desk and when they come in

41:38.420 --> 41:41.220
be like writing on your desk

41:41.220 --> 41:43.860
and like hunched over and not even looking at them.

41:43.860 --> 41:47.060
And they're like, I'm here to get my blood.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.900
And you just turn around like, good day.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.780
And then go back to scratching.

41:51.780 --> 41:54.020
And they're like, no, I just really need to.

41:54.020 --> 41:55.140
I said good day.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.540
No more blood drawn today.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.460
And then keep scratching.

41:59.460 --> 42:02.500
And then eventually they will beg you.

42:04.180 --> 42:04.660
Please.

42:05.300 --> 42:06.980
I want to do anything else.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.300
Please take the blood.

42:09.860 --> 42:10.980
I just want to go.

42:10.980 --> 42:12.340
And I don't know what's happening.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.180
It's kind of a Willy Wonka thing.

42:14.180 --> 42:14.580
Sure.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.820
And then you reward them with the whole clinic.

42:16.820 --> 42:17.620
And then you're like.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.140
I want to walk over and leave a small bag

42:21.140 --> 42:23.140
of their own blood on your desk first

42:23.140 --> 42:23.940
and then walk away.

42:23.940 --> 42:26.660
An adult would want to steal blood their way.

42:26.660 --> 42:28.340
Your grandpa's there and he's like, don't worry.

42:28.340 --> 42:30.660
We'll sell your blood to the plasma place on the corner

42:30.660 --> 42:31.380
and get you $30.

42:32.020 --> 42:33.700
We'll get you some cheap beer.

42:35.540 --> 42:38.980
Maybe what you do is you put a like really bendy

42:38.980 --> 42:41.300
like rubber needle in the syringe.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.220
And then when you go to take their blood,

42:43.220 --> 42:44.580
it just bends and you go.

42:47.540 --> 42:48.260
Unbreakable.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.380
But then with that, oh, and their other arm,

42:51.380 --> 42:52.340
you've already drawn the blood.

42:54.260 --> 42:57.620
They're so busy like, oh, they didn't even see it over here.

42:57.620 --> 42:58.500
That's good.

42:58.500 --> 42:59.140
That's good.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.060
Maybe when you stand up to take the blood,

43:01.060 --> 43:03.940
your pants rip and your pants rip

43:03.940 --> 43:05.780
and then they can see your underwear and everything

43:05.780 --> 43:07.140
and they're like laughing at it.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.500
But then what's that?

43:08.500 --> 43:09.780
You already got the blood.

43:09.780 --> 43:10.740
You already got the blood.

43:10.740 --> 43:13.220
A local phlebotomist was arrested tonight

43:13.220 --> 43:17.620
after consecutively showing 158 patients

43:17.620 --> 43:20.100
their underwear and everything.

43:20.100 --> 43:22.980
Thanks to a recommendation on Comedie Podcast.

43:22.980 --> 43:24.260
My brother, my brother and me.

43:25.140 --> 43:26.660
Did you say Comedie?

43:26.660 --> 43:30.340
Yeah, the news, the newscaster has never heard of comedy.

43:33.540 --> 43:35.860
Comedie Del Arte Podcast.

43:35.860 --> 43:37.300
My brother, my brother and me.

43:37.300 --> 43:39.060
They do something called jokes.

43:41.140 --> 43:41.620
Jokes.

43:53.300 --> 43:53.940
Hey, what's up?

43:53.940 --> 43:56.180
This is Griffin and it's just me this time.

43:56.180 --> 44:00.980
And that's because it's been a fucking heck of a week, y'all.

44:00.980 --> 44:04.820
And I'm just going to do all the normal middle stuff

44:04.820 --> 44:06.100
and let you get back to the rest of the show.

44:06.100 --> 44:06.980
I hope you enjoyed it.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.060
We had a lot of fun in Orlando and Atlanta.

44:10.020 --> 44:13.460
Atlanta, we ran into some tech issues with the recording

44:14.100 --> 44:19.140
because your city and its relationship to us

44:19.140 --> 44:22.420
as a recorded broadcast medium is cursed.

44:22.420 --> 44:23.700
But we'll try and get that figured out

44:23.700 --> 44:25.380
because that episode was a lot of fun too.

44:25.380 --> 44:27.540
But I hope you're enjoying this Orlando one.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.780
And here are the ads.

44:29.780 --> 44:31.700
First off, I want to tell you about Casper.

44:31.700 --> 44:32.740
Casper's so good.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.980
They make these really nice mattresses

44:34.980 --> 44:37.140
that feel good on your body.

44:37.140 --> 44:40.420
And they are affordable because they cut out the middleman

44:40.420 --> 44:42.340
and they sell directly to you.

44:42.340 --> 44:45.380
There is no middleman anywhere.

44:45.380 --> 44:48.580
Certainly not hiding inside the mattress when you open it up

44:48.580 --> 44:50.980
because they would die in the small box

44:50.980 --> 44:53.780
that they ship the Casper to you in.

44:53.780 --> 44:55.380
And Casper's really comfy.

44:55.380 --> 44:56.500
We have one in our guest room

44:56.500 --> 44:58.100
and every time we have guests that stay with us,

44:58.100 --> 45:00.580
they shower us with compliments,

45:00.580 --> 45:02.500
which always feels so good.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.660
They combine multiple supportive memory foams

45:04.660 --> 45:06.900
for a quality sleep surface with the right amount of sink

45:06.900 --> 45:08.180
and the right amount of bounce.

45:08.180 --> 45:09.700
You can be sure of your purchase

45:09.700 --> 45:12.180
with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on trial.

45:12.180 --> 45:15.300
So I want you to get $50 towards select mattresses right now

45:15.300 --> 45:17.300

45:23.860 --> 45:26.420
Hey, stamps are necessary.

45:26.420 --> 45:28.180
They're mandatory in a lot of ways

45:28.180 --> 45:31.940
and sometimes it can be kind of a hassle to go get them.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.660
These days you can get practically everything on demand

45:34.660 --> 45:36.420
like this podcast.

45:41.780 --> 45:45.380

It offers you all the amazing services

45:47.220 --> 45:48.900

You just click print mail and you are done.

46:07.620 --> 46:08.580

46:08.580 --> 46:10.740

46:10.740 --> 46:12.260

46:12.260 --> 46:14.580
that's stamps.com, enter my brother.

46:14.580 --> 46:15.620
Got a few jumbotrons here.

46:15.620 --> 46:18.900
This one's for Mary and it's from Thomas who says,

46:18.900 --> 46:21.060
to my sweet, sweet girl, happy anniversary.

46:21.060 --> 46:23.620
Sorry, this message is a little after September 4th.

46:23.620 --> 46:24.340
Is it though?

46:24.900 --> 46:26.260
Slam dunk the funk.

46:26.900 --> 46:28.820
Fucking crushed it, but this will have to do.

46:29.460 --> 46:32.500
I might as well wish us both happy birthdays too.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.740
Every day I'm inspired and amazed by your intelligence,

46:34.740 --> 46:37.380
good goofs and passion for all things McElroy.

46:37.380 --> 46:39.380
So proud of you and all you've accomplished

46:39.380 --> 46:40.660
and I miss you so much.

46:40.660 --> 46:42.420
A sweet, sweet message and Thomas,

46:42.420 --> 46:44.020
don't ever fucking doubt us again.

46:44.020 --> 46:48.340
Here's a message for Starfire and it's from Blorp7 who says,

46:48.340 --> 46:50.820
dear Starfire, I love you with all my heart.

46:51.380 --> 46:53.300
Love, Blorp7.

46:53.300 --> 46:54.180
I know you're all wondering,

46:54.180 --> 46:57.380
is this part of the Bim Bam ARG, this jumbotron message?

46:57.380 --> 46:59.540
And the answer is, I can't tell you.

46:59.540 --> 47:00.420
It's ARG.

47:00.420 --> 47:01.140
It's part of the game.

47:01.140 --> 47:02.260
You gotta solve it yourself.

47:02.260 --> 47:03.060
One last jumbotron.

47:03.060 --> 47:03.940
This one's for Benji.

47:03.940 --> 47:05.860
It's from Blairbo who says,

47:05.860 --> 47:07.300
remember when we were in college,

47:07.300 --> 47:08.980
smoking that good dank green?

47:08.980 --> 47:10.740
That's a crime.

47:11.460 --> 47:13.940
And you conditioned me Pavlovian style to cry

47:13.940 --> 47:17.140
real actual tears at any picture of Full House's Dave Coulier.

47:17.140 --> 47:18.260
It's a fun experiment.

47:18.260 --> 47:19.780
Yeah, me too because it still happens.

47:19.780 --> 47:22.020
Ben, thank you for five years of being a wonderful,

47:22.020 --> 47:24.260
amazing and also very tall friend.

47:24.260 --> 47:26.740
You're a whip smart, funny and so important

47:26.740 --> 47:27.940
to every life you touch.

47:27.940 --> 47:28.820
I love you.

47:28.820 --> 47:29.460
Hell yeah.

47:30.020 --> 47:33.060
Can I get a hell yeah for this sweet message

47:33.060 --> 47:34.980
between two very good friends

47:35.620 --> 47:40.180
and their unhealthy relationship with Uncle Joey.

47:40.740 --> 47:43.140
Big thanks to everybody who came out to our live shows

47:43.700 --> 47:45.300
in Orlando and Atlanta again.

47:45.300 --> 47:48.100
We got actually, I think all the tickets are sold out

47:48.100 --> 47:49.540
for our Portland and Seattle shows.

47:49.540 --> 47:51.860
So Pacific Northwest, we are excited to come see it.

47:51.860 --> 47:53.220
We're still trying to figure out

47:53.220 --> 47:55.220
maybe one or two more tours this year.

47:55.220 --> 47:58.340
So hopefully we will get out to see some more folks

47:58.340 --> 47:59.860
before the year is up.

47:59.860 --> 48:01.940
We got merch at McElroyMerch.com

48:02.580 --> 48:05.940
and we just launched a new sort of project on there

48:05.940 --> 48:09.140
that is not going to sound funny when I explain it,

48:09.140 --> 48:10.500
but hopefully you all enjoy it.

48:10.500 --> 48:14.820
It's a line of generic podcast merchandising.

48:14.820 --> 48:18.180
There's a shirt on there that just says 100% podcast,

48:18.180 --> 48:18.980
coffee cup that says,

48:18.980 --> 48:20.980
don't talk to me before I've had my podcast.

48:20.980 --> 48:24.180
Listen, we had this idea in one meeting with DFTBA,

48:24.180 --> 48:25.380
our merch supplier,

48:25.380 --> 48:27.860
and we all thought it was very funny and horrifyingly.

48:27.860 --> 48:30.900
It went and moved through the production process

48:30.900 --> 48:32.420
just so, so quickly.

48:33.300 --> 48:35.220
But yeah, all of this dumb stuff

48:35.220 --> 48:38.580
is on our website at McElroyMerch.com

48:38.580 --> 48:41.300
and all of the royalties for this item

48:41.300 --> 48:43.220
are gonna go to ProAct West Virginia,

48:43.220 --> 48:47.220
which is a nonprofit designed to help with opiate addiction

48:47.860 --> 48:50.180
and treatment and care in Huntington, West Virginia,

48:50.180 --> 48:50.740
our hometown.

48:50.740 --> 48:53.700
So it's a dumb line of products,

48:53.700 --> 48:55.140
but it's for a good cause.

48:55.140 --> 48:56.500
Thanks to MaxFun for having us on the network.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.620

49:04.420 --> 49:06.660

You can check out the other shows we do at McElroyShows.com

49:09.460 --> 49:11.220
and I think that's gonna do it.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.300
Yeah, here comes the rest of the episode.

49:13.300 --> 49:17.220
We'll be back with a regular episode next week, I think.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.460
Yes, absolutely.

49:19.460 --> 49:20.180
See you then, bye.

49:20.180 --> 49:24.980
Listen, we already know that you love genre movies,

49:24.980 --> 49:26.900
film craft and female filmmakers.

49:26.900 --> 49:28.740
So if you love all those things,

49:28.740 --> 49:30.340
then by transitive property,

49:30.340 --> 49:32.580
you love my podcast, Switchblade Sisters.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.100
Hi, I'm film critic April Wolf.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.460
Every week I have a conversation

49:35.460 --> 49:36.900
with a different female filmmaker

49:36.900 --> 49:38.260
about their favorite genre film.

49:38.260 --> 49:40.340
Each episode covers the filmmaking process,

49:40.340 --> 49:41.540
working in the film industry

49:41.540 --> 49:44.500
and just like general geeking out about awesome movies.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.540
I've had such great guests

49:45.540 --> 49:47.300
like the big sick writer, Emily Gordon.

49:47.300 --> 49:49.140
To me, indie movies as of late

49:49.140 --> 49:50.900
have come to be a catch all term

49:50.900 --> 49:53.220
for a movie that kind of defies genre.

49:53.220 --> 49:55.700
Billy Madison and half fake director, Tamara Davis.

49:55.700 --> 49:58.260
When a comedian comes and enters onto my set,

49:58.260 --> 50:00.500
they're just there to be funny

50:00.500 --> 50:03.140
and we're all ready and waiting for them to be funny.

50:03.140 --> 50:05.700
Horror industry veteran and actor, Barbara Crampton.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.700
That's where real drama lies for me.

50:07.700 --> 50:11.220
What's between you and I speaking right now?

50:11.220 --> 50:12.820
Where are we meeting?

50:12.820 --> 50:15.140
And what's the energy that we create between us?

50:15.140 --> 50:16.340
And so many others.

50:16.340 --> 50:17.780
So check out Switchblade Sisters

50:17.780 --> 50:19.780
every Thursday on maximumfun.org

50:19.780 --> 50:21.540
or wherever you get your podcasts.

50:25.380 --> 50:26.900
Another question or what do you guys think?

50:26.900 --> 50:28.580
Let's, I think we should go to the audience.

50:28.580 --> 50:31.700
Yes, we have a handful of audience questions.

50:31.700 --> 50:33.060
We have chosen them ahead of time.

50:33.060 --> 50:36.260
Please do not stand up unless we say your name and seat number.

50:36.260 --> 50:40.100
Can we get, thank you Mickey.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.900
Now we can all drink in this beautiful theater together.

50:42.900 --> 50:45.380
We have a mic there in the middle, a mic there in the middle.

50:45.940 --> 50:50.180
Let's go ahead and get Niel in V3.

50:50.820 --> 50:52.900
Come on down to one of these two microphones

50:52.900 --> 50:58.580
and let's get Em in Orchestra Center D2 row BBC 114.

50:58.580 --> 50:59.140
Very specific, thank you.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.420
That's so much longer than the other one.

51:00.420 --> 51:02.340
I'm hoping Niel is able to know that it's them.

51:03.220 --> 51:04.100
Okay, that's two.

51:04.660 --> 51:05.620
Hey, what's up?

51:05.620 --> 51:06.900
Hey, how's it going?

51:06.900 --> 51:07.300
Good, what's your-

51:07.300 --> 51:08.660
It's going good, how's it going for you?

51:10.340 --> 51:11.860
My name, I go by Niel.

51:11.860 --> 51:12.340
Niel?

51:12.340 --> 51:12.660
Niel.

51:12.660 --> 51:14.020
I fucked that up so, Niel?

51:14.660 --> 51:16.020
Well, it's actually pronounced Nail

51:16.020 --> 51:17.540
because it's a Middle Eastern name.

51:17.540 --> 51:21.620
Okay, I mainly just want to hear the story, you know?

51:21.620 --> 51:24.900
Yeah, so we're not even going to read your submission.

51:24.900 --> 51:26.100
We want to hear it.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.780
At first, wait, wait, wait, before we do anything

51:27.780 --> 51:30.340
and if the answer to this is no,

51:30.340 --> 51:32.180
I'm going to ask you to leave the theater in shame.

51:33.780 --> 51:34.660
Is this true?

51:34.660 --> 51:36.340
This is very true, I have a video of it.

51:36.340 --> 51:36.980
Hit it.

51:36.980 --> 51:37.780
Okay.

51:37.780 --> 51:42.340
Okay, so yesterday Guy Fieri opened up a restaurant in-

51:42.980 --> 51:43.300
Yeah.

51:45.300 --> 51:48.180
He opened up a chicken tender restaurant in Disney Springs.

51:49.060 --> 51:49.620
Ooh.

51:49.620 --> 51:50.500
I went to the grand opening-

51:50.500 --> 51:51.540
Hold on, hold on.

51:52.340 --> 51:55.780
We left Disney today, you're fucking telling me this now?

51:55.780 --> 52:00.580
Ow!

52:00.580 --> 52:04.020
I posted it on Twitter, you don't follow me on Twitter, I'm sorry.

52:04.980 --> 52:07.140
I know what the- what's the name of the restaurant?

52:07.140 --> 52:08.260
It's called Chicken Guy.

52:19.060 --> 52:19.860
Go on.

52:19.860 --> 52:22.420
I'm livid about this misconnection right now.

52:23.460 --> 52:25.700
Ew, making chicken tenders.

52:25.700 --> 52:28.180
Me wanting to eat chicken tenders.

52:28.180 --> 52:32.180
Me at Kilimanjaro Safari wishing that I was there

52:32.180 --> 52:33.300
at your chicken tender restaurant.

52:33.300 --> 52:33.940
Okay, go ahead.

52:34.580 --> 52:37.140
So Guy Fieri was making chicken.

52:37.140 --> 52:41.620
Yeah, so I go, it was around like noon the whole thing.

52:41.620 --> 52:44.100
So they opened up the restaurant after they did their whole like

52:44.100 --> 52:46.900
hullabaloo with Mickey cutting the ribbon and all that.

52:46.900 --> 52:49.220
And he's like, he's behind the counter,

52:49.220 --> 52:50.900
he's making the chicken tenders for everybody.

52:51.460 --> 52:51.940
And eventually-

52:51.940 --> 52:52.900
Guy, not Mickey.

52:52.900 --> 52:56.580
No, no, Guy, yeah, Guy's making the chicken, not Mickey, sorry.

52:56.580 --> 52:58.100
And eventually Guy comes out.

52:58.100 --> 53:01.380
It makes me actually very nervous that Guy and Mickey were at the same place.

53:01.380 --> 53:02.580
I hate that actually.

53:02.580 --> 53:03.780
They're conceptually the opposite.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.940
That leaves our nation so vulnerable.

53:08.500 --> 53:10.420
We need a designated survivor.

53:10.420 --> 53:11.060
Right?

53:11.060 --> 53:12.100
Who's the designated-

53:12.100 --> 53:13.220
It was Key for Sutherland.

53:13.220 --> 53:13.780
Don't worry.

53:13.780 --> 53:14.260
Yeah.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.020
Okay, so please.

53:16.580 --> 53:18.180
So I'm back at my table-

53:18.180 --> 53:20.100
Ski Allrich was in a bunker.

53:20.100 --> 53:20.820
Don't worry.

53:20.820 --> 53:21.540
Wait, I'm sorry?

53:21.540 --> 53:22.820
Don't worry.

53:22.820 --> 53:26.260
Is Ski Allrich right between Mickey and Guy?

53:26.260 --> 53:27.300
He's in between there.

53:27.300 --> 53:27.700
Go ahead.

53:27.700 --> 53:28.900
Sorry, if nobody else talk.

53:29.620 --> 53:30.120
Okay.

53:31.220 --> 53:32.500
So I'm back at my table with my food.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.100
Eventually he comes out from behind the counter

53:34.100 --> 53:38.500
to do like an in-person interview with one of the local news journalists.

53:38.500 --> 53:39.380
And he's like-

53:39.380 --> 53:40.340
Okay, stop again.

53:44.660 --> 53:47.780
Everybody, take a second to pretend you're that journalist.

53:47.780 --> 53:52.820
And try to think of your first question.

53:56.260 --> 53:57.620
So Guy Fieri,

53:57.620 --> 54:00.980
why did you open up a chicken to the restaurant at Walt Disney World?

54:02.980 --> 54:03.480
Okay.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.140
Okay, I'm done.

54:05.140 --> 54:05.640
Go.

54:06.820 --> 54:07.780
So they're talking,

54:07.780 --> 54:09.860
maybe they're talking for like 20 minutes or so.

54:09.860 --> 54:10.660
And I'm like right there.

54:10.660 --> 54:11.140
I'm just like-

54:11.140 --> 54:13.220
The interview goes on for 20 minutes?

54:14.100 --> 54:15.620
Was it James Lipton?

54:15.620 --> 54:16.420
What the fuck?

54:16.420 --> 54:17.780
There's like a whole like-

54:17.780 --> 54:19.220
There's a whole crowd around them.

54:19.220 --> 54:20.580
There were people taking pictures.

54:20.580 --> 54:21.380
It was like an event.

54:21.380 --> 54:22.340
Chanting.

54:22.340 --> 54:24.420
I also need to know you say you were right there.

54:24.420 --> 54:26.260
Give me like a distance.

54:26.260 --> 54:28.260
How far were you from Guy Fieri?

54:28.260 --> 54:31.860
I want to say like it was like less than 10 feet.

54:31.860 --> 54:32.500
Okay.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.860
You were in the guy zone.

54:33.860 --> 54:35.860
Nobody else fucking talk.

54:35.860 --> 54:37.700
The story, I need it.

54:37.700 --> 54:39.140
It's the air that I breathe.

54:39.780 --> 54:46.340
So he gets up and he's like taking a picture with one of the people up front.

54:46.340 --> 54:47.700
Like a fan, I guess.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.980
And I have a little like-

54:48.980 --> 54:52.660
I mean, I made a sign out of like the wax paper that covers the tray.

54:53.380 --> 54:56.820
Said, Mayor Fieri, please feed me attendee.

55:02.260 --> 55:05.380
Imagine me scooping you up in my arms, okay?

55:05.380 --> 55:06.660
I'm very proud of you, son.

55:08.020 --> 55:09.700
You did a very good job today.

55:09.700 --> 55:10.820
He's very proud of you.

55:11.380 --> 55:12.020
It means a lot.

55:13.780 --> 55:14.500
So he sees-

55:14.500 --> 55:15.140
He's taking the picture.

55:15.140 --> 55:15.700
He sees it.

55:15.700 --> 55:21.460
And he goes, do you want me to feed you a tender?

55:21.460 --> 55:26.260
And I go, yeah, because the thing did a little wild here.

55:26.260 --> 55:30.580
Joey Fatone, a couple of years ago, fed me a hot dog at the grand opening of this hot dog stand.

55:30.580 --> 55:45.300
That wasn't in the email.

55:47.700 --> 55:49.540
You are a lot, my dude.

55:51.700 --> 55:55.620
You expect Guy Fieri to be like, oh, you're the feeding stuff too, Guy.

55:55.620 --> 56:01.140
I won't be outdone by Joey Fatone.

56:01.140 --> 56:01.860
Not again.

56:02.740 --> 56:03.460
Close, Travis.

56:03.460 --> 56:04.980
He said, I don't want to take you.

56:04.980 --> 56:07.300
That's you and Joey's thing.

56:08.260 --> 56:08.580
Okay.

56:08.580 --> 56:10.260
That's very respectful of him.

56:10.260 --> 56:11.220
Very respectful of him.

56:11.220 --> 56:14.420
What is the name of Joey Fatone's hot dog brand?

56:14.420 --> 56:15.220
It's called Fat Ones.

56:16.340 --> 56:16.580
Great.

56:19.060 --> 56:19.940
No, listen.

56:19.940 --> 56:20.980
No, there's a lot of-

56:20.980 --> 56:24.020
Is it possible I call it Fatones and you're just a jerk?

56:24.020 --> 56:24.980
Possibly.

56:24.980 --> 56:27.060
Listen, there's a lot of good stuff.

56:27.060 --> 56:28.420
We have to get to your question.

56:30.180 --> 56:33.940
So he offers to toss the tender into my mouth.

56:33.940 --> 56:34.180
Sick.

56:35.140 --> 56:37.380
A hot tender, like fresh out of the fryer?

56:37.380 --> 56:38.500
Probably not.

56:38.500 --> 56:41.460
It was my last remaining tender I had in my box.

56:41.460 --> 56:44.020
It was a little cold, but it was fine.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.780
I saved it for this reason.

56:47.860 --> 56:48.180
And?

56:48.980 --> 56:53.140
And I gave him my tender and I stepped back a couple feet

56:53.140 --> 56:55.620
and he tossed the tender into my mouth.

56:55.620 --> 56:59.780
The tenders are big, so it got into my mouth

56:59.780 --> 57:01.860
and kind of just like bounced out onto the floor.

57:01.860 --> 57:02.020
Sure.

57:03.860 --> 57:05.460
I'm not proud of you anymore, son.

57:06.020 --> 57:10.340
Well, should I have eaten the tender off of the floor?

57:10.340 --> 57:10.660
Yes.

57:10.660 --> 57:10.980
Yes.

57:13.300 --> 57:13.620
Yes.

57:14.420 --> 57:14.900
Yes.

57:14.900 --> 57:16.260
The answer is yes.

57:16.260 --> 57:18.740
And you should have eaten it off the floor.

57:18.740 --> 57:19.060
Yeah.

57:19.060 --> 57:23.780
Like hands and knees.

57:23.780 --> 57:24.900
Does that answer your question?

57:25.540 --> 57:26.020
Yeah.

57:26.020 --> 57:26.420
All right.

57:26.420 --> 57:26.660
Thanks.

57:28.500 --> 57:29.140
Thank you.

57:29.140 --> 57:30.100
Thank you.

57:30.100 --> 57:30.660
So dope.

57:33.060 --> 57:38.020
Can we get Quinn, orchestra, right, seat E, row four?

57:38.020 --> 57:39.380
Go ahead and head down.

57:39.380 --> 57:40.020
Hey, what's up?

57:40.020 --> 57:41.460
Row E, seat four.

57:41.460 --> 57:41.940
Hello.

57:41.940 --> 57:42.740
I just fucked up.

57:42.740 --> 57:43.220
Hey.

57:43.220 --> 57:43.700
Hi.

57:43.700 --> 57:43.940
Hi.

57:44.580 --> 57:46.020
So I don't know how to start.

57:46.020 --> 57:46.900
What's your name?

57:46.900 --> 57:47.620
My name's Emily.

57:47.620 --> 57:48.180
Emily.

57:48.180 --> 57:48.660
I am.

57:48.660 --> 57:48.900
Yeah.

57:48.900 --> 57:49.620
Hi.

57:49.620 --> 57:50.980
Sorry, I said Emma.

57:50.980 --> 57:52.100
I truncated it.

57:52.100 --> 57:53.700
I took a wild swing at the email.

57:53.700 --> 57:54.020
OK.

57:54.020 --> 57:54.420
It's OK.

57:54.420 --> 57:55.620
It's not even how I spell my name.

57:55.620 --> 57:55.860
OK.

57:57.300 --> 58:00.020
So basically, do you know those Bigfoot shows

58:00.020 --> 58:02.900
on like most channels at this point?

58:02.900 --> 58:05.460
I know we all have the guilty habit of watching them.

58:05.460 --> 58:06.260
But my dad.

58:06.980 --> 58:07.300
All of them?

58:09.140 --> 58:09.380
Sure.

58:10.500 --> 58:13.300
But my dad takes it to a very big point.

58:14.180 --> 58:15.780
He now knows everybody's name.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.620
He knows.

58:17.620 --> 58:19.860
Everybody on the show, not just everybody.

58:19.860 --> 58:20.660
On most shows.

58:20.660 --> 58:21.140
OK.

58:21.140 --> 58:22.580
He's actually in the audience.

58:22.580 --> 58:24.180
And he's probably thriving right now.

58:24.180 --> 58:24.740
Are you here?

58:25.300 --> 58:26.500
Yeah, he's right there.

58:29.140 --> 58:29.700
Represent.

58:31.380 --> 58:34.740
But at this point, we have a whistle, which I'm sorry,

58:34.740 --> 58:35.780
I didn't bring it with me.

58:35.780 --> 58:37.380
It's actually a Bigfoot whistle.

58:37.940 --> 58:40.500
And you blow into it and it makes a Bigfoot noise.

58:40.500 --> 58:42.260
Whoever just screamed what?

58:42.260 --> 58:42.660
Yes.

58:44.820 --> 58:46.260
I don't mean to put you on the spot.

58:46.260 --> 58:47.620
So you can say no to this.

58:47.620 --> 58:48.900
Can you imitate it?

58:48.900 --> 58:50.020
You can't say no to this.

58:50.020 --> 58:50.580
I must know.

58:52.660 --> 58:53.060
It's like.

58:57.460 --> 58:58.580
That is what it would be.

59:00.900 --> 59:02.900
That's what I found in my studies.

59:04.260 --> 59:07.620
In all my research, that's what it points to.

59:07.620 --> 59:08.340
That's correct.

59:09.140 --> 59:10.100
He loves that noise.

59:10.100 --> 59:11.620
He's crazy for it.

59:11.620 --> 59:13.540
He would hear that and be like, my friend?

59:13.540 --> 59:15.540
All right.

59:17.060 --> 59:22.340
Needless to say, it doesn't attract the Bigfoots like we had been hoping.

59:24.740 --> 59:28.580
Basically, I'm trying to figure out if I should let this Bigfoot addiction continue.

59:31.540 --> 59:35.300
Now at this point, I don't know if I'm going to have a mascot of Bigfoot next year.

59:36.500 --> 59:38.900
I don't know if this is going to become an addiction.

59:39.860 --> 59:41.140
Not that it hasn't already.

59:41.140 --> 59:45.140
Is it going to reach that point?

59:45.780 --> 59:46.580
Just a mascot?

59:46.580 --> 59:49.860
Just all the money has gone to Bigfoot related whistles?

59:50.500 --> 59:51.460
Yeah, basically.

59:54.180 --> 59:56.420
We have a very big surprise for you tonight.

59:57.700 --> 59:58.260
Bigfoot.

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.100
Oh my god.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:00.820
Come on out.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.300
Is he here?

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.220
Oh, he couldn't make it.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.820
Okay, we wasted the VIP.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.820
But what if your dad is the one who finds Bigfoot?

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.420
That's it.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.460
Listen, somebody had to invent the light bulb.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.100
Somebody had to sing the highest note.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.500
Somebody had to swim the channel for the first time.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:25.220
Somebody's got to find Bigfoot and maybe it's your dad.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:29.060
You got to get in there before David Blaine does it because you know he'll find the fucking Bigfoot.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.500
If you want to call Bigfoot, don't use a whistle.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
Just pick up a phone and call him.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.820
Yeah, use 1-800-Collect.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.980
No, just call Bigfoot.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.020
What's his number?

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:42.660
What?

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.540
I don't know his number.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.660
Travis has the right idea.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.500
1-800-Collect, say Bigfoot, please.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.260
And the operator will be like, oh shit, I have to handle that.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.700
I guess you win.

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.180
These shows, they never, first episode.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.100
If I make one of these shows, find a Bigfoot.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.300
What's episode one?

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.020
Find a Bigfoot.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.940
Episode one, whitepages.org.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.540
I search Bigfoot.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.700
I put it, if they want a location, forests.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.500
Trees, yeah.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.300
Trees.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.660
I search Bigfoot.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.180
A phone number pops up.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.620
There's one result.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:12.660
There's only one Bigfoot.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.460
It's very sad.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.900
You call the number on there, just say hi.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:17.860
Just talk to Bigfoot.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:18.900
He'd love to hear from you.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.140
He doesn't get a lot of drop-ins.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.180
He might not meet you.

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.020
Yes, he's very shy, but he'll talk to you.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.780
But he's not mean like the beef jerky commercials make him out to be.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:35.300
I hate those fucking commercials where it's like pranking on Bigfoot's ass and it's like,

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.820
yeah, he's going to hit you and throw you if you prank his ass.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:44.020
If you dunk on Bigfoot's balls, he is going to be so mad at you, beef jerky.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.060
But if you call him on a telephone, chill, dude.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:47.460
Hey.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:47.860
Yeah.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.980
And just talk to him about World War II airplanes.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:51.860
That's his passion.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.500
He loves that shit.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.100
He loves that shit.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:54.980
All of them.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.740
Can you do the whistle noise again?

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.700
Just one more time.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.060
Is this a serious question?

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:01.560
Yeah.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:09.480
All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.320
All right.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:13.960
Does that help?

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.360
What?

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.080
Does that help?

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.200
Yes.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.560
Just one quick fun fact.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.280
My dog is terrified of the whistle.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.200
Yeah, because your dog's like, oh shit, Bigfoot's coming.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.120
What are you doing?

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.080
I gotta get out of here.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.120
You're playing with forces you couldn't possibly understand.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.240
Have you seen that fool?

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.200
He's giant.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:35.720
Thank you, Emily.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:36.600
Thank you.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.920
Quinn, did you make it?

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.760
Down here, Quinn.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.760
Orchestra right, row E, seat four.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.040
Quinn.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.120
There's two possible Quins.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:48.360
Wait.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.560
No, okay.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.880
You just scared the shit out of us.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.280
One of the Quins was coming back for the bathroom.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.240
Now, Quinn.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.120
Yeah.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.000
Yeah, go ahead.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.800
Oh, okay, so I was at work one day and I was at the elevator

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.760
and there was another woman who was approaching the elevator

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.520
at the same time as me.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.840
I pressed up, she pressed down.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.920
It's a common thing that happens.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.160
Okay.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.600
All right, everybody, calm down.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:17.960
It happens.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:23.640
An elevator arrives and the doors open and the down arrow

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.120
is blinking, indicating it was hers.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.680
And she looks at me, gestures and says, after you.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.000
I said, oh, no, thank you.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.960
I'm going up.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.960
And then she looked at me very seriously and said,

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.400
you know, they go both ways, right?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:55.720
And I kind of went, yeah, and then looked down at my phone.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.200
So good.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.320
Very good.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.120
And she went, oh, you've gotten out of this one.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.200
Did you get on the fucking elevator?

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:02.840
Oh, no.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.480
Okay, good.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.720
I waited.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.680
The doors immediately closed and she didn't indicate that

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.600
she was like, I'm just kidding.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.080
Okay.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.920
Wait, so she didn't get on it?

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.960
She did get on to go down.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.760
Oh, thank God.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.360
And then the moment was over.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.640
So I thought for a second, she gestured, you didn't,

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.680
so she didn't either.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.760
Because you could see the future.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.000
You knew the car was going to plummet to the ground.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.840
So what's your question?

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.120
Can we help?

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.520
She works in my building and what happens

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.520
if this situation happens again?

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.720
It will happen again.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.280
It will.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.160
That's life for you.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.440
First of all, you did the right thing in looking down at your

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.040
phone and going, ha ha, yeah.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.080
Because you can, you can get out of,

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.000
you can get out of most situations that way.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.120
Second thing, I regret to inform you,

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.160
you have been bullied.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.200
So you think you've been bullied?

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:56.440
Yes.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.800
It's accurate.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.200
Shit.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.320
Because here's the thing.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.920
Here's what you should have said to her.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:05.000
You know, they go both ways and you should have said,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.600
but not at the same time.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:06.840
Right.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.320
Hey, it's not a fucking wonkivator.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.520
You're going down and I'm going up.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.440
And right now it's pointed down.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.480
How do I know?

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.760
There's an arrow.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.320
She does.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.080
She does have a point though.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.080
Because what you've said is,

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:25.240
I know it would take the exact same amount of time for me.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.920
I just don't want to spend that time with you.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.520
There were two elevators.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.040
Oh wait, was there only one elevator?

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.480
There were two elevators.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:33.800
Okay.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.280
Okay.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.200
Well then, okay.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.800
You, here's one thing you could do.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:45.000
Follow her when she is heading elevator ward.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.640
Oh, what did you say?

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.440
Follow the money.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.480
Follow the money.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.280
Follow the money.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.680
What does she have to gain?

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.960
From bullying you so viciously.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.080
Follow her when she's going elevator ward

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.680
and try to recreate this scenario.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.320
But have it so that the elevator is going your way.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.920
And then you say, mount up regulators.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.440
And then she gets on and she goes up

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.600
when she means to go down and you step off like,

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.920
how you're looks like you're higher up than you should.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.840
And at that point the doors have closed

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.600
and you didn't say anything cool.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.360
But she'll know and she'll resign in disgrace the next day.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.800
And that's how you become CEO.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.520
Does that help?

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.840
Wait, wait, Quinn, real quick before I let you go.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.520
Could you do the Bigfoot whistle noise?

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:45.640
Very good.

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.280
Thank you.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.080
Thank you, Quinn.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.360
Thank you to you, Orlando.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:54.760
Thank you, Orlando, so much for coming to see us.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.040
Thank you to the Walt Disney Theater.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:58.920
You're amazing.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.360
Can I just say,

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:05.160
Quinn's sounded like Bigfoot in his local production of Streetcar Named Desire.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:08.760
Ripped his shirt open.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.640
Thank you to Paul.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.440
Thank you to our dad.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.400
Paul Sabourin.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.840
Paul Sabourin, Arnani.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.720
Thank you, Nani.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.960
Real quick.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.040
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merit Palmer.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.920
It's our closer.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.560
Thank you, Merit.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.880
It's Yahoo Answers user Garrick who asks,

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:29.240
Any bands that write lyrics about how difficult the job market is?

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.920
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.720
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.760
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.880
It's been my brother, my brother.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:56.280
Give your dad a square on the lips.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.200

01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.240

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.320
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.880
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my friend's favor.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.840
Judge John Hodgman ruled in my favor.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.280
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.400
You're hearing the voices of real litigants, real people who have submitted disputes to my

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.040
internet court at the Judge John Hodgman podcast.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.160
I hear their cases.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.360
I ask them questions.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.320
They're good ones.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.240
And then I tell them who's right and who's wrong.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.440
Thanks to Judge John Hodgman's ruling, my dad has been forced to retire one of the worst

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.120
dad jokes of all time.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:36.120
Instead of cutting his own hair with a flowbee, my husband has his hair cut professionally.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.960
I have to join a community theater group.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.920
And my wife has stopped bringing home wild animals.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.320
It's the Judge John Hodgman podcast.
