00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.120 --> 00:53.520
Justice will be served, and the battle will rage. This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage,

00:53.520 --> 00:57.920
and you'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A,

00:57.920 --> 01:02.160
cause we'll put a boot in your ass. It's the American Way.

01:03.360 --> 01:07.680
Welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era,

01:07.680 --> 01:12.880
but specifically Toby Keith fans. What most people don't know is he's quitting Shakespeare there.

01:13.760 --> 01:18.880
Travis works in Shakespeare. He's in the Shakespeare biz, and that is true,

01:18.880 --> 01:20.480
what Travis is saying right now. Hey.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.720
Hey, we got him. What?

01:22.720 --> 01:28.720
Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list, and the Statue of Liberty started shaking her

01:28.720 --> 01:35.040
fist, and the eagle will fly. Man, it's gonna be hell when you hear Mother Freedom start ringing

01:35.040 --> 01:39.280
her bell. Ring the bell, Mother Freedom. You know, we haven't said in a while, but

01:39.280 --> 01:41.360
good work, Tristan. Yeah.

01:41.360 --> 01:46.560
Hey, you got him, man. I attribute this success wholly and entirely to him.

01:46.560 --> 01:53.600
Yes. I know he may have just been in boot camp, and before that, a baby, but I think that he

01:53.600 --> 02:00.240
probably did this all on his own. But now that Osama is dead-

02:00.880 --> 02:02.000
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.360
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.240
You have to say that after every time you acknowledge his death.

02:06.240 --> 02:13.040
I do. Don't worry, I do. Who's next for us? Who's enemy number one,

02:13.040 --> 02:17.440
enemy number uno right now? Who's the new- who's the new hotness?

02:18.240 --> 02:19.200
Space aliens.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.320
Space aliens? I think that that's gonna be- that's sort of a longer play,

02:24.320 --> 02:26.160
but I think certainly that they are-

02:26.160 --> 02:30.000
It took us 10 years to take out a dude on Earth. I think we got time.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.920
I know. I agree with you.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.920
It has to be- it can't be anything ambiguous. It has to be one space alien.

02:36.720 --> 02:39.360
That's the thing. I can't get off- I can't finish

02:39.360 --> 02:45.680
knowing that we are at war with an entire country, but when I think about the full

02:45.680 --> 02:51.280
might of the big bad American military coming after just one dude.

02:51.280 --> 02:51.840
Yeah.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.560
Oh, that's the- that's the good stuff.

02:54.560 --> 02:58.240
I'd like it to be whoever is making the scary movies still.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.240
Wes Craven, your ass is grass.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.840
No, not scary movies.

03:03.840 --> 03:09.280
It's the scary movie series, not just like generally-

03:09.280 --> 03:11.120
Justin hates getting spooked.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.360
Oh, I've been spooked. Nukem.

03:14.080 --> 03:14.800
Nukem.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.560
You got- you got me. Let's get this- let's drop a daisy cutter in there.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.960
Just really murder everybody who made that film.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.400
What if Jamie Lee Curtis got caught in the crossfire, you monster?

03:25.600 --> 03:28.400
Didn't even think about that. This is an advice show- as you've gathered,

03:28.400 --> 03:33.760
this is an advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.320
I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.000
And I'm Griffin McElroy.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.680
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue. So let's get to the advice. So there's this girl I'm really-

03:43.680 --> 03:44.400
Is it- hold on.

03:44.400 --> 03:44.720
Whoa.

03:44.720 --> 03:51.760
Is it weird that I am super against the death penalty, like in every way imaginable,

03:51.760 --> 03:59.840
but I would be okay with, like, putting makeup on Osama Bin Laden's dead-ass assassinated corpse

03:59.840 --> 04:04.240
and, like, letting people, like, pay ten bucks to get, like, a funny picture taken with it?

04:04.240 --> 04:08.880
Yeah, it's- it's- that's fine. It just means you're, like, a huge hypocrite. That's the only thing-

04:08.880 --> 04:13.200
No, here's what it is. I've been thinking about it. I think it's, like, the difference between,

04:13.200 --> 04:17.200
you know, you don't want to see anyone die, but when someone elevates themselves to the level of,

04:17.200 --> 04:18.560
like, super villain-

04:18.560 --> 04:21.200
Like mega dick. Like, yeah, like, I'm like-

04:21.200 --> 04:24.720
Yeah, like, I want a mega dick on a punch through his face, you know what I mean?

04:24.720 --> 04:24.800
Yeah.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.960
Like, when you're on a super villain level, you get- you get what's coming.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.200
Yeah, courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.600
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue. I would have preferred the Phantom Zone, but that's just-

04:35.600 --> 04:43.200
that's just me. So, anyway, real actual ass advice for real people who are still alive.

04:43.200 --> 04:43.680
Okay.

04:43.680 --> 04:48.080
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue. So there's this girl I'm really into right now. I can tell-

04:48.080 --> 04:55.040
Oh, sorry. I misread that. He's not into her right now with an expectation to be less into her later.

04:55.040 --> 05:01.840
Let me try again. So there's this girl I'm really into. Right now, I can tell she sees us as friends,

05:01.840 --> 05:05.840
but I really think that if I have patience and work at it, something could possibly materialize

05:05.840 --> 05:10.320
between us. Here's where the complications arise. I cannot tell my friends I like her,

05:10.320 --> 05:15.360
as keep it a secret doesn't seem to register with them. So they don't know I'm really into this girl

05:15.360 --> 05:20.560
and are fully intent on setting me up with another girl who we know is into me. She's a nice girl,

05:20.560 --> 05:25.520
but not the one I really want. I've tried to slow down their setup plan as much as possible,

05:25.520 --> 05:28.160
but it's fast approaching. Shit, this is exciting!

05:28.160 --> 05:28.960
I know!

05:28.960 --> 05:32.960
Should I break a girl's heart for a chance to be with the girl I really love? Have you any tips

05:33.760 --> 05:38.720
for slowing down the oncoming setup from those who wait? Oh, shit.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.640
There's so much going on in this question.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.600
It's thrilling! God damn, I miss being a teenager. Do you know the biggest, like,

05:45.600 --> 05:50.400
the biggest thing like this is, like, for me is, like, I really wanted to go to Fazoli's,

05:50.400 --> 05:54.800
but Arby's is right there. Ah, fuck it. I'll get some beef.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.640
That's poignant in its own way.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.360
Yeah, and it has its own implications in the real world.

06:00.320 --> 06:07.120
So it sounds like this question is threefold. One, there's, he likes this girl that doesn't like him.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.280
Two, his friends can't keep a secret. Three, they're trying to set him up

06:11.280 --> 06:15.920
with a girl he doesn't dig, right? Those are, like, the three main points of this question.

06:16.480 --> 06:16.720
Right.

06:17.440 --> 06:17.680
Okay.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.080
Good. Thanks. Thank you for that stuff.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.680
There's a lot going on in that question.

06:23.680 --> 06:27.760
That cliff's notes on that 30-second-long question.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.000
It's a recap show for the modern era. We take your questions and boil them down.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.760
Can I get an index card with some bullet points on it?

06:35.760 --> 06:36.720
Yeah.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.640
Well, my next turn was to answer those questions in turn, but...

06:40.640 --> 06:42.880
Oh, you're doing a, oh, a setup.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.640
Yeah, I was, I was...

06:45.280 --> 06:49.680
All right. Well, you bumped it, we set it, now spike it to the advice.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.040
All right. One.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.360
You didn't have anything!

06:55.360 --> 06:55.680
You touched the net.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.600
No, I do. I do. I swear. God, I do.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.720
My question is, and this is for you guys, Justin, Griffin, and everyone else.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.160
What is the possibility?

07:06.160 --> 07:10.640
I, I, whenever I hear someone say, I really like this girl, she just sees us as friends,

07:10.640 --> 07:14.880
but I think with some hard work and dedication, I can change her mind.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.080
I know what you're thinking.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.360
And I think that that's a fool's game.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.560
That is a fool's game.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.600
Uh, where no good, no, there's no cute meat that starts with wearing her down.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.640
Like that is not, you never see that part in a romantic comedy.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.560
Well, we met each other and then I broke her will like a stallion.

07:32.560 --> 07:37.840
Maybe he just needs some time to get a sexy, right?

07:38.640 --> 07:38.880
Whoa.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.360
You think, oh, you were thinking some Patrick Dempsey and can't buy me love shit.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.480
That is specifically and exactly what I'm talking about.

07:48.480 --> 07:53.840
That is the exact shit you were thinking just now in the second.

07:53.840 --> 07:58.640
I was furiously looking up YouTube clips from that movie just now while talking.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.400
That's just part of his routine.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.560
Oh yeah, my early morning routine.

08:02.560 --> 08:07.520
Um, yeah, I, I think that, I think that, uh, uh, if you have to,

08:07.520 --> 08:08.640
Travis has a great point.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.800
If you have to work at it, it's probably not meant to be.

08:12.800 --> 08:18.480
Cause that's like, that's how you end up being the guy who like she'll break up with somebody

08:18.480 --> 08:21.680
and you'll, you're like, I'm going to slip in there, but no, no dice.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.400
Cause she's, she's just not that into you.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.240
And you run the risk of just completely like debasing yourself.

08:30.240 --> 08:35.280
Like the harder you work and say you spend six months convincing this girl to date you

08:35.280 --> 08:36.640
and then you actually get together.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.680
You are going to be so unhappy in this relationship because everything that happens, you're like,

08:41.680 --> 08:43.200
oh shit, I hope I didn't piss her off.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.800
I don't want her to break up with me.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.560
Like it will not be an even relationship.

08:48.560 --> 08:55.120
So you're, you're saying go with, go with the adequate lover.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.760
No, I'm saying like, I don't, I don't think he's giving this second girl a chance because

08:59.760 --> 09:00.480
he's so hung up on the first girl.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.840
She's my adequate lover.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.000
Your backup lover.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.720
Look at her.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.720
She's, she's beautiful in her, her way, her way.

09:09.360 --> 09:15.040
She, I tell you what, get rid of those glasses, dust those funyuns, combs off her shirt.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.480
You might have a prize there.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.920
A hidden treasure.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.640
Yeah, put a blue ribbon on that sweet baby.

09:20.640 --> 09:27.920
Hey, and as Travis points out that it's also not a very attractive quality to be on the

09:27.920 --> 09:31.440
hot, to be like working really hard to wear somebody down.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.520
Here's, here's a classic movie line you never heard.

09:34.240 --> 09:40.160
Frankly, my dear, if you need me or whatever or something opens up, just call me.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.760
Like you got my cell and Twitter and stuff.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.120
So like whatever.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.880
I keep my phone turned on while I sleep.

09:44.880 --> 09:48.000
So if you have like a bad dream or something, I don't want to talk about it.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.200
Yeah, or just frankly, my dear, come on, frankly, my dear.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.040
I don't think you're going to do better.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.560
That was very frank of me.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.760
So that was, that was linguistically accurate.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.280
Frankly, my dear, I give so many dams.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.240
Yeah, I've give like many dams about a hundred billion dams.

10:10.800 --> 10:16.080
I say, I think that if you're okay, you got someone who's into you right now.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.320
You got someone who's not into you right now.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.000
Go with the one who is into you right now.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.160
Cause it's not like a, it's not like a one or the other.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.080
Like one of these paths does not close down.

10:24.080 --> 10:30.320
Maybe other girls, maybe she is your forever love and she's just not ready for that yet.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.440
Maybe the two of you aren't ready in a destiny sense.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.960
Here's a simple direct thing for them trying to set you up.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.080
If you do decide that you don't want to go up and you don't want to go with this set

10:40.080 --> 10:42.160
up date, just tell your friends no.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.720
Yeah, that's a good point too.

10:44.720 --> 10:49.280
Just be directed if they're like, Hey, so just get, you know, I'm not really down with this.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.280
Hey guys, the end.

10:51.840 --> 10:52.080
Thanks.

10:52.080 --> 10:52.640
But no, thanks.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.440
Griffin.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.160
Yeah, I got it.

10:54.160 --> 10:54.720
What I need.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.880
This one was sent in by, uh, I am.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.400
Oh, start a on Twitter.

11:00.400 --> 11:00.720
Thank you.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.080
Timely.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.400
Um, Yahoo answers user Diego asks.

11:06.400 --> 11:14.000
Thanks. Why does my girlfriend feel weird having sex with me because of the posters on my wall?

11:16.080 --> 11:23.920
They are of JFK Gandhi and Benjamin Franklin.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.040
Additional details.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.000
They are on my wall because I strive to be like them.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.040
Okay.

11:31.840 --> 11:32.720
In the sack.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.040
Yeah.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.840
In bed.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.000
Is that what we're, is that what we're presupposing?

11:36.000 --> 11:41.280
Because, uh, I'm sure I can do for you, but what you can do for me.

11:41.280 --> 11:41.840
Yeah.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.160
Yeah.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.600
What you can do for my, my, my Dick.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.400
I'm the president.

11:48.480 --> 11:48.800
Mr.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.240
Kennedy president.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.920
President Kennedy was, uh, probably pretty proficient.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.240
Yeah.

11:56.240 --> 11:56.480
Oh yeah.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.840
Now, now president Gandhi, on the other hand, president Gandhi.

11:59.840 --> 12:06.000
I don't know if you like, if you like those, if you like them stringy, I guess.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.840
I think definite bottom, we have to assume.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.240
Right.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.440
I mean, why are you, you're saying he's, you're saying Gandhi was gay.

12:14.160 --> 12:19.280
No, I'm just saying like in a, it could be in a people use a bottom.

12:19.280 --> 12:19.840
Justin.

12:20.880 --> 12:21.120
No.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.640
Why can we put this in the show?

12:24.720 --> 12:26.720
God, if he was gay, that would be so much fun.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.800
All right.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.000
Can we, okay.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.160
Can we agree for the, this question for the fixture of this question

12:36.160 --> 12:40.880
that we are going to answer it in an alternate universe in which Gandhi was gay?

12:40.880 --> 12:43.360
So I can make that joke about it being a bottom.

12:44.320 --> 12:44.720
No.

12:44.720 --> 12:44.960
Yes.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.680
I'm saying a one question.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.440
Just give me a break on reality for this one question.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.800
So I can make this gag.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.320
It will be in an alternate reality in the sense that I'll delete it from the show and

12:56.320 --> 12:58.080
send it to the fucking phantom zone.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.800
Osama and my hilarious Gandhi spoof.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.600
To be fair Griffin, you don't know what was in Gandhi's heart.

13:07.600 --> 13:07.920
Yeah.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.040
Or in his butt.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.720
He has a very quiet heart, but.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.160
Okay.

13:14.160 --> 13:14.960
All right.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.600
All right.

13:15.600 --> 13:15.840
Bye.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.600
This is my final offer.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.120
Vicarious.

13:21.120 --> 13:25.760
Vicarious, we are in an alternate reality for the duration of this question

13:25.760 --> 13:28.240
in which Gandhi was vicarious.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.600
Now hold on.

13:30.880 --> 13:31.600
Well, I do want to take a second.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.400
What was the goof?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.480
What was even the spoof that started this?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.600
A quick time out.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.720
Welcome our new listeners.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.080
Gandhi, the spoof was he would be a bottom because he was into like,

13:42.640 --> 13:45.600
he was into non-aggression and passive.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.160
You know what I mean?

13:46.160 --> 13:46.400
Like.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
And also really weak from the not eating.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.960
And a giant butthole.

13:53.120 --> 13:53.520
Okay.

13:54.080 --> 13:54.400
All right.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.560
So I will agree to.

13:57.280 --> 13:57.680
All right.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.960
I will drop my gag.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.160
I will drop my spoof.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.840
Yeah, it didn't make a whole lot of sense.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.440
Okay.

14:03.440 --> 14:08.160
But yeah, but if you had given me the leeway to make him gay,

14:08.160 --> 14:11.200
I just want our show to like appeal to everybody.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.560
And we had a bunch of.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.160
Even fiction writers.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.480
I want it to appeal that people writing alternate histories.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.280
Um, I bet Ben Franklin got down.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.800
Oh, yeah.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.520
Like, oh, my God.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.080
Are you kidding me?

14:25.120 --> 14:28.560
Back in the 18th century, it was just a constant Bacchanalian.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.160
Just Buckfest.

14:30.160 --> 14:30.560
Yeah.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.200
All the time.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.400
All the time.

14:32.960 --> 14:33.440
All the time.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.200
The First Continental Congress.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.400
Close the windows.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.480
We don't want the secrets to get out or the stink.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.840
Reopen those windows.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.320
John Hancock just blacked out.

14:45.520 --> 14:45.840
Wow.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.960
So I don't think it's weird that you have those posters on your wall.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.760
I do know.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.200
I did want to know your supplier for Benjamin Franklin posters.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.800
I do want to know where do you pick those up at?

14:58.800 --> 15:00.160
Because I would like to get one.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.480
He was basically the best dude ever.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.080
Like, I can understand.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, he was like the coolest guy.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.680
He was like the fucking coolest guy.

15:07.680 --> 15:12.400
He's sitting there flying a kite with a key on it while boning down on a lady.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.920
Check out this key thing I did.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.960
Now get on it.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.520
Get on it.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.000
That's just history.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.280
That's basic history.

15:19.280 --> 15:19.920
That's a quote.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.400
That's a basic quote from a history book.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.720
An old classic.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.200
Now, JFK was a known philanderer.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.160
Philanderer, right?

15:31.200 --> 15:35.760
Maybe the girl, maybe his girl is like, is put off by the vibe.

15:35.760 --> 15:42.800
The sort of no rules, fire island, swinger vibe that JFK is putting off.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.920
No rules, no fear.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.320
Just bounce on the tip on the person.

15:46.320 --> 15:51.040
Is it possible that during their lovemaking, he's referencing the posters?

15:51.840 --> 15:53.120
See, that's what I'm worried about.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.240
Oh, okay.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.280
Like he's like pointing at them and going, this one's for you, Ben.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.000
Or not even.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.800
I think speaking would alleviate the tension in this situation I'm talking about.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.720
Like she catches him just staring into the eyes of Benjamin Franklin

16:06.720 --> 16:09.120
while crushing them guts.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.680
Maybe he's reflecting on some of their other accomplishments.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.000
Maybe he's crushing them guts while he's thinking about

16:18.000 --> 16:20.720
how cool it was to invent the first fire station or something.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.040
Yeah, I do love bifocals.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.120
I don't think it's weird.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.960
I think that it's, you know, that's why a lot of people don't have posters.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.280
No, you're saying that.

16:31.280 --> 16:35.920
You are saying that people who don't have posters don't have those posters

16:35.920 --> 16:40.400
because they're uncomfortable having posters in their room during coitus?

16:40.400 --> 16:43.040
Yes, I'm saying that if you don't, yeah.

16:43.040 --> 16:48.640
Okay, I think 99% of bedroom decoration decisions are,

16:48.640 --> 16:51.680
would this be weird if I was boning in here?

16:51.680 --> 16:52.800
Like, would this be weird?

16:52.800 --> 16:56.320
That's why you don't put like pictures of your meemaw in your bedroom

16:56.320 --> 16:59.040
because like, what if you catch a glimpse?

16:59.040 --> 17:02.240
Although I do have that poster where the cat's hanging from the tree branch

17:02.240 --> 17:03.520
and it says, hang in there.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.280
Well, yeah, because that's helpful advice.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.880
Like, yeah, yeah.

17:06.880 --> 17:11.200
I'm worried about the way that you guys are looking at your bedroom

17:11.200 --> 17:15.840
because for me, it's a peaceful place where I can go and energize

17:15.840 --> 17:17.920
like a robot for my next day of work.

17:18.560 --> 17:24.880
And to you, it's like some sort of like, it's like the seedy sex room.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.160
Now, why do you think that might be?

17:29.600 --> 17:32.160
Why, because I like robots and you guys like sex.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.520
You are mutually exclusive.

17:39.520 --> 17:48.080
I only, I have enough attention to really dedicate myself to one concentration

17:48.080 --> 17:50.640
and you guys, and by you guys, I mean everybody else.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.480
To put it in tarot's group, I can understand.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.520
He only has enough RAM to think about robots.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.000
He doesn't have enough RAM to RAM is what he's saying.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.120
That's what I'm saying.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
I need an upgrade.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.880
I need a dual core.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.720
Can I come over and sleep with you tonight?

18:04.720 --> 18:05.200
I don't know.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.480
I'm going to be devoting a lot of energy to pretending I'm a robot.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.080
I'm afraid you might impede that in some sense.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.600
Hey, my friend just got engaged to his girlfriend, which is great.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.720
I'm invited to their engagement party, which is not so great.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.120
Here is my problem.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.680
It's a potluck at the girlfriend's house.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.680
I think fiance is now the proper nomenclature.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.160
Yeah, they are throwing.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.560
I think it's really tacky and don't want to bring anything.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.040
Is this a jerk move?

18:35.920 --> 18:37.200
What should I do?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.120
Mike, not even in the wedding.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.840
Oh, this is so, this is like a Da Vinci code.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.160
There's a secret in this question.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.360
Can you find the secret?

18:45.360 --> 18:49.920
Because his thing that he's upset about is total shenanigans.

18:49.920 --> 18:54.640
And it just slips in the real question right there at the end.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.440
Right there at the end.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.000
What is it?

18:56.000 --> 18:56.560
I don't know.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.920
It's Hebrew for apple.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.680
That means that it's at this address.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.480
What's there?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.560
The foreskin Da Vinci code.

19:04.640 --> 19:08.320
So you guys are saying the real issue is that he's not in the wedding?

19:08.320 --> 19:09.200
Of course.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.480
That's what he's upset about.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.360
What is his other issue?

19:11.360 --> 19:16.640
He is abstaining from bringing potato salad because he was not asked to do a reading.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.640
His other issue is that none of their friends or family are close enough to throw them an

19:20.640 --> 19:21.280
engagement party.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.480
That's what he's mad about.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.320
Like, hey, I would have done it.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.080
Why address me?

19:26.080 --> 19:28.080
I would have thrown you a potluck.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.320
Potluck is also the easiest thing to throw.

19:30.320 --> 19:35.600
Well, potluck is the shittiest party because it's saying, hey, come to our party and we

19:35.600 --> 19:41.840
just need you to bring the food and drinks and some decorations and I don't know, some

19:41.840 --> 19:43.600
plates and cups if you can pick them up.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.440
It's also the shittiest.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.360
It's the shittiest party because you say on the invitation, like, everybody brings something,

19:49.360 --> 19:53.760
but just make sure somebody brings rolls and then you get to the party and it's just fucking

19:53.760 --> 19:54.560
70 rolls.

19:55.200 --> 19:55.920
I don't even know what to do with these.

19:55.920 --> 20:01.840
Everybody brought a two liter of off-brand soda and a bag of rippled potato chips.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.920
Oh, man, that sounds like a, see, to me, sounds like a party.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.680
Yeah, we need to get engaged.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.880
Yeah, I gotta get engaged.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.120
Gotta find my robot bride.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.920
Can you be my girl?

20:13.920 --> 20:15.760
Girl, my heart is in beta.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.720
Mike, Mike, you are upset about them not asking you to be in the wedding and that's what's

20:22.720 --> 20:23.600
bothering you.

20:23.600 --> 20:29.920
I think you gotta A, talk to them about it or B, like, just, just make some steak and

20:29.920 --> 20:30.800
take it over.

20:30.800 --> 20:35.760
Just pick up some macaroons or something at the Kmart and just take it over there.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.400
Steak would be fucking baller for a potluck.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.280
Are you kidding me?

20:39.280 --> 20:40.240
How's your potluck?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.920
I guess I just made it way better, huh?

20:41.920 --> 20:47.520
Yeah, you should, if we treated potlucks more like competitions and less, and less like

20:47.520 --> 20:52.480
fucking slop troughs, like just put Discord in your face, I bought it at Kmart.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.680
But you sweet boy, I'm sorry.

20:55.680 --> 21:00.160
I know that that must be, that's such a sensitive time, you know, choosing who's going to be

21:00.160 --> 21:00.800
in a wedding party.

21:00.800 --> 21:01.760
So many factors to consider.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.160
It doesn't mean they didn't like you, you know, it means that, it means that maybe she

21:06.160 --> 21:09.520
only had X number of friends and he couldn't ask you or something like that.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.880
You never know what happened.

21:10.880 --> 21:14.400
And bad news, yeah, you totally have to bring something to that party.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.200
You gotta.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.080
You have to.

21:16.080 --> 21:16.880
Yeah, I can't.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.320
I understand the reluctance, but you're going to be that guy.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.600
I get it, but you're right.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.480
Like Travis is right.

21:22.480 --> 21:27.920
You are, there is no debate on what guy you're going to be because the answer is that guy.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.400
That's the guy.

21:29.200 --> 21:33.440
To put it in different terms, it's like if someone said a party was BYOB and you said

21:33.440 --> 21:37.120
that's shitty and then you showed up and asked to drink everyone else's beer.

21:37.120 --> 21:43.120
And not like some of everyone else's beer, literally just a row of all the beers at the

21:43.120 --> 21:47.600
party that you're slamming one after another, like a scene from the hit ABC family series,

21:47.600 --> 21:48.100
Greek.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

21:51.920 --> 21:57.760
Hey, I live in a college dorm and recently an unfamiliar girl has taken to using my whole

21:57.760 --> 21:59.200
bathroom to shower.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.880
This would be fine, except that she always showers with the curtain open.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.160
I can only.

22:04.160 --> 22:04.640
What?

22:04.640 --> 22:05.680
Slower, slower.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.400
Slower, okay, I will go slower.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.440
Uh, hold on.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.120
Just let me find a place here.

22:11.120 --> 22:17.520
I can only assume that she's creeped out her own hall mates and has to find new turf, but

22:17.520 --> 22:19.520
it's beginning to creep me out as well.

22:19.520 --> 22:25.040
Not to mention flooding the bathroom, which leads me to wonder why might a person prefer

22:25.040 --> 22:31.440
to shower with the curtain open and what can I do to get her to stop flooded in Philly?

22:31.440 --> 22:33.040
You can shut the fuck up.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.480
You're ruining it for everyone.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.200
We need this.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.640
We need this in our lives.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.440
You're ruining it.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.040
I mean, that.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.080
What other reason could it be other than she wanted to get watched?

22:46.080 --> 22:48.240
She wants you to see those fat boobies.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.280
There is no justification to this action.

22:53.280 --> 22:53.600
Yeah.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.960
What other could I like to feel?

22:55.520 --> 22:56.320
I like the breeze.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.800
It's time for a show.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.240
It's my it's my religion.

23:00.240 --> 23:04.160
And this is probably a there's probably a girl asking this question.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.320
Yeah, right?

23:06.320 --> 23:07.200
Yeah, that's right.

23:07.200 --> 23:12.560
I'm not a guy because that that guy would know that even if he were not of that persuasion

23:12.560 --> 23:17.200
where he would enjoy something like that, the the punishment for ending something like

23:17.200 --> 23:19.600
that would be so severe that you couldn't withstand.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.240
Right?

23:20.240 --> 23:26.400
Listen, like we're talking exile, exile in Guyville, but communal showers in the first

23:26.400 --> 23:28.560
place are so creepy and fucking weird.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.000
And the reason I never lived in a dorm, if I lived in a dorm, I would have gone home

23:32.000 --> 23:32.720
to shower.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.640
I would have driven to my my parents' house and showered there and gone back.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.680
That's unacceptable.

23:38.240 --> 23:42.720
I have never, ever been in the shower and thought it's just so stuffy in here.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.000
Yeah.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.480
Oh, boy.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.560
I need to pop open this door real quick.

23:46.560 --> 23:51.280
Like, I don't understand why anyone the water splashes everywhere.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.320
And it's just weird.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.520
It's just weird.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.400
Maybe she just maybe she just saw Psycho for the first time.

23:56.400 --> 24:02.400
And like, but if a merger gets in the room, like saying them isn't going to do you any

24:02.400 --> 24:03.040
help.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.280
Yeah.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.160
And here's the thing.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.600
If you're in a communal bathroom, there's people in and out of that bathroom.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.800
Like, is your fear like, what if somebody walks in?

24:10.800 --> 24:11.360
Well, yes.

24:12.240 --> 24:18.960
Maybe just to her and I, these are my least favorite kind of people on the planet to her.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.120
Nudity is no big deal.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.320
Don't worry about it.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.000
It's just it's just my boobs.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.520
It's just my boobs and my vagina.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.480
No big deal.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.120
This is cool.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.800
One of those houses.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.840
One of those houses.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.560
I can't.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.440
I can't.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.640
I can't be a party to that.

24:32.640 --> 24:36.160
It's like when I go to the pool and like I go to the changing room and there are dudes

24:36.160 --> 24:37.840
just like, check out my free balls.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.080
Check these out.

24:40.080 --> 24:40.880
My balls are waiting.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.080
They're like inches away.

24:42.640 --> 24:46.640
Are you saying that maybe this girl grew up in a home where while one person was showering,

24:46.640 --> 24:50.720
another one could be shooting a deuce on the toilet and like they just got so comfortable

24:50.720 --> 24:54.880
with sharing bathrooms with each other, they just pop open the curtain and have conversations?

24:54.880 --> 25:02.080
I'm saying that the human body, the human body is not a natural, beautiful palace.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.280
It's not.

25:04.160 --> 25:04.800
It's not.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.000
It's fucked up.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.960
Everybody's is weird and fucked up in different ways.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.320
Your secrets are stuck to you.

25:12.320 --> 25:17.440
Your secrets are you have secret parts all over that nobody knows about and nobody should

25:17.440 --> 25:18.320
know about.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.960
And you can't be like, oh, this is how we're supposed to be.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.560
This is natural.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.360
This is natural.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.440
This is humanity at zero.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.200
We got to get back to zero.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.200
Check out this dick, please.

25:29.840 --> 25:36.640
Straight up, even if you are one of the few that is a beautiful palace, man, that's so

25:36.640 --> 25:37.040
weird.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.280
Like, yeah, then you're just rubbing it in.

25:39.280 --> 25:39.520
Yeah.

25:39.520 --> 25:44.720
And somebody like walks in the bathroom, their media reaction is never going to be, oh, nice.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.720
It's always going to be, whoa, you're ruining everyone.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.000
You're ruining this for everybody.

25:50.000 --> 25:50.800
You're ruining everything.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.600
So if this person is, for some reason, listening right now, cover your shame.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.840
Yeah, just hide that shame.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.400
Nobody needs that.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.360
Unless it's good.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.160
Unless it's nice.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.520
Is it not?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.480
Is it nice?

26:04.480 --> 26:06.000
Wait, but is it nice?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.880
Oh, I hadn't even considered the possibility that it might be nice.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.800
Hey, can you just double check for me?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.000
Because maybe you get spooked.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.680
Double check.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.120
Because it might be nice.

26:17.120 --> 26:22.160
Do we already take a journey to the money zone?

26:22.160 --> 26:23.680
How about a Yahoo first?

26:23.680 --> 26:24.880
Yeah, I already said it.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.440
I already said it.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.720
So I got dibs.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.320
And that's like a contract.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.400
It's like a contract that we make with ourselves.

26:30.400 --> 26:30.640
OK.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.240
OK, Yahoo it is.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.200
This one was sent in by Cameron Daigle.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.120
I'm sorry I said his name like that.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.480
Thank you, Cameron Daigle.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monkey Pot Tree Nut who asks,

26:49.600 --> 26:50.720
pregnant with twins.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.680
Are these good names?

26:53.680 --> 26:54.960
I was thinking of cute and-

26:54.960 --> 26:57.680
Wait, can I prognosticate an answer?

26:57.680 --> 26:58.240
Sure.

26:58.240 --> 26:58.720
They are not.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.560
I was thinking of fun and cute names for my twins, boy and girl.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.680
Heart, I'm also inspired by a lot of celebrities.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.520
Their children have such unique names.

27:09.520 --> 27:10.880
Anyway, here it goes.

27:10.880 --> 27:17.200
Starting with a girl's name and then a boy's name.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.800
Jam and Ham Smith.

27:22.400 --> 27:22.800
Nice.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.040
Lola and Boba Smith.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.280
Boba?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
Sammy and Sammy Smith.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.280
Now hold up.

27:32.400 --> 27:36.320
Sammy S-A-M-I and Sammy S-A-M-M-Y.

27:37.200 --> 27:37.920
Oh, Jesus.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.560
Law and Lee Smith.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.600
Boy, that would make Sophie's Choice really tough, wouldn't it?

27:43.600 --> 27:44.480
Take Sammy.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.360
You guys work it out.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.760
Can you say Law and Lee?

27:49.760 --> 27:51.040
Law and Lee Smith.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.440
Sugar and Spice Smith.

27:54.080 --> 27:54.640
Oh, God.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.280
That's got my-

27:55.280 --> 27:59.840
Wait, is the boy Sugar and the girl Spice and the boy Spice?

27:59.840 --> 28:00.800
Nope, you had it right.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.360
Oh, God.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.640
You know what that boy is?

28:04.640 --> 28:05.680
A teen runaway.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.440
Sylvia and Silvio Smith.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.640
Because they're living in a Shakespeare comedy.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.400
Apple and Pear Smith.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.760
Oh, God.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.880
Which pear is your favorite?

28:18.880 --> 28:19.280
Thanks.

28:22.720 --> 28:23.840
I like apple and pear.

28:23.840 --> 28:28.400
Just like fucking turn your whole family into some big, awful fruit salad.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.640
Big, stupid.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.400
Just a big, dumb compote.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.720
Did my boys in the Yahoo Answers crew, did they have any votes?

28:39.920 --> 28:43.440
Yahoo Answers user, you know you love me, said, great for dogs.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.440
How's your burn?

28:45.440 --> 28:46.400
Hey, check your face.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.200
It's on the ground.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.480
I just rammed your face to the deep fat fryer because it burned so bad.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.440
I burned you so hard.

28:54.320 --> 28:54.880
Pretty good one.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.560
Pretty good zinger.

28:57.120 --> 29:01.360
Okay, someone said Jam is an adorable name for a little girl.

29:01.920 --> 29:02.800
No, it's not.

29:02.800 --> 29:03.440
Nope.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.600
Hey, I take you as my bride, Jam.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.280
Excuse me?

29:09.280 --> 29:10.480
Hi, I'm Jam.

29:11.200 --> 29:11.840
Hi.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.920
That is a fucking power play.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.320
Oh, Jam, what does that mean?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.000
It means my parents were borderline.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.760
It means they were borderline retarded.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.560
It's what it means.

29:20.560 --> 29:23.840
It means that before I was even born, my parents decided they hate me.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.040
They hated me already.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.240
You got legitimate grounds, like, mom, dad, you hate me.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.400
Like, yeah, it seems like it.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.440
Can we come up with some other rhyming couplets for this?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.360
Sure, sure.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.480
Food based, maybe, since most of these are.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.360
So, like, these are my kids, Hot and Pocket.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.000
What rhymes would be better off adopted?

29:48.000 --> 29:48.320
Mark.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.280
Mark, that's not quite it.

29:51.280 --> 29:55.200
But what about Julie and Julia?

29:55.200 --> 30:00.480
These are my kids, Susan and Schmoozin.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.760
This is my son, Schmoozin.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.120
I'm very proud of him.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.160
I love him dearly.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.560
What about, can we call him Pepsi and Coke?

30:09.440 --> 30:10.560
Pepsi and Coke.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.320
Pepsi, okay.

30:12.320 --> 30:15.760
Can you choose between my kids in a blind taste test?

30:17.680 --> 30:18.800
What is that, Uncle Kevin?

30:18.800 --> 30:19.440
No, thank you.

30:19.440 --> 30:23.040
Can you call one Mountain Dew and one Dr. Pepper?

30:23.040 --> 30:26.720
What if this is their younger sister, Mr. Pibb?

30:26.720 --> 30:29.760
I am Dr. Dr. Pepper Smith.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.200
This is my brother, Jam.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.840
This is our poor cousin, Dr. Thunder.

30:35.840 --> 30:41.840
Just keep having twins until you can fucking stock a refrigerator with your children.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.880
But don't do that.

30:42.880 --> 30:46.800
I can't state this strongly enough.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.560
Sweetheart, we ran out of Miracle Whip.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.480
We've got to have a kid, I guess, and name him that.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.240
How does this work again?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.800
I don't understand.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.840
Let's go for a kid.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.640
I'm confused.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.840
You name the kid the food, but I'm still hungry after it.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.040
Oh, the poor hell that these kids are being born into.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.360
Okay, here's what you need to do.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.520
Whenever you think about what you're going to name your kids,

31:15.520 --> 31:18.240
just set up some practice sentences in your head.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.920
Like, hello, my name is Jam.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.200
I would love to work here.

31:25.920 --> 31:26.960
I want to be a doctor.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.400
I'm your Dr. Jam Smith.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.600
I'm Dr. Jam.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.160
No, I take it back.

31:34.160 --> 31:38.480
Dr. Jam is perfect because you're setting him up to be a professional sports person.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.360
Dr. Jam.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.160
This is my boombox.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.200
He's my resident.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.280
I'm going to cut into you and fix you.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.400
Yeah, this is resident boombox and I'm Dr. Jam.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.280
How can I help you today?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.680
I'm in a private practice with Dr. Kreigenstein.

31:57.360 --> 31:57.920
Take it back.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.040
These are awesome names.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.080
Who is that in the corner?

32:00.080 --> 32:00.640
It's Ham.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.760
It's my brother, Ham.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.400
Some of the ones and twos he's going to mix while I cut in.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.160
Yeah, so I think they're all pretty good.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.080
Griffin, let's do this thing.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.120
What are they short for?

32:13.120 --> 32:18.640
Hamilton and Jamalton.

32:18.640 --> 32:23.360
And our country's 53rd president was, of course, Jamalton P. Smith.

32:26.080 --> 32:26.640
Oh boy.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.280
Holland, let me put my seatbelt on.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.640
Yeah, strap in.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.360
Okay.

32:31.360 --> 32:46.000
Because you just got a first class ticket to the money zone.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.720
We got two personal messages today.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.240
Let's start with this super easy one.

32:54.240 --> 32:59.760
We got a congratulations for Emily and Andrew from their buddy, Jacob Holler.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.000
Tell me about him, Griffin.

33:02.000 --> 33:02.720
Tell me a story.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.800
A quick one, but a good one.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.800
Emily and Andrew.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.800
Naïve, right?

33:08.800 --> 33:09.920
That's how you pronounce it?

33:09.920 --> 33:10.420
Yeah.

33:11.280 --> 33:16.000
Emily Hall and Andrew Horton have combined forces.

33:16.800 --> 33:22.640
They have smushed together to form one person through love.

33:22.640 --> 33:23.360
With love, I mean.

33:24.080 --> 33:28.160
Before you say the last name, it is the dopest last name.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.200
Like the hyphenated power of this name is amazing.

33:31.200 --> 33:35.200
They had a dope ass, totally sick fucking wedding.

33:35.200 --> 33:35.920
It was nice.

33:36.480 --> 33:42.160
And Emily and Andrew are now Emily and Andrew Horton Hall.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.480
That's really fucking dope.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.480
That's pretty, that's pretty nice.

33:46.480 --> 33:51.200
It was officiated by Susan Pratt, which I don't think we've ever announced that before.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.800
But yeah, now you know that.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.360
Breaking news.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.000
Oh, there was a picture and Travis didn't attach it.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.320
So I don't know how nice I should be to them.

33:58.320 --> 33:58.960
I'll tell you what.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.360
I saw this JPEG.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.000
It was a beautiful ceremony.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.280
They were dancing.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.800
They were dancing and looking each other's eyes like, we got one last name now.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.400
But hey, you guys, congratulations.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.040
We're so proud of you and your buddy.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.400
You have a good friend, obviously.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.280
Jacob.

34:19.280 --> 34:23.120
Emily and Jacob are in the same knitting group now, which is a pretty cool thing.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.400
Oh yeah?

34:24.400 --> 34:25.120
What are they knitting?

34:25.120 --> 34:26.720
What do you think their project is right now?

34:27.280 --> 34:29.200
Probably, hopefully something for us.

34:29.200 --> 34:29.920
Yeah.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.520
Because otherwise they're wasting their time.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.640
Can I have a doily?

34:32.640 --> 34:33.920
Can you knit those?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.680
Can you wamp him up a doily, please?

34:36.240 --> 34:38.240
Why don't you stop talking about it?

34:38.800 --> 34:41.680
Make a tiny sweater for their dog, Frankie.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.040
So they're a great couple.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.600
And Jacob wanted to wish you guys a happy marriage.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.000
And a happy birthday.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.800
And a happy birth.

34:48.800 --> 34:49.280
What?

34:49.280 --> 34:50.000
Really?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.520
I mean, eventually.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.640
Eventually he would like to wish you a happy birthday, but he's going to have to pay again

34:54.640 --> 34:55.200
for that.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.160
I'm sorry.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.480
Okay, so our next one comes to us from David.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.880
And this is unprecedented for us, but here we go.

35:03.680 --> 35:09.440
His money zone request is to buy our UK soccer alliance.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.000
Allegiance.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.840
Well, I like to think of it as teaming up.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.400
Allegiance.

35:14.960 --> 35:15.520
Allegiance.

35:15.520 --> 35:16.960
We'll meet you in the middle.

35:17.920 --> 35:18.720
And this is for the...

35:20.080 --> 35:22.080
So who are we fans of now, Griffin?

35:22.080 --> 35:27.200
We are now the official Brotherly Comm Advice podcast.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.040
Comm Vice.

35:29.040 --> 35:29.920
Bro Comm.

35:29.920 --> 35:35.280
Bro Comm Vice of the Millwall FC.

35:35.280 --> 35:39.120
Which I believe FC is short for football corporation.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.360
They're with a Millwall football company.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.000
Millwall football co.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.040
They're out there every fucking day on the pitch.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.440
Fucking striking it.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.720
Fucking blocking it.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.160
Fucking kicking it.

35:54.160 --> 35:57.520
Penalties, passes, triples.

35:57.520 --> 36:06.640
As you well know, they're the pride of South Bermondsey in the London Borough of Lewisham,

36:06.640 --> 36:08.480
which is Southeast London.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.680
They're formed in 1885.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.160
It's a good year.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.680
They're represented by lions.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.880
Their home colors are blue and white.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.880
Their way colors are yellow and blue, it seems like.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.440
And I would like to take a moment to thank David for having the foresight to think,

36:26.320 --> 36:31.600
you know, for an amount of money, the brothers will become the official something of anything.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.440
That's completely true.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.320
Thank you, David.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.200
This is a note for anybody else.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.480
We will become the official whatevers of whatever the fuck you want.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.320
There is no allegiance we have, we hold so dear,

36:44.320 --> 36:47.040
that we will not abandon it for a hundred dollars.

36:47.920 --> 36:54.160
You think if anybody else, if somebody from Crystal Palace or Charlton or Leeds or West Ham

36:54.160 --> 36:58.400
had contacted us first, we totally would have become the official podcast to them.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.680
But now, yeah, here's the problem that you guys can get to us first.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.600
And now we think all your football companies are bitches.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.960
Millwall is what's up.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.560
Go Lions.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.000
Go Lions.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.560
Meow.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.600
We're going to maul you.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.640
What's that in the grass?

37:12.640 --> 37:15.600
That tall, that tall African grass.

37:15.600 --> 37:15.840
Yeah.

37:15.840 --> 37:16.320
It's Millwall.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.080
And it was, it was an instant change.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.640
Someone brings up all time top scorer Neil Harris.

37:20.640 --> 37:21.680
I tear up.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.480
Neil Patrick Harris is their football man.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.480
He's their, he's their kick, he's their football kicker.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.600
Yeah, close.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.200
Guess how many goals he scored in his last game?

37:32.960 --> 37:33.360
How many?

37:33.360 --> 37:37.360
He got, he got three one-pointers and six two-pointers.

37:38.320 --> 37:38.640
Wow.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.960
That is very impressive.

37:40.960 --> 37:41.920
Yeah.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.320
And check this for an awesome name.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.280
Team manager, Kenny Jacket.

37:48.000 --> 37:48.320
That's-

37:48.880 --> 37:49.680
Kenny Jacket?

37:50.800 --> 37:51.120
Kenny Jacket.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.080
That's why we got into him.

37:52.080 --> 37:52.960
It's a dope ass name.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.240
Yeah, Kenny Jacket.

37:54.240 --> 37:54.800
I like it.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.360
He's a, Neil Harris is a striker.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.640
Why didn't we not have a football alliance?

38:00.640 --> 38:03.920
Oh, by the way, we're also only calling it football from now on

38:03.920 --> 38:05.040
because now we're into it.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.080
Now we're into this world.

38:06.080 --> 38:11.760
Now we call, we call our football, football Norte Americano.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.880
Griffin, time to let that-

38:14.880 --> 38:15.520
Oh, fuck.

38:15.520 --> 38:20.480
That pride, that deep, deep-

38:20.480 --> 38:22.720
Just open your heart and let the pride out.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.000
Just let the pride out.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.440
Can I, we should do a fight song.

38:28.080 --> 38:28.880
Hold on.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.160
For Emily and Andrew?

38:31.920 --> 38:33.600
And a tender love ballad about the football.

38:33.600 --> 38:40.000
Go fight Mary.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.680
Uh, so give me some talking points.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.040
How can I mix these two together?

38:44.080 --> 38:46.240
Uh, we got, well, we got fighting.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.160
Something about cleats.

38:57.200 --> 38:57.520
Yep.

38:57.520 --> 39:09.600
Strap on those cleats.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.440
Walk down the aisle.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.200
Don't block that goal.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.120
Something about cleats.

39:21.120 --> 39:26.880
And it's a soccer wedding.

39:34.480 --> 39:39.920
You got a yellow card for throwing rice too hard.

39:42.080 --> 39:46.960
You cut the cake and shoot a penalty shot.

39:46.960 --> 39:52.080
It's a soccer wedding.

39:59.120 --> 40:04.560
I went to the wedding of Emily and Andrew Horton Hall.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.320
Neil Patrick Harris was there.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.080
It was nice.

40:12.080 --> 40:17.200
It was nice.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.200
It was a soccer wedding.

40:19.200 --> 40:28.320
It was a soccer wedding.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.200
Go Lions!

40:32.480 --> 40:39.360
That wasn't so much a jingle as much as it was a song about a soccer wedding.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.240
Uh, I think it still counts.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.080
If you could have thrown monsters in there and made it a monster

40:48.080 --> 40:49.920
soccer wedding, you would have had a party hit.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.120
Anything you threw in there sort of ideologically would have just glommed on.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.240
That song was a, that was a music.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.080
It was a monster soccer wedding.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.760
A soccer wedding.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.360
That was a thematic stew.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.400
That's what I just made.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.120
I like it.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.800
Simmering its own juices.

41:04.800 --> 41:09.280
I work in a pretty conservative office and although my co-workers are pleasant enough,

41:09.280 --> 41:12.480
they're not the type of folks I would ever hang out with if I weren't getting paid.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.880
Every once in a while they organize a dinner at a restaurant after work.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.720
Pretty much everyone, including my boss, goes,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.960
I've been to a couple and they're not torture.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.800
They're just boring and I'd rather go home.

41:23.360 --> 41:27.520
What's a way to get out of these without alienating anyone or seeming like a dick?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.440
Just here for the cheddar.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.800
I think you got to think of this as part of your gig.

41:32.800 --> 41:37.840
You got to think of it because if you're going to advance in your, in your company or, or,

41:37.840 --> 41:41.040
or whatever, having those personal relationships with people above you

41:41.040 --> 41:42.800
are really going to be invaluable.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.640
I think you got to think of it as like part of your job.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.480
You could also, I don't know, find a fatigue disease.

41:50.480 --> 41:54.640
Something that's not like deadly or life-threatening and like doesn't affect it,

41:54.640 --> 41:56.160
but like just kind of makes you sleepy.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.040
A fatigue?

41:57.040 --> 41:58.800
Like say you have an iron deficiency.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.680
Fatigue disease?

41:59.680 --> 42:01.680
Like, like African sleeping sickness.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.800
Is this a, is this a go-to thing for you?

42:04.800 --> 42:06.240
Have you done this before?

42:06.240 --> 42:07.280
Have you pulled this move?

42:07.280 --> 42:10.400
You came out with that move pretty quick, I think.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
You know, you got mono.

42:13.600 --> 42:14.880
I've got stereo.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.920
It's double bad.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.520
I'm sleepy all the time.

42:17.520 --> 42:18.240
I got to go.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.160
Thank you for the breadsticks though.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.040
They were really good.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.080
You got that from kissing.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.360
I got mine from fucking.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.760
It's called stereo.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.600
Wait, that's a great idea.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.280
At the dinner, just make such awkward conversation that they don't ask you to come back.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.960
Prefer you not be there.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.680
That's good.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.280
That's that hold on.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.080
What's that smell?

42:38.080 --> 42:41.600
I smells like a recipe for success for in business.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.320
So it smells like a recipe for business success.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.800
Who we got a promotion coming up.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.680
Who should we give it to?

42:47.680 --> 42:48.160
I don't know.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.280
Weird Mike.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.720
Yeah, yeah.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.800
Let's give it to jam.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.720
Let's give it to ostracized jam.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.400
That guy seems all right.

42:57.520 --> 42:58.000
Jamalton.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.440
Jamalton, we need to have a talk.

43:00.400 --> 43:04.800
You said some shit during that party that I have never heard before.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.560
I have never been a party to that kind of talk.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.320
And frankly, I love it.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.040
You're hired.

43:09.040 --> 43:09.360
You're hired.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.080
Double hired.

43:10.880 --> 43:11.840
You're already hired.

43:11.840 --> 43:12.720
You're hired twice.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.680
Here's two paychecks.

43:14.160 --> 43:14.880
Now get out of here.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.160
Jamalton, you scamp.

43:16.800 --> 43:17.520
Scampelton.

43:21.600 --> 43:27.200
I know it's not like it's not super fun, but you gotta do it.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.720
Cause like people notice that stuff and they know when someone's just there.

43:31.600 --> 43:32.640
It's all about the money.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.320
For the teasers.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.280
That's the tricky thing.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.560
You can't just go.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.160
I think you really got to invest.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.560
You got to go and you got to like bring your A.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.680
Get your hands dirty.

43:41.680 --> 43:47.760
Well, cause here the fact of the matter is like the underbelly is in any type of job.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.720
You get promoted cause people like you.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.200
Like you could be really awesome at your job.

43:53.200 --> 43:57.840
But if you're that, you know, quiet, creepy guy in the corner, they're not going to bump you up.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.680
They don't want to spend more time with you.

44:00.240 --> 44:00.720
You know what I mean?

44:00.720 --> 44:02.160
They're like, oh yeah, he's great at his job.

44:02.160 --> 44:06.160
So we're going to keep him right there because he's doing such a great job.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.320
But charming Jim over there.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.760
We want to find out more about this charming Jim fellow, right?

44:11.760 --> 44:12.880
We want to elevate him.

44:13.440 --> 44:13.680
Yeah.

44:13.680 --> 44:17.840
We want to put him on a pedestal so we can just be a radiated by his charm.

44:20.480 --> 44:21.040
Be a radio.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.360
You want to be a radiated by charm is what you're saying.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.560
Yeah, by by charming Jim's charm by Jim charm.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.520
And Jamalton, we want to keep right where he's at Jamalton.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.560
You're fine over there.

44:30.560 --> 44:34.160
Actually, can you just over a little just over a little bit?

44:34.160 --> 44:35.520
Scooch a little over.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.240
I'll say when.

44:38.960 --> 44:39.760
Keep going.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.200
Perfect.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.560
Do you guys know what day it is?

44:45.920 --> 44:47.600
Oh, God damn it.

44:47.600 --> 44:47.840
Yep.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.120
Oh, fuck.

44:49.840 --> 44:50.880
It is May now.

44:50.880 --> 44:58.720
I wanted this to be a official swoop in Osama's poon month.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.680
But that might be in poor taste.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.440
Brought to you by the Red White and Blue.

45:03.440 --> 45:07.440
Some people aren't down with the present that the Red White and Blue brought.

45:09.200 --> 45:09.760
And that's fine.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.400
Who brought this to the potluck?

45:12.400 --> 45:13.760
Oh, that's courtesy of the Red White and Blue.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.400
Who brought this dead ass assassinated terrorist to the potluck?

45:16.400 --> 45:17.280
Wasn't me.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.480
I brought the potatoes.

45:18.480 --> 45:22.320
I got to go down the list, though, because I didn't pick it.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.080
Oh, good, good.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.040
Carrots and cauliflower.

45:28.000 --> 45:28.800
Not month.

45:28.800 --> 45:29.600
That's just it.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.280
That's just the title of it.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.400
Just carrots and cauliflower.

45:32.400 --> 45:32.560
Yes.

45:34.080 --> 45:34.960
Baby names.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.400
Get caught reading month.

45:36.960 --> 45:37.680
Yes.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.360
What are you doing over there?

45:39.360 --> 45:41.040
Oh, knock first.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.360
International audit month.

45:45.360 --> 45:48.560
Yay, my favorite.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.920
Let's all celebrate.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.960
We did it.

45:51.520 --> 45:52.880
Nope, you did it wrong.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.600
I want to reject the premise of that month.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.320
I don't think that what do we need to be aware that happens.

45:59.200 --> 46:05.040
You know, I think this every month, but do you pay a fee to get one of these titles?

46:05.040 --> 46:05.760
Like, do you send it?

46:05.760 --> 46:08.880
I think it's like buying a star to name after you.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.280
It's just sort of, you can't.

46:11.280 --> 46:12.240
You know what I love?

46:12.240 --> 46:13.760
Carrots and cauliflower.

46:13.760 --> 46:14.240
Yeah.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.320
We need a month to celebrate.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.560
You probably should slap month on the end of that.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.920
Don't you think, Susan?

46:19.920 --> 46:21.040
No, no.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.240
I wish people would make fun of me for talking about carrots and cauliflower so much.

46:26.240 --> 46:30.720
What I need is a whole month where I can really just get down deep and also fuck broccoli.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.160
National salsa month in parentheses, the food.

46:36.720 --> 46:37.680
Oh, good.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.480
Oh, Jesus.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.240
I just got my dancing shoes on.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.720
I'm glad I get to put instead my tasting tongue.

46:42.720 --> 46:46.400
Prepare tomorrow's parents month.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.840
That's what we do every week here.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.760
I think we don't have a month for that.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.960
Teen CEO month.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.040
Oh, God.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.760
Like Bieber, right?

47:03.760 --> 47:04.400
Huh?

47:04.400 --> 47:05.360
Like Bieber?

47:05.360 --> 47:08.000
Like Bieber is the CEO of Bieber Industries?

47:08.000 --> 47:08.320
Yeah.

47:08.320 --> 47:12.240
Yeah, where did this company go wrong?

47:13.120 --> 47:14.640
Maybe it was the milkshake machine.

47:14.640 --> 47:15.520
This is mysterious.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.040
React month.

47:18.800 --> 47:19.120
Bang.

47:19.120 --> 47:19.680
What was that?

47:21.440 --> 47:21.760
I don't know.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.480
I'll tell you in May.

47:25.040 --> 47:28.560
National hamburger month, national barbecue month, a lot of food.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.000
I don't know.

47:30.000 --> 47:30.480
I don't know.

47:30.480 --> 47:31.920
I need a whole month for hamburgers.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.960
Like I'm pretty much up on those on the reg.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.560
I made a hamburger last week on a grill.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.480
I'm celebrating national hamburger a year.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.840
I'm celebrating national hamburger life.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.600
What about eco driving month?

47:49.600 --> 47:50.880
There's got to be some tips.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.400
There's got to be some tips and tricks.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.640
Guys, you might have to dip into the weekly observances.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.880
Please don't, Christ.

47:59.200 --> 48:00.400
Teen CEO month.

48:01.440 --> 48:02.160
Let's do it.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.360
Let's do it. Let's let's help spread awareness.

48:05.360 --> 48:11.120
Did you know that May 8th through 14th is national a salute to mom's 35 plus week?

48:12.720 --> 48:13.200
What?

48:13.200 --> 48:17.040
Did you know that May 9th through the 13th is national etiquette week?

48:17.680 --> 48:18.080
I don't.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.280
I can't do these weeks with you.

48:19.280 --> 48:24.160
Did you know that May 15th through the 21st is national dog bite prevention week?

48:25.600 --> 48:28.000
Hey, you, you're about to be bitten by a dog.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.400
Don't let that don't let that happen to you.

48:30.400 --> 48:36.400
I I'm just looking for I'm just looking forward to July, which is, of course, national.

48:36.400 --> 48:40.640
Admit this bit you've been trying to make work for six months isn't panning out so well.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.640
It's failing me now.

48:42.640 --> 48:46.000
You think you're not looking at you're not looking forward to that one?

48:46.000 --> 48:49.760
It's like an amnesty where you can admit like, ah, well, we'll give it our best shot.

48:49.760 --> 48:53.120
I'm going to be straight with you guys this entire time as you've been talking about the weeks and

48:53.120 --> 48:57.920
I swear I have, in fact, been picturing teen CEOs and like Mr.

48:57.920 --> 49:02.880
Brad rolling in to the boardroom on a skateboard and saying like, now there's a skateboard room.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.560
Let's do teen CEO month.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.480
Mr. Brad?

49:07.440 --> 49:09.280
Yeah, because that's what he has everyone call him.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.200
He's like, Mr. Johnson is my father.

49:11.200 --> 49:11.920
Call me Mr.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.400
Brad.

49:13.920 --> 49:14.560
Let's start.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.440
Let's start.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.960
OK, I already started.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.520
OK, but in in the form of a PSA, please.

49:20.720 --> 49:21.200
OK.

49:22.400 --> 49:27.360
Hey, hey, teen CEOs, they're just like regular CEOs.

49:27.360 --> 49:29.280
Regular CEOs only shorter.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.280
My brother, my brother.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.200
Teen CEOs.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.440
They'll get dumped and lay off the whole mailroom.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.160
Teen CEOs.

49:42.160 --> 49:44.800
As long as your CFO is a grown up, this should be OK.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.400
Teen CEOs because an adult would want to run everything his way.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.280
My brother, my brother.

49:53.280 --> 49:57.440
Make that one is specific to Charlie the Junko Factory, by the way.

49:57.440 --> 49:58.800
Teen CEOs.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.960
Good luck sleeping your way to the top, felon.

50:05.920 --> 50:07.280
Can I just talk more about Mr.

50:07.280 --> 50:07.780
Brad?

50:09.360 --> 50:13.440
Tired of shaggy songs not being pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

50:13.440 --> 50:14.640
Try a teen CEO.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.400
He loves that shorty one.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.400
I wish I had more modern references to dip into.

50:20.400 --> 50:24.000
Shaggy is the most modern you can go.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.280
Shaggy is about as modern as I can go in terms of music.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.680
If you want to hear more limp biscuit.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.240
Is there one called Disco Panic?

50:34.240 --> 50:37.200
Is that is that an outfit that the kids are listening to?

50:37.200 --> 50:40.880
Yeah, that is that is a pop punk outfit.

50:40.880 --> 50:41.380
All right.

50:42.240 --> 50:46.720
So you want you want to hear more Disco Panic pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

50:46.720 --> 50:50.960
If you want to hear more brown eyed peas, hire a teen CEO.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.280
Maybe they'll get Fergie to come do some motivational work.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.120
That would be inspiring, I think.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.080
Will.i.am come and help everybody get their group back?

51:00.080 --> 51:01.120
How about this?

51:01.120 --> 51:01.620
OK.

51:03.840 --> 51:04.800
Teen CEO.

51:05.520 --> 51:09.440
Profits are down 15%, but angst is up by 20%.

51:09.440 --> 51:14.240
I cut expenses just to feel.

51:14.240 --> 51:20.480
Oh, shit, try again.

51:20.480 --> 51:22.080
Try to save the last minute.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.600
Make this bit worth it.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.720
Do you have any killer Yahoos?

51:25.520 --> 51:26.480
I've got one.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.800
Yeah, how about this?

51:30.800 --> 51:32.320
This one was sent in by Toastrack.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.080
Thanks, Toastrack.

51:36.080 --> 51:43.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Angela, who asks, is it dangerous to shoot a pregnant kangaroo

51:43.520 --> 51:44.560
with a tranquilizer?

51:46.800 --> 51:47.760
Dangerous for the mom.

51:47.760 --> 51:48.260
Urgent.

51:48.880 --> 51:52.160
Dangerous for the mama kangaroo and Joey Fetus, I mean.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.640
I'm moving to Australia.

51:55.840 --> 51:59.920
If you guys get out to the Catskills this year, make sure to check out Joey Fetus.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.720
He is not.

52:00.720 --> 52:04.640
He has got a Frank Sinatra tribute show that will knock you on your ass.

52:04.640 --> 52:10.000
Joey Fetus and his mama kangaroos are playing all good this year, and I can't wait for those

52:10.000 --> 52:10.800
jam sashes.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.880
They late on 30-minute jam sashes at a time.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.960
I'm moving to Australia, and I'm domesticating a kangaroo.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.560
I don't care what the authorities say.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.400
They're so cute.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.560
They look like giant puppy rodents.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.080
I'm going to hug one so bad.

52:27.120 --> 52:27.920
Holy shit.

52:28.560 --> 52:32.560
Well, maybe I won't do that, but at least I want to hug a kangaroo before I die.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.320
Do you think kangaroos are cute?

52:34.320 --> 52:36.960
You will hug a kangaroo right before you die.

52:37.680 --> 52:39.120
Seconds before you die.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.440
Have you ever seen a kangaroo's talons?

52:41.440 --> 52:43.200
They will kick a hole right through you.

52:45.360 --> 52:52.640
I love this because it's like, I fucking love kangaroos so much.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.200
They're like human-sized puppies that you can hug.

52:55.200 --> 53:00.800
I love them so much that I want to shoot one with a tranquilizer gun, destroying the Joey

53:00.800 --> 53:02.080
Fetus inside of it.

53:02.080 --> 53:07.040
That's how much my love is so boundless that I just want to destroy it.

53:08.080 --> 53:11.440
I love the phrase, you know, I don't care what the authorities say.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.640
It's like, well, you should.

53:13.840 --> 53:20.240
In general, rules like don't hug a kangaroo aren't like the man keeping you down.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.760
Are they hoping that the tranquilizer dart will kill the Joey Fetus?

53:23.760 --> 53:24.880
I think they're worried.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.400
Is that what you're telling me?

53:26.400 --> 53:32.160
They have a list, a scrolled out list, and it's called Operation Hug a Kangaroo, and

53:32.160 --> 53:40.560
the list is incapacitate the kangaroo using an incapacitation gun and then hug its lifeless

53:40.560 --> 53:44.000
body, hug its sleeping corpse.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.320
So first of all, that's not going to be very satisfying.

53:46.880 --> 53:52.000
Second of all, you don't fucking care if you kill a baby kangaroo while you do it.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.640
Like, I'll kill a kangaroo if it means I get to hug another one.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.320
That's the trade off you're willing to make.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.880
To hug a kangaroo, you got to bring a few kangaroos.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.760
Yeah, you can't make a kangaroo omelet.

54:06.800 --> 54:07.840
That's what I always say.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.200
I want to get that cross stitch.

54:09.200 --> 54:12.560
Can't hug a kangaroo without killing a few infant kangaroos.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.360
You know what I like, though?

54:14.240 --> 54:15.440
Hug safaris.

54:15.440 --> 54:16.000
Why not?

54:16.560 --> 54:17.440
Why not?

54:17.440 --> 54:18.240
Get in my Jeep.

54:18.240 --> 54:23.280
We're going to go shoot some lions, and then you can hug them while they're down.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.080
You see that giraffe?

54:24.080 --> 54:24.640
Do whatever.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.880
We'll take pictures of you riding them and get a picture of it draped around your shoulders.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.360
You see that giraffe?

54:29.360 --> 54:29.920
Whatever.

54:29.920 --> 54:30.320
Fuck it.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.240
God's creatures are your playthings.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.520
You see that giraffe?

54:33.520 --> 54:38.880
When he's awake and bucking, he's not good for hugs, but when he's incapacitated, when

54:38.880 --> 54:42.160
he's asleep, when he's laying on the ground, that neck is made for hugging.

54:42.720 --> 54:43.360
It's perfect.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.000
You can get like 12 huggers on that at one time.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.440
Stand that neck back up and give it some hugs, you silly goof.

54:49.440 --> 54:55.840
The cruelest joke God ever played was hanging the most huggable necks so high up that we

54:55.840 --> 54:56.480
can't reach them.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.960
You see that giraffe, and you just want to get all up on him.

55:00.960 --> 55:01.760
You could hug him.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.560
You could slide down, give him a slidey hug.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.200
Slidey hug.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.400
I'm just going to throw this out there.

55:07.280 --> 55:11.440
Okay, science, explain to me why evolution hasn't given us really long hugging arms to

55:11.440 --> 55:12.240
hug the giraffe.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.640
Yeah, science.

55:14.640 --> 55:16.160
Science if you're so smart.

55:16.160 --> 55:22.240
But wait, on the flip side, God, why didn't you give me arms long enough to hug a giraffe?

55:22.880 --> 55:23.840
This how you do me?

55:27.680 --> 55:32.480
I gotta make a tiny apple tree in my yard and just hope that one day a giraffe comes

55:32.480 --> 55:33.600
and bends his neck down.

55:35.440 --> 55:39.280
Now I'm left drugging kangaroos and looking at giraffes and dreaming.

55:39.280 --> 55:39.520
Yeah.

55:40.160 --> 55:42.480
God made you drug that kangaroo.

55:42.480 --> 55:43.760
God made you do it.

55:43.760 --> 55:47.600
God made kangaroos slower or weaker, then you could have just hugged him and not even

55:47.600 --> 55:48.160
sweated.

55:48.160 --> 55:52.720
God, why didn't you give me a chest able to withstand a kangaroo kick so that I could

55:52.720 --> 55:53.200
hug him?

55:54.080 --> 55:57.520
God, I'm dead and I'm in heaven because I got kicked in the chest by a kangaroo.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.560
All I wanted was a hug.

55:58.560 --> 55:59.520
This how you do me?

56:00.560 --> 56:01.280
Thanks, God.

56:01.280 --> 56:01.840
You couldn't give me-

56:01.840 --> 56:04.400
On the flip side, my bucket list did get finished.

56:04.400 --> 56:07.360
At the skin of my teeth.

56:09.520 --> 56:11.760
Speaking of which, I have some kangaroo skin in my teeth.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.200
That is unpleasant.

56:13.200 --> 56:13.760
Take this out.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.600
I do not enjoy that.

56:15.600 --> 56:18.960
This is Then My Brother, My Brother Meets An Advice Show For The Modern Era.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.480
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

56:21.280 --> 56:23.920
But first, real quick housekeeping.

56:23.920 --> 56:25.680
Nothing major going on right now.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.320
nbnbam.com is our website.

56:28.320 --> 56:30.240
You can go there to find old shows.

56:31.040 --> 56:35.520
We need to get a link out there for if you don't have iTunes and you want to listen to

56:35.520 --> 56:39.760
some old shows, we'll put that up on our tweet-o this week.

56:39.760 --> 56:40.480
We tweeted it before.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.200
We'll tweet it again.

56:41.200 --> 56:42.320
We'll tweet it again.

56:42.320 --> 56:49.360
If you get a second to email us, you got a question, a query, nbnbam at maximumfun.org.

56:50.560 --> 56:53.600
You can also send any Yahoo answers you find right there.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.120
Also, we haven't pimp this in a while.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.920
If you want to do one of the promotional spots, if you want to get taken to the Money Town,

56:58.480 --> 57:01.360
shoot an email to Teresa at maximumfun.org.

57:01.360 --> 57:05.040
That's T-H-E-R-E-S-A at maximumfun.org there.

57:05.040 --> 57:09.600
$100 for a personal message, $200 for a commercial message, and we'll fucking,

57:09.600 --> 57:10.480
we'll do you up right.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.120
We'll give you a jingle and we'll talk some shit about your shit.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.400
And we will literally endorse anything.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.760
We will endorse anything.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.560
And this is official.

57:18.560 --> 57:24.400
I'm looking, I'm going to try to find a Millwall FC t-shirt that I can wear in public.

57:25.520 --> 57:26.720
So this is real for me.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.360
This is real.

57:29.920 --> 57:32.160
That's about all we've got going on.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.040
Send your questions.

57:34.080 --> 57:40.000
If you get a second to tell a buddy about the show, say hi to this thing

57:40.000 --> 57:45.440
that you would like, go to this website and check it out or, you know,

57:45.440 --> 57:48.880
burn them a CD or something or put a bunch of them on a thumb drive.

57:48.880 --> 57:49.600
Those are cheap now.

57:49.600 --> 57:53.840
You know, something to get them into the world so you can share it with them

57:53.840 --> 57:55.680
and talk about the show with them.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.600
That would be, that would be awesome.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.360
How about some shout outs?

58:00.400 --> 58:04.480
How about my boy Stephen Strom out there on the Twitter box making that happen?

58:05.040 --> 58:09.200
Ed Fail, a new convert, I think, who's out there talking us up.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.640
Oh yeah, he's been all about it.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.600
Let's give it up for Kyle Hillard.

58:16.720 --> 58:17.840
He's in the mix.

58:17.840 --> 58:22.640
And I want to throw out, I'm glad that Edizzle on Twizzler also agreed with me

58:23.280 --> 58:26.640
that Tristan is a hero and Tristan killed us.

58:26.640 --> 58:29.600
Tristan fucking got it done.

58:30.880 --> 58:34.560
And also, I just want to say thanks to everybody who's posted pictures on Twitter

58:34.560 --> 58:36.640
of their MBMBAM tote bags.

58:36.640 --> 58:37.120
Yeah.

58:37.120 --> 58:37.840
I'm loving it.

58:37.840 --> 58:41.200
Not only are they out there in the world repping stuff.

58:41.200 --> 58:44.400
Haven't seen any pictures of a dog and cat in the tote bag,

58:44.400 --> 58:46.640
which I have to say I'm a little disappointed about.

58:46.640 --> 58:47.280
Yeah.

58:47.280 --> 58:47.680
Now I'm going to-

58:47.680 --> 58:51.440
Which would you rather have, a dog and cat in a tote bag,

58:51.440 --> 58:54.640
a tote bag full of guinea pigs or a Joey fetus in a tote bag?

58:54.640 --> 58:55.520
That's what I'm saying.

58:55.520 --> 58:56.400
Not a Joey fetus.

58:56.400 --> 59:00.000
I want to see, I want a tote with a full grown Joey in it.

59:00.000 --> 59:00.400
Yeah.

59:00.400 --> 59:04.400
Now is that the entire series of Joey on DVD?

59:04.400 --> 59:05.600
You want to get creative?

59:05.600 --> 59:08.400
It's up to you.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.680
If you have a friend named Joey-

59:09.680 --> 59:11.600
If you have a friend named Joey, put that bag on his head.

59:11.600 --> 59:12.560
Who's in there?

59:12.560 --> 59:13.040
Who's in there?

59:13.040 --> 59:13.040
Joey.

59:13.040 --> 59:16.480
He has to wear a name tag or something so I can know, I can finish, you know?

59:17.200 --> 59:22.320
So, oh, if you want to tweet about the show, make sure you use that MBMBAM hashtag

59:23.440 --> 59:25.680
and spread the word.

59:25.680 --> 59:28.720
So anyway, Griffin, I'm ready.

59:28.720 --> 59:30.960
This is so appropriate to our last question.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.600
It was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

59:33.600 --> 59:34.320
Thank you, Johnny B.

59:34.320 --> 59:38.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mary Martin, who asks,

59:40.160 --> 59:45.200
if God is all good, why did he let me diarrhea in my pants on the Ferris wheel at the fair?

59:48.880 --> 59:50.000
This is how you do me.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.200
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:54.080 --> 59:55.200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:55.200 --> 59:56.720
You've been my brother, my brother.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.680
Make sure you kiss your dad.

59:57.680 --> 59:58.640
Because we're on the lips.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.400
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.360
Keep your heart.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.520
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.560
Keep your heart.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.840
Man, these girls are smart.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.680
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:28.880
Three Stacks, play your part, play your part.
