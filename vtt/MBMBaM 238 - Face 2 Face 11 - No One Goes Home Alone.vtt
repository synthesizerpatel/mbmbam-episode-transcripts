WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
But anyway, I want you guys to put your hands together, together, there's beer here, put

00:07.200 --> 00:16.200
your hands together like in a clapping motion, and welcome my brother, my brother and me!

00:16.200 --> 00:21.720
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:21.720 --> 00:27.040
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:27.040 --> 00:32.480
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:32.480 --> 00:58.880
cool they are for listening.

00:58.880 --> 01:28.760
The last words Justin said to me right before we walked out here was, I'm fully turnt.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, the advice show for the

01:31.280 --> 01:35.760
modern era.

01:35.760 --> 01:40.560
We want that every sentence, every sentence we say tonight, we expect that result.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.840
I was fucked, that was a goof.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.800
That'll be great because we only have 30 minutes of material prepared, so.

01:47.800 --> 01:53.960
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:53.960 --> 01:57.120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

01:57.120 --> 02:02.320
Oh no, this will be the loudest one, and we'll feel bad about it.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.880
And I'm the baby-est one, Griffin McElroy.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.360
I'm 11 for 11.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.840
I haven't been keeping score, but 11 for 11, loudest cheers.

02:13.840 --> 02:18.880
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, which is my brother, my brother and me, live,

02:18.880 --> 02:21.040
face-to-face, 11.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
Did we come up with that?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.600
No, I said no one goes home alone.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.640
No one goes home alone!

02:26.640 --> 02:29.640
What if they, like, want to?

02:29.640 --> 02:31.480
Too bad!

02:31.480 --> 02:35.440
We have, like, Chilean miners, we have emerged from our...

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
No!

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
No?

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
That is cheap!

02:38.440 --> 02:39.440
Only the hits tonight.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.080
We know you guys put up with a lot of traffic, we're only doing the hits.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.200
Welcome to our spookiest live show.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.200
We'll say, we'll say anything that'll get a response.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.240
There might be ghosts around.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.480
There we go.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.480
Bramblepelt.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.760
I'm literally, I'm shameless.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.320
Thank you, half bottle of Hennessy, half of this is Diet Coke, so...

03:03.320 --> 03:05.040
You pick which half.

03:05.040 --> 03:08.800
I didn't like that LA show, Justin was drunk the whole time.

03:08.800 --> 03:15.840
If you're not, if you're not here right now, which is, like, a lot of the earth.

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
Most of the earth.

03:16.840 --> 03:17.840
What percentage?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.800
We are, we're in a cemetery, well, we're not like...

03:20.800 --> 03:22.440
We're in the middle of a cemetery.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.600
Yeah, it's very chilly.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
No, we're in a cemetery.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.520
We're like Lydia from Beetlejuice, just hanging out.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.520
Did anybody, like, walk around and, like, check out the graves?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.520
These weirdos.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.520
There's just two of them.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.520
There's some pretty good graves.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.520
You see any cool ones?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.520
Shh, quiet!

03:36.520 --> 03:37.520
What?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.720
Did you go to the Mel...

03:39.720 --> 03:40.720
The Mel Blanc one?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
Yes.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
That's the best one.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.720
Yeah.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
Was it cool?

03:44.720 --> 03:45.720
Does everybody in the audience know Mel Blanc's avatar?

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
That's all folks.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
It's so good.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
So choice.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.240
Such a cool dude.

03:50.240 --> 03:56.240
If mine says kiss your dad square on the lips, I'm going to be very, very put out.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.960
So I live here now.

03:57.960 --> 04:03.120
I am a resident of a...

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
In the cemetery.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.720
Travis has been dead for 25 years.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.520
Have you seen Ghost Rider?

04:08.520 --> 04:13.800
I'm like the creepy old guy who once was a ghost rider, but now lives here.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.160
And you guys are visiting.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
How are you enjoying your visit?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.160
Oh, fucking great, dog.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.160
Super good.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.160
Travis has an air mattress.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.960
Oh yeah, there was a vine.

04:25.960 --> 04:32.440
Here's the thing about this air mattress is every 90 minutes you have to re-inflate it

04:32.440 --> 04:33.440
by hand with a pump.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.920
I did not know that when I pitched it to Griffin.

04:36.920 --> 04:42.000
Which almost makes it like a coin-operated bed.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.960
Like the magic fingers at a motel.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.560
So instead of vibrating, it just turns into more floor, essentially.

04:49.560 --> 04:55.000
Now that's unpleasant for Griffin waking up and realizing he's on the floor.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
But I was...

04:56.000 --> 04:58.320
Because I wasn't previously.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.680
I was sleeping directly next to him.

05:00.680 --> 05:09.520
So my sleep was interrupted every 90 minutes by this.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.160
It's a hand pump, but apparently I just breathe very heavily whenever I...

05:14.160 --> 05:16.200
Griffin takes his pumping very seriously.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.320
That's my hand pump noise.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.320
I thought that was obvious.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.320
It's pretty good.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.800
I'm not a Foley artist.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.600
So that made sleeping interesting.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.560
Yeah, it did.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.560
Should we do the show?

05:27.560 --> 05:33.800
If you've never listened to our show before, we take your questions and we turn them alchemy-like

05:33.800 --> 05:35.780
into wisdom.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.640
We have some questions specifically from people here in the audience.

05:39.640 --> 05:45.480
Feel free to say woo or wooboy or wooboy.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.000
We will also...

05:47.000 --> 05:48.960
Any combination of woo and boy.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
Boo and nanny.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Boo, boo, nanny.

05:50.960 --> 05:56.100
Later in the show, we're gonna take questions from people who are brave enough to stand

05:56.100 --> 05:57.160
up here and ask questions.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.160
We just ask...

05:58.160 --> 05:59.160
Do not be a bummer.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.160
As always, don't be a bummer.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.680
We say this every time and we really, really mean it.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
Don't be a bummer.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.640
We'll sit you right back down.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.360
Yeah, it's an exciting show.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
Got a lot of buds in the audience.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.520
Got a lot of yahoos.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.520
It's gonna be so good.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.000
It should be pretty fun.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Let's...

06:16.000 --> 06:19.680
And oh, I should mention, we're sorry the Soulbones couldn't make it tonight.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.680
My baby still isn't sleeping great, so we couldn't make it.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.680
Sorry.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.720
Blame it on his stupid baby.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.720
That dumb baby ruining everything.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.580
But we're super excited about the special guest podcast.

06:29.580 --> 06:30.980
They are so big.

06:30.980 --> 06:31.980
We are opening for them.

06:31.980 --> 06:32.980
We're opening for them.

06:32.980 --> 06:37.040
So they're on after us, but we're really excited to be opening for them.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.640
It's their first live performance, so stay tuned for that.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.200
But first, questions.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.480
Here we go.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.480
This past Candle Nights, I got...

06:46.480 --> 06:47.640
First off, I should ask.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.520
Is anybody here not listened to our show before?

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
Any first timers?

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
Okay.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.520
Oh, it's gonna be really weird for all y'all.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
Oh, shit.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.520
Welcome.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.520
Oh, God, no.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.520
Bienvenidos.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
You're in for a treat.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.360
Say something not funny, but people laugh, lean over to the person you're with and ask

07:03.360 --> 07:04.360
why it was funny.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.360
Right.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.920
And they won't be able to explain it.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.360
Or if you want, we can explain it if you just yell, why was that funny at the stage as long

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
as you can.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
No!

07:13.360 --> 07:16.360
You'll sound a lot like Arnani listening to the show.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.360
I don't get it.

07:18.360 --> 07:24.960
Oh, we should have a pop-up video thing that has like, Arnani is our grandmother.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.640
This past Candle Nights, I got my girlfriend tickets.

07:26.640 --> 07:34.240
Candle Nights, you see, is a Christmas alternative.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.840
This past Candle Nights, I got my girlfriend tickets to an upcoming Meghan Trainor concert.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.760
Meghan Trainor is the singer we didn't get birth to Meghan Trainor.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.840
Not like for life, just for our, okay.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.440
Upon receiving the gift, I got her tickets to a Meghan Trainor concert.

07:52.440 --> 07:56.800
Upon receiving the gift, she was excited and informed me that she coincidentally has the

07:56.800 --> 08:02.160
same dress Meghan, apparently they're on a first name basis, Meghan wears in her music

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
video.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.800
My girlfriend is considering wearing the dress to the concert.

08:05.800 --> 08:12.680
Is this acceptable or is it just as lame as wearing a band t-shirt at their show?

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
That's from Brian.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.680
Brian, are you here?

08:14.680 --> 08:15.680
Woo!

08:15.680 --> 08:16.680
Yeah.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.680
A woo in the darkness.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.680
That was acceptable.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.680
That was an acceptable response.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
Woo, woo boy.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.680
Or just boy.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.680
Or boy.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
Or oh boy.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.680
Oh boy.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.120
If you've been quantum leaped back to the show.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.120
Quantum leapt?

08:30.120 --> 08:32.080
Yeah, you had it the first time.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.880
Quantum leapt.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
Lept quantumly.

08:34.880 --> 08:40.280
I mentioned in the, Travis told us about this question and I mentioned in the car ride here

08:40.280 --> 08:44.520
that we had done a question about whether or not it was acceptable to wear a band's t-shirt

08:44.520 --> 08:50.120
to that band's concert and they both said, I don't remember doing that at all and I don't

08:50.120 --> 08:51.120
think it was that long ago.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.960
In 138 episodes in, I can't remember every stance I took.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.240
Yeah.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.600
I'm actually pro wearing a band's t-shirt.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.980
In the episode, I may have been anti, but that's just a character I play on the podcast.

09:04.980 --> 09:14.120
We didn't cover, we didn't even touch the concept of cosplaying as good Charlotte.

09:14.120 --> 09:19.800
No, I'm the anti, I'm bad Charlotte.

09:19.800 --> 09:30.120
It's a fun spin on the cat, I'm steampunk good Charlotte, it's a fun spin.

09:30.120 --> 09:34.960
I think she should do it because how many more chances is she going to get for a Meghan

09:34.960 --> 09:38.360
Trainor concert?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.360
Listen to you.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.360
Listen to you.

09:40.360 --> 09:44.960
Before it becomes a Meghan Trainor concert to the all about that bass girl concert.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.720
How many completely confusing chart topping hits have you pinned in your lifetime?

09:49.720 --> 09:50.720
Three.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.720
Oh, okay.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
You're beating her by one though.

09:52.720 --> 09:53.720
I just called to say I love you.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.720
That was Travis.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.720
Mbop.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
Mbop was Travis.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.720
Yeah.

09:57.720 --> 10:02.040
And I just called to say Mbop.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.800
I wish you'd stop calling me.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.040
It's 1996 and this is fucking expensive.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.040
I bet.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.680
I just called collect to say Mbop.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.680
What if she-

10:13.680 --> 10:14.680
Hey, don't accept the charges.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.560
Just Mbop, later.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.840
What if she's mid song and she just looks down in the audience like, nice.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.520
Or worse, she looks down and goes, wait, hold on, stop, stop, stop.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.720
What the fuck?

10:28.720 --> 10:31.720
Everybody else out in the lobby until we figure this shit out.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.080
One of us has to change.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.440
One of us is changing and I have other costumes and it's not going to be me.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.440
So figure it out.

10:38.440 --> 10:44.200
We have t-shirts in the lobby that are $45.

10:44.200 --> 10:49.440
Did she coincidentally have the same dress or did she buy it because she's a fan?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.880
Was it a Meghan Trainor fashion decision?

10:51.880 --> 10:54.020
We're sort of asking that to the ephemera.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.160
We're not looking for an actual-

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
Yeah, it's a rhetorical-

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
Into the hive mind.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
Right.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
What do you all think?

10:59.160 --> 11:02.280
Let's take an audience poll.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.840
I'm in favor of it.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.560
I think you could pawn it off as a coincidence.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.000
You know, I don't watch music videos.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
That's what you say.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I didn't see-

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Oh, did I?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Uh-uh.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Is it?

11:13.000 --> 11:17.400
I was wearing a cat face on my chest and a cat face on my vagina and it was just random.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.400
Is that?

11:18.400 --> 11:19.800
I have not seen the video.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.680
Is that it?

11:21.680 --> 11:22.680
That's the follow-up.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.680
That's the second.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.680
That's all about the base team.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.200
Are you like shooting without a script here?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.200
I don't know that this is-

11:27.200 --> 11:29.160
Are you guys not big train heads?

11:29.160 --> 11:31.480
No, I am sorry.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.520
I am a train head, a fan of the band Train.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.720
So don't try and take that away from us.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.600
There's like 60 of us.

11:39.600 --> 11:45.920
If you want me to replicate the casual yet stylish chinos from drops of Jupiter, I can

11:45.920 --> 11:46.920
do that for you.

11:46.920 --> 11:53.360
You're dressed just like the lead singer of Train and no one noticed.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.840
There's a lot of people dressed like the lead singer of Train in LA I've noticed.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.160
Keep an eye peeled.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.280
You'll spot a lot of them.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
I have a Yahoo.

12:01.280 --> 12:07.320
Oh, if you've never listened to our show, we occasionally take questions from the Yahoo

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
answer service.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
Occasionally.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.320
From time to time.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.320
From time to time.

12:11.320 --> 12:17.760
Basically, it's whenever the show stops being funny, we'll, you laughed a little too hard.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
You can keep it.

12:18.760 --> 12:19.760
You can just relax.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.120
We'll take a question from the Yahoo answer service.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.120
Griffin, what question do you have for us?

12:24.120 --> 12:27.120
This one was actually sent in by Drew Davern for you, Drew.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.120
Stand up.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.120
Stand up.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.120
Is he here?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.120
Stand up.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.120
You mountain of a man.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
I see your beautiful face.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
There he is.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.120
The legend of a man.

12:35.120 --> 12:43.760
Wait, wait, I didn't, I didn't get a picture.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.920
Everybody pretend like it's his first time standing up.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Stand up again for a pose.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
Don't move.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.200
Oh, God, that's a great picture.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.200
That's good.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.200
That's good.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.200
He looks like a beautiful ghost.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.200
You go outside.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.200
You go outside.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.480
You pick any tombstone, it's yours.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.480
You can take it home.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.480
You don't have the Mel Blanc one.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.480
Fuck it.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.480
As a profile pic for ages, my friend.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.480
This is a weird giveaway.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.480
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.480
Drew Davenport is a guy that sends in questions a lot.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
All the time.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.840
Drew, tell me if you remember this one, buddy.

13:16.840 --> 13:23.360
It was asked by Yahoo answers user Jabbar who asks, how can I subtly start an apple orchard

13:23.360 --> 13:29.120
in my neighbor's backyard?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.720
I feel like the subtleness ends after step one.

13:32.720 --> 13:41.600
I have a feeling that the soil he has over there would be great for my orchard plants.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
Look at that soil.

13:42.600 --> 13:51.640
And since my wife already used up our acre for this BS perfect picnic courtyard, I can't

13:51.640 --> 13:52.640
do it.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.360
I can't do it on my lands.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.760
Damn it, darling.

13:55.760 --> 13:56.920
My apples.

13:56.920 --> 14:01.400
We never even picnic.

14:01.400 --> 14:09.800
I can't tell me neighbor about this plan though because we've had multiple disagreements lately

14:09.800 --> 14:14.940
and he'd never allow it.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.400
Your picnic courtyard is too fucking perfect over there.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.920
You're making the rest of us look bad.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
How's your soil?

14:20.920 --> 14:25.880
He'd never, he'd never allow it even though all that he grows over there is grass.

14:25.880 --> 14:30.000
It's a complete waste and he could do more if he cared about the beauty of our neighborhood

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
and money.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.440
It's in his backyard.

14:35.440 --> 14:40.480
The problem with this is there has to be a moment during the blossoming where you have

14:40.480 --> 14:44.480
to have a conversation with him like, those are looking, what are you growing over there?

14:44.480 --> 14:45.480
Those look nice.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.480
Also, those are mine.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
Also dimps.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.800
Hey, those look awesome.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.640
Don't fucking touch them though.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.120
Tell you what, I'll take care of those for you.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.120
No charge.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.720
I'll just get all the apples.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.200
All right, 10% of the apples are yours.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
You drive a hard bargain.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.440
Do you think that was Johnny Appleseed's game when he was like roaming the lands?

15:05.440 --> 15:08.120
Just like, where did this fucking apple tree come from?

15:08.120 --> 15:11.720
You planted an apple tree underneath my child's play place?

15:11.720 --> 15:17.160
Yeah, you destroyed my house's foundation because you planted an apple tree right next

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
to it.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.520
Like, yeah, I know, but free apples.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
I'll take care of it though.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.000
But flip side, apples are pretty good, right?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
You like apples.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.280
An apple tree, taking care of an apple tree is a fucking commitment.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.040
Johnny Appleseed planted his shit all across the country.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.840
You know he wasn't watering those trees as they went.

15:34.840 --> 15:39.440
He was saying, this is, hey, stranger in Vermont who I just planted an apple tree in their

15:39.440 --> 15:40.440
front yard.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.440
This is your problem now.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.600
So basically, Johnny Appleseed is a metaphor for a deadbeat dad.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
That's- Listen.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.760
He walks across the country, spreading his seed, and then just moves to the next town.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.760
I'm sorry.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.160
It's right there.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.720
I like a joke as much as the next guy.

15:58.720 --> 16:03.600
But Johnny Appleseed regularly returned to the orchards he had planted to make sure they

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
were thriving.

16:04.600 --> 16:09.320
In his car?

16:09.320 --> 16:13.640
In his magic apple car, like in the fucking Richard scary verse?

16:13.640 --> 16:20.120
Is that what you're suggesting?

16:20.120 --> 16:24.800
Does it exist?

16:24.800 --> 16:29.000
Do you think they had to get new cars like every day or like, they'd spray it with like

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
lemon juice.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.360
Yeah, they'd spray a little bit of lemon juice on the inside, but in like a day, the interior

16:34.360 --> 16:37.840
is just all- What do I have to do to put you into a crab

16:37.840 --> 16:39.880
apple today?

16:39.880 --> 16:41.360
That's a dumb line of jokes.

16:41.360 --> 16:42.360
Justin, save us.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.920
I got another question here.

16:43.920 --> 16:49.440
A photographer friend of mine has developed an uncanny ability to consistently take the

16:49.440 --> 16:52.720
worst pictures of me ever taken.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.960
Somebody's laughing a little too hard.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.440
We're going to get you in a second.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.840
Hey, they're pretty funny, but at this point, there are a lot of them.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.960
And some of them are really, really bad.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.780
I am definitely part of the problem.

17:03.780 --> 17:08.120
When she points the camera at me, I always seem to make a face, but she's got an amazing

17:08.120 --> 17:13.040
ability to catch me with my mouth full, mid sentence, while apparently farting and sneezing

17:13.040 --> 17:15.320
at the same time.

17:15.320 --> 17:20.520
How do I train myself to pull a blue steel when my friend and her camera are near?

17:20.520 --> 17:23.520
Or should I buy a large sack and dive into it?

17:23.520 --> 17:29.280
Any tactics or advice will be appreciated, and that's from problematic photos in Portland.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.280
Are you here?

17:30.280 --> 17:31.280
Okay, everyone look away.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
Okay.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
Pull the face.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.280
Did you drive from Portland?

17:34.280 --> 17:35.280
No, look away, I said front row.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
Okay, pull the face.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.280
Yeah.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.280
Okay.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.280
Solid.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.280
Yeah, that's- Whoa.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.280
Solid.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.280
That's rough.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.280
Don't want that on film.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
That's rough.

17:45.280 --> 17:48.440
Thanks, Candidly.

17:48.440 --> 17:52.680
I used to take a lot of pleasure in being Stink Face Steve.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
Your name's not Steve, is it?

17:53.680 --> 17:56.680
Because that would be really rude and coincidental.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
I used to really enjoy that.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.920
I used to take a lot of pleasure in looking ugly like you.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.400
No, it's not.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.040
It has nothing to do with attractiveness.

18:04.040 --> 18:09.200
I would like to think I have very high self-esteem.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.600
But then all my friends started getting married, and that's not good, because everyone looks

18:13.600 --> 18:19.400
so good, but you're up there during the ceremony farting and sneezing at the same time, and

18:19.400 --> 18:24.360
I have a pizza roll in my mouth during the ceremony?

18:24.360 --> 18:28.440
If you all look in your hearts, I think everyone can admit that they have a face that they

18:28.440 --> 18:34.140
pull when a camera's pointed at them and they know that... I mean, we're all adults, right?

18:34.140 --> 18:38.640
You have that face where you're like, and you know that that's going to be your face

18:38.640 --> 18:39.640
every time.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.160
You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, camera.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.160
My face-

18:42.160 --> 18:43.160
Every time, right?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.160
It's not intentional.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.720
My face is the face I get when I get a Christmas gift.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.960
I don't like, but I don't want to hurt the person's feelings.

18:50.960 --> 18:59.360
It's kind of like... Look at any fucking picture of me, I swear to God.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.120
You'll look for wrapping paper.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
Where is it?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.400
I know he's getting a Christmas gift he doesn't like.

19:03.400 --> 19:08.640
That's only one step away from a fire just exploded in front of your face.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
It's hard, right?

19:09.640 --> 19:13.440
I feel you, because you- Oh, if you're listening to the podcast-

19:13.440 --> 19:17.760
It made a- These faces are solid.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.400
You work so hard, right?

19:19.400 --> 19:27.000
You work hard to keep it right and tight and just looking super good, and then somebody

19:27.000 --> 19:31.640
turns the camera on you, and you just drop the ball.

19:31.640 --> 19:36.520
That's why you need final cut in all of your pictures.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.520
For other people?

19:37.520 --> 19:38.520
No.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.720
You just take everybody's computers and take the JPEGs yourself.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.720
I wish I could help you.

19:42.720 --> 19:43.720
I don't.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.720
I suffer from this pretty chronically.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.820
I haven't had a good picture taken of me since high school, probably.

19:48.820 --> 19:54.680
What if you became the back of your head guy, where every time you saw a camera, you just

19:54.680 --> 19:57.560
went- That's grim.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.840
And they were like, I don't think Steve exists.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.920
I hear all these legends.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.480
And then they'll be happy to start seeing your face in some pictures, like, oh, there

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
he is.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.880
Yo, Yahoo.

20:08.880 --> 20:09.880
This one.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.280
Did you really bring three beers?

20:11.280 --> 20:14.560
No, these are backup beers.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.000
In case of emergency, these beers are here.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.240
If it's- If you- Okay.

20:19.240 --> 20:23.680
So is it if it stops being funny, you're like, I'm out.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.160
I'm under the table with my beer friends.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.520
We record this show sober every single time.

20:30.520 --> 20:35.040
And for some reason- Someone just went, yeah.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.640
Every- You would be shocked.

20:37.640 --> 20:41.080
Dozens of people ask us, you guys do that show high.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.600
No, we don't.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.920
But when we do it in front of people- Because we're older than 22.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.920
So we don't know where- Right.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.160
We can't find weed.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.440
We're in California.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.440
We don't know where it exists.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
How about a Yahoo?

20:53.440 --> 20:59.440
Yahoo is my drug.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.120
This drug was sent in by Mark Brown.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.120
Thank you, Mark.

21:02.120 --> 21:07.280
It was sent in by Yahoo Answers user Rachel One, who asks, if you had the opportunity

21:07.280 --> 21:10.400
to adopt a talking cat, would you?

21:10.400 --> 21:14.880
Long hair or short hair?

21:14.880 --> 21:16.880
Like of course.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.880
The hair length?

21:17.880 --> 21:21.920
I get that long hair is how it's akin to- If I don't want it to shed all over my carpet,

21:21.920 --> 21:23.720
yeah, it's an issue.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.880
But you could talk to it and be like, can you do something about-

21:26.880 --> 21:27.880
Can you stop shedding?

21:27.880 --> 21:28.880
Okay.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.360
To be fair, it's a talking cat, not a listening cat.

21:32.360 --> 21:37.720
That's a good point.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.920
How would it have learned?

21:41.920 --> 21:48.480
Can I ask you though, wouldn't it be disconcerting to have a cat that could speak English but

21:48.480 --> 21:50.480
can't understand English?

21:50.480 --> 21:52.360
Like, I'm hungry.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.360
What are we going to eat today?

21:53.360 --> 21:55.520
Like, well, I got you a can of fancy food.

21:55.520 --> 21:59.960
I can't- How many times do I have to tell you?

21:59.960 --> 22:03.160
Or worse, a cat that could speak English, but didn't.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.440
Just wouldn't- I was like, hey, how's it going?

22:06.440 --> 22:07.440
Oh my God.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.440
You guys will never believe this.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.440
Watch.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.440
Cat.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.440
Say something.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.440
Yeah, he won't do it.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
You fucking dick.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.880
Let me hit you guys with this.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.880
Cat story.

22:16.880 --> 22:23.920
It's like Toy Story, but all cats instead of toys.

22:23.920 --> 22:24.920
Same cast.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.240
Same voice cast as Toy Story.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.920
I think you're the first person to ever like pitch animals can talk, but we just can't

22:32.920 --> 22:33.920
understand them.

22:33.920 --> 22:34.920
No, no, no.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.920
That's not the whole pitch.

22:35.920 --> 22:36.920
Tim Allen.

22:36.920 --> 22:37.920
Sold.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.920
Yeah.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.920
Tim Allen's attached.

22:39.920 --> 22:48.680
Those are the three magic Hollywood words.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.240
I'm having trouble selling my pitch.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.240
Tim Allen's attached.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.240
Nevermind.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.240
What was it?

22:53.240 --> 22:54.240
Cat Story 2?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.240
What was it?

22:55.240 --> 22:56.240
Cat Story 1?

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
That's dumb.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.240
But Tim Allen's on board.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.720
I just make the check out to cash.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.840
You think that Griffin's joking, but think about how many Tim Allen movies you're asking

23:05.840 --> 23:10.200
yourself, how the fuck did this get made?

23:10.200 --> 23:12.200
Someone said Tim Allen's attached.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.640
Tim Allen's attached and a time machine.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.920
Right.

23:16.920 --> 23:21.000
I like to imagine a rich fiction behind many Yahoo answers.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.880
And for this one, I imagined a person sitting on the couch and looking at their cat thinking

23:24.880 --> 23:30.000
God damn it, I wish you could talk or worse.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.080
They adopted a talking cat, but the cat also scratched up at everything and they're like,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.080
should I have done this?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.160
Hold on.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.680
Would you have done it?

23:38.680 --> 23:39.680
Was this a mistake?

23:39.680 --> 23:47.400
It's a talking cat, but also it's really racist and he can't hear, so it's like, you can't

23:47.400 --> 23:48.400
tell him to stop.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.680
He doesn't know any better.

23:50.680 --> 23:57.240
If I had to shit in a little dirty cave, I would probably be pretty racist too.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.800
The foreigners took all our toilets.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
What?

23:59.800 --> 24:00.800
What did you say?

24:00.800 --> 24:01.800
Excuse me?

24:01.800 --> 24:02.800
Whoa, Mr. Bobo.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.120
I can never find a toilet because all the foreigners are sitting on them.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.120
I was like, whoa.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
What?

24:07.120 --> 24:08.120
Be cool for two seconds.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.120
Just one second.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.120
Please.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.120
I can't understand what you're saying.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.120
I don't understand.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.240
I can't learn and grow from my mistakes.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.800
I don't understand English.

24:16.800 --> 24:21.160
Here's a question.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
My wife.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
My wife?

24:23.160 --> 24:24.160
No.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.160
My wife.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.040
Have you guys seen Borat?

24:27.040 --> 24:28.040
It's really great.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.040
I think you guys would like it.

24:29.040 --> 24:33.080
My wife, CeCe'd, recently pointed out that I'm a bit of a jerk.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.080
Her name is CeCe'd?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.080
You CeCe'd her on the email?

24:36.080 --> 24:37.080
Listen.

24:37.080 --> 24:38.080
Solid.

24:38.080 --> 24:43.360
I know you've wanted me to own up to my mistakes and I'm finally doing it in an email to a

24:43.360 --> 24:49.920
comedy podcast, Beverly.

24:49.920 --> 24:54.080
She says I treat her pretty well, but with others, sorry, I missed the emphasis.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
Let me try again.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.080
Hold on.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.080
Ahem.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.080
Oh, yeah.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
That'll help.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.220
It's Justin's magic talking potion.

25:02.220 --> 25:08.520
She says I treat her pretty well, but with others, I can come across as abrasive, arrogant,

25:08.520 --> 25:14.920
overly talkative, and a bunch of other things that basically add up to maximum jerkitude.

25:14.920 --> 25:19.460
My first response was to be upset and not believe it, but then I realized that's what

25:19.460 --> 25:21.760
a jerk would do.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.820
It's fair.

25:24.820 --> 25:28.600
Since this revelation, I've been trying to adjust my behavior, but now I feel like I'm

25:28.600 --> 25:34.620
stomping around angrily on eggshells and hyper-aware of my faults.

25:34.620 --> 25:38.160
How can I stop being a jerk without losing my mind in the process?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.720
That's from Jameson.

25:39.720 --> 25:44.040
Your first move is to ask this question in front of a room full of people.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.680
Jameson, get up here, buddy.

25:45.680 --> 25:46.680
Here, Jameson.

25:46.680 --> 25:47.680
Is Jameson here?

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
Jameson, you motherfucker.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.680
Yeah, get on up.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.680
Come on.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.680
Come on up here.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.680
Come on.

25:52.680 --> 25:53.680
Don't cheer for him.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.680
Don't egg on this behavior.

25:54.680 --> 25:55.680
Yeah, right.

25:55.680 --> 25:56.680
Don't boo him either.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.680
Just be neutral.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.680
Jameson, can I say you were a micro?

25:58.680 --> 25:59.680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.680
Easy, tiger.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.680
Where's your bodyguard?

26:01.680 --> 26:02.680
Okay, already fucking aggressive.

26:02.680 --> 26:11.720
Can I just say, Jameson, you look really pleasant.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.960
Oh, thank you.

26:13.960 --> 26:18.080
So can you give us a specific example of why you think?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.080
I tend to talk.

26:19.080 --> 26:20.080
Whoa, dude.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.080
Calm down.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.080
Pump the brakes.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
Coming at us.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.080
Yeesh, Don Rickles.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.080
You don't have to come out swinging.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.080
Yeesh.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.360
No, no, no, no, really.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.360
Go ahead, Jameson.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.360
All right.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.360
You seem very pleasant.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.360
Now we're different.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.360
I can be a bit of a know-it-all.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.360
I admit that.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.360
And yeah, lots of stuff.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.360
That's not good.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.360
So know-it-all, et cetera.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.360
Yeah, yeah.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.360
Can I just say, I totally, totally relate.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.360
Oh, that means a lot to me.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.360
I expected a bigger response, frankly.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.360
Fucking classic comedy podcast stoppers with your host, Travis McElroy.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.360
No, I...

26:47.360 --> 27:08.280
I had this realization where a friend of mine, Michael Bradbury, basically said like, hey,

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
I like you.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.280
Too much information.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.280
No, no.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.280
Let him out.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.280
Are you speaking hypotheticals?

27:13.280 --> 27:14.280
Yeah.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.280
Imagine there's a gentleman.

27:15.280 --> 27:24.120
Imagine, if you will, and his friend says, I like you, but everyone else thinks you're

27:24.120 --> 27:25.120
a dick.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.120
Sounds familiar.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
Hypothetically.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.120
Yeah.

27:28.120 --> 27:33.960
And when that happens, all you have to do, like a big move was like take stock, and it

27:33.960 --> 27:37.640
really is like when you respond to anything, think like, how would I feel if someone said

27:37.640 --> 27:38.640
this to me?

27:38.640 --> 27:39.640
Yeah.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.640
It's...

27:40.640 --> 27:43.560
Have you read How to Make Friends and Influence People?

27:43.560 --> 27:44.560
Have you read How to Train a Dragon?

27:44.560 --> 27:48.360
Have you read How to Train Your Dragon?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.240
How would you want your dragon to train you?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.560
Not a lot of people think about it.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.600
It's the golden dragon rule.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.520
Jameson, I want to ask you in a serious question.

27:58.520 --> 28:04.740
Is your inner Jameson, the Jameson that you hold to be in your heart, is he a dick or

28:04.740 --> 28:08.360
is the Jameson that you show to the world?

28:08.360 --> 28:12.280
Is that the personality you've crafted for yourself on your exterior?

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
Follow up question.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.600
All right, just let me get mine in.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
Fuck.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.440
I'm afraid that when he answers, I'm afraid that when he answers yours, it will negate

28:19.440 --> 28:20.440
mine.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.440
You can fucking wait and see.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.160
Jameson, hold on one second.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
Roll the dice.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
Okay.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.160
Sorry, Jameson, about my brother, the dick.

28:28.160 --> 28:33.600
My inner Jameson.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.600
He's a real Jameson.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.600
You'll have to excuse him.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.600
No.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.120
Or maybe you're a real Travis.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.120
I don't know.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.120
Let's compare stories out.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
We'll hang out later.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.120
We'll compare stories.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
Wait.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.120
I want to get a fucking answer.

28:48.120 --> 28:54.320
I would say that my inner Jameson is very sensitive, but I show a sort of thorny facade.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.320
There.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.560
I knew he was going to answer my question.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.680
Do you correct people a lot?

28:58.680 --> 29:00.160
Yeah, maybe.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.160
Yeah.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.160
Oh.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
Shit.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
Hey.

29:04.160 --> 29:10.760
Dude, you just got corrected on how often you correct people.

29:10.760 --> 29:14.000
Jameson, I think that that's part of the problem.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.080
That idea of like, I want to respond before the person says something.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.080
Like I want to be a dick before they do.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
The ma bim bam story.

29:21.080 --> 29:22.080
The ma bim bam story.

29:22.080 --> 29:27.640
When you write your autobiography, that will be the title.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.200
I'm afraid that someone else will be a dick to me like a brother would.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.980
And so I want to say something first.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.720
So I appear to be the dominant person.

29:34.720 --> 29:38.960
I think that it's a lack of trust in other people to accept you for who you are.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.280
So you don't accept them for who they are.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.840
So I think there's a certain amount of like, just speak honestly to people the way that

29:44.840 --> 29:47.400
they would, you wouldn't want them to speak to you.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.400
I think honestly might be the problem.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.400
Yeah.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.400
It's hard.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.400
Just don't correct people.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.400
Like take that as your first step.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.200
Cause it's easy not to correct somebody and it makes them feel like shit and nobody gets

29:56.200 --> 29:57.760
anything out of it.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.760
Yeah.

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
Just keep your damn mouth shut.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.360
No, I'm not saying.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.720
I never, no, I literally, I never correct anybody because you, you think about correcting

30:05.720 --> 30:06.720
people.

30:06.720 --> 30:07.720
It's a no win scenario.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.640
Either one, you're actually wrong.

30:10.640 --> 30:17.160
That's the fucking pit or, or two, like they feel bad and everybody else thinks you're

30:17.160 --> 30:18.160
kind of a jerk.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.640
So like, I used to do it all the time.

30:19.640 --> 30:20.640
Look for any opportunity.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
Loved it.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.480
Was overweight, needed a boost.

30:23.480 --> 30:33.080
But now I'm, now I'm still overweight, but I have a podcast.

30:33.080 --> 30:37.960
I have all of you.

30:37.960 --> 30:42.280
The fact of the matter, it's really easy to justify to yourself because I'm in great shape

30:42.280 --> 30:43.280
now.

30:43.280 --> 30:48.840
If you're listening at home, I just fell, I just took off my shirt and all the ladies

30:48.840 --> 30:55.880
and so inclined men in the audience were like, a little bit of a delayed reaction.

30:55.880 --> 30:56.880
We will take that.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.920
We will take that audio clip backwards 10 seconds.

30:59.920 --> 31:00.920
Hey everybody.

31:00.920 --> 31:01.920
Nice.

31:01.920 --> 31:08.480
It's really easy to justify yourself and say, if I correct them, I'm doing them a service

31:08.480 --> 31:10.880
because they had the wrong information.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.880
You're not.

31:11.880 --> 31:12.960
No, you're not.

31:12.960 --> 31:17.760
You're insulting them indirectly and you just keep that because no one ever says a fact

31:17.760 --> 31:20.800
saying, if I'm wrong, I hope someone says something.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.560
No one's ever done that ever.

31:22.560 --> 31:26.160
Jamison, I'm starting to feel exceedingly guilty for the fact that we've had you stand

31:26.160 --> 31:28.200
up on stage for 15 minutes.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.320
If you're listening, Jamison looks great.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.320
He looks really great.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
He's really great.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.320
Round of applause for Jamison.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
Jamison.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
He's a great guy.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
We love him.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.320
Thank you.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
That was very brave of you.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.320
All right.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.200
Who is Jamison's significant other?

31:41.200 --> 31:42.200
Are you here too?

31:42.200 --> 31:43.200
I'm so sorry.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.400
I know you're hanging in there, but- Hey, keep him on the straight and narrow.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
You're doing God's work.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.400
God's work.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
Seriously.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.400
He's going to turn it around.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.720
You wait for his fucking Scrooge moment.

31:53.720 --> 31:58.280
He's going to be visited by some ghosts, us, and he's going to, you watch, he's going to

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
turn it around.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.240
Griffin, you got a Yahoo?

32:01.240 --> 32:02.520
I just closed it.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.040
Griffin, what's on the Google page?

32:05.040 --> 32:06.040
What is today's Google doodle?

32:06.040 --> 32:07.040
I don't know.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.040
Some painting.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.960
We'll talk about it later.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.760
Sorry to interrupt you past us, but we wanted to break in here for a quick trip to the Money

32:15.760 --> 32:17.320
Zone.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.960
Have you ever thought about building an iPhone application?

32:20.960 --> 32:22.520
I don't possess the skills.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.200
I mean, everybody thought about it, right?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.400
It's just like- Everybody thinks that fart button.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
Yeah.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.920
You put these some zeros and ones together, and then it spells the words that form the

32:31.920 --> 32:33.680
programming of the swordfish.

32:33.680 --> 32:37.880
I had an idea for one, and I asked Siri to do it, and she said, go fuck yourself.

32:37.880 --> 32:38.880
Yeah, which is weird.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.880
Yeah.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.520
I want to ask- It was my friend Siri, not the Siri on the

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
phone.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.520
Oh, okay.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.520
Oh.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
Classic Siri.

32:46.520 --> 32:47.520
She sounds rude.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.520
She is rude.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
Yeah, a little rude.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
That's why we like her, though, because she's kind of a sass pot.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.520
You know what I mean?

32:52.520 --> 32:58.000
Your lack of technical skills is no longer going to hold you back thanks to your friends

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
at one month.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I'm going to tell you about one month iOS.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.120
It's an easy way to learn iOS development using Swift.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
What does that mean?

33:05.120 --> 33:06.120
I don't know.

33:06.120 --> 33:10.120
I didn't take the class, but I do know that iPhone is the only way to make money these

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
days.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.760
You have to build an app, and you can do that.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.920
The way one month works is you give one month 30 minutes a day for 30 days, and at the end

33:16.920 --> 33:22.440
of it, you will have a legitimate actual skillset, and not like reading or writing or math skillset

33:22.440 --> 33:26.560
that will actually serve you in your day-to-day life like application development.

33:26.560 --> 33:30.120
Justin, did you say that the iPhone is the only way to make money?

33:30.120 --> 33:31.120
Yes.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.920
Being on iPhone is the only way to make money.

33:33.920 --> 33:34.920
That's a fact.

33:34.920 --> 33:40.840
Sorry, Windows Lumia owners, you fucking broke.

33:40.840 --> 33:44.680
Get an iPhone and get some money, because people are spending money on their iPhones.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.680
They love it.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.240
Snapchat me some bucks.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.760
Snapchat us some bucks.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.760
We're going to save you a few bucks.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.040
I'm going to tell you how, you're going to go to onemonth.com slash my brother, and you

33:54.040 --> 33:57.040
can start building your first iPhone app today.

33:57.040 --> 34:00.780
Each class is broken down into 30-minute chunks, so it's really easily doable.

34:00.780 --> 34:04.400
You don't have to sit down and do it for an eight-hour block or something interminable

34:04.400 --> 34:05.400
like that.

34:05.400 --> 34:09.320
30 minutes a day for one month, and you're going to become an expert at it.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.720
Now, they have other classes, too.

34:10.720 --> 34:13.860
They have one-month growth hacking, so you can get huge.

34:13.860 --> 34:14.860
Shred your delt with one month.

34:14.860 --> 34:15.860
I don't think that's-

34:15.860 --> 34:17.320
Your business delts.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.320
One-month HTML that will teach you-

34:18.320 --> 34:21.240
Your business delts and your accounting abs.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.520
Teach you how to make a website.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.820
One-month rails to help you build your web apps.

34:25.820 --> 34:31.480
If you go to onemonth.com slash my brother, you can get a 25% off discount for one of

34:31.480 --> 34:36.640
these classes, so that's a great deal if you go to onemonth.com slash my brother and get

34:36.640 --> 34:37.840
yourself a skill set.

34:37.840 --> 34:43.840
Now the only thing holding me back is my overwhelming, almost paralytic laziness.

34:43.840 --> 34:48.080
Yeah, but they can't help you with that unless that's what growth hacking is.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.720
Back my lazy brain.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.840
Got a special message from Matthew Hammond from Adam.

34:52.840 --> 34:56.800
Trav, do you want to tell me what they have to say?

34:56.800 --> 35:03.080
Well, Adam says to Matthew, to the beardiest man in China, I'm going to need some documentation

35:03.080 --> 35:06.480
on that, happy candle nights from your home across the sea.

35:06.480 --> 35:11.160
I realize we didn't know about it the last time I saw you, but I guess it's a thing now.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.400
I trust it will be filled with eggnog and revelry.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.120
Two things I can only hope are readily available in your country.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.120
P.S.

35:19.120 --> 35:22.120
Matthew and Adam are half-brothers, tell all your friends.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.800
The good news about candle nights is it's really more of a state of mind.

35:24.800 --> 35:25.800
No, it's not.

35:25.800 --> 35:26.800
It's a specific.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.800
It's a fluid being.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.800
It's not.

35:29.800 --> 35:38.600
It's a specific octet of days in the last month of the Gregorian year, and it's a state

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
of mind.

35:39.600 --> 35:43.060
Yeah, but it's also like a real fluid time, you know what I mean?

35:43.060 --> 35:44.320
What does it mean to you?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.560
What do you think it is?

35:45.560 --> 35:51.240
It's a fluid, transient state of mind that occupies your brain in an octet of days in

35:51.240 --> 35:54.080
the last month of our Gregorian calendar, and it's that simple.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.440
But who knows when that is?

35:55.440 --> 35:56.440
I do.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.440
December.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.440
Nobody.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.440
December, December, December.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.600
December could be any time.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
When is December?

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
A lot of people are still wondering about that.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.600
What is December?

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
What am December?

36:05.600 --> 36:09.680
Matthew, happy candle nights to you from your buddy Adam.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.280
I think that that's very nice that you wished your friend a happy candle nights.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.400
Or half-brother.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
Or half-brother.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.840
Jury's still out on that one, even though they explain, when is December?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.240
How are these people related?

36:21.240 --> 36:23.760
Nobody even fucking knows.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.440
Who is this next message for?

36:25.440 --> 36:31.220
This next message is for Ren, and it's from D, D-E, gosh, I hope that's an actual name

36:31.220 --> 36:34.120
and not Denise, and they just got lazy.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.720
D-E, ugh.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.720
Never mind.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.640
It's for Rem, it's for Ren, from D.

36:41.640 --> 36:42.640
Right.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.760
It could be just a guy named Randy sending it to himself.

36:45.760 --> 36:46.760
Renday.

36:46.760 --> 36:47.760
Renday.

36:47.760 --> 36:53.880
Renday says to himself, happy birthday, here's to the next adventure, short, sweet, to the

36:53.880 --> 36:54.880
point, easy.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.200
Is this for an adventure of this Money Zone ad?

36:57.200 --> 36:58.200
Yeah.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.200
We're all on adventure again.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.600
Whoa, barely got through that one.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.600
Yeah.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.600
Whoa, well this is weird.

37:02.600 --> 37:10.200
I've just been handed a map with an X on it, and it says to tell Ren to go to the special

37:10.200 --> 37:11.200
spot.

37:11.200 --> 37:12.200
You know the one.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.200
Walk 30 paces.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.200
Walk 30 paces.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.200
Walk 30 paces.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.200
All right.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.840
Face the sun from using your clitoris as a jumping off point.

37:20.840 --> 37:21.840
Sundial.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.280
Jump off your clitoris this birthday with one of our brothers.

37:24.280 --> 37:27.560
Wee, it's the magic school bus.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.400
Happy birthday, Ren, I hope it's a great one.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.720
Sorry about all the clitoris talk.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.080
Sorry again about all the clitoris talk, gosh, if we could go one episode without saying

37:37.080 --> 37:38.080
that.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.080
I would never.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.080
It would be huge.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.640
I would hit that button on it, an apology.

37:42.640 --> 37:48.400
Sorry about all the clitoris talk, my brother, my brother, and me.

37:48.400 --> 37:53.120
I want to make a quick mention if you're a fan of ours on Facebook or you're a member

37:53.120 --> 37:57.440
of our Facebook group, there's a domestic violence shelter in Heinz, West Virginia,

37:57.440 --> 38:02.280
the only one, in fact, in our hometown called Branches, and they are trying to raise money

38:02.280 --> 38:04.340
to keep the doors open there.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.120
So if you kick in a couple bucks, it'll be money well spent.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.400
The my bim bam angels are already hopping all over it.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.680
If you could pitch in there, that would be great.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.680
They're doing it.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.680
Just go to our Facebook page.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.840
It's the My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation group, and you can find a link to that, donate

38:16.840 --> 38:17.840
there.

38:17.840 --> 38:23.120
Yeah, they're doing a GoFundMe, so it's easy to help them out.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.880
So please do that.

38:24.880 --> 38:29.960
Oh, also, we're going to have a very special guest, Paul Scheer.

38:29.960 --> 38:34.620
I don't know if it'll be on the next episode, but we are recording, I think, before the

38:34.620 --> 38:36.120
next one goes out.

38:36.120 --> 38:41.320
So we could use your questions that we can chat about with Paul Scheer.

38:41.320 --> 38:45.560
Travis, what are his areas of expertise that will guide the questions?

38:45.560 --> 38:53.280
His areas of expertise are Jason Statham movies, thank you notes, and weird collectibles.

38:53.280 --> 38:57.540
I have a weird collection of thank you notes from people who I went to see the Transporter

38:57.540 --> 38:58.600
movies with.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.760
So I think I'm pretty well stopped.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.940
Have you got a question for Paul?

39:01.940 --> 39:02.940
I don't.

39:02.940 --> 39:07.680
I've kind of mastered all of those concepts, yeah, so we'll need other people to chip in.

39:07.680 --> 39:12.840
Also, listen, alert, alert, Valentine's Day is very close.

39:12.840 --> 39:19.000
We get a lot of emails from people talking about how much they love that sound effect,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.240
because we do it in every goddamn episode.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.240
Because they weren't paying attention until then, and then we do it, and they're like,

39:24.240 --> 39:25.240
wait, hold on, shut up, Steven.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.640
Well, hold on, I hear some high-pitched, shitty sounds.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.080
They're doing horrible mouth sounds.

39:31.080 --> 39:39.720
ProFlowers is gonna save your keister, ladies and gents, with a gift, a beautiful gift,

39:39.720 --> 39:41.440
if I may say so.

39:41.440 --> 39:47.280
We have received many deliveries from ProFlowers, they have always been quite beautiful.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.840
And quite edible, if you ask my cat.

39:49.840 --> 39:54.720
Yeah, go to proflowers.com, and then you're gonna see a blue microphone in the upper right

39:54.720 --> 39:55.720
hand corner.

39:55.720 --> 40:00.040
Click on that and type in my brother, and you're gonna get some access to some special

40:00.040 --> 40:07.200
deals like two dozen long stem assorted roses with chocolates and a cherry vase for $39.98,

40:07.200 --> 40:09.320
if you can believe that.

40:09.320 --> 40:13.960
My cherry vase came in with a bitchin' hot rod paint job, and not that-

40:13.960 --> 40:16.320
There's flame decals, it's awesome.

40:16.320 --> 40:21.560
There is no maraschino-like flavor on the vase.

40:21.560 --> 40:28.280
You could get two dozen roses and chocolates with a free vase for $29.99.

40:28.280 --> 40:34.200
There's an ultimate long stem Valentine's Day special that has a bear and some flowers

40:34.200 --> 40:39.160
and chocolate and some, look, what appear to be some sorts of lotions.

40:39.160 --> 40:43.780
Justin, can you confirm if the bear is a real bear or a stuffed bear?

40:43.780 --> 40:48.560
It's a real bear, and the only way to pacify it is to squirt the lotion in its eyes, or

40:48.560 --> 40:49.560
it will attack you and-

40:49.560 --> 40:52.920
If you didn't figure that out, then you gotta go back to your last save point and start

40:52.920 --> 40:53.920
over.

40:53.920 --> 40:59.560
For $39.98, you will go on a bear combat adventure with your beloved.

41:19.340 --> 41:24.360

41:24.360 --> 41:27.280
beautiful and I got them on the cheap.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.640
Maybe keep that bit of info to yourself.

41:29.640 --> 41:34.920
I got full, I got full price love for you, but I paid half price for it.

41:34.920 --> 41:39.000
Your savings are between you and us and God, so we'll keep it that way.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.160

41:42.160 --> 41:44.180
Yeah, it's a, it's a profit deal.

41:44.180 --> 41:50.880
Thank you, hey, and listen, thank you LA for coming out and showing your support of us

41:50.880 --> 41:54.120
as we got up there and we did our thing.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.680
We've referenced the Masonic Lodge at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery is a great venue.

41:58.680 --> 42:03.360
Thanks to our very special guest podcast that came out after us and really just fucking

42:03.360 --> 42:05.760
swept the floor with us.

42:05.760 --> 42:10.120
Really showed us, it gave us like a masterclass in podcasting excellence.

42:10.120 --> 42:13.820
We'll find some way, they've agreed to actually let us release that episode.

42:13.820 --> 42:15.000
We'll try and figure out some way to do it.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.080
Maybe as a donor bonus, we got Max Fun Drive coming up pretty soon.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.640
So we'll, we'll, we'll find a way to circulate, circulate the tapes as it were.

42:23.640 --> 42:27.360
Anyway, back to the show.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.720
I close it so I don't know who sent it in because I, Drew, just let me know if you sent

42:30.720 --> 42:33.600
this one in.

42:33.600 --> 42:43.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Achaya Siva who asks, what happens when vampire bites a werewolf?

42:43.200 --> 42:44.200
Is that true?

42:44.200 --> 42:45.200
Yeah.

42:45.200 --> 42:55.360
This falls into that category of Yahoo Answers that I go, wait, wait, what does?

42:55.360 --> 42:59.800
I writing a vampire book on Wattpad and my character just bit a werewolf.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.680
So now I'm wondering, wait, wait, what did you say?

43:02.680 --> 43:04.120
A vampire book on what?

43:04.120 --> 43:05.120
Wattpad?

43:05.120 --> 43:08.040
I'm guessing it's a, some sort of, is that a cool hip young person thing?

43:08.040 --> 43:09.040
Yeah.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.120
It's like thought catalog, but for werewolves.

43:11.120 --> 43:14.240
I'm writing a vampire book on LiveJournal.

43:14.240 --> 43:19.120
So now I'm wondering if a vampire's bite somehow affects a werewolf in any way.

43:19.120 --> 43:22.040
I already know what happens when a werewolf bites a vampire.

43:22.040 --> 43:25.840
Well, oh, okay.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.620
We all took high school chemistry.

43:29.620 --> 43:33.960
Please tell me if you know what happened when a vampire bites a werewolf.

43:33.960 --> 43:39.280
Someone's in the front row whispering to a friend saying, well, clearly, do you know

43:39.280 --> 43:40.280
the answer?

43:40.280 --> 43:42.880
Oh, I thought you were whispering about what happens.

43:42.880 --> 43:47.400
Could you read the first line of the first answer, please?

43:47.400 --> 43:51.200
Jesus Christ, you ask a simple question about fantasy critters and some douchebag thinks

43:51.200 --> 43:54.140
you asked for a sermon about the frigging evil Girl Scouts.

43:54.140 --> 43:55.140
Some people.

43:55.140 --> 43:56.480
Anyway, where was I?

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
Oh yeah.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.480
Jesus Christ.

43:58.480 --> 44:03.800
Lost my train of thought there, I got so angry.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.600
What happens though when a vampire bites a werewolf?

44:06.600 --> 44:09.280
I think the werewolf goes, what the fuck?

44:09.280 --> 44:10.280
What does he gain?

44:10.280 --> 44:15.680
So okay, most of the mythology I've seen is that a vampire has to feed on you and you

44:15.680 --> 44:19.160
have to feed on a vampire and normally you wouldn't think that a werewolf would do this,

44:19.160 --> 44:22.240
but you would have to assume a vampire bites a werewolf.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.760
They're locked in combat, correct?

44:23.760 --> 44:26.480
We can all agree vampires and werewolves are better enemies.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.680
Look in your hearts.

44:28.680 --> 44:34.320
Watch fucking Vampire Diaries or Twilight or any of our home movies.

44:34.320 --> 44:37.200
You'll see vampires and werewolves are better enemies.

44:37.200 --> 44:41.760
So the vampire has bit the werewolf, the werewolf has probably bitten the vampire.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.760
Sixty-ninin.

44:42.760 --> 44:49.960
I want to hear Griffin's story now, you're out.

44:49.960 --> 44:50.960
You're out.

44:50.960 --> 44:53.960
Tag Justin, tag me in.

44:53.960 --> 44:54.960
Sixty bite?

44:54.960 --> 44:55.960
Is that a thing?

44:55.960 --> 44:57.400
Start at the beginning and talk slow.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.800
Well, it's not, they're not really sixty.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.360
They're not really sixty-ninin.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.960
It's just, you know, you do a double nose bite.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.960
They're sixteen sixty-ninin.

45:05.960 --> 45:06.960
Oh shit.

45:06.960 --> 45:07.960
I figured it out.

45:07.960 --> 45:08.960
I figured it out.

45:08.960 --> 45:09.960
Nothing?

45:09.960 --> 45:10.960
Nope.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
It's fair.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.960
They bite each other on the necks.

45:12.960 --> 45:13.960
Same time.

45:13.960 --> 45:14.960
Boom.

45:14.960 --> 45:15.960
Right?

45:15.960 --> 45:16.960
And then they...

45:16.960 --> 45:17.960
What?

45:17.960 --> 45:18.960
What?

45:18.960 --> 45:19.960
What's your addition?

45:19.960 --> 45:20.960
Do you know?

45:20.960 --> 45:21.960
You saw the answer?

45:21.960 --> 45:22.960
Whisper it.

45:22.960 --> 45:23.960
No, he's saying whisper.

45:23.960 --> 45:24.960
Oh, you want me to whisper my answer?

45:24.960 --> 45:25.960
ASMR it.

45:25.960 --> 45:26.960
ASMR it.

45:26.960 --> 45:27.960
ASMR it.

45:27.960 --> 45:28.960
I guess I'll ASMR this thing.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.960
Everybody, I need complete and utter silence.

45:29.960 --> 45:30.960
Or I can't finish.

45:30.960 --> 45:36.400
You can't fucking laugh.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.280
We do a bite sixty-nine.

45:39.280 --> 45:44.240
And they both just like, just suck that.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
Shut up.

45:45.240 --> 45:49.480
We're never going to get a YouTube smash hit.

45:49.480 --> 45:54.640
They both suck that monster fluid out so hard.

45:54.640 --> 45:57.680
And then, but they both suck all of it out.

45:57.680 --> 46:02.320
All of a sudden, the vampire's a werewolf, werewolf's a vampire.

46:02.320 --> 46:07.160
They fucking switch all their fluids around.

46:07.160 --> 46:10.600
They do a complete fluid rotation.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.600
Vampire's a werewolf, werewolf's a vampire.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.600
Oh, so not like a vamp, werewolf, or were-vampire.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.600
They're like, they switch places.

46:15.600 --> 46:22.280
No, I'm saying a complete, 100% fluid transaction.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
Do you think we can mix?

46:23.280 --> 46:24.280
Total monster conversion.

46:24.280 --> 46:28.240
No, I need you to look at Griffin's face and how happy he is about this.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.960
Just think about it.

46:29.960 --> 46:33.360
First of all, why is the werewolf sucking blood?

46:33.360 --> 46:34.360
That's not his M.O.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.360
He's thirsty.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.360
What do you want from him?

46:36.360 --> 46:37.360
What's he going to do?

46:37.360 --> 46:38.360
Drink a lemonade?

46:38.360 --> 46:39.360
Come on, Griffin.

46:39.360 --> 46:40.360
Full point.

46:40.360 --> 46:41.360
Sixty-nine monster drain.

46:41.360 --> 46:45.640
Okay, seriously, what liquid would you see a werewolf...

46:45.640 --> 46:48.360
Three-sixty no-look.

46:48.360 --> 46:52.200
What werewolf would you see, what drink would you see a werewolf drinking and you think,

46:52.200 --> 46:54.200
yep, other than blood?

46:54.200 --> 46:55.200
Powerade?

46:55.200 --> 46:56.200
Nope.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.200
That's a good point.

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
Pink lemonade?

46:58.200 --> 46:59.200
Absolutely not.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.200
Monster?

47:00.200 --> 47:02.200
Monster, someone said.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.200
On the nose.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.200
A little on the nose.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.200
That's fine.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
You want to change places?

47:06.200 --> 47:13.440
When we put that on the tube, I think we should mix it stereophonically so I'm in one ear

47:13.440 --> 47:17.480
and Trous is in the other so you really feel like you're here.

47:17.480 --> 47:18.480
When you hear...

47:18.480 --> 47:19.480
Those are blood-drinking noises.

47:19.480 --> 47:24.480
Did everyone get their ASMR rocks off?

47:24.480 --> 47:25.960
Is that important to me?

47:25.960 --> 47:26.960
You feel the tingles?

47:26.960 --> 47:27.960
Excellent.

47:27.960 --> 47:32.480
I'm the gal you guys created life with during the last LA show.

47:32.480 --> 47:33.760
That's not what it sounds like.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.080
Thanks for the advice.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.560
We're now expecting that baby.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.560
My friend Julie and I are...

47:39.560 --> 47:42.320
Congratulations or whatever.

47:42.320 --> 47:43.320
My friend...

47:43.320 --> 47:46.520
Sorry, after you have a baby, it's kind of like, yeah, I get it.

47:46.520 --> 47:51.240
My friend Julie and I are coming again to enjoy your advice stylings.

47:51.240 --> 47:52.720
So here's another question.

47:52.720 --> 47:57.240
Do you have any specific suggestions on baby names?

47:57.240 --> 48:01.440
We got a couple of possibles, but naming a human is hard.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.160
Specific name suggestions or general ideas would be appreciated.

48:04.160 --> 48:07.160
Linda, Linda, are you here?

48:07.160 --> 48:08.160
Linda.

48:08.160 --> 48:10.480
We should explain.

48:10.480 --> 48:15.920
If you miss that show, Linda asked us if she should have a child and we said, it's not

48:15.920 --> 48:18.280
going to be our problem, so sure, go for it.

48:18.280 --> 48:21.080
And then she did that night.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.920
Well, I don't know that the timing works out so well on that.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.920
Wait, what is it?

48:26.920 --> 48:27.920
Fuck.

48:27.920 --> 48:28.920
Linda.

48:28.920 --> 48:29.920
We got to go ahead.

48:29.920 --> 48:30.920
It's time to party.

48:30.920 --> 48:33.920
Are we going to be pod fathers?

48:33.920 --> 48:37.480
Linda, do you know Boy or Girl?

48:37.480 --> 48:40.760
Oh, that makes things a lot easier on us.

48:40.760 --> 48:41.760
Sorry.

48:41.760 --> 48:42.760
Easy.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.760
Lieutenant.

48:43.760 --> 48:44.760
Could you...

48:44.760 --> 48:45.760
Wait, what's your last name?

48:45.760 --> 48:48.760
Wait, you don't have to say it.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.760
What's your social security number?

48:50.760 --> 48:53.000
It's your Netflix password.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.480
Give us your thumbprint.

48:54.480 --> 48:59.120
Show your thumbprint on paper.

48:59.120 --> 49:02.400
Everyone can do that, right?

49:02.400 --> 49:11.400
Have you considered nature box?

49:11.400 --> 49:13.680
A streamer's chance.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.560
Brand your child.

49:15.560 --> 49:16.560
Early in all of them.

49:16.560 --> 49:22.160
I went through, you don't know how many permutations of when I was trying to name our child, Charlie

49:22.160 --> 49:23.160
the baby.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.160
Hi, Charlie, if you're listening.

49:25.160 --> 49:26.160
In 15 years.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.520
In the future.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.720
If you're younger than 15, turn the fucking show off right now.

49:30.720 --> 49:33.760
Because he's about to tell you where the treasure is buried.

49:33.760 --> 49:34.760
I went...

49:34.760 --> 49:38.160
Also, we just talked about Monster 69, eh?

49:38.160 --> 49:39.160
I went...

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
Yeah, there's no way.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.720
She's like, ugh, I can't.

49:42.720 --> 49:49.320
We went through every permutation of like, Batman, no, Batman the baby, no, Batman the

49:49.320 --> 49:54.680
baby, Junior McElroy, no, Batman the comic of the movie, no.

49:54.680 --> 49:58.880
Have you thought about Kraken so that every time you let her out of her heart, him out

49:58.880 --> 50:01.840
of his harness or his like crib, you can say, release the Kraken.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.240
Yeah, that's pretty good.

50:03.240 --> 50:06.640
Because when you name a baby, it should be for one easy goof.

50:06.640 --> 50:10.320
I mean, Justin's obvious.

50:10.320 --> 50:15.140
Yeah, it's like, I think we should probably, we've been involved so far.

50:15.140 --> 50:19.600
We kind of have been carrying the load a little, like a lot.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.200
What does Justin mean?

50:21.200 --> 50:22.200
What?

50:22.200 --> 50:23.200
What does it mean?

50:23.200 --> 50:28.320
What does Justin...

50:28.320 --> 50:34.040
How long have you got, man?

50:34.040 --> 50:38.840
You wait till you're 34, you're going to be asking yourself a lot of questions like that.

50:38.840 --> 50:44.520
What does Justin mean?

50:44.520 --> 50:45.520
What did you do?

50:45.520 --> 50:46.520
Oh, fuck me.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.520
Perfect.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.520
Just what you needed.

50:48.520 --> 50:53.360
If you're listening at home, I just ripped off my shirt again and my muscles were even

50:53.360 --> 50:59.160
bigger and they went nuts for it.

50:59.160 --> 51:02.520
Can we combine our names into one totally great name?

51:02.520 --> 51:03.800
What would that sound like?

51:03.800 --> 51:04.800
Boo-shimmy.

51:04.800 --> 51:09.020
None of us have a B.

51:09.020 --> 51:11.440
Or a shim or an E.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.440
Okay.

51:12.440 --> 51:14.800
That always goes by Chaboy, right?

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
Fair.

51:15.800 --> 51:16.800
Lieutenant Boo-shimmy McElroy.

51:16.800 --> 51:21.800
Lieutenant Boo-shimmy Chaboy McElroy.

51:21.800 --> 51:25.500
Can you tell us an invented last name so we can have something to work with?

51:25.500 --> 51:26.500
Just make it up.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.500
Just make it up.

51:27.500 --> 51:28.500
Whatever.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.500
We'll take it from anybody in the audience.

51:29.500 --> 51:30.500
It's time to put you on the spot.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.560
Everybody promises not to identity theft them.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.560
Come on.

51:33.560 --> 51:40.200
Now, give me a location, give me a location someplace where you might go on a first date.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.200
I have a veterinarian's office.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.200
Okay.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.200
I've heard aerobics.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.200
Okay.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.200
Venet...

51:45.200 --> 51:46.200
Ven...

51:46.200 --> 51:47.200
Ving Rhames Aerobics.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.320
Is that what you're saying?

51:49.320 --> 51:51.400
I was thinking like...

51:51.400 --> 51:52.400
Like J-trigger.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.400
Why?

51:53.400 --> 51:57.640
For the last name or for the first name?

51:57.640 --> 51:58.640
For both.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.640
Okay.

51:59.640 --> 52:00.640
Say it again.

52:00.640 --> 52:01.640
J-trigger.

52:01.640 --> 52:04.600
So it'd have to go back to that J-trigger J-trigger.

52:04.600 --> 52:08.080
I'm Lieutenant J-trigger J-trigger.

52:08.080 --> 52:12.120
Have you picked out his last name yet?

52:12.120 --> 52:13.120
You laugh.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.120
But you can do whatever.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.120
It's 2015.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.120
Yeah.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.120
You can play Calvin Ball.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.120
Let's...

52:18.120 --> 52:21.280
Should we take some audience questions?

52:21.280 --> 52:22.720
Calvin Ball is a great first name.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.720
It's been...

52:23.720 --> 52:24.720
Yeah.

52:24.720 --> 52:25.720
I guess.

52:25.720 --> 52:26.720
Yeah.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
We've checked out.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.720
So let's do audience questions.

52:28.720 --> 52:29.720
Can we do one?

52:29.720 --> 52:30.720
Okay.

52:30.720 --> 52:31.720
Here's what we do.

52:31.720 --> 52:34.080
I'm going to read one more and that person comes on stage and that'll be our segue into

52:34.080 --> 52:35.080
audience questions.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.080
You don't have to line up or whatever.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.080
We'll call on you.

52:37.080 --> 52:38.080
Yeah.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.080
No bummers.

52:39.080 --> 52:46.120
Remember, seriously, if you fucking kill this, oof, hypothetically speaking, do you know

52:46.120 --> 52:47.120
who that is?

52:47.120 --> 52:48.120
Are you here?

52:48.120 --> 52:49.120
Come on up.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.640
Someone just got real nervous.

52:51.640 --> 52:52.720
Come on up.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.720
Come on up.

52:53.720 --> 52:54.720
Come on up.

52:54.720 --> 53:00.640
No, no, no, no, no.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.600
They approach in silence.

53:02.600 --> 53:03.600
Everybody just relax.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.680
Just look.

53:04.680 --> 53:05.680
Don't speak.

53:05.680 --> 53:06.680
Don't speak.

53:06.680 --> 53:07.680
Hello.

53:07.680 --> 53:14.760
Okay, here we go.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.360
Hypothetically speaking, this is a fucking really funny question.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.880
This is why I wanted to bring you up.

53:19.880 --> 53:23.960
Hypothetically speaking, would you consider attending the live recording of a podcast,

53:23.960 --> 53:29.240
perhaps one that focused on the alchemy like creation of wisdom, good material for a second

53:29.240 --> 53:30.240
date?

53:30.240 --> 53:32.040
Follow up question.

53:32.040 --> 53:37.880
Absolutely hypothetical.

53:37.880 --> 53:46.040
Do you think it would make a good second impression if I, I mean Jane Doe, submitted a question

53:46.040 --> 53:52.480
about whether or not this second absolutely hypothetical date is a good idea?

53:52.480 --> 53:55.600
Does it make a funny story or a cautionary tale?

53:55.600 --> 54:04.120
And that's from totally not in the audience right now.

54:04.120 --> 54:08.520
The jig, the jig, as they say, is up.

54:08.520 --> 54:09.520
Hey, Debra.

54:09.520 --> 54:11.520
Hey, Debra, should I email the brothers?

54:11.520 --> 54:14.600
They won't like make this completely on blast.

54:14.600 --> 54:15.600
It might be cool.

54:15.600 --> 54:16.600
Right?

54:16.600 --> 54:17.600
Yeah, yeah, that's probably true.

54:17.600 --> 54:23.880
So like, wait, well, I mean, now I have to ask, how's a good one?

54:23.880 --> 54:29.560
You'll have to speak at some point.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.560
He didn't come.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.560
Oh, what the fuck?

54:31.560 --> 54:32.560
What the fuck?

54:32.560 --> 54:36.360
What's his name?

54:36.360 --> 54:38.080
Just first names, please.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.080
For legal issues.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.080
Lieutenant.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.080
Lieutenant.

54:41.080 --> 54:45.320
Well, listen, no, listen, listen, listen.

54:45.320 --> 54:49.360
If he has served in our military forces, I don't think that we can.

54:49.360 --> 54:53.440
They don't legally change your first name to Lieutenant when you join the military.

54:53.440 --> 54:54.440
Yeah, they do.

54:54.440 --> 54:55.440
It's to like.

54:55.440 --> 54:56.440
Lieutenant Dan.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.440
Yes.

54:57.440 --> 54:59.840
It's how they make you part of like the machine or whatever.

54:59.840 --> 55:05.960
So they say private and like 40 guys like, yup.

55:05.960 --> 55:09.200
Well, now it's awkward to say like, yeah, that'd be totally great second date.

55:09.200 --> 55:12.200
To be fair, though, he's still a funny story.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.200
What?

55:13.200 --> 55:14.200
Yeah, I mean, now.

55:14.200 --> 55:15.920
No, it's a great story about fuck that dude.

55:15.920 --> 55:16.920
Yeah.

55:16.920 --> 55:17.920
Just so I'm clear, he did pay though, right?

55:17.920 --> 55:18.920
I mean, he still bought the ticket.

55:18.920 --> 55:19.920
Oh, no.

55:19.920 --> 55:20.920
What the fuck?

55:20.920 --> 55:26.480
I got a mouth to feed.

55:26.480 --> 55:27.480
Okay.

55:27.480 --> 55:28.480
Come here.

55:28.480 --> 55:39.160
So this was literally a hypothetical, okay.

55:39.160 --> 55:44.040
To answer your question, I think it's fine.

55:44.040 --> 55:49.760
One time I went on a second date to see the film, a hundred and twenty seven hours.

55:49.760 --> 55:53.880
I forget how many hours that man was trapped between those rocks.

55:53.880 --> 55:55.680
It was a bunch of hours.

55:55.680 --> 55:58.000
I think it was a hundred and twenty seven hours.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.960
And I actually did throw up in my mouth while I was watching the movie.

56:02.960 --> 56:07.400
And it was like, if you're going to throw up in your mouth, I did it probably as smoothly

56:07.400 --> 56:08.400
as you could do it.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.400
But yeah.

56:09.400 --> 56:12.760
It was like two hours in.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.080
He was like chewing to his own bone veins.

56:15.080 --> 56:18.120
I was like, whoa, hold up.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.120
That's fucked up.

56:19.120 --> 56:20.960
I didn't know you had bone veins.

56:20.960 --> 56:26.960
And homeboy was like going to golden corral on those motherfuckers.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.960
And so I threw up a little bit in my mouth, literally.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.480
I know that's a thing people say.

56:30.480 --> 56:34.680
It can happen to you while you're watching twenty seven hours.

56:34.680 --> 56:38.040
I played it off real smooth, but we didn't see each other again.

56:38.040 --> 56:44.640
Jane, if it makes you feel any better, the first girl I ever actually dated, our first

56:44.640 --> 56:52.720
date was bowling with her family.

56:52.720 --> 56:53.720
Be cool, you guys.

56:53.720 --> 56:54.720
Be cool.

56:54.720 --> 56:55.720
He's coming out for the first time ever.

56:55.720 --> 56:56.720
I didn't even know that.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.520
Our second date was seeing Bridges of Madison County.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.160
Nice.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.160
I spent.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.160
I can top that.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.160
I can top that.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.160
I can top that.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.160
Not a joke.

57:06.160 --> 57:10.400
I spent the what felt to me five hours and thirty minute running time of Bridges Madison

57:10.400 --> 57:14.000
County putting my arm around her.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.240
So literally.

57:16.240 --> 57:17.240
Show me on.

57:17.240 --> 57:18.240
Yeah.

57:18.240 --> 57:24.280
Even even if you had time lapse, it would look like this.

57:24.280 --> 57:26.760
And I mean, literally, this is accelerated, right?

57:26.760 --> 57:30.680
Like like five hours elapsed in about 30 seconds.

57:30.680 --> 57:31.680
She would not.

57:31.680 --> 57:37.760
She would have at the by the fucking time she was swept away by fucking Clint Eastwood.

57:37.760 --> 57:38.760
Spoilers.

57:38.760 --> 57:39.760
OK, sorry.

57:39.760 --> 57:44.160
By the time the credits rolled, she would have sworn with her hand on the Bible that

57:44.160 --> 57:46.600
my hand had always been on her shoulder.

57:46.600 --> 57:51.600
That was the speed at which has always been there, will always be Justin's hand.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.440
I think it was there when I was.

57:53.440 --> 57:56.600
There was moss connecting your hand and shoulder.

57:56.600 --> 57:59.120
There was went on a first date to see the notebook.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.120
OK.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.120
And I know fresh.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.840
I left like a baby.

58:02.840 --> 58:03.840
Yeah.

58:03.840 --> 58:04.840
And she did not.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.960
All right.

58:06.960 --> 58:10.840
And I chose to never see her again because she was a robot.

58:10.840 --> 58:12.880
Bounces off you first date.

58:12.880 --> 58:15.840
I went on with this with a young lady.

58:15.840 --> 58:18.800
We were in Godfuck like middle school.

58:18.800 --> 58:20.920
And it was also my first date ever.

58:20.920 --> 58:26.760
We went to see the Prince of Egypt.

58:26.760 --> 58:30.840
The animated movie with Johnny Osmond.

58:30.840 --> 58:40.160
I learned for these to get you laid.

58:40.160 --> 58:44.840
So I guess what we're saying, Jane, is did that help?

58:44.840 --> 58:48.160
We're saying you could have fucked up so much worse.

58:48.160 --> 58:49.160
This was like.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.160
Yeah.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.160
This was.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.160
Yeah.

58:52.160 --> 58:53.160
He didn't deserve you.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
Yeah.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.160
You're way better than that.

58:55.160 --> 58:56.160
If any single men are out there.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.160
Don't fucking do that.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.440
That's not going to fucking turn our podcast into Grinder.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.800
Thank you, Jane, so much for joining us.

59:01.800 --> 59:06.280
You want to get some people up here?

59:06.280 --> 59:07.280
Yeah.

59:07.280 --> 59:08.280
All right.

59:08.280 --> 59:09.280
Let's take another question from the audience.

59:09.280 --> 59:10.280
Raise your hand if you have a question.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.480
Not a bummer at all.

59:12.480 --> 59:16.760
Let's get Drew up here first because like we owe him our lives.

59:16.760 --> 59:17.760
Yeah.

59:17.760 --> 59:18.760
Drew.

59:18.760 --> 59:25.200
I like when Drew comes on stage because it puts us in scale.

59:25.200 --> 59:26.200
He's a big guy.

59:26.200 --> 59:27.200
God, look at you.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.400
He's a giant of a man.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.400
Strong like a bull.

59:30.400 --> 59:31.400
Look at that.

59:31.400 --> 59:32.400
He's standing.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.400
He isn't even on the stage right now.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.400
He's standing on the steps.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.400
And he's still six times stronger than I am.

59:35.400 --> 59:36.400
Griffin, go stand next to him.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.400
No, I don't want to do that.

59:37.400 --> 59:42.360
No, I have to pee like so fucking bad if I stand up.

59:42.360 --> 59:43.360
The show's over.

59:43.360 --> 59:44.360
Go ahead.

59:44.360 --> 59:45.880
A little behind the scenes.

59:45.880 --> 59:50.320
I have a question that probably only you three and one other person can answer.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.320
Okay.

59:51.320 --> 59:52.320
Who's gaslighting me?

59:52.320 --> 59:57.320
Someone in this room.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.760
Gaslighting Drew.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.160
I saw a hand move.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.160
Are you doing it?

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.160
No.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160
That was very suspicious.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.160
It was very suspicious.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.400
It was very shifty, madam.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:10.760
Somebody wrote Drew Davenport a very sweet message that we read a lot on the show, realizing

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.440
as we read it that it was a sweet message to Drew Davenport.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
I don't know if you know this.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.960
I get a lot of emails, Yahoo submissions, hand of God from people to the Mabim Bam email

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.760
account with Yahoo submissions with the name Drew Davenport, but it's not you.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:32.880
There are false prophets among us that create Gmail shits like Drew hyphen Davenport.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.400
I'm like, that ain't it.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.160
That's not the legit email address.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.080
You have a lot of impersonators, but I know the true flavor.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.480
Drew, how do you feel being gaslighted?

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
Gaslit I think.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480
Gaslit?

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
Gas hung.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.120
At first it was like, oh, that's so sweet.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120
I was really excited.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.480
And then it started to grow.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Yeah.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.000
Someone should have came forward at some point and it never happened.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Should we just tell them?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.600
Is it getting like, do you find a dead bird in your car or something?

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:11.160
No, just a lot of notes, like I'm watching, I don't know.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.240
You scared the shit out of me.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.080
Man, I feel like this show has done at least a little bit of good for a few people out

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.040
there in the world, but if you got murdered, it would cancel all that out I think.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.880
Drew, let's just say there's a very good, there's a very good reason we're doing this

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.520
show at the Masonic Lodge.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.560
Was it the tip?

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.240
I can't say anything, but yes.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.680
If you're listening at home, we are not making triangles with our fingers.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:45.680
Where are my people at?

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.680
I know some of you are out there.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680
We'll edit this out, right Grimmon?

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.680
Yes.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.680
Yeah.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.760
We'll edit out the shapes in our hands made from the audio recording.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.840
Drew, I'm so sorry that we've brought to light all of your stalkers.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.880
But can I tell you, you fucking love it.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.880
Sorry.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.880
Love that shit.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:01.880
Sorry we ruined your life.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.880
Drew Davenport, everybody.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.880
Yeah.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.880
Who's next?

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.880
I saw that hand go up first.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:08.880
Yep.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.080
Come on up with the sweet vest.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.960
Are you not cold?

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.360
It's not a very protective vest from the elements.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.400
So I'm here with my girlfriend.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400
What's your name?

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400
My name's Kenji.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400
Kenji.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
How's it going?

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400
Going good.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
So I'm here with my girlfriend.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400
Hi.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400
Yo.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.960
And the question I have is, my ex will not leave me alone to the point that it's actually

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.880
kind of like really bad and dangerous and it's actually affecting our relationship now.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.160
Kenji, I just want to stop you one second.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160
Yeah?

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.800
You are on a fucking razor's edge, my friend.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.960
If you take us into Bummer Town- Not literally, don't look behind you, Kenji.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.960
Not literally.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.880
Well, I thought you meant like the edge of the-

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.680
Just pull it off of that.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680
You gotta-

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680
She's a downer.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680
Come on, man.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680
She's a downer.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680
Listen to your girlfriend, Kenji.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680
She saved it.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680
Congratulations.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680
Okay.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.680
Do you want us to get rid of her?

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680
Is that what it would've been?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680
Does she listen?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.680
We have a particular set of skills, but it's boner jokes.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.600
There's one thing we're good at, it's ruining relationships.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.560
Let Kenji- We don't even need to be here anymore.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.200
Let Kenji finish for once.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.200
Sorry, Kenji.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.200
Sorry, Kenji, every time.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.000
No, the question I have is, what can I do to get the ex to stop?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
How tied are you to Hollywood?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Because I want her to stop.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.560
I have asked her to stop, and she won't.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.000
You can go my route and gain like 50 pounds.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.080
Is it really?

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:43.480
It was that funny?

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480
Kenji and-

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480
Kelsey.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480
Kelsey.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480
Cool.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480
Kelsey and Kenji.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480
You guys are doing so good together.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.640
Yeah, by the way, that's amazing.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.440
You guys locked it down.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.600
Just pretend like it's a debt collector and pretend like it doesn't exist.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600
Yeah.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.600
Is that not what you do?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.760
It's what I have traditionally done.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.560
What effect does she- She has no effect.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.560
She can do all she wants.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.500
She can put forth all the energy she wants.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.480
Unless she's putting dead rabbits into stews, you got nothing to do.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.480
Dead rabbits into stews?

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480
That's where they fucking go.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480
I want to know.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.280
What are you fucking talking about?

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.720
Unless she's like cutting up potatoes and putting it in soup.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.560
Unless she's like cutting up meat and seasoning it and putting it on grills, like fucking

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.560
ignore her.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.560
Well, I mean-

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.560
Is she working a restaurant?

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.560
What's she doing?

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:36.360
Also, have you guys ever had to deal with a situation like that?

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:41.360
Just like a crazy ex that won't leave you alone.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.360
Like a crazy ex that won't leave you alone.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360
With a woman being obsessed with us?

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360
Look at me, Kenji.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360
Look at me.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360
Look at me.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360
Oh, man.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360
How many times?

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:55.160
At Prince of Egypt date, she was like, come on, we got to go see Exodus.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.400
It's like, it's been like 21 years.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.200
I love the way you cry in the notebook.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200
Let it go.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.480
Let it go.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.840
It's like Prince of Egypt, but not animated and Donnie Osmond's not in it.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.520
Like what's the fucking point?

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:18.640
I saw a preview for a NBC special for the New Testament, a mini series coming up.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.200
Talk about yourself, Kenji.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.840
Just one second, Kenji.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.920
And the opening of the trailer said, from the producers of the Bible.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:32.760
I was like, I'm so glad that fool wrote something else.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.720
It's like Harper Lee coming back and writing again.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.280
The Bible was so good, but like, what's next?

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:48.000
So Kenji, seriously, have you been straight up with this girl and said like, we're done.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.520
Like I couldn't be less interested in you.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.120
Did you tell her we broke up six months ago, get the net?

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.920
I don't even have a gun.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.040
It's been off for a while now and she says, yeah.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.680
If you've been clear and you've been straightforward, you've literally done all you can do except

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.680
for like a legal restraining order.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.680
I've tried to be nice with her.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.440
I've tried to be civil, you know.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440
Restraining order.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440
Yeah.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.840
Did she give you a gun rack?

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840
We just did that one.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840
We did that joke.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.360
I'm just going to fucking keep doing it until you stop laughing.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.360
Don't laugh at this.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.920
I don't even own a gun.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920
We literally said that.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.920
We fucking literally just said that.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.560
Remember when I simultaneously said, Hennessy P. Jones over there.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.840
That's a great baby name.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.340
We had a- Hennessy P. Jones, we found it.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:40.680
We had a meeting with a business person today for business and we all remarked to each other

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.680
that sincerely in our heart of hearts, we were disappointed that the meeting didn't

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:53.600
end with the person saying, and I have a cashier's check here for $5,000 each.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.160
So yeah, if you've been clear and you've done all you can do, legal, go legal.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.960
That's why laws exist, dog.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.760
Not just to like fuck you over because you parked your car in a place where it wasn't

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.560
supposed to be or whatever.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:11.160
I know that's like 99% of our exposure to the man, but sometimes it'll get you out of

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.160
a pickle.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.160
Thank you, Kenji.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.160
Say thank you, Kenji.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.160
Thank you.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.160
One more.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:23.160
Let's go a little bit deeper.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.760
Are there any ladies here that would like our advice?

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760
We just did two dudes.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760
I see a lady right there.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.760
Right there.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.760
Yes.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.760
Come on up.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.760
You wooed.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.640
Give her a round of applause.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.440
And might I say sweet t-shirt.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.440
That is a nice t-shirt.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.440
I'd love to buy one of those in the lobby.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440
Yeah.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440
Go out there.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440
They're for sale.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.800
Travis's wife will sell you one.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.880
Don't be weird to her though.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Don't be weird.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880
Be cool.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880
Can you give me one name?

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880
What's your name and what's your question?

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880
My name is Jolene.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880
Jolene?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880
Talking to the microphone, Jolene.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880
Yeah.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880
Don't be scared.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880
Jolene, can I ask you a question?

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.600
Are you sick of that song or is that song your fucking jam?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600
Which one?

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600
There's like nine of them.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.600
What?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.400
Jolene Lamontagne's like, hold up, I got a good song name too.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400
Like do you?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.400
Because Dolly Parton like took it.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.880
You cannot beat that fucking DP joint.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.880
I get the Dolly Parton one all the time.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880
Okay.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880
It's only because it's like the best song ever.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880
But go ahead.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.680
Hey Jolene, just between you and I, if you don't talk into the microphone, people can't

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680
hear you.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680
Yeah.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.680
Okay.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680
There we go.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.680
That's better.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680
What's up?

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.400
So my husband who is here, he has become like completely addicted to like board games and

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400
could play them 24-7.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.400
Sure.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.680
Really glad you said board games.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:34.160
There are a bunch of different avenues that could have gone down that would've been awful.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.840
That's really the best one.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.160
He's become really addicted to murdering.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160
For crack.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.400
He murders people to take the crack away from the people who have all the crack.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.400
What do I do?

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.400
Okay.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.400
Board games.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400
Go on.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.400
Okay.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.400
Board games.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400
And remember, just like get really close to that mic.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.760
He could play them like 24-7 with his friends all the time.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.000
I could play them maybe 24 minutes every other week.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
But he says, well, why don't we do some of your hobbies?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.440
I don't have any hobbies.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.440
I don't know what I like.

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.120
And you establish that among the things you like, Catan, not one of them.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120
Not great.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120
Not great.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.160
So what are some good hobbies to do?

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.640
If I may, let me ask you this.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.780
And feel free not to answer or to give a range.

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780
How old are you?

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.780
I'm 24.

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780
Great.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:24.480
The world is so literally going for people to be younger than 30, but go on.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:33.760
I think a cool hobby would be staying up until 11 o'clock.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.520
The greatest opportunity you have, I assume you live in Los Angeles?

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.520
No, we're from Utah.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.520
Oh, I'm done.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.520
No, fuck off.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.520
Fuck off.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520
West Virginia guy.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.520
Hey, we're big time now.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520
Yeah.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.240
No, but like in any city, there are like classes offered anywhere.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.560
So like if you're like, I kind of like to cook, wait, take a cooking class.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.960
If you're like, I kind of like movies, take a film class.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.440
You're a millionaire, right?

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.120
That can afford to buy like cooking classes.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.160
Yes, because every class costs $20,000.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:10.560
We also, we don't like people and stuff, so we wouldn't like go out to find-

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.560
It's 2015, nobody likes people.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.560
Can I ask you a question?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.120
If you were to play a board game with just the two of you, would you enjoy that?

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:21.000
Or is it just like, because like my wife, God love her, she doesn't enjoy board games.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.960
Like almost to a point where I feel like it's intentional, like because she knows how much

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.720
joy brings me, she wants to deprive me of it.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.800
You guys don't know who his wife is, right?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.080
So this is totally cool.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.560
This is fine if you bad mouth her.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.560
She didn't know.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.000
I love the woman very dearly.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.240
She gave me my child, my world, my everything.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:46.100
She doesn't like board games.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:51.120
One time my wife beat me at Settlers of Bataan and then we stopped playing board games together.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.880
You're a very big person.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.200
You gotta, can you find, what?

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200
Can you give us anything?

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.200
Can you give us anything?

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.560
What do you like even if you don't think it's a hobby?

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560
What do you like?

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.600
We like- No, what do you like?

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:05.600
What do you like?

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600
This is about you now.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.600
I like podcasts.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.600
Ignore all these people.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600
You like podcasts.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.600
Podcasts.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600
Podcasts are not a very good shared experience.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600
No, it's not.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.120
Let's sit here and just not talk for an hour.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.200
Hey, did you, listen, shut up.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200
Make your own podcast.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200
Yeah, it's easy.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.200
I've been wanting to do that forever, but he doesn't think we have anything to talk about.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200
Listen, can I throw it out?

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200
Board games.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200
Why are you laughing?

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200
This is serious.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.520
Do a podcast in which he loves board games and you do not, and it's about him trying

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520
to sell you.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520
Yeah, that's going to be really compelling.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.000
I really like Catan because it's like every time it's different because the hexes are

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
always shoved.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Fuck this.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.840
Can I just say, I would listen to that.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:51.000
I would listen to a show of somebody describing how cool Catan is and somebody making wet

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
fart noises.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I would do that.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.600
That's the most successful podcast.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.600
That is serial two Catan wet fart sounds.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.440
I really like it because it's like different strategies every time you go for longest road,

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.440
biggest army.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.440
Why isn't this digital?

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440
Boo.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.440
That'd be good.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440
Yeah.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.840
So there you go.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.840
We did it.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.840
We did it.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.840
Another one for the brothers.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840
Thank you.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.840
I think that's a wrap up.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840
Yeah.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.780
Listen, folks, thank you so much for having us here at the Masonic Lodge, the beautiful

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.200
Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200
They have been fucking excellent.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.200
They've been super, super great.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.200
Big round of applause for them.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.200
Yeah.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:40.440
If you haven't had a chance, just like walk around and look at all of the things they

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.840
have here, because they have a lot of really great things, especially at night and let

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.960
them lock the gate while you're still here and just live here.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:56.840
We want to thank Maximum of Fun dot org, a podcast network that we were proud members

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.840
of.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:10.240
They have great shows like Oh No, Ross and Carrie, Bunker Buddies, Saw Bones, and I'm

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.240
a fan.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.240
I think we should try Bunker Buddies again.

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.240
The Adventure Zone is another one.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.240
Are there other Macroid podcasts?

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.640
There are other Macroid family podcasts.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.040
Jordan and Jessica, Judge John Hodgson, RISC, The Memory Palace.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040
Flop House.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040
The Flop House.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040
Yes.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.760
Try and get a video project on Kickstarter.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.400
Brian Lindsay will totally eat that.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.800
Go kickstart that.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:47.680
It is a full podcast, Cornucopia, and we are so proud to be a part of their vast family.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.440
So yeah, but above all else, thank you guys for coming.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440
Thank you.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.240
You guys have been a wonderful audience.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.560
Our closer is going to be coming on immediately after we finish the show.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.040
I hope you're as kind to them as you have been to us.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040
Yeah.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040
They're super nervous to get out here.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040
You guys have been so cool.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.040
I'm going to run to the bathroom.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.040
Are you guys ready?

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.400
I mean, are you really going to go?

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400
You better fucking hurry.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400
You don't want to miss a minute.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.920
I'm going to stand up and just like sprint full speed as soon as I read this final Yahoo.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920
But I have to pee too.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920
Nobody go to the bathroom.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920
Seriously, stay.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.920
Stay completely still.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920
Stay seated.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.920
Let Griffin run to the bathroom.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.240
This final Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240
Thank you, Drew.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.240
Thank you, Drew.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240
Woo.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:37.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user baby who asks, any good websites I can meet human sugar daddies?

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.920
Not the candy, but men's sugar daddies.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.920
Got to say, I'm Joe.
