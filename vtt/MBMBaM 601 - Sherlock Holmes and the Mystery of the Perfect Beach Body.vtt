00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

00:17.660 --> 00:30.660
What's up, you cool, baby?

00:48.440 --> 00:50.440
It's better, it's better with you

00:53.980 --> 00:56.060
It's better it's better with you

00:56.060 --> 01:21.060
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:21.060 --> 01:25.060
Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm Travis, the middle-est.

01:25.060 --> 01:27.060
No, I like it.

01:27.060 --> 01:31.060
I like the energy, except for the spin on the name.

01:31.060 --> 01:33.060
Oh, nope.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.060
Oh, that's good stuff.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.060
It's something new, Travis. We're in the 600s now.

01:37.060 --> 01:39.060
I was standing at the sexy sixes.

01:39.060 --> 01:41.060
Oh, the sex hundreds.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.060
The sex hundreds.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.060
The sex hundreds.

01:45.060 --> 01:49.060
We're like 66 episodes away from another episode that we're going to have to skip.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.060
There's no way.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.060
We would get in so much trouble.

01:53.060 --> 01:55.060
We would get in so much trouble with my dad for doing the devil's eyes.

01:55.060 --> 01:57.060
I'm not going to summon El Diablo.

01:57.060 --> 01:59.060
No, thank you.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.060
No, thank you.

02:01.060 --> 02:09.060
We're already tempting fate enough playing Dungeons and Dragons to then mess with that black magic.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.060
Oh my God.

02:11.060 --> 02:15.060
This is like when my D&D character died all over again, just like that Chick track.

02:15.060 --> 02:25.060
If you were to make a biopic of Gary Gygax, do you think you would put in a scene where he's looking at a piece of paper and it says Dungeons or Dragons?

02:25.060 --> 02:29.060
And he's looking at it and he's like, well, hold on a second.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.060
Then he just erases it.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.060
And he showed it.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.060
Should I make a game about Dungeons, question mark?

02:37.060 --> 02:39.060
Dragons, question mark?

02:39.060 --> 02:43.060
And then there was a character like Justin Timberlake in social.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.060
Dungeons ain't cool.

02:45.060 --> 02:47.060
You know what's cool?

02:47.060 --> 02:49.060
Dungeons and Dragons.

02:49.060 --> 02:53.060
But then the haters are like, how are you going to fit a dragon inside of a dungeon, Gary?

02:53.060 --> 02:55.060
It's too small.

02:55.060 --> 02:57.060
It's a small chamber, Gary.

02:57.060 --> 03:03.060
What I'm saying is that I'm going to put the dungeon inside the dragon.

03:03.060 --> 03:05.060
Well, I don't think that's it either, Gary.

03:05.060 --> 03:09.060
And that's my vision for Elden Ring too.

03:09.060 --> 03:11.060
The dungeon's inside the dragon.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.060
Yeah, that's good stuff.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.060
This is an advice show.

03:15.060 --> 03:19.060
I'm standing. I wanted to bring standing energy to this episode.

03:19.060 --> 03:25.060
Sometimes I dig deep, deep down and I stand up.

03:25.060 --> 03:29.060
You summon everything within you.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.060
I channel all my strength and I stand.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.060
I used to do this for hours at Best Buy.

03:33.060 --> 03:37.060
I should be able to do it for an hour while we record this podcast, right?

03:37.060 --> 03:39.060
I'm at work.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.060
I still have the same springy, dewy body that you had in your Best Buy days.

03:45.060 --> 03:47.060
Yeah, that's true. I was fucking so sexy.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.060
I was ripped.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.060
That blue polo.

03:51.060 --> 03:55.060
I was thinking about this this morning, speaking of dewy, sexy bodies.

03:55.060 --> 03:59.060
What do you guys think you're the Ryan Reynolds of?

03:59.060 --> 04:03.060
Because I saw Ryan Reynolds and clearly he's the Ryan Reynolds of movies, right?

04:03.060 --> 04:05.060
Well, and selling cell phones.

04:05.060 --> 04:07.060
Yeah, and owning soccer teams, I believe.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.060
Did he need to sell the cell phones?

04:09.060 --> 04:11.060
No, that's a passion. That's a passion project.

04:11.060 --> 04:15.060
He just loves getting burners in the hands of miscreants.

04:15.060 --> 04:21.060
The gym, the soccer team, the movies, that's his day job, right?

04:21.060 --> 04:25.060
Selling cell phones, that's his passion.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.060
One for him, one for me.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.060
Yeah, he's the Ryan Reynolds of selling cell phones.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.060
The Lord came to him in a dream and said,

04:31.060 --> 04:37.060
Ryan, you must sell cell phones that when people drop them in the toilet, they go, eh, oh well.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.060
I'll get another one.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.060
That's fine.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.060
What am I the Ryan Reynolds of?

04:43.060 --> 04:45.060
Yeah.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.060
I mean, is this about physical appearance?

04:47.060 --> 04:49.060
No, no, no.

04:49.060 --> 04:53.060
If you were saying, well, you know, like Ryan Reynolds from movies?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.060
Well, I'm like the Ryan Reynolds of blank.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.060
You know what I mean?

04:57.060 --> 04:59.060
Can I say movies?

04:59.060 --> 05:01.060
Ryan Reynolds of movies.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.060
Well, I guess if he's going to take Ryan Reynolds of cell phones,

05:03.060 --> 05:05.060
you could be the Ryan Reynolds of movies.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.060
He shouldn't be allowed to take all that stuff.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.060
You, as we realized this week, or as I realized this week,

05:09.060 --> 05:13.060
you did perform in an Oscar-nominated film.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.060
Right.

05:15.060 --> 05:21.060
You're basically an Oscar-nominated film performer for your hidden cameo.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.060
That's true.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.060
It's not really hidden. I mean, I am in the credits of the film.

05:25.060 --> 05:29.060
No, if you want to say hidden, Justin and I have a hidden cameo

05:29.060 --> 05:31.060
where robots took our jobs.

05:31.060 --> 05:37.060
Ironically, in the movie Mitchell's vs. the Machines,

05:37.060 --> 05:39.060
robots took our jobs.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.060
And you know I'm rooting for him in cancer.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.060
You know I want Lenny to get that EGOT.

05:43.060 --> 05:45.060
Obviously.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.060
That would be so huge for him, because you know he's just like,

05:47.060 --> 05:49.060
he's tortured until he gets that O.

05:49.060 --> 05:53.060
But me, like, I could just have an awe.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.060
You know what I mean?

05:55.060 --> 05:57.060
If Mitchell's vs. the Machines wins the Oscar for best animated picture,

05:57.060 --> 05:59.060
I think they do have to send me one,

05:59.060 --> 06:01.060
because I did do a voice in it.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.060
Who knows, that could have been the linchpin

06:03.060 --> 06:05.060
keeping the whole thing together.

06:05.060 --> 06:09.060
They should give out Oscars sized to the contribution.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.060
So Griffin would get a little teeny tiny one,

06:11.060 --> 06:13.060
because he had an off-screen cameo.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.060
Like an earring.

06:15.060 --> 06:17.060
Wow, okay.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.060
I don't know why you had to tear me down for that.

06:19.060 --> 06:21.060
Because we got cut because of robots.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.060
Because robots took our jobs.

06:23.060 --> 06:25.060
It's weird that robot didn't take my job though.

06:25.060 --> 06:27.060
Did we tell that story?

06:27.060 --> 06:29.060
We can probably tell that story now.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.060
Let's preface it by saying,

06:31.060 --> 06:33.060
there is no animosity from us whatsoever.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.060
It sounds like there's a little bit.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.060
It's just such a fucking funny,

06:37.060 --> 06:39.060
no it is towards you,

06:39.060 --> 06:41.060
but so we recorded some voices for Mitchell's vs. the Machines.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.060
This is something that happens, you know,

06:43.060 --> 06:45.060
especially with voiceover stuff.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.060
You don't know if you're actually going to be like,

06:47.060 --> 06:49.060
in it until,

06:49.060 --> 06:51.060
they just swap you out with stuff.

06:51.060 --> 06:53.060
So they wanted us to do voices for these appliances.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.060
And the initial thing that they had wanted to do,

06:55.060 --> 06:59.060
was have like computer generated voices.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.060
That was like AI or whatever,

07:01.060 --> 07:03.060
but I guess the voice technology was trademarked or whatever.

07:03.060 --> 07:05.060
So those were the parts that we were going to do.

07:05.060 --> 07:11.060
And then they managed to clear the AI voices.

07:11.060 --> 07:13.060
So like the artificially generated voices,

07:13.060 --> 07:15.060
they used those quite literally.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.060
Literally.

07:17.060 --> 07:23.060
We were supposed to be immune to jobs taking our machines.

07:23.060 --> 07:25.060
That is exactly what happened to us.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.060
And it's delicious because that is,

07:27.060 --> 07:29.060
if you've seen the film,

07:29.060 --> 07:31.060
pretty much the plot of the thing.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.060
The plot of the thing. We're living it.

07:33.060 --> 07:35.060
You lived it.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.060
McElroy's vs. the Machines.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.060
And the machines win.

07:39.060 --> 07:41.060
But Griffin.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.060
I will cut my Oscar into three pieces

07:43.060 --> 07:45.060
that we can assemble Shrine of the Silver Monkey style.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.060
Yes, I've seen this. This is a Solomon thing.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.060
No, let Griffin keep the Oscar.

07:49.060 --> 07:51.060
Now Griffin, I don't want to put you on the spot,

07:51.060 --> 07:53.060
but do you think you could recreate?

07:53.060 --> 07:55.060
Yeah, sure, sure.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.060
Could you recreate your Oscar nominated line?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.060
Yeah, sure, sure. Here we go.

07:59.060 --> 08:01.060
Today I'll be playing the voice of Freezer.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.060
Freeze!

08:03.060 --> 08:05.060
So there's...

08:05.060 --> 08:07.060
But you did have a line in it.

08:07.060 --> 08:09.060
That's pretty much it.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.060
That's it.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.060
No, you're the guy in the hallway in the dorm.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.060
No, I didn't get that part.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.060
I think you did.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.060
Maybe I did. Who knows?

08:19.060 --> 08:21.060
But all I know is that

08:21.060 --> 08:23.060
I am going to melt the Oscar down

08:23.060 --> 08:25.060
and turn it into money.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.060
That was very fun.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.060
Can I reiterate? There is zero.

08:29.060 --> 08:31.060
Zero anime. It's a great movie

08:31.060 --> 08:33.060
and we are really excited.

08:33.060 --> 08:35.060
Especially from me because I dig it in.

08:35.060 --> 08:37.060
I'm trying to be gracious about this

08:37.060 --> 08:39.060
and Griffin is making it so challenging.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.060
No, no, no. You're being gracious to them

08:41.060 --> 08:43.060
and I'm being super gracious to them

08:43.060 --> 08:45.060
because they kept me.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.060
This is how gracious I am.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.060
They sent out casting crew gifts

08:49.060 --> 08:51.060
and I still have one. I have it on display.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.060
Yeah, I didn't shatter mine with a ball peen hammer.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.060
Definitely.

08:55.060 --> 08:57.060
I have those now.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.060
I do.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.060
Can I jump back to The Wisdom of Solomon real quick?

09:01.060 --> 09:03.060
Just want to touch on it.

09:03.060 --> 09:05.060
Yes!

09:05.060 --> 09:07.060
That's what this country is missing.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.060
Let's all take it back to The Wisdom of Solomon.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.060
Isn't it fucked up?

09:11.060 --> 09:13.060
Solomon's like,

09:13.060 --> 09:15.060
all right, I'm going to cut this baby in half

09:15.060 --> 09:17.060
and then you guys can each have half.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.060
One of the people is like,

09:19.060 --> 09:21.060
sounds good to me.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.060
Do you guys want to make a billion dollars?

09:23.060 --> 09:25.060
Sure.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.060
Listen. Fuck, this is good.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.060
King Solomon's like,

09:29.060 --> 09:31.060
guys, if you're not standing already,

09:31.060 --> 09:33.060
get on my level because it is invigorating.

09:33.060 --> 09:35.060
My mic's just not that high.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.060
Get higher, baby.

09:37.060 --> 09:39.060
I'm looking down to the microphone.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.060
Okay.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.060
King Solomon's like,

09:43.060 --> 09:45.060
well,

09:45.060 --> 09:47.060
if you all can't agree on whose baby it is,

09:47.060 --> 09:49.060
I guess we'll just have to cut it in half.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.060
Then the baby turns around

09:51.060 --> 09:53.060
and is like,

09:53.060 --> 09:55.060
you're going to want to run that by HR.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.060
Boss Baby 3.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.060
Whoa!

09:59.060 --> 10:01.060
Yes!

10:01.060 --> 10:03.060
That's so choice, right?

10:03.060 --> 10:05.060
Yes! Fuck yes!

10:05.060 --> 10:07.060
I love this.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.060
We can have a whole series of this

10:09.060 --> 10:11.060
where it's like,

10:11.060 --> 10:13.060
oh, Pharaoh said to kill all the male babies

10:13.060 --> 10:15.060
and we got to put this baby in a basket

10:15.060 --> 10:17.060
and float him down the river.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.060
The baby turns around like,

10:19.060 --> 10:21.060
excuse me? Boss Baby 3.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.060
It's all biblical.

10:23.060 --> 10:25.060
Listen, don't confine yourself.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.060
Baby's day out.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.060
The baby's rocking around on girders

10:29.060 --> 10:31.060
and there's a monkey trying to eat it.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.060
The baby's about to fall off the girder

10:33.060 --> 10:35.060
and then Boss Baby pops up and he's like,

10:35.060 --> 10:37.060
um,

10:37.060 --> 10:39.060
don't think you're going to file for Workman's comp.

10:39.060 --> 10:41.060
Boss Baby 3.

10:41.060 --> 10:43.060
Boss Baby pops up and says, hey, you're better than this.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.060
You don't have to be a clown for those adults out there watching you.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.060
I liked my bet.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.060
We'll workshop it.

10:49.060 --> 10:51.060
There's plenty of time for this Boss Baby 3 trailer.

10:51.060 --> 10:53.060
A lot of people like to talk about Solomon's Great Wisdom

10:53.060 --> 10:55.060
because he was like,

10:55.060 --> 10:57.060
let's cut a baby in half. JK, you win.

10:57.060 --> 10:59.060
Cut a baby into half.

10:59.060 --> 11:01.060
But I bet you he also had some

11:01.060 --> 11:03.060
thinkers of rulings like, oh, man,

11:03.060 --> 11:05.060
she did, she menstruated

11:05.060 --> 11:07.060
on the Lord's day. Got, she's dead.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.060
Cut her in half.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.060
All of his stuff, they don't try to do

11:11.060 --> 11:13.060
problematic prophylaxis on this biblical character

11:13.060 --> 11:15.060
just assuming there's some wack

11:15.060 --> 11:17.060
shit in Solomon's closet.

11:17.060 --> 11:19.060
Yeah, well, we talk about how it worked

11:19.060 --> 11:21.060
out with the baby, but it's never like, oh, cut the

11:21.060 --> 11:23.060
house in half. Oh, well, let's cut this.

11:23.060 --> 11:25.060
We'll cut that cow and stop trying to

11:25.060 --> 11:27.060
fucking cut stuff in half, Solomon.

11:27.060 --> 11:29.060
How close did he get? Was he like, I'm going to

11:29.060 --> 11:31.060
do it. I'm really going to do it.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.060
Why weren't... He had like a paper

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
cutter that's just like, oh.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.060
I'm going to get him.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.060
I just want both people to be like

11:39.060 --> 11:41.060
doing this bare hands like the power team

11:41.060 --> 11:43.060
and he just, he came up with that ruling

11:43.060 --> 11:45.060
on the spot to save face.

11:45.060 --> 11:47.060
You don't want to actually...

11:47.060 --> 11:49.060
Nevermind. I don't want to tear the baby

11:49.060 --> 11:51.060
in half. You were going to let me do it.

11:51.060 --> 11:53.060
I saw in your face you didn't want me to.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.060
But you definitely were going to let me,

11:55.060 --> 11:57.060
so I'm giving it to her.

11:57.060 --> 11:59.060
What? What are you talking about?

11:59.060 --> 12:01.060
You tried to karate chop the baby.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.060
We both said stop.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.060
No, I can see she didn't mean it.

12:05.060 --> 12:07.060
When she said stop, she was totally cool

12:07.060 --> 12:09.060
with me karate chopping this baby in half.

12:09.060 --> 12:13.060
What a dumb way of fixing the problem.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.060
I'm going to cut the baby in half.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.060
You're going to wait.

12:17.060 --> 12:19.060
We both know that baby won't keep

12:19.060 --> 12:21.060
working. Half a baby won't turn

12:21.060 --> 12:23.060
into a whole baby.

12:23.060 --> 12:25.060
He had to lean over to like the king's hand

12:25.060 --> 12:27.060
and be like, check this out.

12:27.060 --> 12:29.060
I'm going to go jazz on this one.

12:29.060 --> 12:31.060
I'm going to get a little loose.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.060
Just follow my lead.

12:33.060 --> 12:35.060
I bet you ten...

12:35.060 --> 12:37.060
Follow me in the key of G, my man.

12:39.060 --> 12:41.060
I bet you ten ducats this works.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.060
Ten bags of salt.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.060
Follow me on this one, man.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.060
But be ready to pull the record and laugh

12:49.060 --> 12:51.060
like it was a joke if they don't buy it.

12:51.060 --> 12:53.060
I'm the king. You got to do it.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.060
It is time for a fight.

12:59.060 --> 13:01.060
I've lost my monitor signal.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.060
One moment, please. Bear with.

13:03.060 --> 13:05.060
While Justin gets his monitor back in,

13:05.060 --> 13:07.060
I was thinking maybe we could raise

13:07.060 --> 13:09.060
the level of sophistication

13:09.060 --> 13:11.060
here on the show a little bit.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.060
There was a little ribaldry in there.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.060
King Solomon. It's very blue.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.060
I think it's time that we

13:17.060 --> 13:19.060
maybe take some time to appreciate.

13:19.060 --> 13:21.060
It's a work of fart.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.060
We know what it is it's going to be.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.060
We know your bits. We know what this is going to be.

13:25.060 --> 13:27.060
I know, but there's a lead-in to it, Griffin.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.060
Yeah, you got to let him work his magic.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.060
There's art to it, man.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.060
Sure. There's fart to it.

13:33.060 --> 13:35.060
Now, Griffin has shown...

13:35.060 --> 13:37.060
Fuck.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.060
What's wrong, Juice?

13:39.060 --> 13:41.060
No, he just burped and said fuck at the same time.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.060
It's hard standing up because

13:43.060 --> 13:45.060
my cords are not wanting to cooperate.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.060
Yeah, I had a real situation

13:47.060 --> 13:49.060
that I had to untangle while recording,

13:49.060 --> 13:51.060
but I'm fully dialed into your bit now, Travis,

13:51.060 --> 13:53.060
and I want you to start it.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.060
Now, Griffin, can you

13:55.060 --> 13:57.060
please fill the list, Marion?

13:57.060 --> 13:59.060
I don't want to do that for you.

13:59.060 --> 14:01.060
I'll do it. Here's how it works.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.060
Travis is going to come up with a

14:03.060 --> 14:05.060
a punny

14:05.060 --> 14:07.060
a punny name

14:07.060 --> 14:09.060
for a work of art that makes it

14:09.060 --> 14:11.060
ribald or blue.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.060
He's not going to say what it is.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.060
He's going to make us say it because

14:15.060 --> 14:17.060
that makes us complicit.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.060
He's going to come up with a punny name

14:19.060 --> 14:21.060
with a clue

14:21.060 --> 14:23.060
and then that we're complicit in the thing

14:23.060 --> 14:25.060
because we're actually the ones coming up with it.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.060
And this time, I'm going to change something slightly.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.060
You got to buzz in.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.060
You got to buzz in this time.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.060
Oh, interesting.

14:33.060 --> 14:35.060
And how do we do that?

14:35.060 --> 14:37.060
You can say whatever you want to.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.060
You don't have to say buzz, Griffin.

14:39.060 --> 14:41.060
The world's your oyster.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.060
A scientist resurrects a dead masturbator.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.060
But who's really the monster?

14:45.060 --> 14:47.060
Buzz, buzz.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.060
I heard Griffin's buzz first, but Justin's buzz most.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.060
Griffin?

14:51.060 --> 14:53.060
I'm going to say Wankenstein.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.060
That is correct. Wankenstein.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.060
Wow. Wow. Huge.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.060
It was either going to be that or Frankenstein.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.060
Not the most outside of the box one, if I'm being honest.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.060
Okay.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.060
That's the reason it was first.

15:05.060 --> 15:07.060
Check out the balls on this guy.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.060
He's tilting at windmills.

15:09.060 --> 15:11.060
Oh, I got it.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.060
Dang buzz.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.060
Is that Dong Quixote?

15:15.060 --> 15:17.060
No, I'm sorry. Justin?

15:17.060 --> 15:19.060
Wow.

15:19.060 --> 15:21.060
Say it one more time, please.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.060
Check out the balls on this guy.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.060
He's tilting at windmills.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.060
Yes, Justin?

15:27.060 --> 15:29.060
Dong Quixote?

15:29.060 --> 15:31.060
There it is. Yes.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.060
Oh, stop it.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.060
Well done. Okay, it's one and one.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.060
One and one.

15:37.060 --> 15:39.060
A famous detective is on the case

15:39.060 --> 15:41.060
when a man on a train shits himself to death.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.060
Huh.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.060
Say it one more time.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.060
A famous detective is on the case

15:47.060 --> 15:49.060
when a man on a train

15:49.060 --> 15:51.060
shits himself to death.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.060
A piece of that tip just got me, Odell.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.060
Yes, Justin?

15:55.060 --> 15:57.060
Is it Sharder on the Orient Express?

15:57.060 --> 15:59.060
Oh, no. So close.

15:59.060 --> 16:01.060
Is it Squirter on the more Orient Express?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.060
No, no. You're both wrong.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.060
It's Turter on the Orient Express.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.060
No, no, no.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.060
That's a weakness with the question.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.060
Okay, but Sharder doesn't rhyme with murder.

16:11.060 --> 16:13.060
Squirter does.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.060
And Squirter doesn't necessarily

16:15.060 --> 16:17.060
refer to proof.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.060
I don't want to get...

16:19.060 --> 16:21.060
I don't...

16:21.060 --> 16:23.060
Just go on.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.060
It makes me mad.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.060
Okay, it's one and one.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.060
It's like the concept of it is already so fucking rotten

16:29.060 --> 16:31.060
that when the execution is off,

16:31.060 --> 16:33.060
it's like, why are we...

16:33.060 --> 16:35.060
No. Hey, no.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.060
Just because you got the question wrong, Griffin,

16:37.060 --> 16:39.060
don't shit around on me.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.060
Don't make this like it's Travis's problem.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.060
Yeah, you said dong kihoti

16:43.060 --> 16:45.060
when I clearly said balls in the clue.

16:45.060 --> 16:47.060
You're right. And as we all know,

16:47.060 --> 16:49.060
dong refers pretty much mostly

16:49.060 --> 16:51.060
to the shaft.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.060
I have a diagram prepared.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.060
Look over here, guys.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.060
So just because you got it wrong, Griffin,

16:57.060 --> 16:59.060
doesn't mean the game's broken.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.060
I will say if someone's old balls popped out of their pants,

17:01.060 --> 17:03.060
you wouldn't point at the old balls and be like,

17:03.060 --> 17:05.060
look at that dong.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.060
This is referring to, you know,

17:07.060 --> 17:09.060
at the most sort of liberal interpretation,

17:09.060 --> 17:11.060
the whole kit.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.060
Right? And the caboodle.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.060
Maybe. Maybe.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.060
Okay. Next.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.060
Next bit.

17:19.060 --> 17:21.060
Next. Oh, are you done?

17:21.060 --> 17:23.060
Oh, next bit. I thought Travis had another one.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.060
No, I only did three.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.060
Somebody is going around my apartment complex

17:27.060 --> 17:29.060
and stealing all the catalytic converters.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.060
How do I protect mine?

17:31.060 --> 17:33.060
That's from catalytic chaos in Kentucky.

17:33.060 --> 17:35.060
Do you want to go ahead and do your

17:35.060 --> 17:37.060
usual thing, Juice?

17:37.060 --> 17:39.060
Just the thing you usually say

17:39.060 --> 17:41.060
that helps these kinds of situations.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.060
Well, okay, yes.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.060
Yes. Well,

17:45.060 --> 17:47.060
I don't know. In this case.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.060
I don't know if putting jelly on it is going to be a good fix.

17:49.060 --> 17:51.060
It may catalyze the jelly.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.060
This is the concern.

17:53.060 --> 17:55.060
They get extremely hot, the catalytic converters.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.060
Yeah. Could you glue it in?

17:57.060 --> 17:59.060
Is that a problem?

17:59.060 --> 18:01.060
Yeah, what's keeping it in there anyway?

18:01.060 --> 18:03.060
It seems like it's not really in there good.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.060
I will say, I've owned

18:05.060 --> 18:07.060
a car or two in my day.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.060
It's easy to take stuff out of there.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.060
It's a lot harder to put it back in, I've found.

18:11.060 --> 18:13.060
Because sometimes they'll take something out and then be like,

18:13.060 --> 18:15.060
well, where the fuck does that even go?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.060
Because frankly, a lot of it is all kind of the same color.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.060
I've also noticed that.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.060
And so, like, if we could color

18:21.060 --> 18:23.060
code more of that stuff, that would be great.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.060
That would make it easier for thieves, for sure.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.060
You're not helping. You're making it harder.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.060
No. Oh, but then you paint your catalytic

18:29.060 --> 18:31.060
converter a different color.

18:31.060 --> 18:33.060
It'll burn the paint. Fuck!

18:33.060 --> 18:35.060
They get so fucking hot, dude.

18:35.060 --> 18:37.060
And this, can I say about this problem?

18:37.060 --> 18:39.060
We actually need to solve it

18:39.060 --> 18:41.060
pretty quickly, because this problem

18:41.060 --> 18:43.060
is only going to get worse.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.060
With the catalytic converter

18:45.060 --> 18:47.060
issue, with everything going on,

18:47.060 --> 18:49.060
this is just getting worse. So we need a solution.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.060
When the robots come around, they love eating it so much.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.060
No, it's because the catalytic converters

18:53.060 --> 18:55.060
got palladium, it's one of the precious metals

18:55.060 --> 18:57.060
that it uses.

18:57.060 --> 18:59.060
It's the favorite food of robots.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.060
Robots eat palladium and it gets stronger.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.060
I think so, too. I think robots

19:03.060 --> 19:05.060
do eat palladium and it gets stronger.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.060
If you put jelly on it, jelly will fucking burn

19:07.060 --> 19:09.060
right off. Nothing's fixed.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.060
Bait car. Bait car, Travis.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.060
Let me tell you. Bait car.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.060
This catalytic converter, it's rigged to blow.

19:15.060 --> 19:17.060
Not for, well, that's, now we're talking

19:17.060 --> 19:19.060
about killing people because they steal

19:19.060 --> 19:21.060
the car part for money. How many catalytic

19:21.060 --> 19:23.060
converters? Let me ask you guys. I just want to

19:23.060 --> 19:25.060
just say a number. Don't think about it.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.060
How many catalytic converters would someone

19:27.060 --> 19:29.060
have to steal before

19:29.060 --> 19:31.060
exploding them with a bait car would be

19:31.060 --> 19:33.060
the appropriate proportional response?

19:33.060 --> 19:35.060
None. Travis, you're asking

19:35.060 --> 19:37.060
at what point is

19:37.060 --> 19:39.060
murder okay for that? No, no, no. That's

19:39.060 --> 19:41.060
not what I said. I said blowing them up.

19:41.060 --> 19:43.060
It sounds like what you're saying is that

19:43.060 --> 19:45.060
exclusively.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.060
Blowing up doesn't have to be murder.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.060
It can just pop in their face. Maybe an ink.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.060
It can be like the guy who makes the bait

19:51.060 --> 19:53.060
Amazon packages that people

19:53.060 --> 19:55.060
steal and then it farts and

19:55.060 --> 19:57.060
you hear fucking Bill

19:57.060 --> 19:59.060
Ingvall come out of a speaker like,

19:59.060 --> 20:01.060
here's your sign, and you're like,

20:01.060 --> 20:03.060
yeah, get those fucking people.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.060
Get those thieves. Yeah, maybe like a

20:05.060 --> 20:07.060
permanent ink situation.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.060
Oh, you removed the catalytic converter.

20:09.060 --> 20:11.060
I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, you do.

20:11.060 --> 20:13.060
Purple face. I don't enjoy

20:13.060 --> 20:15.060
I guess

20:15.060 --> 20:17.060
like capital punishment, which is

20:17.060 --> 20:19.060
what you seem to be a huge

20:19.060 --> 20:21.060
fan of. I'm talking about spraying them with

20:21.060 --> 20:23.060
ink, Griffin. Though that is

20:23.060 --> 20:25.060
I don't know if it's cruel, but it is unusual.

20:25.060 --> 20:27.060
I don't think it's cruel or unusual

20:27.060 --> 20:29.060
punishment though. So

20:29.060 --> 20:31.060
I would say that you know how

20:31.060 --> 20:33.060
like the like really

20:33.060 --> 20:35.060
fancy stock cars or whatever

20:35.060 --> 20:37.060
like there's people who will just like

20:37.060 --> 20:39.060
pop the steering wheel out and they can take the

20:39.060 --> 20:41.060
steering wheel. What if you just could do that with

20:41.060 --> 20:43.060
your catalytic converter? Like

20:43.060 --> 20:45.060
you just slide on under there and you like

20:45.060 --> 20:47.060
push in on it really hard and

20:47.060 --> 20:49.060
it pops and it pops out and you can take it

20:49.060 --> 20:51.060
with you to work. What about one of those

20:51.060 --> 20:53.060
you know in like the 90s where they had those

20:53.060 --> 20:55.060
like diaries where

20:55.060 --> 20:57.060
you had to like voice activate it for

20:57.060 --> 20:59.060
kids so that your sneaky little brother

20:59.060 --> 21:01.060
couldn't get in there and you had to be like

21:01.060 --> 21:03.060
dreamboat in order to like open the thing

21:03.060 --> 21:05.060
maybe you put a voice activated lock.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.060
I have no idea what, I have no idea what you're talking about.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.060
You don't remember that? That was like a

21:09.060 --> 21:11.060
voice activated diary? It wasn't a

21:11.060 --> 21:13.060
voice activated diary, it had a lock on it.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.060
It had a voice activated lock on it. Yes,

21:15.060 --> 21:17.060
that's true, yes. And you would say like

21:17.060 --> 21:19.060
you would say the code word so your sneaky little

21:19.060 --> 21:21.060
brother, that creep, couldn't get in there

21:21.060 --> 21:23.060
and read as you were writing about all the people you had crushes on.

21:23.060 --> 21:25.060
You know,

21:25.060 --> 21:27.060
put that on your card. I bet I could have cracked

21:27.060 --> 21:29.060
your fucking code Trav easy. It was

21:29.060 --> 21:31.060
DuckTales. I just walked up to it

21:31.060 --> 21:33.060
and just been like,

21:33.060 --> 21:35.060
Xanth, Xena, and then it would have just popped

21:35.060 --> 21:37.060
right up and revealed all your fucking secrets to me.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.060
It was actually Xena, then Xanth.

21:39.060 --> 21:41.060
Oh, I apologize. Yeah, thank you.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.060
Juicy okay.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.060
Justin, are you reading about what

21:45.060 --> 21:47.060
catalytic converters do?

21:47.060 --> 21:49.060
No, I know what they do. Now?

21:49.060 --> 21:51.060
No, I knew before that. Oh, did you?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.060
I was talking about it before the pause,

21:53.060 --> 21:55.060
Travis. Uh-huh, because you looked it up.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.060
Review the tape. Because you looked it up.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.060
No, I know because...

21:59.060 --> 22:01.060
Okay, doesn't matter. That's not funny

22:01.060 --> 22:03.060
for me to talk about that I know this.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.060
It's not funny. You can get a lock

22:05.060 --> 22:07.060
for them. There, if you don't want to be

22:07.060 --> 22:09.060
funny, Travis, there. You can get a lock

22:09.060 --> 22:11.060
for it. Oh, I thought you said

22:11.060 --> 22:13.060
you could get a lot for them and we were going to talk

22:13.060 --> 22:15.060
about the price. No, you can't get a lock

22:15.060 --> 22:17.060
for it, actually. How much do you think...

22:17.060 --> 22:19.060
Wait, okay, listen. How much do you think you could

22:19.060 --> 22:21.060
give for a catalytic converter?

22:21.060 --> 22:23.060
I know that it costs like two Gs to replace it.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.060
Oh, yeah, really? It's probably less than that.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.060
So I could probably get like a thousand...

22:27.060 --> 22:29.060
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.060
Hey. Yeah? Hold on a second.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.060
What if you stole your own catalytic converter?

22:33.060 --> 22:35.060
Oh, they'd never see that coming.

22:35.060 --> 22:37.060
Then the thief comes along and like, well, fuck.

22:37.060 --> 22:39.060
Somebody already hit this one.

22:39.060 --> 22:41.060
Listen, it's not a good for your environment,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.060
but one car

22:43.060 --> 22:45.060
cruising around, putting that bad

22:45.060 --> 22:47.060
air gravy

22:47.060 --> 22:49.060
out and it's not being purified

22:49.060 --> 22:51.060
by the catalytic

22:51.060 --> 22:53.060
converter. It's not that bad.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.060
Just do it. It's just one.

22:55.060 --> 22:57.060
It's just one. It's like a drop in the bucket.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.060
Do you know what that is? Like cranking out that fog gravy

22:59.060 --> 23:01.060
constantly. Yeah, that bad gravy.

23:01.060 --> 23:03.060
Just do what that kid in my dorm floor did

23:03.060 --> 23:05.060
whenever he wanted to smoke weed.

23:05.060 --> 23:07.060
Just put a

23:07.060 --> 23:09.060
dryer sheet over your tailpipe.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.060
It'll basically do the same thing.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.060
It's going to blow some clean

23:13.060 --> 23:15.060
cool, clean linen smell through there.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.060
You're going to be fine. I had a friend who called that a

23:17.060 --> 23:19.060
wookie tube. I don't know if that was something other people

23:19.060 --> 23:21.060
call it, but you would take a paper, like a paper

23:21.060 --> 23:23.060
towel roll, like the cardboard

23:23.060 --> 23:25.060
part of it, and you would stuff it with dryer sheets

23:25.060 --> 23:27.060
and then you would rip the bong

23:27.060 --> 23:29.060
and then you would put your mouth on that tube and

23:29.060 --> 23:31.060
you would breathe out into it. And maybe

23:31.060 --> 23:33.060
it's just because he did call it a wookie tube, but we would

23:33.060 --> 23:35.060
of course, like when we breathed out, just be like

23:35.060 --> 23:37.060
vvvrtttttt.

23:37.060 --> 23:39.060
And we would laugh

23:39.060 --> 23:41.060
and laugh and laugh. Because it was funny!

23:41.060 --> 23:43.060
Okay because it was funny and it was a

23:43.060 --> 23:45.060
different time so I'm wondering if you could do that

23:45.060 --> 23:47.060
into a catalytic converter, what would come out the other

23:47.060 --> 23:49.060
side of it. Oh great question, yeah

23:49.060 --> 23:51.060
yeah yeah. Maybe that's it, maybe there's somebody

23:51.060 --> 23:53.060
stealing your catalytic converter so they can blow their weed

23:53.060 --> 23:55.060
smoke through it without getting caught.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.060
That's, yeah. Can you think about that? Maybe they need it more than you.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.060
Thank you,

23:59.060 --> 24:01.060
yes! Here's another question.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.060
I recently received a very nice

24:03.060 --> 24:05.300
handwritten card from my grandma.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.300
I actually received a very nice handwritten card

24:09.300 --> 24:11.860
from their grandma, too, so there, that's nice.

24:11.860 --> 24:12.700
Oh, thanks.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.540
Your grandma loves us, too.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.140
Thanks for the good time.

24:18.460 --> 24:22.060
We went and saw Death on the Nile together.

24:22.060 --> 24:22.900
We had a great time.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.540
Don't tease me, I'd love to get out there for that.

24:24.540 --> 24:25.900
Oh yeah, me too.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.740
She said she was going through some old family pictures

24:28.740 --> 24:30.860
and sending them, did I mention the baby pictures

24:30.860 --> 24:32.860
or did you guys start doing your bits before I said that?

24:32.860 --> 24:34.180
I don't know.

24:34.180 --> 24:36.100
There were baby pictures inside the card.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.880
She said she was going through some old family pictures

24:37.880 --> 24:40.500
and sending them to the families of who was in the picture,

24:40.500 --> 24:42.620
meaning I should have received old pictures of myself.

24:42.620 --> 24:45.620
However, these pictures aren't of me.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.300
I asked my mom, she has no idea

24:47.300 --> 24:48.900
who is actually in those pictures,

24:48.900 --> 24:50.500
but it sure isn't me.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.140
Brothers, what do I do with these pictures?

24:53.140 --> 24:55.300
Do I send them back to her and correct her?

24:55.300 --> 24:56.140
Yeah.

24:56.140 --> 24:57.220
Yeah, that'd be good.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.060
Oh, wrong!

24:58.060 --> 25:00.660
You knew it wasn't that one, right?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.500
Just fucking kicking the door out of your house

25:02.500 --> 25:03.740
and just rubbing her face.

25:03.740 --> 25:04.580
Wrong!

25:04.580 --> 25:05.420
Wrong!

25:05.420 --> 25:06.820
You think it's me?

25:06.820 --> 25:07.660
Hey, Dweeb.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.460
You blew it!

25:10.460 --> 25:11.300
Blew it, Dweeb.

25:11.300 --> 25:14.220
You're wrong, now eat them, eat the pictures, grandma!

25:14.220 --> 25:15.060
Wrong!

25:17.220 --> 25:18.540
Do I send them back?

25:18.540 --> 25:19.940
Obviously not.

25:19.940 --> 25:22.180
Or just, should I just try to track down

25:22.180 --> 25:24.620
who is in these pictures or is it a lost cause?

25:24.620 --> 25:27.180
I mean, there's no reason,

25:27.180 --> 25:31.980
why are these pictures chained to their physical form?

25:31.980 --> 25:33.820
It's time to set them free.

25:33.820 --> 25:37.220
Get them up on the internet, just be like,

25:37.220 --> 25:39.980
don't put them on Facebook though, that'll be too easy.

25:39.980 --> 25:42.820
You need to put them on ancestry.com or something,

25:42.820 --> 25:45.180
just be like, hey, got some new pics?

25:45.180 --> 25:46.020
New pics of this.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.060
What do you think ancestry.com does?

25:48.060 --> 25:50.860
Because they definitely don't have-

25:50.860 --> 25:53.220
You know how they cross-reference

25:53.220 --> 25:55.220
facial recognition, baby photos.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.020
No, I'm saying you put them up on the family tree,

25:58.020 --> 26:00.580
but just put them on the miscellaneous branch

26:00.580 --> 26:02.940
and let people come and claim them.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.900
Well, it's like a little squirrel on the family tree

26:04.900 --> 26:07.100
is this weird baby.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.820
More like a nut.

26:08.820 --> 26:09.660
What?

26:09.660 --> 26:11.660
More like a nut.

26:11.660 --> 26:12.500
Yeah.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.260
Hey, my family tree's got a few nuts on it.

26:16.340 --> 26:17.180
Yeah.

26:19.580 --> 26:20.740
Like testicles?

26:21.780 --> 26:23.180
I was listening for,

26:23.180 --> 26:24.940
I've been listening to encyclopedia brown books

26:24.940 --> 26:27.140
with Charlie when we go to school,

26:27.140 --> 26:29.700
Wake Up Her Mind to Mystery,

26:29.700 --> 26:32.340
and the burns in that book that Bugs Me does

26:32.340 --> 26:36.620
are so fucking wretched that I cannot even process

26:36.620 --> 26:38.100
how bad this is.

26:38.100 --> 26:39.940
Like the one we listened to this morning,

26:39.940 --> 26:42.060
Bugs and Encyclopedia Browns-

26:42.060 --> 26:42.900
What Bugs do?

26:42.900 --> 26:43.900
What Bugs do?

26:43.900 --> 26:44.740
Listen, shut up.

26:44.740 --> 26:45.580
Okay, I'm trying to.

26:45.580 --> 26:48.580
Bugs is like, if Encyclopedia Brown's like,

26:48.580 --> 26:52.100
hey, Gundam, I know you ate this kid's cherries,

26:52.100 --> 26:55.260
and I give them back or give them some money for them,

26:55.260 --> 26:57.300
and Bugs is like, huh,

26:57.300 --> 27:00.580
you better stay away from a candy factory

27:00.580 --> 27:03.220
because they're looking for nuts like you.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.060
It's like Bugs.

27:04.060 --> 27:05.380
Fucking killed it.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.220
Dude, hey, Bugs.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.060
Bugs, dude, we don't say shit like that in VR.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.740
Hey, pick up your face, Encyclopedia.

27:10.740 --> 27:12.020
He just melted it right off.

27:12.020 --> 27:13.540
Stick to punching.

27:13.540 --> 27:14.660
Yeah, stick to punching

27:14.660 --> 27:16.940
because you could really hurt somebody's feelings by-

27:16.940 --> 27:17.780
I mean, fuck it.

27:17.780 --> 27:20.780
Encyclopedia Brown is so lucky that Sally's around.

27:20.780 --> 27:21.980
Yeah, to defend.

27:21.980 --> 27:24.060
Because fucking Bugs would just murder him.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.820
Walk all over him, yeah.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.260
I came up with a great idea to do

27:27.260 --> 27:28.540
an adult Encyclopedia Brown,

27:28.540 --> 27:30.380
and then I realized that John Hodgman and Dave Reese

27:30.380 --> 27:32.100
did that with their hit series, Dicktown, on Hulu.

27:32.100 --> 27:35.740
Well, also the Adam Brody movie, Boy, Detective.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.020
And also Brick, if you think about it.

27:38.020 --> 27:41.100
Yeah, and Sherlock Holmes.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.020
Did you guys know that House

27:43.020 --> 27:45.500
is an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes?

27:45.500 --> 27:46.460
Fuck, man.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.900
Thank you, let's talk about it.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.580
Because we don't have detectives anymore.

27:50.580 --> 27:54.860
And that dude from Dead Poets Society is his Watson?

27:54.860 --> 27:56.980
I'm gonna, can I do something else for you guys?

27:56.980 --> 28:00.460
I want to be straight up with you guys.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.500
Fully, fully honest transparency.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.340
Just listen.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.660
Listen to Griffin, he's about to admit

28:04.660 --> 28:05.500
he's never watched House.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.660
Fully transparent.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.140
No, it's not that I haven't watched it.

28:08.140 --> 28:10.700
It's that I really have, I have so,

28:10.700 --> 28:12.060
I don't have any interest

28:12.060 --> 28:13.980
in talking about this kind of subject.

28:13.980 --> 28:18.180
And I was wondering if I could be excused.

28:18.180 --> 28:19.740
If you guys are about to go on a run

28:19.740 --> 28:21.860
and sometimes I feel that energy building,

28:21.860 --> 28:22.940
I was wondering if I could be,

28:22.940 --> 28:24.540
may I please be excused from the podcast?

28:24.540 --> 28:26.420
Everyone gets one.

28:26.420 --> 28:27.980
You want to use yours now, Griffin?

28:27.980 --> 28:31.620
We should get a monthly get out a bit free card.

28:32.660 --> 28:33.900
You guys were about to talk about

28:33.900 --> 28:37.260
how House is like Sherlock Holmes.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.060
And I'm like, where's the fucking door?

28:39.060 --> 28:40.940
House is not like Sherlock Holmes.

28:40.940 --> 28:44.660
House is an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes.

28:44.660 --> 28:45.940
I felt my bladder go,

28:45.940 --> 28:47.580
well, you just peed right before recording,

28:47.580 --> 28:51.660
but maybe you could use me to get away from here.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.620
Use me, Griffin, to get away from here.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.300
Oh, it's Wilson instead of Watson.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.300
Yeah.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.140
Oh, that's how they get, that's how they trick people.

28:59.140 --> 29:01.700
That's how they get around the non-existent.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.660
They don't like that.

29:02.660 --> 29:04.420
The Sherlock Holmes estate.

29:05.780 --> 29:07.900
The estate of Sherlock Holmes.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.300
Hi, I'm Doug Holmes.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.300
I'm Doug Holmes.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.980
And I heard that you were making a thing

29:11.980 --> 29:13.860
about my great-great-granddaddy.

29:13.860 --> 29:14.700
Gotta call it up.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.300
Your character himself is entered into the public domain,

29:16.300 --> 29:18.380
but many of the stories and elements from those stories

29:18.380 --> 29:19.220
are protected.

29:19.220 --> 29:21.020
Oh, I see.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.540
But they're intense about it.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.820
They're like, don't make Sherlock nice.

29:25.820 --> 29:27.380
He's a weird dick.

29:27.380 --> 29:29.140
You gotta make him a butthole.

29:29.140 --> 29:32.820
No, again, the character is in the public domain,

29:32.820 --> 29:35.180
so it could be like Sherlock Holmes

29:35.180 --> 29:37.540
in the mystery of the perfect beach body,

29:37.540 --> 29:38.700
and it's a different version.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.020
Like, there's no rules there.

29:40.020 --> 29:42.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, really?

29:42.020 --> 29:43.900
We could do like, my brother and my brother and me

29:43.900 --> 29:46.820
presents Sherlock Holmes Day about town,

29:46.820 --> 29:49.860
and it's just like Baby's Day out, but Sherlock Holmes?

29:49.860 --> 29:54.100
Well, in Taz, we absolutely did a Sherlock Holmes episode.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.100
We called it that, remember?

29:55.100 --> 29:56.820
Oh, yeah.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.940
Yeah.

29:57.940 --> 30:01.140
Everything old is new again, as they say.

30:01.140 --> 30:02.860
You guys wanna get paid?

30:02.860 --> 30:03.700
Yeah, let's go.

30:03.700 --> 30:04.540
I guess.

30:04.540 --> 30:05.380
Follow me.

30:05.380 --> 30:06.420
Where are we going?

30:06.420 --> 30:07.420
To the money zone.

30:07.420 --> 30:10.100
Oh, it kinda felt like I was setting it up,

30:10.100 --> 30:11.980
and then you kinda stepped in front of me.

30:11.980 --> 30:14.580
I thought you were setting me up to...

30:14.580 --> 30:16.140
Let's go together.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.660
Okay, take my hand.

30:17.660 --> 30:20.900
Oh, wow, there's three sets of footprints on the beach.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.660
It's better, it's better with you.

30:29.540 --> 30:33.460
Squarespace, what more needs to be said?

30:33.460 --> 30:34.900
Nothing, next ad.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.700
Well, there is copy, we do need to say...

30:37.700 --> 30:39.540
I've been using Squarespace.

30:39.540 --> 30:40.780
Okay. What for?

30:40.780 --> 30:45.780
For Sydney's campaign website, McElroy4WV.com.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.460
If you go there, you can see a Squarespace website

30:48.460 --> 30:51.180
that I built with the help of my friend Michael.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.940
He helped me sort of get it set up,

30:53.940 --> 30:55.740
and then I'm doing updates.

30:55.740 --> 30:58.620
It's so easy to make big changes, little changes.

30:58.620 --> 31:01.380
Just like big changes in the government.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.220
Wow.

31:02.220 --> 31:03.740
Thank you, that's beautiful, Travis.

31:03.740 --> 31:04.780
That's really good, Travis.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.620
You know, it's not just...

31:05.620 --> 31:07.180
You can use that too, Juice.

31:07.180 --> 31:08.020
Yeah.

31:08.020 --> 31:08.900
It's not just political campaigns.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.780
Do you wanna use that of like Sydney McElroy

31:10.780 --> 31:14.420
will do for government what I do on a Squarespace website?

31:14.420 --> 31:16.660
No, I don't think I'll use it,

31:16.660 --> 31:19.140
but I will use customizable galleries

31:19.140 --> 31:23.540
to display images and videos in unique ways.

31:23.540 --> 31:28.180
I'll use it to sell products on an online store.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.020
And every Squarespace website-

31:29.020 --> 31:29.860
What are you selling?

31:29.860 --> 31:30.700
What are you selling?

31:30.700 --> 31:32.420
What are you selling?

31:32.420 --> 31:33.260
T-shirts.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.820
Look at this, I've got all the size,

31:37.820 --> 31:40.060
but I'm running out of larges.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.580
It's a very popular size.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.660
They're made to order on things.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.660
You'll get it in three weeks.

31:46.660 --> 31:50.140
They're so soft, I'm wearing one now and you had no idea.

31:50.140 --> 31:53.780
Assuming there's not supply chain issues.

31:53.780 --> 31:54.940
I'm saying it's really easy to do.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.620
You don't need to know internet at all.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.620
You just like, just go for it.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.500
Let your heart go free.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.140
Even if you don't have like a design background,

32:02.140 --> 32:04.460
the elements that they have that you can pull in

32:04.460 --> 32:07.220
are like already sort of designed and look good together.

32:07.220 --> 32:10.020
It's really fun and easy to use.

32:10.020 --> 32:13.820

32:20.300 --> 32:22.780
Griffin, what's on your feet right now?

32:22.780 --> 32:24.940
List off everything.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.980
Just lots of open source.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.540
Oh boy, close those up.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.100
Bunch of, yeah, okay, travel.

32:32.100 --> 32:32.940
Let me just close them up

32:32.940 --> 32:36.100
because I'm Wolverine with a mutant healing factor.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.140
Okay, are you done?

32:37.140 --> 32:40.020
Yeah, I actually, I feel much better now.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.660
Thanks for giving me that time that I needed

32:41.660 --> 32:43.020
to fix my shit.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.740
Well, Griffin, maybe you wouldn't have so many open source

32:45.740 --> 32:47.900
on your feet if you would put on some Bombas socks.

32:47.900 --> 32:51.300
You see Griffin, Bombas' mission is simple, Griffin.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.060
Make the most comfortable clothes ever, Griffin,

32:54.060 --> 32:57.540
and match every item sold with an equal item donated.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.020
So Griffin, when you buy Bombas,

33:00.020 --> 33:03.580
you are also giving to someone in need.

33:03.580 --> 33:06.740
Because Griffin, everything they make is soft, Griffin,

33:06.740 --> 33:09.020
seamless, Griffin, and tagless, Griffin.

33:09.020 --> 33:12.900
And it has a luxury, Griffin, cozy feel.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.540
I do like Bombas socks though, for real.

33:14.540 --> 33:16.700
I feel like sometimes we have too much fun with the ads

33:16.700 --> 33:19.020
and people don't realize that.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.260
I actually, I do like these socks quite a bit.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.980
They're very comfortable.

33:22.980 --> 33:25.620
Yeah, sometimes people miss that it's a joke

33:25.620 --> 33:28.420
that Griffin didn't wear socks so much

33:28.420 --> 33:30.060
that he got open source on his feet.

33:30.060 --> 33:32.860
I do wear socks because I gotta have my Bombas.

33:32.860 --> 33:34.940
That's what I say, that's what I like to say.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.340
Gotta have my Bombas.

33:36.340 --> 33:39.700
Rachel actually contacted us and said that you say that

33:39.700 --> 33:41.260
at inappropriate times.

33:42.180 --> 33:44.260
She asked us to talk to you about it.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.180
Like the kids wake up in the middle of the night

33:46.180 --> 33:47.180
and they're like, Daddy, I'm so scared.

33:47.180 --> 33:48.940
And I'm like, gotta have my Bombas.

33:48.940 --> 33:52.540
Yeah, she said that there was a parent teacher conference

33:52.540 --> 33:54.820
where the teacher said like, any questions?

33:54.820 --> 33:57.180
And you just yelled, gotta have my Bombas,

33:57.180 --> 33:58.900
and then hung up the phone.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.020
Yeah, I did do that.

34:01.020 --> 34:02.900
Well, I understand why.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.060
Because they're made from super soft materials

34:05.060 --> 34:09.700
like merino wool, pima cotton, and even cashmere,

34:09.700 --> 34:11.940
which makes them the perfect cozy layers.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.580
Duh-nuh-nuh.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.780
And- Wait, what did you guys sing?

34:15.780 --> 34:18.060
No, Justin got me the immigrant song.

34:18.060 --> 34:19.940
Yeah, you guys did definitely do immigrant song.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.420
But it was just Justin did it first.

34:21.420 --> 34:25.820
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

34:25.820 --> 34:26.660
Come with me.

34:26.660 --> 34:30.780
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

34:30.780 --> 34:33.100
Thank you Godzilla soundtrack and puffy that.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.180
Come with me.

34:34.180 --> 34:35.060
Duh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.980
Okay, Bombas underwear has a barely there feel

34:37.980 --> 34:40.380
with second skin support that might make you forget

34:40.380 --> 34:42.780
they're even there in a good way.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.140
And Bombas knows the shelters

34:44.140 --> 34:45.660
for people experiencing homelessness,

34:45.660 --> 34:49.660
the highest requested items are socks and underpants.

34:49.660 --> 34:53.540
So for every item you buy, an equal item is donated

34:53.540 --> 34:57.780
so you could feel good and feel good about it.

34:57.780 --> 34:59.100
Ooh. Ooh.

35:15.620 --> 35:18.940
Are you ready to binge watch something old?

35:18.940 --> 35:22.340
The Greatest Generation is a podcast about Star Trek

35:22.340 --> 35:24.860
by a couple of hosts a little bit embarrassed

35:24.860 --> 35:27.380
to even have a Star Trek podcast.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.540
Hosted by me, Ben Harrison.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.580
And me, Adam Pranica.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.900
We get into the critical, the technical,

35:33.900 --> 35:37.260
the science fictional aspects of the show we love

35:37.260 --> 35:39.820
while roasting it and each other at the same time.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.540
We've completed an entire series

35:41.540 --> 35:43.820
about Star Trek The Next Generation

35:43.820 --> 35:46.380
and another one about Star Trek Deep Space Nine

35:46.380 --> 35:48.620
and we've just begun Star Trek Voyager.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.020
So now is a great time to start watching

35:51.020 --> 35:53.380
a new Star Trek series with us.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.100
So subscribe to The Greatest Generation

35:55.100 --> 35:58.500
on maximumfun.org or wherever you get your podcasts

35:58.500 --> 36:01.700
and become a friend of DeSoto today.

36:01.700 --> 36:02.700
How about another question?

36:02.700 --> 36:03.700
Yeah.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.700
Yeah.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
I mean, do you not have a thing?

36:05.700 --> 36:06.700
No.

36:06.700 --> 36:07.700
Okay.

36:07.700 --> 36:08.700
Well, then how about we go to the wizard instead?

36:08.700 --> 36:09.700
I'd love that.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.700
Thank you.

36:10.700 --> 36:11.700
Hi, wizard.

36:11.700 --> 36:12.700
Hello.

36:12.700 --> 36:13.700
Oh, God.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.700
Are you okay?

36:14.700 --> 36:15.700
Oh, no.

36:15.700 --> 36:16.700
What happened?

36:16.700 --> 36:17.700
I'm a wizard.

36:17.700 --> 36:18.700
You've never heard my voice before.

36:18.700 --> 36:19.700
Okay.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.700
I'm a wizard.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.700
I'm a wizard.

36:21.700 --> 36:22.700
I'm a wizard.

36:22.700 --> 36:23.700
I'm a wizard.

36:23.700 --> 36:24.700
I'm a wizard.

36:24.700 --> 36:25.700
I'm a wizard.

36:25.700 --> 36:26.700
I'm a wizard.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.700
I'm a wizard.

36:27.700 --> 36:28.700
I'm a wizard.

36:28.700 --> 36:29.700
Are you okay?

36:29.700 --> 36:32.700
I'm like sort of a big dog man.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.700
I love that.

36:33.700 --> 36:34.700
Yeah.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.740
You didn't know he was a big dog man in the sky.

36:36.740 --> 36:37.740
I love it.

36:37.740 --> 36:38.740
Thank you.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.760
This one has an author which fucks me up.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.020
Oh, boy, someone put their name on it.

36:43.020 --> 36:47.420
Yeah, it was co-authored by John Keegan and Ally Rusciano.

36:47.420 --> 36:48.420
So good.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.160
Great work, y'all.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.020
Way to own it.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.780
So if you have issues with this one, you know who to hit up.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.220
This one is how to respond to a how was your day text.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.540
Thank you, Jesus, yes.

37:00.540 --> 37:02.940
It's actually 14 easy ways to do it.

37:02.940 --> 37:04.560
And I thought we could go through them pretty quick

37:04.560 --> 37:08.300
and just kind of rank them by like,

37:08.300 --> 37:11.140
would you ever actually say these things or not?

37:11.140 --> 37:13.700
And this is specifically text and not just like

37:13.700 --> 37:15.820
walking by someone like in a hallway or something, right?

37:15.820 --> 37:17.220
Yeah, it's nearing the end of the day, Travis,

37:17.220 --> 37:19.220
and your phone dings into, how was your day?

37:19.220 --> 37:20.900
Text stares back at you.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.440
Maybe it's from your best friend, parent,

37:22.440 --> 37:23.540
or even your crush.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.500
They just want to check in, but how do you respond?

37:25.500 --> 37:27.780
If it's your crush, I'm over the moon.

37:27.780 --> 37:28.740
Are you kidding me?

37:28.740 --> 37:29.580
Yeah.

37:29.580 --> 37:33.980
And unprompted, how was your day from my crush?

37:33.980 --> 37:34.820
Oh, boy.

37:34.820 --> 37:35.660
Fucking forget it.

37:35.660 --> 37:37.540
Now my day's amazing.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.220
Like, are you kidding me?

37:39.220 --> 37:41.340
I would guess that the answer would be

37:41.340 --> 37:43.740
sort of context sensitive depending on

37:43.740 --> 37:47.340
if you got it from your parent or your crush.

37:47.340 --> 37:48.700
Because I'm gonna say to them,

37:48.700 --> 37:52.300
well, I've got a great boner now, to one of them.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.780
Yeah.

37:53.780 --> 37:55.880
Well, I got a great boner now, dad.

37:55.880 --> 37:56.980
It's so-

37:56.980 --> 37:59.500
I'm proud of you, son.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.660
You've done it.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.180
Now you're the dad.

38:02.180 --> 38:05.340
You've overcome our family's curse.

38:05.340 --> 38:10.340
You finally carried one of the other family up a mountain

38:13.340 --> 38:15.120
and ate the stinky vegetables,

38:15.120 --> 38:17.300
and now you can have the bonus.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.140
It's-

38:18.140 --> 38:18.960
It's true.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.260
Noodle-limping to the second.

38:20.260 --> 38:23.800
I've never been more proud of you than I am today.

38:24.620 --> 38:25.460
So-

38:25.460 --> 38:27.760
We're going to start calling you Rock Hardson.

38:31.760 --> 38:32.740
All right.

38:32.740 --> 38:33.780
Number one, it's been great.

38:33.780 --> 38:34.700
How about you?

38:34.700 --> 38:36.500
Share how awesome your day's been with this text.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.180
There's no shame in having a great day.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.660
Let them know how amazing you feel.

38:39.660 --> 38:40.940
A fucking great day.

38:40.940 --> 38:41.780
Great day.

38:41.780 --> 38:42.820
I forgot that it's okay to do

38:42.820 --> 38:44.660
because it's been so long since I've had one.

38:44.660 --> 38:45.500
Right, yeah.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.420
Well, but I would go the other way,

38:47.420 --> 38:49.340
which is like, it's a little braggadocious.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.060
This would be like, fucking awesome.

38:51.060 --> 38:53.260
The odds of two people communicating with each other,

38:53.260 --> 38:54.100
having a good day,

38:54.100 --> 38:55.660
simultaneously right now, impossible.

38:55.660 --> 38:57.660
Nobody reaches out to somebody else

38:57.660 --> 39:01.580
because they're having a good time in this day and age.

39:01.580 --> 39:04.660
If you say that it is good in any way

39:04.660 --> 39:07.620
and do not follow that up with all things considered,

39:07.620 --> 39:09.140
you're fucking lying.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:10.580 --> 39:13.300
Okay, chilled at home, so not too bad.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.140
Sorry, what?

39:14.140 --> 39:15.060
Chilled at home?

39:15.060 --> 39:16.220
Chilled at home.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.060
Chilled.

39:17.060 --> 39:18.980
Chilled makes more sense than killed.

39:18.980 --> 39:21.060
Chilled at home, so not too bad.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.300
Tell them what you've been up to with this reply.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.220
Even if all you did today was chill out on the couch,

39:24.220 --> 39:26.220
fill them in with the deets.

39:26.220 --> 39:27.140
Are you still standing?

39:27.140 --> 39:28.180
Yeah.

39:28.180 --> 39:30.140
Okay, thank you for your honesty, Travis.

39:30.140 --> 39:30.980
I appreciate it.

39:30.980 --> 39:32.420
Well, I go to the gym for my exercise, Justin.

39:32.420 --> 39:35.140
This is my time for work.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.820
I know, but when I work, I stand up.

39:36.820 --> 39:38.780
Well, when I work hard, I play hard, yeah?

39:38.780 --> 39:40.300
Hey, Travis, if you got time to lean,

39:40.300 --> 39:41.140
you got time to clean.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.380
I'm not leaning.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.580
Okay, if you get time to sit,

39:43.580 --> 39:45.140
then you got time to clean shit.

39:45.140 --> 39:47.140
Here, take this Windex and go clean

39:47.140 --> 39:49.260
while I go and do this comedy.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.220
Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.260
I'm an older brother.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.060
I'm gonna start managing this show better.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.300
Okay, I'm gonna do what I always do at jobs,

39:56.300 --> 39:58.940
which is go around the corner and then stop.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.860
And that energy juice, I think we all know

40:00.860 --> 40:02.180
from the retail jobs we've worked,

40:02.180 --> 40:06.060
is the most effective way to get somebody to be effective.

40:06.060 --> 40:09.220
And it makes for a fun experience that everyone enjoys.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.100
Fun experience.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.420
I had to learn to podcast

40:11.420 --> 40:12.740
just so I would never be in that situation.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.500
Yeah, so once my manager, Jimmy Johns,

40:15.500 --> 40:17.940
made me shave in the Jimmy John's bathroom

40:17.940 --> 40:19.940
with a rusty razor and lukewarm water,

40:19.940 --> 40:22.700
I said, time to get into podcasting, I think.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.420
Hey, listen, I love hunting elephants

40:25.420 --> 40:26.460
as much as the next guy.

40:26.460 --> 40:30.540
But this has gone too far.

40:30.540 --> 40:31.380
All right.

40:32.540 --> 40:33.620
I'm taking these pickles with me.

40:33.620 --> 40:38.100
The only thing I wanna poach from now on is eggs, Jimmy.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.420
I don't think they put poached eggs on Jimmy John's sandwich.

40:40.420 --> 40:42.020
No, that's why I had to quit.

40:42.020 --> 40:42.980
That's why I had to quit,

40:42.980 --> 40:44.340
because I tried to put poached eggs,

40:44.340 --> 40:46.540
and Jimmy said, we only poach elephants.

40:46.540 --> 40:48.060
Right, yes, that's what-

40:48.060 --> 40:50.420
This is our new sandwich, The Fruity Little Wuss.

40:50.420 --> 40:51.860
Okay.

40:51.860 --> 40:53.980
It's got poached eggs on it.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.380
He says it's good for protein.

40:55.380 --> 40:57.260
I just like elephant steaks.

40:58.540 --> 41:02.220
The trunk is so subtle, you don't even know, man.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.300
Okay, really good, really good.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.460
Thanks for asking.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.260
Really good?

41:07.260 --> 41:08.860
No, that's sarcastic.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.220
Really good.

41:10.220 --> 41:13.900
Thanks for asking.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.380
That's really good.

41:15.380 --> 41:17.060
Really good, man.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.180
Glad you made me think about it.

41:19.180 --> 41:21.260
Similar vein, good, how was yours?

41:21.260 --> 41:22.100
Good.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.100
There's a lot of use of smiling and laughing emojis,

41:25.100 --> 41:25.940
and a lot of like-

41:25.940 --> 41:26.780
Can't really communicate that.

41:26.780 --> 41:29.220
Can't wait for finals to be over, ha ha.

41:29.220 --> 41:33.180
Good, how was yours, by the way, is so clear.

41:33.180 --> 41:38.020
One, I'm either gonna read that as a lie, right?

41:38.020 --> 41:39.260
Or I'm going to read it as,

41:39.260 --> 41:42.340
oh fuck, they're really annoyed I asked.

41:42.340 --> 41:43.420
Good, how was yours?

41:43.420 --> 41:46.100
Right, like you responded with as few,

41:46.100 --> 41:49.100
not just words, but letters as possible.

41:49.100 --> 41:53.020
Yeah, if you guys ever get this text back from me,

41:53.020 --> 41:54.700
it means I have been killed,

41:54.700 --> 41:57.780
and the killer is using my phone to create an alibi.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.580
Pretty good, you won't believe what happened.

42:00.580 --> 42:03.140
If I ever say that to you without saying,

42:04.180 --> 42:06.860
you know, someone stole my catalytic converter,

42:06.860 --> 42:09.220
I don't know why I would say that's a pretty good day,

42:09.220 --> 42:11.060
but if I say, you won't believe

42:11.060 --> 42:12.660
what happened to me today, guys.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.820
And I know how you guys are anxious

42:14.820 --> 42:18.020
in the way that you are, and I am, and we all are.

42:18.020 --> 42:22.180
That's not me saying that, that is my neighbor,

42:22.180 --> 42:24.940
or most murders are done by people.

42:24.940 --> 42:27.700
You, Griffin McElroy, would know never to text us like,

42:27.700 --> 42:30.420
do you have a second to talk, right?

42:30.420 --> 42:33.740
Hey guys, got an important conversation

42:33.740 --> 42:36.100
you're not gonna like.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.020
And then not respond to our response.

42:38.020 --> 42:40.180
Don't respond forever.

42:40.180 --> 42:42.420
Okay, okay, what about you?

42:42.420 --> 42:44.020
So just a lot of just like,

42:45.820 --> 42:48.300
here's the quality of my day, and now I'm gonna hit you up.

42:48.300 --> 42:51.340
This article feels like different ways

42:51.340 --> 42:53.420
of different days you could be happy.

42:53.420 --> 42:56.420
Is there an option on there that's like, fucking suck, dude?

42:57.620 --> 42:59.140
Yeah, Trav, I don't know if you've noticed,

42:59.140 --> 43:01.260
there's a pattern, these are decreasing.

43:01.260 --> 43:03.100
Oh, excellent.

43:03.100 --> 43:04.380
Is there one on there that's like,

43:04.380 --> 43:05.900
hey, this feels superficial.

43:05.900 --> 43:07.500
Do you really wanna get into it, man?

43:07.500 --> 43:09.180
Cause I'll open up my heart to you, bro.

43:09.180 --> 43:14.180
No, but there is the raw, powerful ennui

43:14.260 --> 43:16.900
of same old, same old, how was yours?

43:16.900 --> 43:19.260
Yes. I see, I see.

43:19.260 --> 43:23.740
Big case of the Mondays, Brock.

43:23.740 --> 43:24.580
How about you?

43:24.580 --> 43:27.180
I think, actually, I'm gonna say

43:27.180 --> 43:29.700
that if you ask someone how was their day,

43:29.700 --> 43:32.820
I would rather hear someone say it fucking sucked

43:32.820 --> 43:34.980
than same old, same old.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.860
Cause there's a certain amount of acceptance

43:37.860 --> 43:40.820
and same old, same old, it's like, whoa, okay, hey, man.

43:40.820 --> 43:44.140
Bad, but in a way I'm used to, how about you?

43:44.140 --> 43:46.780
Let's get out of here and try something,

43:46.780 --> 43:49.060
let's go horseback riding or something.

43:49.060 --> 43:49.900
Yeah.

43:51.220 --> 43:54.260
Okay, so the next one is awesome, fine.

43:54.260 --> 43:56.140
Give this reply if you don't wanna talk.

43:56.140 --> 43:57.300
Yeah. Maybe your ex or a friend

43:57.300 --> 43:58.900
you recently had a falling out with texted you.

43:58.900 --> 44:00.540
A one word response is a blunt way of saying,

44:00.540 --> 44:02.500
I don't wanna talk right now.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.540
No, you know what's an even blunter way?

44:04.540 --> 44:06.060
Don't respond.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.820
Don't wanna talk to you right now.

44:08.820 --> 44:09.660
Not so great.

44:10.620 --> 44:11.980
If it's your mom or best friend,

44:11.980 --> 44:13.180
open up and tell the truth.

44:13.180 --> 44:14.020
Not so great.

44:14.020 --> 44:14.980
Let me confide in you.

44:14.980 --> 44:15.860
Is this mom?

44:15.860 --> 44:18.620
Hey, does you block my number, mom?

44:19.940 --> 44:20.780
That's okay.

44:20.780 --> 44:21.900
It's been better.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.820
This next one is for horny.

44:23.820 --> 44:26.140
It was okay, seeing you would have made it better.

44:26.140 --> 44:26.980
Oh.

44:28.620 --> 44:30.060
Real smooth.

44:30.060 --> 44:30.900
What do you mean?

44:30.900 --> 44:32.780
Like seeing all of you would have made it better.

44:32.780 --> 44:35.540
Watch out Peter Dinklage, there's a new Cyrano in town.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.900
Oh, hey, nice.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.380
They should make a modern remake of Cyrano

44:39.380 --> 44:43.020
where it's just about like sexy texties.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.620
I'm pretty sure that's in Roxanne.

44:45.620 --> 44:47.380
I think he's just constantly sending sexy texts.

44:47.380 --> 44:49.620
They send sexy texties in Roxanne?

44:49.620 --> 44:52.220
Yeah, he's just sexting constantly.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.700
Guys, sexy texties is something.

44:54.700 --> 44:55.780
There's something powerful about

44:55.780 --> 44:58.100
not saying the second T in the word text.

44:59.060 --> 45:00.060
Sexy texties.

45:00.060 --> 45:01.380
This is a great reply for someone

45:01.380 --> 45:03.140
you haven't seen in a while.

45:03.140 --> 45:05.020
Maybe you haven't seen their butt in a while.

45:05.020 --> 45:06.540
To be fair, that is a good point though.

45:06.540 --> 45:09.260
So that doesn't work if you did see them.

45:09.260 --> 45:11.660
Seeing you would have, I just left.

45:11.660 --> 45:13.860
The arc of this article is so great

45:13.860 --> 45:16.020
because it's like at the top of it,

45:16.020 --> 45:17.740
it's like brag about how cool your life is

45:17.740 --> 45:19.140
and how shitty their life is.

45:19.140 --> 45:22.220
All the way down to like cry for help

45:22.220 --> 45:25.740
because you are so sad about the non-changing nature

45:25.740 --> 45:28.020
of your life and how you feel like you're stuck

45:28.020 --> 45:29.940
in a sort of existential quagmire.

45:29.940 --> 45:32.180
And then it's like, get a little horny.

45:32.180 --> 45:34.180
And the next one is any day is great

45:34.180 --> 45:37.460
when you text me, get that dick out now.

45:37.460 --> 45:39.220
Let's go.

45:39.220 --> 45:41.420
I was sad before, but I changed it

45:41.420 --> 45:43.020
with a different feeling.

45:44.180 --> 45:45.820
That's the one I text back when I get them

45:45.820 --> 45:48.060
from Bernie Sanders, definitely real.

45:48.060 --> 45:48.900
Bernie Sanders.

45:48.900 --> 45:49.740
Hey, it's Bernie.

45:49.740 --> 45:50.740
Burn.

45:50.740 --> 45:51.580
Burn?

45:52.620 --> 45:54.940
You wanna go see the Batman or what?

45:54.940 --> 45:55.780
Burn?

45:55.780 --> 45:57.620
We're still on for tonight?

45:57.620 --> 45:58.620
All right, all right, we'll see.

45:58.620 --> 46:00.500
Murder on the Nile, geez.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.340
Feeling better now.

46:01.340 --> 46:03.300
I love having old friends.

46:03.300 --> 46:05.660
Yeah, we can go to, we'll go to the 5 p.m. show.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.780
We'll go to 5 p.m. man, you gotta get to bed.

46:07.780 --> 46:09.060
Sounds great, my dude, that works for me.

46:09.060 --> 46:11.060
Hey, bring those mittens I ordered from your shop.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.700
Yeah, we can sneak in candy, Bernie.

46:12.700 --> 46:15.180
It has gotten too expensive lately.

46:15.180 --> 46:18.060
Yeah, sorry they don't have Mary James.

46:18.060 --> 46:20.620
I bet we can sneak in some Bitto Hunnies.

46:20.620 --> 46:24.260
We'll sneak in some Bitto Hunnies, you old bird.

46:24.260 --> 46:25.660
You old sneak.

46:25.660 --> 46:26.500
Hound dog.

46:27.620 --> 46:29.700
Oh, you scoundrel, are those good and plenty?

46:29.700 --> 46:30.540
Get out of here.

46:30.540 --> 46:32.340
What's a good place, you old hound dog?

46:32.340 --> 46:33.660
Careful, that box is real loud.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.300
Oh, you put them in a Ziploc bag.

46:35.300 --> 46:37.220
That's gonna fix that right up.

46:37.220 --> 46:39.060
You're right, this one would be better

46:39.060 --> 46:40.100
with Marlene Dietrich.

46:40.100 --> 46:40.940
You're right.

46:40.940 --> 46:42.580
We're all having a lot of fun.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.940
We're all having a lot of fun here

46:44.940 --> 46:49.060
at Mr. Sanders' expense, but feeling better.

46:49.060 --> 46:51.740
Well, he should stop texting, that's all.

46:51.740 --> 46:53.020
Feeling better now, thanks for checking in.

46:53.020 --> 46:53.860
That one's not funny.

46:53.860 --> 46:54.980
This next one is pretty good though.

46:54.980 --> 46:56.940
A mess, but we live and learn.

46:56.940 --> 46:57.900
Whoa.

46:57.900 --> 46:58.720
Whoa.

46:58.720 --> 47:01.780
That is a store, somebody murdered somebody.

47:01.780 --> 47:03.060
Yeah, that's like growth.

47:03.060 --> 47:03.900
We live and learn.

47:03.900 --> 47:04.720
I'm murdered.

47:04.720 --> 47:05.560
A mess?

47:05.560 --> 47:07.500
If you describe your day as a mess,

47:07.500 --> 47:08.980
you should be brought up on charge.

47:08.980 --> 47:11.980
I'm betting vehicular manslaughter is my guess.

47:11.980 --> 47:14.340
Hit someone with a car, won't do that again.

47:14.340 --> 47:15.700
Live and learn.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.260
Wait, killed someone with a big, fast automobile,

47:18.260 --> 47:20.540
didn't like it, won't do it again.

47:20.540 --> 47:22.260
Do not recommend.

47:22.260 --> 47:24.020
Would love to see you though.

47:24.020 --> 47:26.100
Would've been better if I hit you with my dick.

47:26.100 --> 47:28.580
Wait, hold on, no, jump back, jump back.

47:28.580 --> 47:30.580
I was happy and then I was sad, then I got horny,

47:30.580 --> 47:31.900
then I hit someone with my car

47:31.900 --> 47:35.100
and now I'm just sort of focusing on me and my journey.

47:36.420 --> 47:39.140
It turns out I'm super horny again.

47:39.140 --> 47:41.520
Yeah, it turns out it made me even hornier.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.720
Now, this is the last one and it's like,

47:44.760 --> 47:47.060
this one you should actually expect to get from me

47:47.060 --> 47:47.900
at some point.

47:47.900 --> 47:49.780
You say, Griffin, how was your day?

47:49.780 --> 47:50.700
Very productive.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.300
Very, very productive, eventful.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.900
The team made lots of progress

47:58.900 --> 48:01.540
and I'll make sure to have that data to you by midnight.

48:01.540 --> 48:03.820
That's one of the suggested response.

48:03.820 --> 48:06.460
Is that a e-how person trying to figure out

48:06.460 --> 48:07.620
how jobs work?

48:07.620 --> 48:08.980
Good, and the meeting went well.

48:08.980 --> 48:11.620
I think our proposal has a shot, smiley face.

48:11.620 --> 48:15.420
This one feels fairly specific, yeah.

48:15.420 --> 48:17.300
Can't wait to work more.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.740
Can't wait to work more, love work, love doing it.

48:20.740 --> 48:24.940
Would love to see that butthole on a text message though.

48:24.940 --> 48:28.140
Oh, sorry, sorry, I thought you were my boss.

48:28.140 --> 48:29.220
I didn't realize.

48:29.220 --> 48:30.060
Whoops.

48:31.660 --> 48:33.860
I knew he was there somewhere.

48:33.860 --> 48:36.460
I was trying to be polite and keep up the vibe.

48:36.460 --> 48:37.740
Yeah, man, for sure.

48:38.900 --> 48:42.880
Diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga, diga,

48:42.880 --> 48:43.880
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.720
Oh, wow.

48:44.720 --> 48:49.120
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

48:49.120 --> 48:51.660
I want a munch squad.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.420
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

48:53.420 --> 48:56.700
I want to munch squad.

48:56.700 --> 48:59.660
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

48:59.660 --> 49:00.820
Welcome to Munch Squad.

49:00.820 --> 49:02.900
It's a podcast within a podcast

49:02.900 --> 49:06.800
profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.420
And me, just a macaron.

49:09.420 --> 49:14.420
I'm ready to get loud and wild with Mountain Dew.

49:15.020 --> 49:15.860
Oh boy.

49:17.860 --> 49:19.420
Mountain Dew is going to thrill sports fans

49:19.420 --> 49:22.540
at Buffalo Wild Wings with the exclusive new pour,

49:22.540 --> 49:23.380
Mountain Dew Legend.

49:23.380 --> 49:24.220
Yeah.

49:24.220 --> 49:25.060
Whoa, shit.

49:25.060 --> 49:27.020
This new offering delivers a bold burst

49:27.020 --> 49:31.660
of blackberry flavor that is, wait for it, legendary.

49:31.660 --> 49:33.100
That's not how you do it.

49:34.940 --> 49:37.620
Yeah, they messed up that great

49:37.620 --> 49:39.100
how I met your mother reference.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.300
That's not how you do it.

49:40.300 --> 49:43.700
You messed up the how I met your mother reference, PepsiCo.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.420
So Mountain Dew and Buffalo Wild Wings

49:46.420 --> 49:48.380
are bringing sports fans a reason to celebrate.

49:48.380 --> 49:49.220
Finally.

49:49.220 --> 49:52.700
By recruiting an all new exclusive.

49:52.700 --> 49:54.020
Don't say recruiting.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.380
I know what you're going for.

49:55.380 --> 49:56.860
Trying to make a sporty thing.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.580
But it makes it sound like on the street,

49:58.580 --> 50:02.420
you saw a soda and said, give me that kid.

50:02.420 --> 50:03.300
Hey, soda.

50:03.300 --> 50:04.240
Yeah, you.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.540
You ever dreamed about being in the big leagues?

50:07.960 --> 50:12.060
So this soda is soon to be legendary, it says,

50:13.060 --> 50:14.620
even though they're only offering

50:14.620 --> 50:16.620
exclusive Buffalo Wild Wings.

50:16.620 --> 50:18.660
I guess they're leaving the legend some room

50:18.660 --> 50:21.260
to expand on it so it's sort of simmer.

50:21.260 --> 50:23.180
You don't want to come out the gate too strong

50:23.180 --> 50:24.780
and shove the legend down people's throats

50:24.780 --> 50:27.500
by saying this is a legend, right?

50:27.500 --> 50:29.660
They should have called it Mountain Dew.

50:29.660 --> 50:32.380
And then let it grow on its own.

50:32.380 --> 50:33.820
Let it be its own thing.

50:33.820 --> 50:38.080
This sentence is like maybe one of the worst ones.

50:38.080 --> 50:38.920
Ever?

50:40.220 --> 50:43.780
There's not a sentence after that.

50:43.780 --> 50:45.780
Like this sentence I'm about to read

50:45.780 --> 50:47.580
is one of the worst ones.

50:47.580 --> 50:48.420
Okay.

50:49.260 --> 50:51.860
Curated for those who embrace the fun

50:51.860 --> 50:53.740
and freedom in life.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.580
This standout, that's already-

50:55.580 --> 50:56.420
Yeah.

50:56.420 --> 50:57.260
Fuck yeah.

50:57.260 --> 50:58.080
What?

50:58.080 --> 50:58.920
Awesome.

50:58.920 --> 50:59.760
What are you saying?

50:59.760 --> 51:00.600
That's me.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.100
I love fun and freedom.

51:02.100 --> 51:03.740
Do you mean made from a syrup in an-

51:03.740 --> 51:05.500
No, Justin, no.

51:05.500 --> 51:09.060
Every bottle is made by a professional mixologist

51:10.180 --> 51:11.500
in suspenders.

51:11.500 --> 51:16.500
This standout beverage combines the exhilarating taste

51:16.960 --> 51:18.980
of original Mountain Dew.

51:18.980 --> 51:20.540
Whoa, what's this?

51:20.540 --> 51:22.360
I'm still alive.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.440
For the very first time.

51:25.440 --> 51:30.440
Original Mountain Dew, M-T-N capital, D-E-W, Mountain Dew,

51:30.780 --> 51:35.060
with notes of blackberry, citrus, and ginger.

51:35.060 --> 51:35.900
Okay.

51:35.900 --> 51:38.620
With its bold charge and refreshing taste,

51:38.620 --> 51:41.420
Mountain Dew legend is uniquely designed

51:41.420 --> 51:45.660
to elevate Buffalo Wild Wings sauces, burgers,

51:45.660 --> 51:46.980
and other bar food items.

51:46.980 --> 51:49.140
Now you can't just make that blanket statement.

51:49.140 --> 51:49.980
There's so many different-

51:49.980 --> 51:50.800
They have, they have.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.640
There's a lot of different-

51:51.640 --> 51:53.260
It's formulated to elevate all food offerings.

51:53.260 --> 51:56.460
There's so many sauces and dry rub.

51:56.460 --> 52:00.540
It pairs perfectly with frickels.

52:00.540 --> 52:04.460
You can't tell me it's great for like the garlic zing

52:04.460 --> 52:06.540
and the fucking Cajun dry rub.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.040
It's not the flavor, Travis.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.660
It's that it pairs well with the bones.

52:10.660 --> 52:11.500
Oh, okay.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.940
The Mountain Dew pairs good with the bones.

52:13.940 --> 52:15.660
Just pop your bones in there when you're done,

52:15.660 --> 52:17.260
it'll dissolve them all up.

52:17.260 --> 52:18.100
Make a broth.

52:18.100 --> 52:21.020
This makes the fan favorite sports bars

52:21.020 --> 52:23.660
the best place for sports enthusiasts

52:23.660 --> 52:25.900
to enjoy great food and drinks,

52:25.900 --> 52:28.780
all while watching their favorite matchups

52:28.780 --> 52:30.620
on the big screen.

52:30.620 --> 52:31.940
Yeah.

52:31.940 --> 52:32.780
Yeah, that-

52:32.780 --> 52:33.600
This is what sports people like, right?

52:33.600 --> 52:35.500
Do they still offer trivia?

52:35.500 --> 52:36.340
Do they still do the-

52:36.340 --> 52:37.160
I don't know if they do anymore.

52:37.160 --> 52:38.000
I want to do the trivia game.

52:38.000 --> 52:38.840
That's my favorite sport.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.260
They used to do it.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.900
We used to have a very small B2B place.

52:41.900 --> 52:42.740
Oh yeah, shoebox.

52:42.740 --> 52:43.820
Now we have a very big one.

52:43.820 --> 52:44.660
Oh yeah?

52:44.660 --> 52:45.480
It's weird.

52:45.480 --> 52:46.320
It grew up.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.700
Yeah, at the mall.

52:47.700 --> 52:49.820
Anyway, at Buffalo Wild Wings,

52:49.820 --> 52:51.860
we strive to provide our guests with mouthwatering-

52:51.860 --> 52:53.300
Wait, who's this?

52:53.300 --> 52:54.140
It's just a choice.

52:54.140 --> 52:56.780
You do not know that that is what their voice sounds like.

52:56.780 --> 52:57.600
Yes, I do.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.860
What's the name?

52:58.860 --> 52:59.860
Rita Patel.

53:00.740 --> 53:01.860
It's possible.

53:01.860 --> 53:03.020
Okay.

53:03.020 --> 53:03.860
Anything's possible.

53:03.860 --> 53:06.620
She might sound like an old-timey oil magnate, for sure.

53:06.620 --> 53:09.020
I don't know much about no Buffalo Wild Wings.

53:09.020 --> 53:11.280
What I do is tea.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.460
This is the only stage for character work I have.

53:13.460 --> 53:15.740
It's this and playing dolls with my kids, okay?

53:15.740 --> 53:18.660
Now, I might be a simple brand ambassador

53:18.660 --> 53:22.060
from a big company like Coca-Cola-Co,

53:22.060 --> 53:26.380
but what I know, I know bone flavor.

53:26.380 --> 53:27.800
And this goes with bone.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.740
Dip them in there, eat the bones.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.900
What's that?

53:30.900 --> 53:32.420
I can't tell them to eat the bones?

53:32.420 --> 53:35.420
Rita Patel is the chief marketing officer

53:35.420 --> 53:37.500
of Buffalo Wild Wings.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.340
The CMO.

53:39.420 --> 53:40.300
Do you think you'd get in trouble

53:40.300 --> 53:41.860
if we call your CMO come-o?

53:41.860 --> 53:45.020
Yes, I do, Justin.

53:45.020 --> 53:45.860
Probably.

53:45.860 --> 53:47.460
Yes, I do think you'd get in trouble.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.140
How was the weekend, come-o?

53:49.140 --> 53:51.420
I wish you wouldn't.

53:51.420 --> 53:54.640
I think immediately the HR representative would appear.

53:55.860 --> 53:57.340
Did you just say the word come-o?

53:57.340 --> 53:59.780
It's not on our list of words you can't say,

53:59.780 --> 54:01.960
but it is now.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.940
What is it to you, her?

54:03.940 --> 54:06.100
Sorry, it's HR, human resources.

54:06.100 --> 54:08.100
Oh, that explains so much.

54:08.100 --> 54:08.940
Yeah.

54:08.940 --> 54:10.460
Mountain Dew legend.

54:10.460 --> 54:12.900
Okay, at Buffalo Wild Wings,

54:12.900 --> 54:15.500
we provide our guests with mouth, water, and flavors

54:15.500 --> 54:18.220
and exciting innovations across our menu,

54:18.220 --> 54:20.260
said Rita Patel, chief marketing officer.

54:20.260 --> 54:21.500
If that's true, Rita,

54:21.500 --> 54:23.100
why did you get rid of the big pretzel

54:23.100 --> 54:24.780
and replace it with smaller pretzels

54:24.780 --> 54:25.620
that aren't as good?

54:25.620 --> 54:26.940
Thank you.

54:26.940 --> 54:29.860
Mountain Dew legend is a unique drink

54:29.860 --> 54:34.100
that we're proud to serve exclusively at our sports bars

54:34.100 --> 54:35.020
that we have.

54:35.020 --> 54:38.260
We have a longstanding relationship with PepsiCo,

54:38.260 --> 54:42.220
and we are known for bringing fans unexpected bold flavors

54:42.220 --> 54:45.580
like the Doritos spicy sweet chili flavored sauce.

54:45.580 --> 54:46.420
What?

54:46.420 --> 54:47.240
I didn't know about this.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.080
I gotta go.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.500
The Doritos spicy sweet chili flavored sauce.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.620
We're thrilled to continue our collaboration

54:52.620 --> 54:54.820
for one of a kind menu offerings.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.480
In case you're curious about Pepsi's side of it,

54:58.480 --> 55:00.060
Scott Finlow, the come-o.

55:00.060 --> 55:00.900
Pepsi.

55:00.900 --> 55:01.720
Pepsi.

55:01.720 --> 55:02.560
Pepsi.

55:02.560 --> 55:03.400
Pepsi.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.220
Pepsi.

55:04.220 --> 55:05.060
Pepsi.

55:05.060 --> 55:05.900
Pepsi.

55:05.900 --> 55:06.880
He sounds like this.

55:06.880 --> 55:08.700
Buffalo Wild Wings and Mountain Dew

55:08.700 --> 55:12.580
both know a thing or two about passionate fan bases,

55:12.580 --> 55:15.700
how to take celebrations to the next level

55:15.700 --> 55:17.940
with great tasting, food, and beverages.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.060
Okay.

55:19.060 --> 55:22.620
Together, our goal is to elevate the sports viewing

55:22.620 --> 55:25.640
and dining experience with Mountain Dew legend,

55:25.640 --> 55:30.180
serving as the ultimate wingman.

55:30.180 --> 55:31.840
Oh!

55:31.840 --> 55:32.680
All right.

55:32.680 --> 55:33.740
That's good, Scott.

55:33.740 --> 55:34.580
Good job, Scott.

55:34.580 --> 55:35.420
That's good.

55:35.420 --> 55:36.780
Yeah, you did all right with that one, Scott.

55:36.780 --> 55:40.700
It'll be available at all 1200 Buffalo Wild Wings locations

55:40.700 --> 55:42.140
by May, 2022.

55:42.140 --> 55:45.220
Apparently the pipeline is still being constructed.

55:45.220 --> 55:46.860
So that's a thrill.

55:46.860 --> 55:48.440
And it's something to get excited about.

55:48.440 --> 55:51.060
Mountain Dew legend coming.

55:51.900 --> 55:53.260
So you can't fucking wait.

55:53.260 --> 55:54.100
Thank you.

55:54.100 --> 55:54.920
Me neither.

55:54.920 --> 55:57.580
Hey, thanks for listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

55:57.580 --> 55:58.740
We hope you had fun.

55:58.740 --> 55:59.860
I know that we did,

55:59.860 --> 56:02.020
and I hope you're hanging in there and doing well.

56:02.020 --> 56:04.340
And we always appreciate you spending an hour with us.

56:04.340 --> 56:05.500
So thank you for that.

56:05.500 --> 56:06.340
Sincerely.

56:06.340 --> 56:07.360
And we have some information

56:07.360 --> 56:09.580
about the 20 Rendezvous Fancy Takes Flight Tour.

56:09.580 --> 56:11.540
So due to a scheduling conflict,

56:11.540 --> 56:14.400
we had to reschedule the Fancy Takes Flight Tour dates

56:14.400 --> 56:16.140
that were originally set for this month

56:16.140 --> 56:18.960
in Washington, D.C., Detroit, and Cincinnati.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.660
They'll now take place in November.

56:20.660 --> 56:23.980
So the Scentsy MBMB AM will be November 10th.

56:23.980 --> 56:26.720
The Detroit MBMB AM will be November 11th.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.500
The D.C. MBMB AM will be November 12th,

56:29.500 --> 56:32.380
and the D.C. TAZ show will be November 13th.

56:32.380 --> 56:33.980
All existing tickets will be honored

56:33.980 --> 56:35.540
for the rescheduled show.

56:35.540 --> 56:37.540
Refunds will be available at point of purchase

56:37.540 --> 56:39.260
for those unable to attend the new dates.

56:39.260 --> 56:40.140
We know it sucks.

56:40.140 --> 56:41.160
We didn't want to do it.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.000
We had to,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.500
and we're looking forward to seeing you later in the year.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.700
Tickets for these shows are on sale now

56:46.700 --> 56:49.100

57:13.620 --> 57:15.780

57:15.780 --> 57:17.820

we got the mystery pin of the month,

57:32.180 --> 57:34.740
which is going to be a random pin of the month

57:34.740 --> 57:36.220
from the past, which benefits

57:36.220 --> 57:39.940
the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum.

57:39.940 --> 57:43.020
We've got Candle Nights 2021 special video on demand.

57:45.700 --> 57:48.020
You can check that out at McElroyMerch.com.

57:48.020 --> 57:51.860
Also, I'm going to be hosting a live virtual show

57:51.860 --> 57:54.660
to benefit two great efforts here in Cincinnati.

57:54.660 --> 57:56.540
One is called Bethany House,

57:56.540 --> 57:59.340
which is a shelter that focuses on families

57:59.340 --> 58:01.100
that are experiencing homelessness

58:01.100 --> 58:03.780
or at risk of experiencing homelessness.

58:03.780 --> 58:06.460
And also, we're going to stock some free fridges

58:06.460 --> 58:09.100
here in Cincinnati and right across the river in Kentucky

58:09.100 --> 58:11.500
with masks and COVID tests.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.380
And we're going to have some amazing guests.

58:13.380 --> 58:14.500
We had to reschedule,

58:14.500 --> 58:17.140
but we're rescheduling for April 1st.

58:17.140 --> 58:18.980
Our guests are going to be, let's see,

58:18.980 --> 58:22.940
we got Adam Brody, got Rob Corddry, got Montane.

58:22.940 --> 58:24.660
We got Christina Ariel.

58:24.660 --> 58:26.380
And then there will be two more guests

58:26.380 --> 58:28.980
that we haven't locked down yet, but it's very exciting.

58:28.980 --> 58:33.060
Get those tickets at cincyticket.com slash cuscares.

58:45.020 --> 58:45.860
That's it.

58:45.860 --> 58:46.700
Thank you for listening to all those announcements.

58:46.700 --> 58:48.660
What if we show up, so am I going to show up

58:48.660 --> 58:51.500
and then you'd be like, no show, April Fools.

58:51.500 --> 58:52.980
No, I would never do that.

58:52.980 --> 58:55.340
And it will be available for two weeks,

58:55.340 --> 58:56.340
a video on demand afterwards.

58:56.340 --> 58:58.180
No, it won't, it's an April Fools joke.

58:58.180 --> 59:00.140
No, don't say that, please. It's not real.

59:00.140 --> 59:02.980
Please, it benefits really good organizations, Griffin.

59:02.980 --> 59:07.460
Yeah, sure it does, fake show, joke, fake joke show.

59:07.460 --> 59:08.900
Thanks to Montane for these for a theme song.

59:08.900 --> 59:09.900
My life is better with you.

59:09.900 --> 59:12.700
It's a great track and the music video's on YouTube.

59:12.700 --> 59:14.140
If you haven't seen that, it's a lot of fun.

59:14.140 --> 59:15.200
We're in it.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.940
We're in it, we did it.

59:16.940 --> 59:20.500
Oh, final bit, I liked doing an impression last week.

59:20.500 --> 59:22.780
I felt like, cause I got an email

59:22.780 --> 59:26.260
from the Saturday Night Live guy.

59:26.260 --> 59:27.220
Oh yeah?

59:27.220 --> 59:28.060
Wow.

59:28.060 --> 59:29.100
Yeah.

59:29.100 --> 59:33.780
And I don't remember his name, but that's okay.

59:33.780 --> 59:35.700
He said it's okay if I don't remember his name,

59:35.700 --> 59:37.820
but he was like, great voices.

59:37.820 --> 59:39.680
What else you got, kid?

59:41.060 --> 59:43.180
So just like, I guess give me somebody else,

59:43.180 --> 59:46.900
like a hot, like a name that's like in the news right now.

59:46.900 --> 59:49.060
Okay, who's like a cool,

59:49.060 --> 59:52.260
who's like a cool impression that Griffin could do?

59:52.260 --> 59:54.140
Griffin, could you do Pete Davidson?

59:56.460 --> 59:57.300
Oh, wait, did you say you want to do it?

59:57.300 --> 59:58.140
Justin, were you about to do it?

59:58.140 --> 59:59.340
It sounded like you were about to get a hint.

59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.900
No, no, I was like, oh, that's a good choice.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.580
Oh, it sounded like you were about to be like,

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.900
well, let me see what I can do.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.840
No, I don't have a beat.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.340
Go ahead, Griff, let's hear your beat.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.180
Oh.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.140
All right, who cares?

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.620
Check it out, guys.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.940
I'm just trying to,

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.420
we're all having trouble.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.540
Oh, we're all having trouble, aren't we, Kim?

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.260
Classic.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.060
Really excellent, thank you so much.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.700
People think my wiener's big because of the way I am.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.540
Why are you Justin McElroy?

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.360
