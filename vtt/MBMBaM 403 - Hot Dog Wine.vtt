00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.600
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, and it's an advice show for the Modron era.

00:49.600 --> 00:55.600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.920
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.760
Justin, for a second, it kind of sounded like you were starting with like a Yakov Smyrnov thing

01:03.760 --> 01:10.480
there. Hello, hello America. Is that still, is that still topical? Yakov Smyrnov, is that?

01:10.480 --> 01:14.560
My name is Chester Bengleton. I come from other country.

01:14.560 --> 01:18.080
Okay, I guess follow-up question, is it also now deeply problematic,

01:18.080 --> 01:21.680
and maybe has it always been? Hugely, hugely, wildly.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.560
Defo.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.280
Oh, good.

01:23.280 --> 01:29.920
Have you? I mean, but his show is like so wildly patriotic in its best length.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.320
And so incredibly xenophobic.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.640
It's weirdly very xenophobic. It's like he got in and he was like,

01:36.640 --> 01:42.640
that is it, everybody. Nobody else different. I'm the last one. Everybody else figure out.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.840
Yakov Smyrnov looks at Borat and he's like, that's too far.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.040
You've gone too far.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.840
Wait to ruin it for the rest of us.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.680
Becoming Dracula a little bit.

01:53.680 --> 02:02.080
So sorry that we missed the day of days. We try to come out with an episode on every 420.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.640
And honestly, y'all, we just couldn't get it done.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.880
I tried to do April 20th episode, but then I got high.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.320
So, and that's when we could have done.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.120
That's when we could have done, but we did.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.120
Do y'all remember that song is all about responsibilities this person had,

02:19.920 --> 02:21.680
but they didn't end up doing them.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.280
It's a cautionary tale.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.720
It's a cautionary tale. And it's really a powerful anti-drug message.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.920
If you think about it. Yeah.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.120
Cause it's like I was supposed to pay my rent and then I got high

02:31.120 --> 02:35.680
and then I got evicted from my apartment and lost my job.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.760
And I was supposed to read at the library to kids, but then I got high.

02:39.760 --> 02:45.440
Yeah. I was supposed to take my heart medicine, but then I got high and I died teens.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.640
And now I'm a ghost warning you from beyond the grave. I know the cush is fun.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.960
But then I got high.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.560
A lot of people are excited for the episode we got coming up here in about 17 episodes

02:58.560 --> 03:00.720
because it will be the 420th episode.

03:00.720 --> 03:07.040
And I don't know how to start laying the groundwork to not disappoint those people

03:07.760 --> 03:12.480
because of how, just how profoundly detached we are.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.240
I feel like to make a weird pop culture pull,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.480
it kind of feels like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer

03:18.480 --> 03:23.440
when the demons like don't celebrate Halloween because it's so cliche.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.520
I feel like for our 420th episode,

03:25.520 --> 03:30.240
we should just make it devoid of any jokes about dank nugs and blunts.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.840
Alternative idea.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.240
And I had this last night and I was thinking about it.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.360
We, instead of putting up a proper episode,

03:37.360 --> 03:42.320
just take all the audio out of an episode of Family Guy and put that up instead.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.720
Is that now?

03:44.720 --> 03:47.280
Justin, you know some things about entertainment law.

03:47.280 --> 03:47.920
Yes.

03:47.920 --> 03:53.600
If I put up just 23 tight minutes of Stewie and Brian,

03:55.280 --> 03:59.680
just thinking about these two clowns makes me start rolling,

03:59.680 --> 04:01.600
even when I'm not on the cush.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.760
It's a great question, Griffin.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.320
You can do that.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.800
The one issue you do need to be careful of

04:08.800 --> 04:12.800
is you gotta make sure you have the audio from the commercials in there as well

04:12.800 --> 04:15.680
because that's the only way it counts for them towards that money.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.440
And that's Seth's money, guys.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.440
Hey guys, I'm not here to take Seth's money.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.640
That's his money.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.720
So you gotta leave the commercials in it on that one.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.880
Let me ask you a question.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.520
What if, instead of just straight taking all the audio from one episode,

04:29.520 --> 04:36.160
we did a super cut of an hour of all of the uh and er sounds

04:36.160 --> 04:38.720
from a bunch of episodes of Family Guy?

04:38.720 --> 04:39.600
Oh, a Family Guy.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.120
I kind of thought you were going to say our podcast

04:41.120 --> 04:42.960
because there's a lot of source material.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.520
No, no, no.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.720
All Family Guy, and you just hear all the different voices,

04:46.720 --> 04:53.520
most of them Seth, and you just hear all the uh, er, uh, ah, uh, eh.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.840
What if we did just one episode of my Bim Bam

04:55.840 --> 04:58.800
where each of us brought an episode of Family Guy

04:58.800 --> 05:01.280
and just tried to recap it as much as we could?

05:01.280 --> 05:02.320
Like a book report?

05:03.200 --> 05:05.680
Yeah, a book report, and we could talk about all the great cutaway jokes,

05:05.680 --> 05:09.600
and we could talk about the baby trying to kill the mom.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.840
Do you think America would listen to a podcast called

05:11.840 --> 05:13.680
that Great Family Guy Humor?

05:13.680 --> 05:18.240
This is us recapping individual select episodes.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.480
Oh, we call it Extended Family Guy.

05:21.280 --> 05:21.840
That's good.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.200
Nuclear Family Guy.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.480
We'll keep workshopping it.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.720
I'm just so sorry we missed.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.160
I didn't do really any good weed humor.

05:30.160 --> 05:35.600
I tweeted one thing at like 4.05 on 4.20 thinking like,

05:35.600 --> 05:37.920
okay, and then in 15 minutes a punchline,

05:37.920 --> 05:42.240
and then I didn't. I didn't.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.480
I forgot. Then I got high.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.280
I was gonna tweet something so funny, but then I got high.

05:49.840 --> 05:55.040
Snoop on the evening of 4.19 tweeted,

05:55.040 --> 05:57.520
don't forget to leave milk and cookies out for me tonight.

05:58.160 --> 05:58.960
That's pretty good.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.080
It was, I had a very good chortle.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.600
We leave it to the professionals,

06:03.600 --> 06:07.600
the professionals who know where weed even comes from.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.400
Thank you.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.800
The ground from Gaia.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.080
It comes from Gaia.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.240
I keep telling everybody it's natural.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.520
Even John Boehner now is on the crazy wave.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.640
Does he party?

06:18.640 --> 06:21.200
Yeah, now he's in the industry.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.320
He's in the biz now.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.760
I'm so worried that someday when she is much,

06:25.760 --> 06:28.480
much older and understands language,

06:28.480 --> 06:30.880
that BB is gonna write a tell all book

06:30.880 --> 06:32.880
that reveals my horrible secret

06:32.880 --> 06:34.720
that I don't know where to get weed from.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.800
And most of these jokes are based on nothing.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.600
Yeah.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.160
I'm just so afraid that everyone's gonna find out

06:40.160 --> 06:44.240
my nasty truth that I didn't do as much drugs as I said I did.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.760
And I don't know where it came from, this idea,

06:47.760 --> 06:52.560
or why every time anyone sees the number 420 in the wild,

06:52.560 --> 06:56.400
or on the same topic, the number 69 in the wild,

06:56.960 --> 06:59.280
and they make sure to snap a pic and send it to me.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.720
Because both those numbers are not numbers

07:02.720 --> 07:06.160
that reflect the core of my being.

07:06.160 --> 07:06.880
Do you know what I mean?

07:07.680 --> 07:08.320
Yeah.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.920
That's the thing is the McElroy brothers,

07:09.920 --> 07:11.600
we don't celebrate a lot of artifice.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.080
And like the only artifice and irony we have

07:14.080 --> 07:15.120
is that we are cool.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.680
It's that we think that we are edgy in any sort of way.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.720
Any sense.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.360
Like I'm almost to the point where I could get it

07:23.360 --> 07:24.640
for my glaucoma.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.000
Like that's about where I'm at on the scale.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.360
So let's help some people.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.280
Oh, by the way, Texas, if you came out last weekend,

07:35.280 --> 07:36.560
is that, was it last weekend?

07:37.120 --> 07:37.440
Yeah.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.280
Yeah.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.400
Yes, last weekend.

07:40.400 --> 07:40.960
Thank you.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.240
That was very fun.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.320
You were all good eggs.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.200
And thank you to everybody who came to the Moon Tower Show,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.160
the Schmaner's Moon Tower Show.

07:48.160 --> 07:48.800
Oh, that was good.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.400
Oh, it was so good.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.040
Good.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.080
It was amazing.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.040
Do you think maybe we could,

07:53.040 --> 07:54.560
do you think maybe we could open with a Yahoo?

07:54.560 --> 07:58.160
Cause I got four Yahoo's this week that are all club bangers.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.760
I'm very excited about.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.520
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles,

08:01.520 --> 08:04.240
who is so deep in the game right now,

08:04.240 --> 08:06.160
just like crushing it, crushing it, crushing it.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.440
Thank you so much, Adrian.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.080
Well, on their way to earning a nickname perhaps,

08:10.080 --> 08:11.120
or a tagline.

08:11.120 --> 08:11.600
Getting there.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user NickA07, who asks,

08:16.800 --> 08:20.640
how do I be brave on the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror?

08:21.440 --> 08:22.480
Well, good news.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.040
It's not that anymore.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.480
Now it's the Guardians of the Galaxy prism break extreme.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.520
Not in Florida, baby.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.040
Oh, really?

08:31.040 --> 08:31.360
Yeah.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.960
It's still a big drop, right?

08:32.960 --> 08:34.000
It's still a big scary drop.

08:34.000 --> 08:34.800
And I don't think.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.880
Yeah, but now there's a raccoon sitting next to you,

08:36.880 --> 08:37.680
holding your hand.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.760
Okay, well that might help.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.520
But let's imagine that wasn't true.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.840
This will be my first time going on a drop tower ride,

08:43.840 --> 08:46.720
especially at Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.600
Is that what it's called?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.120
I felt like I don't want to go on it because I'm scared.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.040
And I am tired of being scared.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.160
But my mom's said she's going on it,

08:56.160 --> 08:57.280
but her back hurts.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.800
I'm worried something could happen to her

08:58.800 --> 09:00.160
if I don't go on with her.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.480
IDK, what to do when the time comes?

09:02.480 --> 09:03.440
What should I do?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.120
Should I go on with her or not?

09:05.120 --> 09:06.800
How do I be brave for this ride?

09:06.800 --> 09:07.760
How do I feel safe?

09:07.760 --> 09:09.360
I am just afraid what it will feel like

09:09.360 --> 09:12.240
when I float off my seat in the air when dropping.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.840
I do worry too much, lol.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.080
Seriously, I need help.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.120
Okay, wait.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.640
We'll get to that in a second.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.640
What does this person think that they are going to do

09:20.640 --> 09:22.800
to help their mother's back while they're there?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.560
Just hold the spine.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.760
Hold the spine upright while the drop is happening

09:27.760 --> 09:32.000
and try to cushion the tailbone when the ground hits.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.760
I think it's wild that this is a ride

09:33.760 --> 09:36.320
where you plummet 10 stories

09:36.320 --> 09:40.320
and then come to an immediate zero miles an hour stop.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.680
Yeah, by hitting the ground.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.320
By hitting the ground, it's extremely dangerous.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.760
And I guess, hey, you know what?

09:45.760 --> 09:48.880
I just figured out where they get all the fucking ghosts from.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.000
And it's the former writers of the ride.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.520
So it's cool that Disney World has two exits,

09:55.520 --> 09:56.960
really, if you think about it.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.440
The main one in front of Mickey's castle.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.640
And then the Tower of Terror,

10:00.640 --> 10:02.960
which is sort of a more permanent exit.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.840
I'll tell you what not to do.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.320
If you're asking me about Tower of Terror etiquette,

10:12.320 --> 10:13.600
I can- Not etiquette.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.240
Fear.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.520
But I'm gonna tell you what not to do.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.440
I went on the Tower of Terror, Teresa and I went,

10:19.440 --> 10:22.080
and it kind of hovers at the top for a second

10:22.080 --> 10:23.920
before plummeting to your death.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.880
Hovers at the top.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.760
And just before it dropped,

10:27.760 --> 10:30.400
somebody let out a blood-curdling scream,

10:30.400 --> 10:31.760
before it dropped.

10:31.760 --> 10:40.800
And everybody's emotional ride was ruined by that.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.120
Because everybody just turned around and went,

10:43.120 --> 10:44.160
and then it dropped.

10:44.160 --> 10:44.800
I thought you were gonna say

10:44.800 --> 10:47.120
they let out a blood-curdling toot.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.320
Which might be nice, actually,

10:48.320 --> 10:49.520
because somebody toots and you're like,

10:49.520 --> 10:50.480
oh, who did,

10:50.480 --> 10:52.960
whoa, at least I'm falling out of the fart cloud.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.460
Yeah.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.040
So that could be something

10:55.040 --> 10:56.320
you could be grateful for the drop,

10:56.320 --> 10:56.880
because it's like,

10:56.880 --> 11:00.560
oh, Mickey, get me out of this fart cloud.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.920
It is Mickey, right, who does it,

11:01.920 --> 11:03.120
pulls the drop lever?

11:03.120 --> 11:03.840
Yeah.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.600
He appears out of nowhere and is like,

11:06.400 --> 11:06.900
I'm here.

11:08.080 --> 11:08.960
Goodbye.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.460
You're fucked.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.460
Peace out.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.000
Hold on to your mom's back.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.400
Don't forget to hold your mom's back.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.360
Tootles, bring me the hemorrhoid donut.

11:19.360 --> 11:29.920
Tootles, bring her mom's back.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.280
I got this one wrong.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.400
This is how I get my kicks.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.480
Be careful.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.120
My mom's spine telescoped on this one.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.760
Now, which one was that?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.040
Who was that, Griffin?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.800
That was Donald.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.080
Now, here's how Donald went.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.960
Oh, please give me Donald.

11:50.960 --> 11:51.520
That would be actually much scarier.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.200
Oh my god, drop it, drop it, drop it.

11:53.200 --> 11:53.680
I can't.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.120
Kill me, kill me.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.200
Escape Donald, the ride.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.640
Is it possible to...

12:01.840 --> 12:02.640
Do you know what would make

12:02.640 --> 12:04.320
Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

12:04.320 --> 12:06.560
a hundred thousand times scarier?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.120
What?

12:07.120 --> 12:09.680
If one out of every 20 rides,

12:10.560 --> 12:11.920
or maybe it's 50-50,

12:11.920 --> 12:15.680
it just operates like a normal functioning elevator.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.480
Ah, that would be good.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.760
It takes you up to the top,

12:18.240 --> 12:20.400
and then it's like, here we go.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.760
And then it slowly lowers you back down to the ground.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.480
And you get a little speech about expectations

12:26.480 --> 12:27.200
and disappointment.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.840
But then, you don't know which one you're gonna get, right?

12:31.120 --> 12:33.600
I just made it scarier, they're not less scary,

12:33.600 --> 12:34.880
which is what this person asked for.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.240
Griffin, how about this, right?

12:36.800 --> 12:39.520
50-50, one time it operates like a normal elevator,

12:39.520 --> 12:40.880
which is it starts to drop,

12:40.880 --> 12:43.200
but then it opens on like every other floor,

12:43.200 --> 12:44.640
and someone goes, oh, you know what,

12:44.640 --> 12:45.680
I'll get the next one.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.200
And like, so it's just kind of like,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.040
oh, we did, oh, oh.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.600
And you keep thinking the drop is coming,

12:51.600 --> 12:52.960
and just like Skrillex,

12:52.960 --> 12:54.320
you gotta wait for that drop,

12:54.320 --> 12:55.760
and it never comes.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.080
Oh, I mean, I can't stop thinking of ways

12:58.080 --> 12:58.880
to make it scarier,

12:58.880 --> 12:59.920
but I'm thinking about my own

12:59.920 --> 13:01.680
sort of real life elevator fears.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.320
And obviously getting stuck is bad.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.480
That's one way to make it scarier,

13:06.480 --> 13:08.800
is if it also sometimes just like stopped.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.720
But what if the doors open on one floor,

13:10.720 --> 13:12.160
and there was a big family,

13:12.160 --> 13:13.600
all with a bunch of suitcases,

13:13.600 --> 13:14.880
and you knew they were gonna try

13:14.880 --> 13:16.480
to all squeeze on the elevator.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.480
Oh, no.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.960
Hey, listen to this one.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.400
Listen to this joke I got.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.040
All right.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.720
What if on one floor it opened up,

13:25.520 --> 13:28.320
and there was a guy, and he was in a suit,

13:28.320 --> 13:31.200
and his suit just had a bunch of summer squashes on it,

13:31.200 --> 13:37.280
and his name was Reginald Q. Summer Squash,

13:37.280 --> 13:40.480
Summer Squash, and he kind of did his thing.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.000
Now, what's his thing, Justin?

13:42.000 --> 13:42.880
What's his thing, Juice?

13:42.880 --> 13:43.920
Can you describe the...

13:43.920 --> 13:44.480
Exactly.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.640
Oh, okay.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.840
He's his own thing.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.280
I'm really glad you said that, Justin,

13:51.280 --> 13:52.880
because I was gonna make a goof

13:52.880 --> 13:54.640
about like you're on the elevator,

13:54.640 --> 13:56.000
and you know you have to get somewhere important,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.280
but a whole bunch of like people

13:57.840 --> 13:58.960
that just got out of the pool,

13:58.960 --> 14:00.480
and are still like dripping wet get on,

14:00.480 --> 14:00.980
and you're trying.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.680
But your thing about someone in a...

14:05.680 --> 14:07.120
Let me get this again.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.640
Summer Squash suit.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.200
Was that it?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.320
Now, is he by himself?

14:13.360 --> 14:18.160
No, there are two sort of spooky entities with him

14:18.160 --> 14:19.600
to be decided later.

14:19.600 --> 14:23.840
I gotta say, this does remind me of Saturday Night Live bit.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.520
Haven't seen it.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.840
Yeah, well, it was very similar.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.360
Go to bed early on Saturdays.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.520
Typically got a newborn, so...

14:32.160 --> 14:33.520
The bit was called Gilly.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.600
Oh, okay.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.880
Yeah, that was back before I had kids.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.380
Gilly.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.320
You unloved child.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.800
I'll scoop up Gilly.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.680
If no one else here will love the Gilly sketch,

14:45.680 --> 14:47.280
I will take care of Gilly.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.520
Please climb into my satchel, Gilly.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.960
I'll carry you through the wasteland.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.240
I'm here for you, the sketch, Gilly.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.680
My favorite on Saturday Night Live

14:55.680 --> 14:57.840
is when someone's doing an impression of somebody,

14:57.840 --> 15:00.240
and that person actually shows up,

15:00.240 --> 15:02.560
and it's so embarrassing.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.840
How could you do this?

15:03.840 --> 15:08.800
How did you not know that Hillary Clinton was right there?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.600
You didn't know.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.560
I'm right behind you.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.960
Catherine McKinnon was doing an impression of her,

15:12.960 --> 15:14.720
but then the actual Hillary showed up.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.760
How awkward.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.880
Catherine McKinnon, is she your third grade teacher?

15:20.880 --> 15:23.520
Are you on that formal of a basis for this, McKinnon?

15:23.520 --> 15:25.440
You think I'm just gonna be all chummy and be like,

15:25.440 --> 15:27.200
yo, Kate, what's up, buddy?

15:27.200 --> 15:27.760
Special K.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.520
How about a question?

15:29.520 --> 15:31.200
I recently made some new acquaintances

15:31.200 --> 15:33.280
who live just a few blocks away from me.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.120
My friend and I were recently at their place

15:35.120 --> 15:36.560
working on a project,

15:36.560 --> 15:40.400
and we commented on their beautiful enclosed porch,

15:40.400 --> 15:41.360
to which they replied,

15:41.360 --> 15:43.280
oh yeah, you're free to use it anytime,

15:43.280 --> 15:44.400
even if we're not at home.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.240
I was shocked by this offer,

15:48.240 --> 15:50.480
but laughed it off as if they're just joking.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.800
However, my friend said she planned to drop by

15:52.800 --> 15:55.200
and knit on their porch later this week

15:55.200 --> 15:56.400
when they are at work.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.920
Am I right in not hanging out in the home of someone

15:59.920 --> 16:01.920
I don't know very well when they are not there,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.440
or am I missing out?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.280
That's from porch squatter in Portland.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.440
This is unacceptable.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.600
It's clearly unacceptable

16:09.600 --> 16:11.920
because we could get into a debate

16:12.800 --> 16:14.880
about where does house start?

16:14.880 --> 16:18.080
For me, I feel uncomfortable walking in front

16:18.080 --> 16:20.240
of people's houses on the sidewalk sometimes

16:20.240 --> 16:21.760
because if their kids go out there

16:21.760 --> 16:22.960
and do chalk drawings on it,

16:24.000 --> 16:25.280
that's house, baby.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.680
I sometimes feel weird driving by a house

16:27.680 --> 16:29.040
and looking at it too long.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.960
Mm, yeah.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.520
And then your little gold tooth shines and sparkles

16:33.520 --> 16:35.840
because you're planning to steal all their treasures.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.920
Oh, the idea of someone,

16:37.920 --> 16:39.760
I just feel 24 seven,

16:39.760 --> 16:41.920
someone assumes I'm casing the joint.

16:41.920 --> 16:42.480
Yeah, for sure.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.840
So I think we could get into a debate

16:47.840 --> 16:49.760
about if porch is house,

16:49.760 --> 16:53.680
except for the fact that it is an enclosed porch.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.200
When you put walls around it,

16:55.200 --> 16:57.760
hey gang, when you put walls around it,

16:57.760 --> 16:59.440
that's a house, baby.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.240
This is true.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.120
Think about the difference

17:01.120 --> 17:04.000
between garage and driveway, right?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.240
That is basically driveway outside,

17:07.040 --> 17:08.640
garage inside.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.920
That's a house.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.960
And now that's a house.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.240
If I took my kitchen and did sort of a open concept,

17:14.240 --> 17:15.680
that's not what the term traditionally means,

17:15.680 --> 17:17.520
but I knocked down all the walls in the kitchen

17:17.520 --> 17:18.960
and put up screens instead

17:19.840 --> 17:22.320
so that everybody could smell all the great pies

17:22.320 --> 17:23.920
and cookies I'm always making,

17:23.920 --> 17:26.560
then that's still house.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.600
Do you know what I mean?

17:28.400 --> 17:29.600
You can't just go in someone's house

17:29.600 --> 17:30.400
when they're not there.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.000
End of discussion, it feels like, right?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.600
Is there a discussion to be had?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.960
You do have the direct,

17:38.960 --> 17:41.440
the person did directly say,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.280
feel free to use my porch whenever.

17:43.280 --> 17:45.680
I did do this in college though.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.480
I would go to Jason Eldridge's house

17:48.480 --> 17:51.520
and we would all sit on his porch and use his grill.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.240
Even if he wasn't at home, and he was always at home,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.280
so this is theoretical,

17:55.280 --> 17:57.360
but if he wasn't at home,

17:57.360 --> 18:01.440
if he was at Arby's or Office Depot or something,

18:01.440 --> 18:04.800
then we would just sit on his porch.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.400
But I was younger then.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.240
It was a different time.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.880
I think there's an exception to be carved out

18:10.880 --> 18:14.560
for weed and EverQuest dens,

18:14.560 --> 18:17.840
which is kind of what Jason's house was,

18:17.840 --> 18:19.360
I feel like, for you guys.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.400
At that point, it's more of a community space.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.760
It's more of like a neighbor.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.440
It's like 18 to 24,

18:27.040 --> 18:30.400
what we would traditionally think out of as a hangout.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.160
Yeah, it's your peach pit.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.320
Rather than like somebody's family home.

18:34.320 --> 18:39.840
Yes, it's a non-starter.

18:39.840 --> 18:40.960
Let me hit you with this,

18:40.960 --> 18:43.680
how do you guarantee that they're not home?

18:43.680 --> 18:45.440
Because you gotta be sure.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.560
I'm talking about you,

18:46.560 --> 18:49.680
you need to break and enter first just to make sure nobody's home,

18:49.680 --> 18:53.920
and then lock the doors up as you're leaving,

18:53.920 --> 18:55.200
and then you can hang out on the porch,

18:55.200 --> 18:57.840
because can you imagine hanging out on the porch,

18:57.840 --> 18:59.200
and then somebody walks outside like,

18:59.200 --> 19:00.800
what the fuck are you doing?

19:00.800 --> 19:06.080
I'd rather have that than for me to be sitting on the porch

19:06.080 --> 19:07.360
and somebody comes home from work

19:07.360 --> 19:09.440
and they've had like a terrible day at work,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.440
or like their boss yelled at them,

19:11.440 --> 19:13.280
and they didn't get their shit done,

19:13.280 --> 19:14.160
and it's just like,

19:14.160 --> 19:16.880
hey buddy, just me reading on your porch, drinking some lemonade.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.320
You sure do look rough.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.120
And it's just like, get the fuck out of here.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.200
This is my fucking castle.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.800
Eventually, you're right, Travis,

19:24.800 --> 19:25.760
if you do this every day,

19:25.760 --> 19:27.200
eventually there will come a day

19:27.200 --> 19:29.360
when they're like, get off my porch.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.960
I need this porch today.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.320
This is important right now.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.360
Did you schedule this?

19:35.360 --> 19:39.760
I hung up a thing and it says mine on every day.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.480
Get out.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.760
That's the reason I get it.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.720
Every day, get out, the reason I couldn't do this

19:44.720 --> 19:46.400
is because it's not in my house.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.720
I'm like a toddler with the number of accessories

19:48.720 --> 19:49.840
that I require.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.120
What if I got there and I realized that my Pepsi Max,

19:54.080 --> 19:57.040
because it was in a useless 20 ounce plastic bottle,

19:57.600 --> 20:00.320
got warm because all plastic bottles do instantly

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
the second you take them out of refrigeration.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.160
It got warm and now I have a warm drink.

20:04.160 --> 20:04.800
What do I do now?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.080
Well, I guess I drive home.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.840
I guess now I have to get in my car

20:07.840 --> 20:08.960
and drive back to my house.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.640
Also, the problem is that they invited you to use the porch.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.560
So if you don't use the porch, it's gonna be rude.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.680
You gotta do something pretty heinous on that porch

20:17.680 --> 20:20.000
to get that invite revoked.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.360
Do you know what I mean?

20:21.360 --> 20:24.320
And then you won't have this problem anymore.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.440
So I don't know what that looks like.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
I don't know if that means leaving a bunch of ham slices

20:27.440 --> 20:28.000
all over.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.960
I don't know if it means leaving a bunch of roast beef slices

20:30.960 --> 20:32.000
all over.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.560
I don't know if it means hiding pepperonis.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.360
Unless.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.520
Unless.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.020
Unless.

20:38.020 --> 20:42.360
Unless you start making improvements to the porch

20:42.360 --> 20:44.520
because Justin's made me think like maybe you set up

20:44.520 --> 20:46.520
like a mini fridge out there, right?

20:46.520 --> 20:49.320
You make enough improvements until now it's fair use

20:49.320 --> 20:50.360
and it's your porch.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.240
It's our porch.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.160
I've remixed it fair use.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.760
It's a fair use porch.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.560
Yeah.

20:55.560 --> 20:56.360
That could be good.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.800
What if you buy me a mini fridge I hate

20:59.800 --> 21:00.920
and then I can't just,

21:00.920 --> 21:03.240
I was gonna get a mini fridge next week.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.880
Now you've bought me one I hate and I can't justify it.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.400
I'm stuck with this one.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.320
It's got room for half a Coke.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.520
The other half sticks out the top of it.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.920
It only cools the bottom half of the can of Coke.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.960
Why did you get this terrible fridge?

21:18.920 --> 21:19.800
It was on sale.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.040
There's three baby teeth in it.

21:22.040 --> 21:22.600
Like what?

21:22.600 --> 21:23.320
Does this use?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.200
Was this someone who was storing baby teeth in?

21:27.480 --> 21:28.680
It only cools half a Coke?

21:30.680 --> 21:32.280
Maytag has a new fridge

21:32.280 --> 21:34.040
and they put the baby teeth right in there

21:34.040 --> 21:37.080
because it's supposedly soaked up the stink really good.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.840
I don't know if you ever smelled the baby tooth before

21:38.840 --> 21:41.000
but good God.

21:41.000 --> 21:41.800
Yeah, it's rough.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.400
This Yahoo was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

21:45.400 --> 21:45.960
Thank you, Graham.

21:45.960 --> 21:49.640
It's Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks,

21:50.600 --> 21:53.720
how do you, let me read a voice.

21:55.240 --> 21:59.640
How do you eat a hot dog in a fancy way?

22:01.880 --> 22:03.560
And then there's a picture of a hot dog.

22:04.920 --> 22:05.960
Just for reference?

22:05.960 --> 22:09.240
Yeah, it's a big Frank, big thick Frank.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.120
Big Francis.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.040
With a line of mustard on it.

22:12.840 --> 22:15.720
How do you, excuse me.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.960
I'm going to the marina later

22:17.960 --> 22:20.440
and some of my fellow business,

22:20.440 --> 22:22.840
I don't even know what like fancy people sound like.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.240
Maybe it's like Downton Abbey,

22:25.240 --> 22:27.960
but an episode where they all crush some dogs.

22:29.960 --> 22:30.680
You know what I mean?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.040
So like Matthew comes in, he's like,

22:32.040 --> 22:36.120
Uncle, look what I've discovered from the Americas.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.680
They're like our sausages,

22:38.680 --> 22:43.160
but they don't taste like any sort of discernible thing.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.000
They call them wieners.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.400
They call them wieners like a dick, uncle.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.880
So I've invited the Duchess over for dogs

22:54.520 --> 22:58.200
and I'm trying to figure out how not to get mustard

22:58.200 --> 23:00.280
on my fancy boy gloves.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.240
And I tried biting into one of them

23:03.240 --> 23:04.840
and it expressed a juice

23:04.840 --> 23:07.240
that managed to get all over my frock.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.320
And so uncle, uncle, help me eat the hot dog in a fancy way.

23:11.320 --> 23:14.360
There's no scene in Downton Abbey

23:14.360 --> 23:18.120
that would not be improved by one or more of the characters

23:18.120 --> 23:21.640
enjoying a hot dog as it continued.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.960
What if just once there was a really dramatic thing,

23:23.960 --> 23:25.400
you've lost it all, how could,

23:25.400 --> 23:27.560
and as it panned across there's just a servant

23:27.560 --> 23:30.600
sitting in a chair and he's eating a hot dog

23:30.600 --> 23:34.360
just as it like just kind of goes past in a tracking shot.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.560
And you're just like, wait, hold on.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.600
Is that the under butler just eating a hot dog?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.080
I think that guy's eating a hot,

23:41.080 --> 23:44.360
is Lady Crawley eating, oh my God, it's a hot dog.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.240
She's got like five of them on a paper plate.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.160
That's the episode.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.760
She's an American.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.800
And so she can eat the dogs and bring them all in

23:55.800 --> 23:58.440
and she'll be like, oh, you guys are gonna love this.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.040
I don't know, it looks like one of our sausages,

24:02.040 --> 24:03.400
but it stinks a lot.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.880
She's got like a paper plate of hot dogs

24:05.880 --> 24:08.840
and like a two liter of like store brand root beer.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.520
And like that's it.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.400
That's it.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.800
And then maybe the servants are all eating it

24:13.800 --> 24:15.480
and all the rich people are like,

24:15.480 --> 24:18.280
I would never eat the hot dog.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.600
A hot dog, how could you?

24:20.600 --> 24:23.240
You've heated the dog, it stinks so bad.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.880
Why do I wanna eat it and watch baseball?

24:25.880 --> 24:26.920
And then they all do.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.480
And then they're like, you know what, pores?

24:29.480 --> 24:32.200
Maybe we have more in common than I initially thought.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.440
Now hand me a, do we drink the hot dog water?

24:37.320 --> 24:40.680
What do we do with the water left over from the hot dogs?

24:40.680 --> 24:42.600
Bring me more tubular meat.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.960
Give me a split bun and some tubular meat.

24:45.960 --> 24:50.200
And then they decide that only they can have hot dogs

24:50.200 --> 24:52.520
and they don't let the servants have them anymore

24:52.520 --> 24:53.400
because now they're-

24:53.400 --> 24:55.720
You can have this lobster and filet mignon.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.120
Give me another one of those round boys.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.200
And then there's an episode

25:00.200 --> 25:05.480
because Lord Grantham is only eating hot dogs

25:05.480 --> 25:06.600
and it's been three weeks.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.320
He just loves them so much

25:09.320 --> 25:12.360
but it's the only thing he'll put into his body

25:12.360 --> 25:14.520
so that he's become wracked with illness.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.040
And then World War II happens.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.440
And then there's no more hot dogs.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.280
They gotta send all their hot dogs to hands.

25:20.280 --> 25:20.840
To the war effort.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.360
The Titanic sank.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.480
There were 20 tons of hot dogs on the Titanic.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.160
No.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.000
Did someone think of the hot dogs?

25:29.560 --> 25:32.200
All of those round boys at the bottom of the ocean

25:32.200 --> 25:34.040
getting eaten by those fish.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.360
How much better would Titanic have been

25:36.360 --> 25:41.080
if at the end an old woman threw a hot dog into the ocean

25:41.080 --> 25:44.440
and you watched it for 40 minutes

25:44.440 --> 25:48.440
as it disintegrated in the water

25:48.440 --> 25:51.640
and then it sunk and it landed on the jewel of the ocean,

25:51.640 --> 25:52.440
the heart of the ocean.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
How do you eat a hot dog in a fancy way?

25:56.760 --> 25:58.360
If I ever saw somebody with a knife and fork

25:58.360 --> 25:59.240
I would call the police.

26:00.200 --> 26:00.680
So that's out.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.120
So that's out.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.480
I think you dip it in water to help you eat it faster.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.360
That's what Kobayashi-

26:06.360 --> 26:07.080
I'm sorry.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.400
You've watched Joey Chestnut do his work

26:10.120 --> 26:11.000
and then you thought,

26:12.120 --> 26:13.640
wow, what a fancy fucking gentleman.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.840
What a fancy bully.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.320
You've thought that.

26:15.320 --> 26:16.280
That's the thing.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.400
Think this way Griffin, right?

26:17.400 --> 26:21.480
Have you ever been impressed by someone eating hot dogs

26:21.480 --> 26:23.640
outside of a hot dog eating competition?

26:24.360 --> 26:27.160
No, but I've never watched a hot dog eating competition

26:27.160 --> 26:30.600
and thought anybody there was fancy in any way.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.560
Well, it depends on how you define fancy, doesn't it?

26:33.560 --> 26:36.920
Because yeah, if you're talking fucking Downton Abbey, no.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.800
But if you're talking like skateboard trick fancy?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.800
If there's no fancy way to eat a hot dog,

26:43.000 --> 26:46.360
then the best you can do is get it over with

26:46.360 --> 26:52.520
quickly so you have more time for like cotillion classes

26:52.520 --> 26:54.840
or what the fuck ever fancy people did.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.400
I see.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.400
So if you blaze through the dogs,

26:57.400 --> 27:02.200
then it's like you have plenty of time to go like,

27:02.200 --> 27:05.880
you know, polish your shoes or-

27:05.880 --> 27:06.440
Yes.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.680
If you pair the hot dog eating with a fancy thing.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.160
Why?

27:11.160 --> 27:11.960
If you, oh.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.560
Hot dog, why?

27:13.560 --> 27:14.060
Why?

27:14.060 --> 27:16.060
Why?

27:16.060 --> 27:17.260
Okay, so-

27:17.260 --> 27:20.540
The meat might not be fancy, but boy, this-

27:23.980 --> 27:26.780
Name a wine, name a wine, name any wine.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.220
The Chardonnay that we-

27:28.220 --> 27:29.420
You pair it with Chardonnay.

27:29.420 --> 27:33.580
You would not, oh, hot dog with Chardonnay, Justin.

27:33.580 --> 27:36.860
I just wanted to say, I Googled hot dog wine

27:36.860 --> 27:41.020
and the top result is the Marshall Hall of Fame Cafe

27:41.020 --> 27:42.220
in Huntington, Virginia.

27:42.220 --> 27:44.140
I don't know if they have a dish.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.500
Don't boil it in water.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.860
Boil it in wine.

27:46.860 --> 27:48.940
Boil those wieners in wine.

27:48.940 --> 27:50.300
Make them wine-ers.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.620
Oh, these Franks will get you fucked, dog.

27:53.260 --> 27:54.220
Oh my God.

27:55.420 --> 27:59.260
These are Griffin McElroy's 100% alcoholic hot dogs.

28:01.020 --> 28:02.540
You're going to love these.

28:02.540 --> 28:05.340
I bet the Dave Matthews Band wine pairs really nicely

28:05.340 --> 28:06.140
with a hot dog.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.660
If you're going to Frank down,

28:09.660 --> 28:13.260
I think maybe have some of the Dave Matthews Band wine.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.220
That would be so good.

28:14.220 --> 28:17.820
Or maybe some of Sting's wine.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.460
Yeah.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.380
Wait, can we go back to the Dave Matthews Band wine?

28:22.380 --> 28:23.900
Cause I just got there and it's,

28:25.100 --> 28:27.660
it'll drink you under the table and dreaming.

28:27.660 --> 28:28.140
Thank you.

28:28.140 --> 28:28.700
There it is.

28:28.700 --> 28:32.780
Yeah, it took me a second, but I wanted to circle back.

28:32.780 --> 28:33.820
Okay, good job.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.220
Those are many fancy ways of being a hot dog.

28:36.220 --> 28:38.540
And now I would welcome you all right this way.

28:38.540 --> 28:42.780
Through the adjoining chamber into here, the money zone.

28:42.780 --> 28:44.780
For cigars and brandy and hot dogs.

28:55.340 --> 28:57.100
I want to tell you about Casper.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.220
Then do it, coward.

28:58.220 --> 29:01.580
Casper, one, supports my brother, my brother and me,

29:01.580 --> 29:05.020
but also supports you while you sleep.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.380
I have a Casper mattress.

29:06.380 --> 29:08.700
I have a Casper mattress, I sleep on it.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.580
When I, this is very good.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.340
Yeah, listen, this is not a joke.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.020
When we tour, I love getting out there,

29:15.020 --> 29:18.620
seeing the fans, doing our goofs, hitting the road.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.740
But you know what I don't love?

29:20.620 --> 29:22.460
Being away from my Casper mattress.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.820
Now here's the thing you're thinking.

29:23.820 --> 29:26.060
Oh, this sounds too good to be true.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.460
It must be super expensive.

29:28.460 --> 29:29.340
No, no, no.

29:29.340 --> 29:32.300
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out

29:32.300 --> 29:34.780
the middleman and sells directly to the consumer.

29:34.780 --> 29:37.260
It's a great deal and a great mattress.

29:37.980 --> 29:40.300
They combine multiple supportive memory phones

29:40.300 --> 29:42.700
for a quality sleep service with the right amount.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.140
And you're thinking, oh, what?

29:44.140 --> 29:45.980
Right amount of sink or bounce?

29:45.980 --> 29:50.380
No, no, no, both sink and bounce.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.540
And you can be sure of your purchase

29:52.540 --> 29:56.700
because Casper is 100 night risk-free sleep audit trial.

29:56.700 --> 29:59.580
Right now you can get $50 towards select mattresses

30:14.220 --> 30:17.020
Can I tell you about Audible?

30:17.020 --> 30:19.100
Do you use Audible as much as I do?

30:19.100 --> 30:19.980
Because I use it.

30:19.980 --> 30:20.860
I use it more.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.140
I probably use it most.

30:22.140 --> 30:23.100
How much do you use it?

30:23.100 --> 30:24.540
Go ahead, Justin.

30:24.540 --> 30:25.900
I love Audible.

30:26.620 --> 30:29.660
They have lots of books that you can listen to

30:29.660 --> 30:32.460
and it's much better than podcasts

30:32.460 --> 30:34.460
because at the end of listening to a podcast,

30:34.460 --> 30:36.060
you're like, uh, fine.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.260
At the end of listening to a book,

30:37.260 --> 30:38.460
you're like, I'm better.

30:39.740 --> 30:40.940
I've grown.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.180
I'm a better person now.

30:43.180 --> 30:45.500
Audible has an unmatched selection of audiobook

30:45.500 --> 30:47.340
and spoken word audio products.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.100
Audible is the internet's leading provider

30:49.100 --> 30:50.700
of spoken word entertainment.

30:50.700 --> 30:53.180
They're great for helping you be a better you

30:53.180 --> 30:54.460
whether you wanna feel healthier,

30:54.460 --> 30:57.340
get motivated or learn something new.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.460
Our listeners might enjoy,

31:00.460 --> 31:02.860
what am I listening to right now?

31:02.860 --> 31:03.260
I don't know.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.580
You just set up that reading books makes you better

31:05.580 --> 31:06.380
and so good luck.

31:06.940 --> 31:07.980
Can you find one?

31:09.340 --> 31:11.100
Well, I just wanted to pick one to highlight.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.620
I know, but it's gotta be a book

31:12.620 --> 31:13.740
that when you read it, it makes you better.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.980
You know what's so good that I just finished actually?

31:16.860 --> 31:19.420
Jake Gyllenhaal reads The Great Gatsby.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.620
So good.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.540
He does an amazing reading of it.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.140
I read it.

31:26.140 --> 31:27.580
Did I read it just so I could listen

31:27.580 --> 31:29.500
to the book club episode of A Flow for the Magic Tower?

31:29.500 --> 31:31.020
No, yes.

31:31.020 --> 31:33.660
But Jake Gyllenhaal does a magnificent job with that.

31:34.780 --> 31:35.980
Can I recommend one?

31:35.980 --> 31:36.220
Yeah.

31:37.420 --> 31:43.180
I really liked Vincent D'Onofrio reads Guy Fieri Family Food

31:43.180 --> 31:46.460
125 Real Deal Recipes Kitchen Tested Home Approved.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.420
Man, Griffin, I gotta go get a fucking towel

31:49.420 --> 31:51.420
to clean my computer, you dick.

31:51.420 --> 31:52.060
You got him.

31:53.420 --> 31:54.940
Let me recommend a whole bunch.

31:54.940 --> 31:59.340
I recommend Stiff, The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers

31:59.340 --> 32:00.140
by Mary Roach.

32:00.140 --> 32:01.260
It's very educational.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.220
Allison Rosen just put out a book

32:04.220 --> 32:06.460
that's about tropical attire encouraged

32:06.460 --> 32:09.740
and other phrases that scare me.

32:09.740 --> 32:10.620
It's very good.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.860
I just accidentally played it.

32:12.860 --> 32:15.420
And you can find basically, I think,

32:15.420 --> 32:19.580
all of the Poirot novels or the Agatha Christie's Poirot novels

32:19.580 --> 32:26.220
read by Hugh Frazier, who was in the Poirot Masterpiece Theater series.

32:26.220 --> 32:27.500
It's really good.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.380
Highly recommend.

32:29.260 --> 32:30.060
I actually have another.

32:30.060 --> 32:30.700
I have a real one.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.500
Hey, literally, time out.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.700
Stop the show, because I have to stop this recording

32:37.500 --> 32:38.940
so I can clean my computer.

32:38.940 --> 32:39.340
Oh, God, Justin.

32:39.340 --> 32:40.700
Because it's fucking covered in coffee.

32:41.340 --> 32:43.740
Because you're dumb ass dumb garbage.

32:43.740 --> 32:45.740
I actually, I have a real recommendation

32:45.740 --> 32:47.660
if I can do it real quick, because my other one was a joke.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.300
But I think the audible would appreciate it more

32:50.300 --> 32:51.900
if I gave a real recommendation.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.580
Now, we just stopped for five minutes

32:53.580 --> 32:54.540
so I could clean my stuff.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.740
No, this one's not a joke.

32:55.740 --> 32:56.460
This one's not a joke.

32:56.460 --> 32:57.660
So it's not going to make you laugh so hard

32:57.660 --> 32:58.140
you spill your coffee.

32:58.140 --> 32:59.820
So it's OK for me to go ahead and get some coffee.

32:59.820 --> 33:02.300
Yeah, get a big sip.

33:02.300 --> 33:03.420
I'm just getting some coffee here.

33:03.420 --> 33:05.340
Yeah, a big sip and hold it in your hands.

33:05.340 --> 33:08.060
So what I want to recommend is actually,

33:08.060 --> 33:09.820
so Maggie Smith from Downton Abbey,

33:09.820 --> 33:11.260
it's funny we were just talking about it,

33:11.260 --> 33:13.660
did a reading of Guy Fieri Family Food,

33:13.660 --> 33:17.100
125 Real Deal Recipes Kitchen Test at Home Proved.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.300
That was really good.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.700
And she reads it.

33:22.300 --> 33:27.020
The trash can nachos will move you to tears and diarrhea.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.620
OK, let's end on a real one,

33:28.620 --> 33:30.380
because I was really excited when I found this.

33:31.020 --> 33:33.740
The Series of Unfortunate Events series.

33:33.740 --> 33:35.100
Read by Guy Fieri.

33:35.100 --> 33:35.660
It's really good.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.180
As read by Tim Curry.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.380
Oh, that's even better.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.260
Yeah, is that real?

33:39.260 --> 33:40.540
Yeah, it rules.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.060
Anyway, Audible's offering our listeners

33:42.060 --> 33:43.340
a free 30-day trial membership.

33:43.340 --> 33:45.820
Get a free audiobook with a 30-day trial today by signing up.

33:45.820 --> 33:47.340
Go to audible.com slash my brother

33:47.340 --> 33:51.020
or text my brother to 500-500 to get started.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.140
And I read that last bit,

33:52.140 --> 33:55.340
so I think Travis should read the first Jumbotron here.

33:55.980 --> 34:00.460
OK, this is for Joe, and it's from Candace.

34:00.460 --> 34:01.740
Hi, boobles.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.620
Yeah, that's right.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.140
I said boobles.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.740
I'm sending my message of love

34:05.740 --> 34:08.860
and caring out on the airways for the cutest babe ever.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.620
Love, your sweet, sweet girlfriend, Candace.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.780
Um.

34:14.780 --> 34:15.900
Deal with it.

34:15.900 --> 34:16.700
Deal with it.

34:16.700 --> 34:17.580
Handle it.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.660
Why did I take such an aggressive tone?

34:20.460 --> 34:20.940
I don't know.

34:20.940 --> 34:24.140
Boobles read with that, and now I've said it.

34:24.140 --> 34:28.780
But read with that sort of that fury, that passion.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.860
It was really something to behold.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.940
I think maybe it's a that's right,

34:32.940 --> 34:35.020
because it kind of reads as if someone just said,

34:35.020 --> 34:35.900
what did you say?

34:35.900 --> 34:38.060
And I was like, yeah, that's right.

34:38.060 --> 34:39.260
I heard you reading that, Travis.

34:39.260 --> 34:41.980
I thought, this is the episode that's gonna get us the webby.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.020
Here's a Yahoo.

34:43.020 --> 34:43.660
Nope.

34:43.660 --> 34:45.260
Here's a Jumbotron.

34:45.900 --> 34:46.400
Yeah.

34:47.260 --> 34:50.780
Here's a Jumbotron for Zach, and it's from Fred the Human,

34:50.780 --> 34:55.820
Kaz, Elden Toss Cobble, Donara, Nethgoria, RIP,

34:55.820 --> 34:59.660
and Morniel, who say, this is the unskippable cut scene

34:59.660 --> 35:00.700
where you get a Jumbotron,

35:00.700 --> 35:02.540
so don't jump in a portable hole

35:02.540 --> 35:04.140
and fly away on a spectral horse.

35:04.940 --> 35:05.660
What's this?

35:05.660 --> 35:06.860
What are they talking about?

35:06.860 --> 35:07.980
It's so fanciful.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.220
A portable hole?

35:10.220 --> 35:12.380
It's magic and fanciful.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.620
I feel like I'm in a real Harry Potter book.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.540
Thanks for putting up with us

35:16.540 --> 35:19.980
and for introducing most of us to D&D and Taz.

35:19.980 --> 35:21.740
Happy whatever holiday is closest

35:21.740 --> 35:23.260
to when the McElroys read this.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.300
So Earth Day.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.100
Welcome to Earth.

35:25.820 --> 35:26.700
Welcome to Earth.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.200
Day.

35:27.820 --> 35:28.320
Day.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.900
What if he had said that?

35:31.900 --> 35:33.660
Because it was Earth Day when it happened.

35:33.660 --> 35:34.540
Welcome to Earth Day.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.140
Welcome to Earth Day.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.420
Or what if he had punched me and said,

35:37.420 --> 35:38.620
like, welcome to Good Burger.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.860
Home of the Good Burger.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.460
What if you kissed him instead?

35:42.460 --> 35:44.300
I have something I'd like you two to read.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.580
It's called What If You Kissed Him Instead.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.620
Let me do this one.

35:48.620 --> 35:52.300
This is for Ryan W. and Josie G. from Alphazor.

35:52.860 --> 35:54.460
Josie, you almost crashed a car

35:54.460 --> 35:56.860
because the tower was too dang tall

35:56.860 --> 35:59.500
and then you used Shelby's towel.

35:59.500 --> 36:01.900
I hope no student of yours, yo, teaches you

36:01.900 --> 36:03.100
and I'm lucky to be your friend.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.220
Happy B-day.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.100
Ryan, happy B-day

36:05.100 --> 36:06.460
and thanks for being such a great brother.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.340
I'm really proud of you

36:07.340 --> 36:08.540
and I love you a lot.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.940
I just wish you listened to my bim bam

36:10.940 --> 36:11.420
so you could hear it.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.340
Just shouting into the void.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.300
Just screaming at the night sky.

36:16.300 --> 36:16.800
Brother!

36:17.500 --> 36:18.000
Brother!

36:18.620 --> 36:20.300
I communicate to you through podcasts.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.100
You don't listen to.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.180
Welcome everyone to the live wrestling

36:25.180 --> 36:27.260
spectacular in Los Angeles.

36:27.260 --> 36:29.260
So far the world's most boring wrestling

36:29.260 --> 36:31.980
podcast has been destroying the competition.

36:31.980 --> 36:34.140
Isn't there anyone who can save us

36:34.140 --> 36:35.740
from this travesty?

36:35.740 --> 36:37.660
Wait, could it be?

36:37.660 --> 36:38.940
It's tights and fights.

36:38.940 --> 36:40.700
The perfect wrestling podcast.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.900
Tights and fights is here to save us

36:43.900 --> 36:46.620
from the monotony of boring wrestling podcasts

36:46.620 --> 36:48.300
with hilarious conversations.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.340
Woke trips through the history of wrestling.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.100
And joke about the finer points

36:53.100 --> 36:54.940
of people wearing spandex.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.780
What a match!

37:00.780 --> 37:02.220
And the tights and fights podcast

37:02.220 --> 37:03.660
will be back every week.

37:03.660 --> 37:06.060
Thursdays on Maximumfun.org

37:06.060 --> 37:08.060
or wherever you get podcasts.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.060
Please, these hosts have families.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.060
Tights and fights.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.060
Podcast.

37:14.060 --> 37:20.060
Tights and fights.

37:20.060 --> 37:23.020
Excuse me, gentlemen.

37:23.020 --> 37:24.300
I have a game.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.100
A very fun game.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.060
Is it a new bit?

37:29.180 --> 37:30.060
It's a new bit.

37:30.060 --> 37:31.020
It's a new game.

37:31.740 --> 37:32.780
I think we can only play it once.

37:32.780 --> 37:34.140
I don't know if it's going to be recurring.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.340
It might, you know what?

37:35.340 --> 37:36.540
We could probably play it more than once.

37:37.180 --> 37:38.620
I am going to give you-

37:38.620 --> 37:40.860
Do you think Ellen said the same thing?

37:40.860 --> 37:42.220
Like, I've got-

37:42.220 --> 37:43.020
I'm gonna dance.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.100
I've got this, I'm gonna dance once.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.100
We'll see.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.380
You think Jimmy Fallon was like,

37:48.380 --> 37:50.620
I'm gonna do a game with you,

37:50.620 --> 37:52.140
Dwayne, the Rock Johnson,

37:52.140 --> 37:53.580
but this is the only one.

37:53.580 --> 37:55.820
So don't ask me to do any more games.

37:56.540 --> 38:00.220
No, this is a game that I'm going to play with you.

38:00.220 --> 38:02.140
I'm going to play with you.

38:02.140 --> 38:06.140
This is called Celebrity Wine, Why Not?

38:06.940 --> 38:07.900
Okay.

38:07.900 --> 38:11.740
That's the name of the game is Celebrity Wine, Why Not?

38:11.740 --> 38:12.460
Okay.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.020
And you can spell it however you think is like funniest.

38:15.020 --> 38:15.980
I'm not a big pun guy,

38:15.980 --> 38:19.500
but I'm going to name some celebrity wines

38:19.500 --> 38:22.060
and their score from Wine Enthusiast.

38:22.060 --> 38:24.700
Their rating from Wine Enthusiast.

38:24.700 --> 38:25.900
What's that scale go up to, 100?

38:26.780 --> 38:28.860
It is a scale of 100 and like straight.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.300
I'm just going to be straight with you.

38:30.300 --> 38:35.660
There is no wine on this that rates below 82 points.

38:35.660 --> 38:37.100
Oh, okay.

38:37.100 --> 38:40.140
So it's like 82 to 100.

38:40.140 --> 38:41.900
How bad do you think your wine would have to be

38:41.900 --> 38:43.020
to get like a one?

38:43.020 --> 38:45.580
Would it just be like water and like dirty water?

38:45.580 --> 38:49.100
I think Coke Zero gets a one, not wine.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.340
To give you some sense of what we're talking about,

38:51.340 --> 38:52.460
how limited the scale is here,

38:52.460 --> 38:57.340
we're actually talking about 82 to 95 is the scale.

38:57.340 --> 38:59.180
If it's 82, it fucking sucks.

38:59.180 --> 39:02.380
Like we can all agree they're on the video game review scale.

39:02.380 --> 39:04.620
If it's an 82, it's fucking garbage.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.100
So I'm going to have you, here's the game.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.300
I'm going to give you a,

39:09.420 --> 39:12.220
I have a list of celebrities

39:12.220 --> 39:15.100
that I'm going to share with you boys right now.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.340
And you are going to be able to pull from this list.

39:19.340 --> 39:21.580
We're not going to share this with the audience

39:21.580 --> 39:22.700
so they can get,

39:22.700 --> 39:27.180
it'll be a little bit more out of left field for them.

39:27.180 --> 39:27.820
I think.

39:27.820 --> 39:29.500
So I'm sharing this list with you

39:29.500 --> 39:31.100
and these are all the celebrities

39:31.900 --> 39:34.540
that are in my list here.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.820
So I am going to tell you the name of the wine.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.220
You're going to tell me the celebrity

39:40.220 --> 39:42.460
and then you're going to guess the score.

39:42.460 --> 39:43.020
The score.

39:43.020 --> 39:43.740
Okay, okay.

39:43.740 --> 39:44.300
Yes.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.100
Are you ready?

39:45.100 --> 39:45.420
Yes.

39:46.060 --> 39:48.780
Some of these will be easier than others.

39:48.780 --> 39:52.300
The name of this wine is 2007 Discovery Series Chardonnay.

39:53.420 --> 39:54.380
That's Mike Ditkas.

39:54.380 --> 39:59.580
It's not Mike Ditkas wine.

39:59.580 --> 40:02.140
My Ditkas football touchdown juice.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.740
I'm going to say Drew Barrymore.

40:05.740 --> 40:06.140
It does.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.340
You're both incorrect.

40:07.340 --> 40:08.700
It's Dan Aykroyd.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.020
Damn.

40:09.020 --> 40:11.980
Dan Aykroyd made the 2007 Discovery Series Chardonnay

40:11.980 --> 40:13.020
from Sonoma County.

40:13.020 --> 40:14.460
Wine Enthusiast gave it a,

40:15.260 --> 40:15.820
I'm going to say,

40:16.860 --> 40:17.980
I'm going to say 83.

40:17.980 --> 40:18.380
Not good.

40:18.380 --> 40:19.180
87.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.020
Holy shit.

40:21.020 --> 40:23.580
Griffin McElroy, 83 points.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.500
It's one step above toilet wine.

40:25.500 --> 40:25.900
It is.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.340
83 exactly.

40:27.340 --> 40:27.740
Booyah.

40:27.740 --> 40:29.580
You got the exact right thing.

40:29.580 --> 40:30.460
So guessed it.

40:30.460 --> 40:31.820
So where'd he go wrong?

40:31.820 --> 40:33.900
What'd he do bad to get there?

40:33.900 --> 40:37.020
It's tart and jammy with acidic one-dimensional flavors

40:37.020 --> 40:39.260
of pineapples, vanillas, and butterscotch.

40:39.260 --> 40:40.380
Now I will say this.

40:41.180 --> 40:42.700
I don't think if you're,

40:42.700 --> 40:45.740
I don't want to call Wine Enthusiast on their bullshit,

40:45.740 --> 40:48.220
but you can't say it's got one-dimensional flavors

40:48.220 --> 40:50.060
of pineapples, vanilla, and butterscotch

40:50.060 --> 40:51.980
because it sounds like Dan has summed it up

40:51.980 --> 40:55.020
at least three discrete flavors there.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.900
But they don't have distance, Justin.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.060
It's like two different pineapples.

41:00.060 --> 41:01.100
Like, fuck you guys.

41:01.100 --> 41:01.980
Seriously.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.100
With the 83 though,

41:03.100 --> 41:06.940
it sounds like my boy Dan took some pineapples

41:06.940 --> 41:09.100
and like vanilla pudding and butterscotch,

41:09.100 --> 41:11.420
blended it all up in a food processor,

41:11.420 --> 41:13.980
and then dumped that into some three buck chuck.

41:13.980 --> 41:15.820
83, are you fucking kidding me?

41:15.820 --> 41:17.820
And 83 betwixt these lips?

41:17.820 --> 41:18.780
No way.

41:18.780 --> 41:19.340
No, no way.

41:19.340 --> 41:21.980
We have standards.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.020
Okay, this, I want to do an easier one.

41:25.020 --> 41:28.300
Number 99 Icewine Cabernet Franc.

41:28.300 --> 41:32.060
Number 99 Icewine, you say?

41:32.060 --> 41:34.460
Number 99 Icewine Cabernet Franc.

41:34.460 --> 41:36.780
Oh, this is Mr. Jeffrey Gordon.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.100
I would also say Jeffrey Gordon.

41:39.820 --> 41:41.900
No, it's Wayne Gretzky.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.420
Oh, is that his number?

41:43.420 --> 41:44.300
Icewine.

41:44.300 --> 41:44.540
Yeah.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.740
Yeah, didn't see that name on the list.

41:47.740 --> 41:52.700
Yeah, now name me the score that Wayne got for his wine he did.

41:52.700 --> 41:53.900
I'm going to say 99.

41:53.900 --> 41:54.620
Oh, that's perfect.

41:54.620 --> 41:56.300
I'm actually going to say 89.

41:56.300 --> 41:58.380
Wayne got 92 points from one and two.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.380
This is very good ice wine.

42:00.380 --> 42:01.340
Holy shit.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.100
Wayne, you shouldn't have.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.300
A medium cherry in color with notes of raspberry jam.

42:06.300 --> 42:07.100
Wet stone.

42:09.900 --> 42:11.260
Tastes like a wet rock.

42:11.260 --> 42:11.980
I love it.

42:11.980 --> 42:13.180
93 points.

42:13.180 --> 42:19.900
Hey, Wayne, your wine tastes like wet rocks and ba-da-ba-ba-ba.

42:19.900 --> 42:20.780
I'm loving it.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.540
Thank you, Wayne.

42:25.660 --> 42:27.580
2014 Casa de Metz.

42:29.100 --> 42:33.500
Thompson Grenache from Santa Barbara County.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.460
If it's Santa Barbara, I do think this one's Drew Barrymore.

42:36.460 --> 42:37.500
I think it's Drew Barrymore.

42:37.500 --> 42:44.940
It's Emilio Estevez's Casa de Metz 2014 Thompson Grenache from Santa Barbara County.

42:44.940 --> 42:46.460
Wine Enthusiast gives it a...

42:47.340 --> 42:48.060
94.

42:49.260 --> 42:49.820
86.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.540
92 points for Emilio.

42:52.540 --> 42:57.020
The bottling shows very fresh cherry juice and dried roses,

42:57.020 --> 43:00.380
as well as inviting splashes of Dr. Pepper cola nut.

43:02.860 --> 43:03.820
Hold on.

43:03.820 --> 43:08.460
Hi, I'm a professional wine critic, and this tastes like Dr. Pepper.

43:08.460 --> 43:09.420
Hold on.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.180
Who the doctor is in this bottle?

43:15.020 --> 43:16.220
Let's do one more.

43:19.100 --> 43:21.100
Let's do the highest.

43:22.780 --> 43:24.060
No, I don't want to give that away.

43:24.860 --> 43:25.420
Here's one.

43:27.420 --> 43:28.220
2014.

43:28.780 --> 43:29.580
One more?

43:29.580 --> 43:30.460
One more again?

43:30.460 --> 43:34.620
And what's the city of origin?

43:34.620 --> 43:35.980
I'm going to tell you...

43:35.980 --> 43:38.700
Oh, it's Pinot Noir.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.300
Vin de France.

43:41.820 --> 43:42.140
French.

43:42.140 --> 43:43.740
Chateau de Thigne 2014.

43:44.940 --> 43:47.020
And the name of the person is actually in this wine,

43:47.020 --> 43:49.740
so I can't read the whole name of the wine because that would be cheating.

43:49.740 --> 43:50.700
Okay, so...

43:50.700 --> 43:51.260
One more time.

43:51.260 --> 43:51.900
Mike Dicke.

43:52.460 --> 43:53.180
The name of it?

43:53.820 --> 43:55.180
Chateau de Thigne.

43:55.180 --> 43:58.300
It's Drew Bledsoe's Chateau de Thigne.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.420
Chateau de Thigne.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.380
I'm going to say...

44:01.340 --> 44:02.860
Wait, can I change wine?

44:04.380 --> 44:06.220
I'm going to say Gérard Depardieu.

44:06.220 --> 44:07.980
I'm going to guess Bas Skagg.

44:07.980 --> 44:14.060
It is Chateau de Thigne 2014, Gérard Depardieu, Pinot Noir, Vin de France.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.420
Wine Enthusiast gives it a...

44:16.620 --> 44:17.500
87.

44:18.540 --> 44:19.020
82.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.580
Holy shit, Travis McElroy.

44:21.580 --> 44:24.780
87 points with its attractive red fruit flavors.

44:24.780 --> 44:26.700
This is a light perfumed wine.

44:26.700 --> 44:32.460
Travis just got the name of Gérard Depardieu's wine as well as the exact score.

44:32.460 --> 44:34.380
I don't know if we'll bring this back.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.380
What's Bas Skagg's fucking wine called?

44:36.380 --> 44:37.100
I need to know.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.340
No, I need to know the band Trane's wine.

44:40.060 --> 44:41.180
Bas Skagg's...

44:41.180 --> 44:42.460
Skagg's Vineyard.

44:44.460 --> 44:46.380
It sounds like a fucking, like...

44:46.380 --> 44:49.500
Like a zone in a post-apocalyptic game.

44:49.500 --> 44:55.180
2008 Montage GSM, so it's a blend.

44:55.180 --> 44:57.100
Uh, I bet that means...

44:57.100 --> 44:57.900
I don't actually know.

44:58.540 --> 45:00.620
Bas Skagg's Leftovers.

45:00.620 --> 45:03.180
I didn't finish these bottles, so I put them all in one.

45:03.820 --> 45:05.180
You see a bottle on the shelf.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.780
It says Skagg's Vineyard.

45:06.780 --> 45:07.820
You open it up.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.540
And it's 2008.

45:10.540 --> 45:11.340
You open it up.

45:12.780 --> 45:13.340
You taste it.

45:13.340 --> 45:15.100
What kind of score are you going to give it?

45:15.100 --> 45:17.020
I know it's not on the scale, but 74.

45:19.020 --> 45:19.580
Travis?

45:19.580 --> 45:20.460
93.

45:21.660 --> 45:24.540
Well, boys, it is a 95.

45:24.540 --> 45:27.260
The highest rated wine we have.

45:27.260 --> 45:30.380
The greatest celebrity wine is from Bas Skagg's.

45:30.940 --> 45:32.860
It's a rave for wine enthusiasts.

45:32.860 --> 45:35.500
That's extraordinarily decadent.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.580
Monteverde, Ganache, and Syrah blend.

45:37.580 --> 45:38.300
So it is a blend.

45:38.300 --> 45:39.180
Good for me.

45:39.180 --> 45:44.860
Currently among the best in California from Bas Skagg's.

45:44.860 --> 45:45.180
Wow.

45:45.180 --> 45:48.860
The best at wine, the best at playing Lido shuffle.

45:48.860 --> 45:49.900
Bas Skagg's.

45:49.900 --> 45:50.400
Wow.

45:51.260 --> 45:53.500
Okay, give me the band Trane's wine, Justin.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.820
I would, Travis.

45:55.820 --> 45:59.900
But I care about you too much to give you the band Trane's wine.

45:59.900 --> 46:01.980
Because it is, let's see.

46:01.980 --> 46:02.860
Can I guess?

46:02.860 --> 46:03.420
Can I guess?

46:03.420 --> 46:04.860
It's going to be so much better.

46:04.860 --> 46:06.380
Is it drops of juniper?

46:07.900 --> 46:15.820
No, it's Save Me San Francisco is the wine from the band Trane.

46:16.620 --> 46:20.460
That, of course, is named after a song that they did.

46:20.460 --> 46:22.060
And it's actually an album.

46:22.060 --> 46:24.620
So they did the album and a song.

46:24.620 --> 46:26.860
And is it an 82, Justin?

46:26.860 --> 46:28.540
And I guess it's a wine as well.

46:29.180 --> 46:30.860
It's 86 points.

46:30.860 --> 46:38.060
The San Francisco-based Roots Rockers have a whole line of wines based on their songs.

46:38.060 --> 46:41.020
There's also a petite Syrah called drops of Jupiter.

46:41.020 --> 46:42.060
Okay, that's fine.

46:42.700 --> 46:45.900
The wine is dry with a hint of oaky vanilla and buttered toast.

46:47.180 --> 46:49.180
So that's the band Trane's wine.

46:49.180 --> 46:49.740
It's very good.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.940
I don't think I'd ever want to drink wine and be like, mm, toast.

46:53.740 --> 46:55.020
Yum, it's just like toast.

46:56.620 --> 46:59.500
Yeah, I don't want to drink wine that came out of the brain of Trane.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.780
The Trane brain.

47:00.780 --> 47:01.740
Can I read this Yahoo?

47:01.740 --> 47:04.220
I know it's time for a question, but the Yahoos are so good.

47:04.860 --> 47:05.420
Yeah, please.

47:05.420 --> 47:06.860
This one's sent in by Steven Titus.

47:06.860 --> 47:10.780
It's Yahoo Answers user, sorry, something's gone wrong.

47:10.780 --> 47:11.260
Call them.

47:11.260 --> 47:21.180
Hmm, Boz asks, how do you describe taking out five blades out of your chest in a book?

47:22.140 --> 47:25.980
Like one of my main characters in the book has got stabbed with five blades in his chest

47:25.980 --> 47:26.780
at the same time.

47:26.780 --> 47:32.140
How do I describe in detail of him taking out of the five blades and what he feels as

47:32.140 --> 47:33.020
he takes them out?

47:33.020 --> 47:33.900
Help, please.

47:33.900 --> 47:34.460
Update.

47:34.460 --> 47:36.540
BTW, he's not human.

47:37.740 --> 47:38.380
May I go?

47:38.380 --> 47:40.060
As if I'm reading, here's what I want to hear, Travis.

47:40.060 --> 47:42.060
I want to hear as if I'm reading the audio book.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.300
As if I'm listening to it on audible.com.

47:44.300 --> 47:44.800
Okay.

47:45.820 --> 47:48.540
Zebular turned to face his attackers.

47:48.540 --> 47:50.780
What, you think this can stop me?

47:50.780 --> 47:53.260
He said through his tentacled mouth.

47:53.260 --> 47:55.420
He began removing the blades.

47:55.420 --> 47:58.140
Schlorp came the first one.

47:58.140 --> 48:00.620
Schlorp came the second.

48:00.620 --> 48:03.180
Schlorp, that was the third one.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.020
Schlorp, that was the fourth.

48:05.820 --> 48:08.140
Schlorp, the fifth one came out.

48:08.140 --> 48:10.140
Clang, he threw them all on the ground.

48:11.020 --> 48:12.540
Clang, clang, clang.

48:12.540 --> 48:14.060
Clang went the second one.

48:14.060 --> 48:15.100
Clang went the third.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.180
Clang went the fourth.

48:17.180 --> 48:21.660
Schlorp went the fifth as he threw it into his attacker's chest, killing him instantly.

48:22.300 --> 48:26.700
Take that, attacker, said Zebular or whatever his name was.

48:28.060 --> 48:29.660
Zebular, that was very good, Travis.

48:29.660 --> 48:30.300
Let me try.

48:30.300 --> 48:30.800
Okay.

48:31.660 --> 48:36.140
Zebular reached up and grabbed the knife handle of one of the five knives that was in him.

48:36.140 --> 48:38.700
And he pulled it out a little bit.

48:38.700 --> 48:39.660
Ah, fuck.

48:42.220 --> 48:44.380
He pulled it out another half inch.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.060
Fuck me, seriously.

48:46.060 --> 48:48.540
He pulled it out another quarter inch.

48:48.540 --> 48:49.820
God damn it.

48:49.820 --> 48:52.460
Only three more inches to go, he thought to himself.

48:52.460 --> 48:54.700
And then he blacked out from pain.

48:55.660 --> 48:56.780
And then he woke back up.

48:56.780 --> 48:58.300
Okay, I've got to get back to work.

48:59.580 --> 49:00.140
Chapter two.

49:01.980 --> 49:03.980
Another quarter inch came out of the knife.

49:03.980 --> 49:06.620
And he's like, it's worse doing it slowly.

49:06.620 --> 49:07.340
God damn it.

49:08.140 --> 49:11.740
And so he pulled it out another inch and a half, he thought to himself.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.240
Fuck.

49:12.780 --> 49:15.660
Okay, well, only one more inch and a half to go.

49:17.340 --> 49:18.060
And then he puked.

49:18.060 --> 49:21.580
And he's like, okay, I've got to stop.

49:21.580 --> 49:23.020
I've got to stop kidding around.

49:23.020 --> 49:24.140
It's time to get serious.

49:24.140 --> 49:25.580
It's time to get real.

49:25.580 --> 49:26.780
And then he said this out loud.

49:26.780 --> 49:27.820
It's time to get real.

49:27.820 --> 49:28.860
It's time to get real.

49:28.860 --> 49:32.940
And then in an instant, he yanked it out and then he finished.

49:32.940 --> 49:36.540
And then he did that with the other ones at the end.

49:37.900 --> 49:38.860
Can I do it?

49:38.860 --> 49:39.360
Yeah.

49:40.540 --> 49:47.100
Hercules Jr stood up from the ground and stopped being dead and smirked.

49:47.100 --> 49:51.740
Looks like you brought five knives to a god fight.

49:52.540 --> 49:56.540
He took the first blade by a handle and the second blade.

49:56.540 --> 50:00.540
And it had two at the same time, as if to show off how mighty he is.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.700
And then the third one came out pretty quick.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.620
And the fourth one got a little rib.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.140
And so that one was tricky.

50:06.140 --> 50:08.460
And then he accidentally put the third one back in.

50:08.460 --> 50:10.460
I don't know.

50:10.460 --> 50:11.340
What a twist.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.460
Uh oh, he said, I'm just going to leave those there.

50:14.460 --> 50:19.340
It hurt a great deal, even for Hercules Jr, who can't be hurt.

50:19.340 --> 50:22.300
So it didn't hurt it.

50:22.300 --> 50:22.860
I'm sorry.

50:22.860 --> 50:24.620
My backspace key fell off.

50:24.620 --> 50:28.060
And so whatever I write, it's got to stay in her.

50:28.060 --> 50:28.860
I mean, here.

50:28.860 --> 50:30.780
I mean, here, I couldn't even fix that.

50:31.660 --> 50:35.260
Anyway, then he fell in love.

50:39.900 --> 50:45.100
Does the Yahoo community have any good ways of describing that?

50:46.060 --> 50:50.060
I mean, Javec says there's a very good chance he wouldn't be feeling anything anymore.

50:50.060 --> 50:53.260
Even if somehow someone survived five stab wounds to the chest,

50:53.260 --> 50:55.500
I don't think they're going to last long if they yank the blades out

50:55.500 --> 50:56.460
and let themselves bleed to death.

50:56.460 --> 50:58.380
They're not human.

50:58.380 --> 51:01.660
So he saw that and he was like, all right, I got to edit this question.

51:01.660 --> 51:02.780
No, it's an edit, Travis.

51:02.780 --> 51:05.500
He saw the first response like, ah, fuck, I should have clarified.

51:06.700 --> 51:08.620
Gretchen Wiener says, ouch.

51:08.620 --> 51:10.620
For normal people, they would have died.

51:10.620 --> 51:14.300
So the person writing this book is like, ah, fuck, maybe it shouldn't be five blades stabbed.

51:14.940 --> 51:15.340
Shoot.

51:15.340 --> 51:15.660
Four?

51:16.300 --> 51:17.420
Maybe four?

51:17.420 --> 51:19.100
I think I could do four.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.620
It depends on where.

51:20.620 --> 51:21.020
That's it.

51:21.020 --> 51:24.860
OK, listen, question writer, is this like four stab wounds to the chest

51:24.860 --> 51:27.020
or is like one of them stabbed my toe?

51:27.020 --> 51:28.860
Oh, here's what it is.

51:28.860 --> 51:31.820
Update, Gretchen Wiener says, OK, then I got a great idea.

51:31.820 --> 51:33.420
How about, no, you don't.

51:33.420 --> 51:37.260
What about a lot of blood pouring out, but the blood that poured out went back in

51:37.260 --> 51:38.620
and then his wound recovered?

51:38.620 --> 51:39.900
So here's what it would be.

51:39.900 --> 51:45.100
Hercules Jr. smirked and pulled all the five blades out with his five mighty arms

51:46.140 --> 51:47.500
and threw them down to the ground.

51:48.140 --> 51:51.340
But evil Hercules knew the job was done.

51:51.340 --> 51:53.180
Look at all your blood, he says.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.580
It's on the ground where the dirt lives.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.500
Hercules Jr. smiles.

51:57.500 --> 51:59.020
We'll see about that.

51:59.020 --> 52:04.140
All five of his wounds open back up real wide and start making a sucking noise

52:04.140 --> 52:08.540
and the blood slurp and the blood lifts up off the ground

52:08.540 --> 52:10.940
and the five mouths on his body drinks it up

52:10.940 --> 52:12.940
and all the blood goes back in him.

52:12.940 --> 52:14.460
Now I'm ready to fight again.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.100
I hate you, evil Hercules.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.380
Glad I got my blood back.

52:18.380 --> 52:20.220
Now I'm strong for fighting.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.900
Look at how high I can jump.

52:21.900 --> 52:22.860
The end.

52:22.860 --> 52:23.420
The end.

52:23.420 --> 52:25.420
The end.

52:25.420 --> 52:27.180
You gotta know when to end your book.

52:27.180 --> 52:28.300
Yep, end on a high note.

52:28.300 --> 52:29.020
That's what I always say.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.460
Thank you, yes.

52:31.580 --> 52:33.580
I say you gotta start in the middle of the action

52:33.580 --> 52:35.260
and you gotta end in the middle of the action.

52:36.460 --> 52:37.740
Evil Hercules sighed.

52:37.740 --> 52:38.940
Well, I'm out of knives.

52:39.660 --> 52:40.940
Those are all my knives.

52:40.940 --> 52:44.140
I thought I would only need one, but I brought five.

52:44.140 --> 52:48.140
That was the set I got at Ikea and it only came with the five knives.

52:48.860 --> 52:49.900
How about another question?

52:49.900 --> 52:50.940
Yeah, we've only done one.

52:50.940 --> 52:53.740
Hmm, yeah, that seems like not enough.

52:53.740 --> 52:55.260
We should probably do more of those.

52:55.260 --> 52:57.420
My wife and I recently moved into our first house.

52:57.980 --> 53:01.420
We keep to ourselves, but try to be friendly with the neighbors.

53:01.420 --> 53:03.820
Yesterday, one of our neighbor's kids came to our door

53:03.820 --> 53:06.140
and asked if he could vacuum our home.

53:06.140 --> 53:07.900
A bit confused, but trying to be a good neighbor,

53:07.900 --> 53:10.460
we said he could vacuum downstairs.

53:10.460 --> 53:13.500
Like a good neighbor vacuum my house.

53:14.380 --> 53:17.260
It took about 10 minutes and we gave him five dollars.

53:17.260 --> 53:17.580
What?

53:17.580 --> 53:20.620
As he left, he gave us a handmade business card that said,

53:25.260 --> 53:27.820
It said, I will vacuum your house for $20.

53:30.380 --> 53:33.180
Now we're living with the shame of underpaying a 12-year-old

53:33.180 --> 53:35.260
for a service we didn't want or ask for.

53:35.740 --> 53:37.660
Do we owe this kid $15?

53:38.220 --> 53:41.180
If so, how do we give him the money?

53:41.660 --> 53:43.900
Hell, spotless in Seattle.

53:43.900 --> 53:44.540
This kid.

53:44.540 --> 53:49.580
I will vacuum your house for $20.

53:49.580 --> 53:54.060
This kid had, let's just confront this,

53:54.060 --> 53:56.460
a pocket full of business cards that said,

53:56.460 --> 53:58.540
I will vacuum your house for $4

53:58.540 --> 54:01.740
and then $15 more for however much money you gave him.

54:01.740 --> 54:03.900
If you gave him $50, he would say,

54:03.900 --> 54:06.860
for $65, I will vacuum your whole house.

54:06.860 --> 54:07.900
And it's a good racket.

54:07.900 --> 54:09.500
It's a good racket to get into.

54:09.500 --> 54:10.620
Good scam.

54:10.620 --> 54:11.500
Because that's the thing.

54:11.500 --> 54:14.300
It has to be like an Artful Dodger,

54:15.020 --> 54:19.900
like kind of, you know, the young gang of vacuuming scam artists.

54:19.900 --> 54:22.540
Because what kid just like rolls,

54:22.540 --> 54:26.380
it's one thing for like, I'll mow your lawn or whatever,

54:26.380 --> 54:28.380
but like, I'll vacuum your house?

54:28.940 --> 54:31.820
That kid probably also stole some of your jewelry.

54:31.820 --> 54:33.820
Put the vacuum into the jewelry box,

54:33.820 --> 54:35.020
sucked all the treasures up.

54:35.580 --> 54:37.260
I've never thought about this before,

54:37.260 --> 54:42.540
but if you let a kid mow your lawn and vacuum your house,

54:42.540 --> 54:45.180
when does this start to like broach

54:45.180 --> 54:47.100
into like child labor issues?

54:47.820 --> 54:49.660
Immediately, instantly.

54:49.660 --> 54:50.220
Already.

54:50.220 --> 54:54.220
The moment you pay them a service for hard work.

54:54.220 --> 54:56.060
So you think this is a sting?

54:56.060 --> 54:58.140
Like this kid, if you have him back,

54:58.140 --> 54:59.580
he's definitely wearing a wire.

55:00.380 --> 55:06.460
So I appreciate the entrepreneurial ship of this child, right?

55:06.460 --> 55:11.500
Because I used to mow Tommy Redd's dad's lawn

55:11.500 --> 55:13.820
for money that I could spend on Hero Clicks,

55:13.820 --> 55:17.020
but I used a manual push mower that didn't accomplish anything.

55:17.020 --> 55:20.300
It just kind of, just kind of-

55:20.300 --> 55:23.100
Mushed, just mushed the grass down.

55:23.100 --> 55:24.780
It mushed the grass down.

55:24.780 --> 55:27.740
And so one time I went to do it and he said,

55:27.740 --> 55:29.180
last time, did you actually do it?

55:29.180 --> 55:31.580
And I said, yeah, I just use a push mower

55:31.580 --> 55:33.260
and so it didn't work very well.

55:33.260 --> 55:37.820
And he said, I'm not going to employ you anymore.

55:37.820 --> 55:39.580
And I said, totally got it.

55:39.580 --> 55:40.620
$20, please.

55:42.700 --> 55:44.060
I'll vacuum your house for $20.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.100
I will vacuum your house for $20.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.220
With this push mower.

55:46.860 --> 55:51.660
I would sell, I will vacuum your house for $20 t-shirt

55:51.660 --> 55:53.020
at our merch store.

55:53.020 --> 55:56.860
I'm fairly sure you could not walk half a block wearing that shirt.

55:56.860 --> 55:58.860
You would just instantly like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:58.860 --> 56:00.380
Yeah, yeah, come on in.

56:00.380 --> 56:01.100
Come on in, please.

56:01.100 --> 56:02.780
Please, this isn't your house

56:02.780 --> 56:03.900
and we're not anywhere near your house.

56:03.900 --> 56:05.260
I know, but I really need this service.

56:05.260 --> 56:06.700
This is a great service.

56:06.700 --> 56:07.980
I think you might be in the clear

56:07.980 --> 56:10.780
because the terms were not agreed upon before, right?

56:10.780 --> 56:12.380
This is not how business cards work.

56:12.380 --> 56:15.260
It's not, it's a business card, not an invoice.

56:15.260 --> 56:17.500
You need to be ready for the fact that this kid

56:17.500 --> 56:18.700
is going to come back

56:19.580 --> 56:21.500
and he's going to offer you the service again

56:22.060 --> 56:24.140
and you are going to need to think of a reason

56:24.140 --> 56:25.900
why you said yes the first time

56:26.460 --> 56:28.380
but now it's a no from now on.

56:28.380 --> 56:31.660
It's much cleaner than I used to be.

56:31.660 --> 56:34.060
We found another child who does it for $15.

56:34.060 --> 56:35.660
So sorry, Jeremy.

56:35.660 --> 56:36.780
You got undercut, Jeremy.

56:36.780 --> 56:37.580
Hit the bricks.

56:37.580 --> 56:38.620
This is business.

56:38.620 --> 56:42.140
Mark Cuban came by with his $15 house vacuuming service.

56:44.060 --> 56:45.740
It's a robot, you see.

56:45.740 --> 56:47.820
So I'm sorry to say that automation

56:47.820 --> 56:49.580
is taking your job, Jeremy.

56:49.580 --> 56:50.460
I love $20.

56:51.660 --> 56:52.220
Don't get me wrong.

56:52.220 --> 56:52.940
It's a good number.

56:52.940 --> 56:54.540
It's a good number and if you're a kid,

56:54.540 --> 56:55.580
it's basically $100.

56:56.540 --> 56:57.260
That is the thing.

56:57.260 --> 56:58.780
A $20 bill when you're a kid

57:00.060 --> 57:01.260
is like blank check.

57:01.260 --> 57:02.220
$20?

57:02.220 --> 57:02.940
Oh my gosh.

57:04.140 --> 57:05.740
Well, with inflation,

57:05.740 --> 57:06.940
they'd still be jazzed about $20.

57:06.940 --> 57:08.620
They'd still be psyched out of their fucking minds.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.100
Probably not a good vacuuming job, huh?

57:11.100 --> 57:13.420
Why didn't you ask how much it costs?

57:14.460 --> 57:16.140
Why did you let this kid in your house

57:16.140 --> 57:17.820
with no terms discussed?

57:19.260 --> 57:22.060
If you don't ask the kid how much it costs upfront,

57:22.060 --> 57:24.220
you are opening yourself up to a reality

57:24.220 --> 57:25.820
in which you're like, well, what do I owe you?

57:25.820 --> 57:26.860
And the kid's like,

57:26.860 --> 57:27.500
oh, nothing.

57:27.500 --> 57:29.020
I just wanted to look at all your things

57:29.020 --> 57:29.740
and touch them.

57:29.740 --> 57:30.140
Yeah.

57:30.140 --> 57:31.980
Because I'm dirty and I'm nasty.

57:31.980 --> 57:33.580
Or you're like, what do I owe you?

57:33.580 --> 57:35.100
And the kid's like $150.

57:35.900 --> 57:37.500
Yeah, that's all bad.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.260
There's no good outcome here.

57:39.260 --> 57:40.780
Or the kid comes in to vacuum your house

57:40.780 --> 57:42.380
and he's still vacuuming your house

57:42.380 --> 57:43.980
three hours later.

57:43.980 --> 57:45.980
And you're like, okay, go.

57:47.180 --> 57:48.860
That's a 10 minutes.

57:48.860 --> 57:51.180
I'm not sure he was doing a very good job.

57:51.180 --> 57:52.940
That's, I think we can all agree on that.

57:52.940 --> 57:55.100
It's not a good vacuum job this child did.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.260
So it may have been a $5 vacuum job.

57:57.260 --> 57:59.340
If you want your house vacuumed, call me.

57:59.340 --> 58:00.540
I'll do it for $19.

58:01.260 --> 58:04.060
$25, but it'll be cleaned by a man.

58:04.060 --> 58:06.380
And I will show you how a man cleans a house.

58:08.380 --> 58:10.140
A child's not gonna do it.

58:10.140 --> 58:11.580
I'll show you how a man does it.

58:11.580 --> 58:13.900
Oh, Justin, that vacuum cleaner's pretty big.

58:13.900 --> 58:15.020
Are you sure you can?

58:15.020 --> 58:15.340
Whoa.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.460
Yeah, it's no problem.

58:18.460 --> 58:20.860
I'll throw it on my back like a Ghostbuster.

58:20.860 --> 58:23.180
And you can get, like, business card says like,

58:23.180 --> 58:25.260
I'll suck this shit out of your house carpet.

58:27.740 --> 58:31.020
Our mom used to put, do other people do this?

58:31.020 --> 58:33.660
Our mom used to put this weird, smelly dust.

58:33.660 --> 58:34.620
Carpet Fresh?

58:35.180 --> 58:36.060
Carpet Fresh.

58:36.060 --> 58:37.580
Do people still do Carpet Fresh?

58:37.580 --> 58:40.300
Cause I feel like I've never seen anybody else do it.

58:40.300 --> 58:42.380
I know it used to be a thing where it's like,

58:42.380 --> 58:43.740
I'm about to vacuum anyway.

58:43.740 --> 58:45.660
Let me throw a bunch of dust on the ground.

58:45.660 --> 58:49.740
I guarantee Carpet Fresh is now like asbestos and lead paint.

58:50.460 --> 58:50.860
For sure.

58:50.860 --> 58:52.300
Like nobody uses it.

58:52.300 --> 58:53.260
Are you kidding me?

58:53.260 --> 58:54.540
You're gonna use Carpet Fresh?

58:54.540 --> 58:57.260
Oh, your feet are gonna melt off by the time you're 40.

58:57.260 --> 58:59.580
That is gonna do it for us for this week, folks.

58:59.580 --> 59:03.820
Thank you so much for, I was gonna say enjoying,

59:03.820 --> 59:04.460
but that seems-

59:04.460 --> 59:05.100
Indulging?

59:05.740 --> 59:07.580
Indulging yourself in this pot.

59:07.580 --> 59:08.380
Indulging us.

59:08.380 --> 59:09.900
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

59:09.900 --> 59:11.820
Thank you for indulging us for this hour.

59:12.380 --> 59:14.060
We hope you have enjoyed yourself.

59:15.020 --> 59:18.060
We are, okay, so we have a few things to talk about.

59:18.060 --> 59:20.380
We're gonna try to blow through them as quick as possible.

59:20.380 --> 59:21.660
St. Louis and Detroit.

59:22.380 --> 59:24.700
Columbus, we're also coming to you in May,

59:24.700 --> 59:26.460
but you have come out in a big way

59:26.460 --> 59:29.100

59:29.100 --> 59:30.780

59:34.540 --> 59:36.300

59:46.860 --> 59:49.740
And it's going to be very fun,

59:49.740 --> 59:52.460
and we would love it if you would come out and see us.

59:52.460 --> 59:54.380
Those shows are very close,

59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.060
so please come buy them.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.140
There's not, like, infinity tickets.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.620
There's, like, a fixed amount in the world.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.940
It might sell out before the time we do the show,

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.620
so hop on it right now.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.420

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.660
Also, I want to say, just announced,

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.900
we are going to be on this year's JoCo Cruise,

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.340
JoCo Cruise 2019.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.820
We are super excited about it,

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.740
and we hope you are super excited about it too.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.860
Well, speak for yourself.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.860
I can't stop thinking about the Kraken.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.260
You're worried about the Kraken?

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.940
The Kraken, Leviathan, Poseidon.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.020
Yeah, I understand.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:47.980
Well, don't worry.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:49.260
We start every-

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.700
They start every JoCo Cruise

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.380
with a sacrifice to the sea.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:52.700
Okay.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.140
So that we don't have to worry about it.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.420
Listen, there's not many cabins available,

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.300
but we're going to be on there

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.900
with They Might Be Giants and our whole family.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.580
So like, come on this fucking cruise already.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.300
What are you talking about?

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.060
JoCoCruise.com.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.500
It's one of the most fun things

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.020
I've ever done in my life going on last year,

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.540
so I'm super looking forward to this one.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.220
JoCoCruise.com.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.340
Also want to say,

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.580
I started a secret society here in Cincinnati

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.660
called the Cincinnati Underground Society,

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.580
and we are doing a monthly show

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.500
called the Cincinnati Underground Society Show,

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.420
or CUS, and-

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:19.740
Nice.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.260
Tickets for our April show are on sale now.

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.700
They are very close to selling out.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.100
We're at about 75% sold at this point.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.460
The show comes up Saturday, April 28th.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.900
I've got five out of town guests coming in

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.380
and one local, and they're pretty great.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.980
It's going to be a really great show.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.740
We had a lot of fun doing the March show.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.180
I'm not going to tell you who the guests are,

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.780
but trust me, it's a really good lineup.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.540
So if you want to come out to that,

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:55.420
go to bit.ly slash C-U-S-S-K-E-Y 2018.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.020
Come to Travis's show, and also buy my book.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.620
Justin and Sydney are doing a book,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.740
and that's so exciting.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.380
They just announced it.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.660
They've been working really hard on it.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:06.720
Yep.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.340
Sydney's sister, my sister-in-law Taylor,

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.260
who's extremely talented, is doing illustrations,

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.900
and it is a book based on our podcast, Sawbones.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.500

but please pre-order this book.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.500
I worked so hard on it.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.620
It's so hard to write a book.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.940
Bit.ly forward slash Sawbones book.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.060

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.560
Who asks?

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.080
Now, back to sandals and non-white socks.
