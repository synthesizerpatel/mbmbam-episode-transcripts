00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
One, two, three, four!

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
It's the start of something beautiful.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
A small acquaintance has blossomed, it's ripened into a precious friendship.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
I could have never seen what was coming for me.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Hangs at the skatepark, hangs by the beach.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
My life, it feels like life.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
My life, oh, it's better with you.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother mean advice show for the imaginary.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis big dog woof woof McElroy.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I don't know that I have the same level of energy as my two brothers.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Rarely.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Get it together.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I mean, here's what I'll say.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Okay.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I watched Jungle Cruise.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yes, you did.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
But I don't feel like I saw it, and here's why.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Because you experienced it in your blood?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No, it's bad.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
What?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
It's negative.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
And honestly, I blame the filmmakers and Diz.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I blame Bob J. Pack all the way down, the whole Diz family.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I blame them.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Because 10 minutes into this fucking flick, Giamatti pops up.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
You're fucking kidding me.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Now, my kids, obviously, from that point on, that's all they can talk about.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Big Giamatti fans.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Dad, when's Giamatti coming back?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
When's the G-Man back?

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Dad, what's with Giamatti's accent?

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Dad, do you think Giamatti made scale for this, or do you think it's a payday?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Or do you think it was a favor to the Rock?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Do you think he shot out in one day, or do you think he was there for a while?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Exactly.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, do you think they just gang shot all the Giamatti stuff, Daddy?

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Then it's like 30 minutes into this fucker, and Giamatti's not hiding her hair of Giamatti.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Not even a post-credit sequence.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Not even a hint that Giamatti will return.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Fuck off.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, in Jungle Cruise 2, Jungle 2s.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
You don't even get that bit where he reaches in and grabs the gauntlet, and he puts it on,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
and he slides some Infinity Gems in it, and he's like,

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
it looks like it's time for Giamatti to go to work.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
What was interesting to me is, so I watched it, and my 18-month-old daughter,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
all she was wondering was, we haven't seen Giamatti in a while.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
How much of this is makeup?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
It's something she kept asking.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's been a while since I've seen Giamatti.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
How much of that is just his look now?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Because not all of it's bad, frankly.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
The problem is, with COVID interrupting, they had to do a lot of it with computers.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
So about 70% of it is CGI-Matti.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
That's CGI-Matti.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
No, it's better when you say it faster, honestly.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
CGI-Matti.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
CGI-Matti.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
CGI-Matti.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
There you go.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
Dot kept asking me, how much of this do you think is just Giamatti single shot with him looking at a tennis ball,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
but then they cut together with the rock scenes.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
How much was he on set in these scenes?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Because there's a lot of single shots, not a lot of doubles.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, he's like Sky Captain in the world of Giamatti.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, right, right, right, right.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
And that's the episode title of today's episode, and we got that out two minutes in.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
He didn't even fly out, from what I heard.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
He didn't even fly out.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Here's what happened.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Giamatti put on one of those tennis ball mocap suits.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And they said, Giamatti, we can do it with ping pong balls.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
And he said, no, I only work with tennis balls.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
No, I only work with tennis balls because I want my movements to be very specific.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
So the balls need to be much larger and yellower.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But he didn't do this movie specifically.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
So what Giamatti did, and this is smart, he stood in front of a camera and said every word.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah, in the dictionary, not just English.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Yeah, Giamatti said all the words, because China's the future.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And China's the future of entertainment.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
He did all the movements, too.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
And he was nude T-posing the entire time.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
He was fully naked.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Yeah, tennis balls glued to his nude body.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Right, and he just said, and just use this however you want.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah, and he kept saying, I'm nude, glued, and totally rude, which was weird.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
He kept saying that over and over again.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
75 years after his death, Paul Giamatti will be the only actor that is in the public domain.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So you can use a Giamatti performance in anything.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Let me show you around.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm hollow Giamatti.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
You can use him to basically advertise anything at that point.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
True.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
I didn't see the fucking flick, but I have been on the Jungle Cruise ride.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
So is most of the film Dwayne cutting up, pointing at things in the water?

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Hey, bud, I know that you're having some fun here, but this is the danger of having fun when you don't have the contacts.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It's a lot of the movie.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Absolutely.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
It's like a lot of the movie.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
It is one of the most accurate theme park ride to movie adaptations I have ever seen.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
So much of it is a Jungle Cruise, first of all.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
You would expect the cruise to be the first half hour, right?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
No, no, no, no, no.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No, no, no.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
There's probably more Jungle Cruise in this than there are pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Absolutely.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
You know how in Pirates of the Caribbean when they made the movie, if you've seen it nine times in theaters, which I did,

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
there will be little winks at the ride where it's like, oh, now the pirates are trying to tempt the dog with a bone, right?

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
It's like with Jungle Cruise, they said, what if we did that, but it's hints at a movie within the ride adaptation that we made.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
And to the point where I felt at one point that much like they do sometimes where Disney would be like,

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
we stared at lions for two weeks before making Lion King.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
Imagine that Dwayne The Rock Johnson rode Jungle Cruise endlessly for like a week to prepare for this role because he is nailing it.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
I did deadass read that he led some Jungle Cruise rides.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Hell yes.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Which like, how lucky do you have?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
That is some make-away shit right there.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Okay.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
But here's the problem with what you just said is it's not true.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, it's not?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
No, but here's the weird thing about it.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
I watched this Jungle Cruise, it's like behind the attraction or whatever, right?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Yes, yes.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Of course you know I'm loving that.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Right.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I live for it.

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
And The Rock said to prepare for this role, I have actually led several Jungle Cruises.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
This is what I saw.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Okay.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
But here's the thing that he said right after that in this special.

07:15.000 --> 07:24.000
And he says, and if you're wondering why you never saw anybody talking about The Rock doing that, it's because it all happened in my mind.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Oh.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, that's interesting, Dwayne.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Isn't that interesting?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Huh.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Isn't that interesting?

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
So like you can picture him like sitting in his bathtub, eyes closed, like just pointing.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
And he has like put little like tape marks everywhere where he's supposed to point.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
And he's practiced until he can just nail it eyes closed every time.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And if someone walked into the room, they would get really worried about The Rock.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
He's like, he's just, I mean, it's just what he's, I mean.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
Just like laying in bed surrounded by his crystals and just saying like, and there's the back of the water.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
And everybody's like, yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:10.000
I know how complete the visualization was, you know, like to what extent was Dwayne, you know, imagining all of it, every second of it?

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Did he do the cue? Because it can get up there, you know?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah, sure.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Did he picture himself as a scrawny teenager leading it with a little bit of apathy, frankly?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
It's possible, possible.

08:21.000 --> 08:31.000
Hey, is there a scene in the movie where Dwayne points over the side of the boat and is like, and there's a, check out that wily witch doctor with his shrunken head.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's no way to get a head in business.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
And then Emily Blunt is sitting in the front of the boat and she's like, this feels bad.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Like that feels problematic.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Not quite that, Griffin, but not far off.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Like this feels like a pretty problematic portray.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
Like, I'm not here to tell you your job, The Rock, but even the Disney ride is starting to sort of leave some of this stuff on the old cutting room floor.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Hey guys, I don't want you to think I'm fucking with you.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So I just went ahead while we were sitting here having some fun.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I cued up this exact joint because I want you to hear it.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Cool, cool.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
I have had a chance to skipper many Jungle Cruise boats over the years in multiple parks.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh, hopefully not like this.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
And you're probably thinking, wow, I don't remember ever seeing you there, Rock.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
He's absolutely right.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Of course you didn't because it all happened in my mind.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And it's so good.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
It's one of the wilder things I've ever heard a human being, Rock or non-Rock, say.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
You know, it's like, it's a very wild thing to say from The Rock.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Can I tell you with that context, Justin, thank you very much.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
It's not like he's saying in preparing for this role, I pictured myself.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
He says in multiple parks over the years.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Over the years.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Why even add that detail?

09:46.000 --> 09:56.000
It's such a specific, it would be as though he said, I remember actually in the, it was July 13th, 2017, I did one.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
That's when I did the Tokyo Disney one.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
I did Tokyo Disney July 13th of 2017.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, whenever I get really stressed out on set, I just close my eyes and picture myself leading one of the Jungle Cruises.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Jungle Cruise, take me away.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Oh, God.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I just don't know why that would be the case.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm so happy it was the case, but I don't know why it would be the case.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
You know what I'm saying?

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
Have you guys seen the clip of Emily Blunt and The Rock doing a press tour, press day for Jungle Cruise,

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
and a reporter asked them about Vin Diesel talking about getting the best performance out of The Rock through confrontation with him?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Did we not talk about that?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
We talked about this.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Did we?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Oh, yeah, and then Emily Blunt.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
We talked, I told you this, but it was after the episode.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
We hate that the two of them are fighting, and it makes us so sad that we don't want to talk about it.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, they're the Pacino and that other guy of the modern day, you know what I mean?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Bambino?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, Pacino and Bambino.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
This is, of course, an advice show.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
I only want to talk about The Rock imagining that he's The Rock.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
He looks like that.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
His body's crazy and strong, and he's affable and charming and famous.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Incredible body.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
And he also has dream visions where he is the skipper of the Jungle Cruise ride at Disney at several parks.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
Griffin, over the years, you've made me realize that while many a celeb,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
by putting on perhaps a low-hanging hat and some sunglasses,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
might be led on a VIP experience through a park and ride the Jungle Cruise,

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
when you are a living mountain as The Rock is, you have to imagine that it's tough to blend in.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
He might have never been able to ride it.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
What could The Rock do?

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm not detracting from The Rock, who is, I think, more of a movie star first and an actor second.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
So I'm not trying to denigrate his talent.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
He absolutely has his superpowers.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
That said, what could The Rock do to where he could host your Jungle Cruise ride,

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
and you would not instantly just be like, is everyone seeing this? The Rock is in charge of my Jungle Cruise ride.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I think what you're actually seeing is they would probably do that, right?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You don't even have to write your own gags.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
You choose from a selection of different gags to be a Jungle Cruise skipper.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, you think The Rock would do that? You think The Rock would go stay on script, Justin?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
No, I'm just saying it's not that hard.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
The Rock could do it. They would write some gags for him if he was nervous about it.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It doesn't seem like he would be, but I'm saying it would be doable.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
But he can't, and what's sad about this is it's a prison.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
The Rock's life is a prison.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
He's trapped in a beautiful prison.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
He could do this, and he has the juice to get it done, but he actually couldn't,

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
because people would be hurling themselves into the boat like a fucking scene from World War Z.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
You know what I mean? Just catapulting themselves into this Jungle Cruise boat.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I'd swim up to the next one.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
If I see The Rock through the backside of water in another boat, I'm jumping out.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
It's going down. It's going down for real.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
It's got to be so rough for him to be on the Jungle Cruise.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
And by the Jungle Cruise, I mean any entertainment experience ever.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And he's sitting there, and the skipper's like,

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Look over there at that hippo. Those hippos don't lie.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
And The Rock is like, I'm stronger than this person.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm funnier than this person. I'm more handsome than this person.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Absolutely. Charismatic. I'm more affable.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
More philanthropic, I bet.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
The Rock is saying, I should be the skipper because I'm stronger, faster, smarter, and funnier than this person.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
But also, everybody else on the boat is like,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I'm having fun on the Jungle Cruise with my dipshit kids,

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
but fuck, wouldn't it be so much cooler if The Rock, who is sitting across from me, was doing the skip?

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Like, it's wild they're not letting him skip this one since he was the guy in the movie of it.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
Why isn't Disney letting Johnny Depp hide out in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
He may be one of the pirates.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Right.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Why aren't they letting The Rock leave there?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
It sucks.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
The poor The Rock, man. It's such a bummer.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
He should be allowed to do what he wants.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Just let him do what he wants. If he wants to do the boat, just let him do it.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
I trust him.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
This is the thing, too.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Sometimes, if you're ever getting on the tram ride at Universal,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
or you're getting the Jungle Cruise, where so much of it is about,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
man, even a fucking ghost tour, I would love to have the ride.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I'd love to have The Rock lead anything.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
But you get on it, and it's like, well, the ride is the same every time.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
It's all about the energy that the host is bringing to it.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
If I saw that it was The Rock, I would be like, oh, fucking strap in everybody.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
This is going to change our lives.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
This is going to be like senior year of high school level.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Change our lives, everybody.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
Everyone in this boat is going to want to exchange contact information

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
so that 10 years from now, we can talk to each other.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
We didn't dream it, did we? It really happened.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
It was real, right? What happened to you?

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Well, after that, I cleaned up. I got my life together.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
That was the kick in the pants that I've been waiting for.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
That's what I needed. I called Debra. I got her back.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
We're a happy family again.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Got my kids back from The Rock.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I was watching them, and that was so chill of them.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I really appreciated that.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
You know, honey, I've been thinking, I think actually The Rock should be the dad of our children

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
because he's stronger than you are and smarter and funnier and cooler.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
I have raised children in all the Disney parks over the years,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
and it all happened in my mind.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Hey, honey, you know how we met and fell in love on that jungle cruise that The Rock led?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Maybe we should ask him to officiate.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
No, we should ask him to be your best man.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Well, maybe we should ask him to be the groom.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, that sounds great.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
That's great. I'll see you later.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Bye.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Let's be in a throuple with The Rock.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
I've been in a bunch of marriages in all the parks over the years.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah, over the years. In my mind.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
In my mind?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I just love The Rock so much.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Let's do some questions.

16:09.000 --> 16:18.000
We should have a, there should be a name and a specific numeric distinction for like-

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
The event horizon?

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, right. The goof horizon where it's like, well, if we've talked about it for 20 minutes,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
at some point it has to be the entire episode.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, it's the war with grandpa.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
It's the war with grandpa continuum.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Right.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
This is an advice show, not of The Rock fan cast.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Unless the advice you need is, who's great?

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
Yeah, it seems like that would be a fun show to do.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Although I bet it probably exists, doesn't it?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
The Rock fan cast.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Probably. Rocking out.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
I've recently started a new job in accounting where I have my own office.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
How do I decorate to make my peers think I'm a badass big business boy?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
That's from corporate capitalist in Kentucky.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Congratulations on your new level of responsibility.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Great job.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And opportunities for failure.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
So that's fun.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
That's the other side of that coin.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
What about the balls?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
What?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Oh, the swinging ones.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh, the clicky clackies.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
The big clicky clacky balls, except here's the twist.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
They're really big and there's only three of them.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
That's cool.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Oh.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
That's cool, right?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah, so like somebody could be having a meeting in the other room and it's like,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I think we're going to have to let go like six or seven people.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Clack, clack, clack, clack.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Jeremy.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Sorry, is that too loud?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
That would be a power play, though, like I'm going to start these balls a-clacking.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Mm-hmm.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
If they lose inertia.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
By that time.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Like you have until then to impression with business.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Justin, can I take it and turn it a little bit?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Okay.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
The balls are very tiny.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Hold on.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I didn't give you.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Hold on.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Let me think.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Because this is something that I've been at.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
This idea is a big one for me.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It's something I've been working on for a long time.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah, absolutely.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
The big three balls is like kind of a-

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
It's huge.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Go ahead, Travis.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Okay.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It's a lot of balls and they're very small.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
So you have like let's say 35 very small like marble-sized balls spread out in a line across

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
the desk.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
But you set it up so that of that 35, 17 starts swinging, hits one in the middle, and then

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
the other 17 swing from the other way.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Oh, yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
That's physics, baby.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
That's how it works.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Sure.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
I love that.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Let's do...

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
But can I...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't even want to take it and turn it.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
I want to just add some spice on it, which is sort of what I do here, I think.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.480
Why just stop at the ball swinging desk object?

18:45.480 --> 18:51.640
Why not go to Spencer's Gifts and like finally cash in that $100 gift card that you've been

18:51.640 --> 18:58.260
sitting on since your high school graduation and get the plasma ball and get a lava lamp?

18:58.260 --> 19:03.840
Get that thermometer that's like a tube of water with the different balls inside of it

19:03.840 --> 19:04.840
that float up and down.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.840
It's like density or something.

19:06.840 --> 19:07.840
Yeah.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.040
Get the bird that like dips in and get the dips into the water and the dips back up.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
Get a little...

19:13.040 --> 19:16.720
Oh, you could get like a small little water feature fountain on your desk.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.000
Like really turn your desk into a little amusement park.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I love that.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
That's so fun.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I love that a lot.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
That's pretty great.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
That's fine.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Because then like it disarms people, right?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.560
First of all, people want to come in your office because they want to see all your cool

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
stuff.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
They want to touch the plasma ball.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.560
And they want to touch the plasma ball.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.560
That's the only thing, right?

19:32.560 --> 19:35.040
That's the only reason people go into Spencer's Gifts is like, hey, I wonder how it feels to

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
touch the plasma ball.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.880
And you touch it and then you're like, that was cool.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
Does that towel have...

19:39.880 --> 19:40.880
Breasts like a ball.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.200
Does that towel have breasts on it?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
I'll buy that.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
And that's how they get you.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.200
Yep.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.120
So they're going to come in your office and be like, cool stuff, cool toys.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.960
And you're like, they're not toys, they're business objects.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.400
And then they are disarmed.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.080
And now you're the bad ass big business boy.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.360
It would be like if you had a Nerf hoop on the door and then you just left a prominent

19:57.360 --> 19:58.360
Nerf basketball.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.680
And then the first time someone picked it up and you're like, what are you doing in

20:01.680 --> 20:02.680
this office?

20:02.680 --> 20:03.680
Whoa.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.680
This is a place of business.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.720
How dare you?

20:05.720 --> 20:11.360
You could also, if you just wanted to like, you know, the virtue posters, right?

20:11.360 --> 20:14.720
Do that, but make them a little whimsical to go with the same thing.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.720
You know what I mean?

20:15.720 --> 20:19.120
So it's just like you put fun on there and they're like fun and like business fun.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.200
And you're just like, what?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.200
What did you say?

20:22.200 --> 20:23.200
I said business fun.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.200
This is an office.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
Yeah.

20:25.200 --> 20:30.840
You could also get those posters, but instead of it being things like dedication and diligence,

20:30.840 --> 20:33.000
working hard means, you know what I mean?

20:33.000 --> 20:40.960
Instead of that, have it say like abstinence and people are like, what is that?

20:40.960 --> 20:41.960
Religious chastity.

20:41.960 --> 20:42.960
What does your poster say?

20:42.960 --> 20:43.960
Cowardice.

20:43.960 --> 20:44.960
Does that say cowardice?

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
Yeah.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:46.960 --> 20:47.960
Disrespect.

20:47.960 --> 20:48.960
That's me.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.960
Melancholy.

20:49.960 --> 20:50.960
Oppression.

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
What?

20:51.960 --> 20:55.320
Hygiene.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.320
Wash those pits, Carl.

20:58.320 --> 21:04.120
You can put out all the toys all across your desk, and then instead of shaming, when someone

21:04.120 --> 21:09.320
picks one of them up and starts fiddling with it, you pull out a clipboard from a drawer

21:09.320 --> 21:14.480
and make a small note, then put the clipboard away silently and go, huh.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.480
Interesting.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.280
No one's ever done that before.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.280
Interesting.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.280
That one.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.280
Okay.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.280
50 mugs.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.280
What?

21:23.280 --> 21:25.720
50 mugs.

21:25.720 --> 21:30.800
Each one more fun and whimsical than the one before.

21:30.800 --> 21:36.040
So you have one that just has the minions on it, then the Garfield one, and then one

21:36.040 --> 21:41.920
that says, do not meddle in the affairs of dragons for you are crunchy and taste good

21:41.920 --> 21:42.920
with ketchup.

21:42.920 --> 21:43.920
You know what I'm saying?

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
That's awesome.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
I love that.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.920
Love that.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.920
Can I tell you something?

21:47.920 --> 21:55.560
This is actually, I saw that on someone's mug one time when I was in college, and it's

21:55.560 --> 21:59.640
actually kind of, it was kind of traumatizing for me because it was the uncoolest thing

21:59.640 --> 22:00.640
I've ever seen.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.640
Right.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.440
And it was actually hard for me to vocalize just then.

22:03.440 --> 22:08.040
I was like feeling bad saying it because I found the experience of seeing it the first

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
time so painful.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
Yeah.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.360
Well, let's dive into that, Justin, because maybe it's just that you're unwilling to open

22:12.360 --> 22:13.360
yourself up.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.360
I don't want to unpack it.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.360
Okay.

22:15.360 --> 22:20.840
So you get one mug for every person that works in the office, and you write their name on

22:20.840 --> 22:23.560
the bottom of it, but you keep them all in your office.

22:23.560 --> 22:28.120
Oh, so they have to come to you to get their mugs?

22:28.120 --> 22:30.280
Well, so they have the option, right?

22:30.280 --> 22:34.400
Because you go to the, oh, you go to the sink, ah, Derek, here's my mugs, my mugs there.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.800
Well, I know Tom has an extra mug with my name on it.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
For me?

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
Yeah.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
I could go buy-

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
My backup mug.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.800
I could go get my backup mug from Tom.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.800
Yeah.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.400
I don't have to worry if none of our stuff is helpful.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.400
You don't think that's helpful?

22:47.400 --> 22:53.720
I just feel like if you did any of this, it would just make you a bad coworker.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.480
Take the door off your office.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.480
Yeah.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.840
Yeah, do that yourself.

22:58.840 --> 23:04.360
Like in office space, if you just do all the stuff like the office space man, everybody

23:04.360 --> 23:05.360
liked that guy at the end.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.360
They did.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.360
I loved office space man.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.360
He thought it was funny.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.440
Everybody else did too.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.160
And they just kept giving him more money.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.160
Yeah.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.760
I don't know if you remember that part, but everybody really loved that guy.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.040
They really did.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.120
And the people who were working hard, they were getting fired.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.120
Yeah.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.840
And he was hardly working and he kept climbing up the wall.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.360
So anyway, here's the plot of office space.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.360
A man gets hit in time.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.360
Uh-huh.

23:26.360 --> 23:27.360
And in the middle, a man dies.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.320
So I got a call from the wizard yesterday.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.120
He said he got some good stuff for me.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.120
And he-

23:33.120 --> 23:34.120
Oh, like drugs?

23:34.120 --> 23:37.200
He actually drove by my house and he dropped off this WikiHow article.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.920
And he said, he said, he said, don't tell.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.400
And then he, yeah.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.400
And then he drove-

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
He said it like that?

23:44.400 --> 23:47.720
And then guys, I swear to God, his car drove up.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.720
Okay.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.800
Wait, did he make you walk outside and meet him at his car?

23:52.800 --> 23:53.800
Yeah.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.720
So he drove over to your house.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.720
Well my-

23:56.720 --> 23:58.800
Made you come outside and get it.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.580
Our infant is home.

24:00.580 --> 24:04.400
And so like, I didn't want him to come in, to come inside.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.400
Do you know what I mean?

24:05.400 --> 24:06.400
He already knows where you live.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.400
You're done.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
Yeah.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.400
I guess so.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.400
But anyway, his car-

24:10.400 --> 24:11.400
He drove him in.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
That's very important.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
That's all that matters.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
He drove up into the clouds.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
And here's a WikiHow that was sent by-

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
Like at the end of Grease?

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Yep.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
By Graham Roebuck.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.400
Thanks, Graham.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.280
It's a great, it's a really good one.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.960
And this one's fresh off the press.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.060
This one's from June 2nd.

24:25.060 --> 24:30.200
So it's a hot one because the title of this one is How to Become a Civil War Corpse.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.200
Whoa.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.200
What?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
And it's not like-

24:33.200 --> 24:34.200
No, wait, hold on.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
Just give me a second.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.200
Yeah.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
Okay.

24:37.200 --> 24:44.360
Getting a time machine and do a bad job at Gettysburg is one of them, for sure, one of

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
the big ones.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
Yeah.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.040
Charging up a hill, defending a post, maneuvering a flank, everyone wants to be the hero of

24:49.040 --> 24:50.520
Civil War reenactments.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.520
Nope.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.520
Yeah.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.680
But one thing is always in short supply, corpses.

24:54.680 --> 24:58.320
Clutching your chest and falling down doesn't exactly cut it in terms of historical accuracy.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
This article will help you get started.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
Okay.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.320
They didn't even have chests back then.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.320
A lot of people didn't.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.320
No.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.320
Here's what I would like.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.000
I'm just going to continue, this is giving me the idea that I would like to be a corpse

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
at a Civil War reenactment, but I would like to be there when everyone else gets there

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
and my corpse is part of a different thing.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I mean, it's still part-

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Okay.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.080
I'm still playing the game, right?

25:18.080 --> 25:22.320
But I just happened to be a corpse on the battlefield when they showed up to fight and

25:22.320 --> 25:23.320
then-

25:23.320 --> 25:24.320
Which had to happen at least one time.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.320
Right?

25:25.320 --> 25:28.840
So often, way more than one time, if somebody trips over a corpse in the middle of a fresh

25:28.840 --> 25:32.440
new battle and they're like, guys, stop the battle, stop the battle.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
Who-

25:33.440 --> 25:34.440
Do you think they ever-

25:34.440 --> 25:35.440
Guys.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.440
Can we do this mystery?

25:36.440 --> 25:37.440
Please?

25:37.440 --> 25:38.440
Please?

25:38.440 --> 25:39.440
Just this one time?

25:39.440 --> 25:40.440
Someone's been murdered?

25:40.440 --> 25:41.440
Is this one of yours?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.440
It's not one of ours.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.440
It's one of-

25:43.440 --> 25:44.440
This cat's wearing orange.

25:44.440 --> 25:45.440
He's not one of us.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.440
I don't see who works here.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.640
I don't think he works here, guys.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.640
We have-

25:49.640 --> 25:53.480
Hey, hey, other team, stop war for a second.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.680
We have to come together to get all the clues to solve this one.

25:56.680 --> 26:02.720
Then we can go back to us saying slavery is obviously bad and you guys supporting it,

26:02.720 --> 26:04.720
but first, we got to-

26:04.720 --> 26:05.720
Travis.

26:05.720 --> 26:06.720
Yeah?

26:06.720 --> 26:07.720
Travis, it was about heritage.

26:07.720 --> 26:08.720
A lot of t-shirts.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.720
Well.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.920
Listen, I used to be confused too, but I saw a lot of t-shirts around here before me as

26:13.920 --> 26:14.920
about heritage.

26:14.920 --> 26:15.920
Not hate.

26:15.920 --> 26:16.920
So that was-

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
I see.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.920
I see.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.920
I see.

26:19.920 --> 26:20.920
I see.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.920
Okay.

26:21.920 --> 26:27.760
You don't actually believe that, do you, Justin?

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
No.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.720
It's especially irritating in West Virginia.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.720
Yes.

26:31.720 --> 26:38.720
It's like, okay, even if I take you at face value, you know that we literally like, we're

26:38.720 --> 26:42.680
like, well, we're just going to scooch over here so far that we become our own state so

26:42.680 --> 26:44.640
we don't have to be on your team.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.520
It's definitely not a good fit for West Virginians.

26:47.520 --> 26:50.380
So for you, we can rule that out, right?

26:50.380 --> 26:52.720
So it's definitely about just the racism, right?

26:52.720 --> 26:53.720
It's just the other thing.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.680
I don't know how to tell you guys this.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.680
You're all Yankees.

26:56.680 --> 27:02.800
Yeah, you are definitely Yankees and you just don't like black people like that year.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.080
So it's just racism.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.080
Cool.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.080
Cool.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.080
Okay.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
Cool.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
Cool.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.080
Cool.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.320
What would be a- like, it's hard to be a fun Corpse, isn't it?

27:12.320 --> 27:13.880
Well, here's my suggestion.

27:13.880 --> 27:14.880
Okay.

27:14.880 --> 27:15.880
Gangrene.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
Okay.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.880
You get shot.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.600
You pretend to get shot in the leg and then you just spend the rest of the battle just

27:20.600 --> 27:23.200
going like, oh, God.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.200
Slowly expiring.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
This is never going to get better.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.200
Oh, man.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.200
Who's got lead medicine?

27:28.200 --> 27:29.200
Anyone?

27:29.200 --> 27:30.200
Oh, shoot.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.200
Oh, God.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.720
I'm up shit creek over here.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.720
I wish we had invented penicillin.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.720
Oh, damn it.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.720
All right.

27:37.720 --> 27:43.880
So the first two steps, find your unit, do a Google search, find out where battles are

27:43.880 --> 27:46.480
taking place, find out when.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.480
It's a lot of work.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.480
It's a lot of work.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.320
Make sure you have a period accurate uniform.

27:53.320 --> 27:57.160
It says, remember this American Civil War was fought between the Union and Confederate

27:57.160 --> 27:58.160
armies.

27:58.160 --> 28:04.080
Knights and stormtroopers were not at the Battle of the Shiloh, lo lo lo lo.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.320
And then march into battle.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.760
Some reenactors march in columns with their units, other run onto the battlefield waving

28:08.760 --> 28:10.880
their arms and screaming, it's your call.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.880
The next step is-

28:11.880 --> 28:12.880
I'm doing that second one.

28:12.880 --> 28:13.880
Are you kidding me?

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
Yeah.

28:14.880 --> 28:20.680
I'm going to make myself look big to intimidate you.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.480
The next step seems like the most important one.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.680
Step five, get shot.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.560
Make sure you're falling over just as your enemy shoots.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.680
Nothing's more embarrassing than falling over to silence.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.040
You'll look like the world's stupidest soldier.

28:34.040 --> 28:38.080
Also, take care not to fall over after the sound of your own side's guns, lest you look

28:38.080 --> 28:39.880
like you got fragged.

28:39.880 --> 28:40.880
Okay.

28:40.880 --> 28:46.720
Now, Griffin, do they give instructions on how to, you hear the shot, you fall down,

28:46.720 --> 28:50.000
but then you're like, I was just faking it to get your guard down.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.560
Now I'm shooting you.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.920
And then what to do if the other side is like, I fell down, but I was faking it too, and

28:55.920 --> 28:57.720
I've got an invisible grenade.

28:57.720 --> 28:58.720
Boom.

28:58.720 --> 28:59.720
Yes.

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
Boom.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.920
And then you're like, okay, well, I have a chainsaw and it's like, well, I have an invisible

29:03.920 --> 29:04.920
force field.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.480
Like, well, my chainsaw is magic and cut through force fields.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.160
Well, my force field is scientific, so it's not affected by magic.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.160
That kind of thing?

29:12.160 --> 29:13.160
Is that in there?

29:13.160 --> 29:14.160
Yeah.

29:14.160 --> 29:18.680
That's step six through 19 is all that stuff you just said.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.760
Clutch your wound.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.320
Spectators need to know where you've been shot and that it hurts, hence the clutching.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.320
It doesn't say-

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
Oh, my balls.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.320
Yeah.

29:26.320 --> 29:29.320
It shows a person clutching the chest, but the copy doesn't say the chest.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
So like-

29:30.320 --> 29:31.320
No.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.320
You could have gotten shot right in your beampus and say like, oh.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.320
Well, that's the thing.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.360
In 1860, rifles were very inaccurate.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.820
They didn't have a very good tooling on that.

29:40.820 --> 29:43.440
So chances are you're not getting shot in the chest.

29:43.440 --> 29:49.440
And as Travis has said, Dan Green, a very, very genuine, you, you, you know, doing some

29:49.440 --> 29:57.160
home reno accidentally, you know, get a nail in your hand, you're fucking dead, dude.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.060
Like you're not gonna, you're donzo.

29:59.060 --> 30:00.060
They don't have a thing.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.580
They don't have medicine for that yet.

30:02.580 --> 30:03.580
So clutch anywhere.

30:03.580 --> 30:07.080
That's not saying you could get shot in the toe and go down and you're fucked.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.080
And you're dead.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.080
You know what I mean?

30:09.080 --> 30:10.080
This one's wild.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.080
Prepare your death cry.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.080
This area is open to the most artistic interpretation.

30:13.080 --> 30:18.120
Most people go with, ah, but the more elaborate death cries could build backstory into your

30:18.120 --> 30:19.120
character.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
Yeah.

30:20.120 --> 30:27.160
For example, try this one's for you and, ah, or no, you're not dying for your aunt.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.720
Or this one's wild.

30:29.720 --> 30:32.600
I'm coming for you, Mr. Lincoln.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
Sorry.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.600
What?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.840
I'm coming for you, Mr. Lincoln.

30:37.840 --> 30:38.840
I'm what?

30:38.840 --> 30:40.640
I'm coming to heaven to kill you.

30:40.640 --> 30:41.640
What?

30:41.640 --> 30:46.600
I also am pretty sure that during the civil war, Lincoln was still alive.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.600
That would be a weird.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.320
How about, not again.

30:51.320 --> 30:54.920
This is what the prophecy warned me about.

30:54.920 --> 30:55.920
Not again.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.800
Oh, no.

30:57.800 --> 31:03.960
And on my day of retirement, and on my birthday would be a good one.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.320
It's my birthday and all I wanted was to kill Mr. Lincoln.

31:07.320 --> 31:15.260
And also I had a coupon for a free scuba basket rabbit.

31:15.260 --> 31:18.320
The most important thing with the death cries, you must interrupt whatever you're saying

31:18.320 --> 31:21.160
with.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
Fall down.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.120
Except it takes a long time to die.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.120
Yeah.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
Fall down.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.520
If you're in the front rank, fall forward so you don't knock over the guy behind you.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.640
And if you're in the rear range, fall backward.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.640
Very thoughtful.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.640
What if you're in the middle?

31:34.640 --> 31:35.640
Thunk.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.640
Ow.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.640
Fucking asshole.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.640
You bumped into me.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.680
All I wanted was to kill Lincoln on my birthday.

31:41.680 --> 31:47.920
And also your bayonet is now for real in my shoulder, so that's a problem for sure, for

31:47.920 --> 31:48.920
sure, for sure.

31:48.920 --> 31:53.160
You scuffed my fucking 18th century Pumas.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.200
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.200
But I'm dead.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.200
Fall down.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.200
I'm coming for you.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.200
What was his name?

31:59.200 --> 32:04.560
Guys, guys, what's the guy with the hat?

32:04.560 --> 32:06.560
He's got the hat and the beard.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.560
What was his name?

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
Lincoln?

32:10.560 --> 32:11.560
Professor Cool Hat?

32:11.560 --> 32:12.560
I'm coming for you, Professor Cool Hat.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.560
I'll be straight with you guys.

32:13.560 --> 32:19.240
It would be a lot easier to think about this if I didn't have a bullet in my toes.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.240
Lay there.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.600
You must remain still until the battle is over.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.520
An exception to the rule is if the reenactment allows zombies.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.680
See tips section.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.160
I believe I will.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.480
Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.

32:30.480 --> 32:31.480
Just quick question.

32:31.480 --> 32:35.000
Do you think that it would get you in trouble if you fall down and then you just kind of

32:35.000 --> 32:40.040
slowly pop your AirPods in and you're just like, whoop, and then you just go back to

32:40.040 --> 32:43.000
laying there while you listen to like This American Life or something?

32:43.000 --> 32:48.400
If I could get in a time machine and I was doing my death cry, you know what I'm saying?

32:48.400 --> 32:51.800
And I get killed in a civil war, and I'd rather not get killed in a civil war than a way to

32:51.800 --> 32:52.800
fake it.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.880
But like, I would just shout, I'm inventing Spider-Man.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.880
Oh, that's cool.

32:58.880 --> 33:03.000
And so every, and at the first, people wouldn't get it.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.880
Like there would be like probably 20 people who are like, no, the craziest thing I ever

33:06.880 --> 33:14.760
saw in a war, this dude was like, after he got shot, this, this, this dude fell over

33:14.760 --> 33:17.440
and he was like, I'm inventing Spider-Man, right?

33:17.440 --> 33:18.440
Yeah.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.080
And it was, it was a while since I ever saw it.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.080
Their kids would hear it.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.080
And eventually they'd hear about Spider-Man, right?

33:24.080 --> 33:26.440
And they'd be like, hold on a second.

33:26.440 --> 33:30.360
I don't think you actually came up with this, Stan Lee and Steve.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.640
I don't think it's your baby.

33:31.640 --> 33:37.800
I think actually what happened is, I think actually Justin McElroy, an old civil war

33:37.800 --> 33:40.800
soldier, invented him as he died.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.800
And then who was that?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
Your battle with Justin?

33:43.800 --> 33:44.880
Well, it's Robert E. Lee.

33:44.880 --> 33:50.400
And a century later, his grandson, his great grandson, excuse me, Stan Lee was like, my

33:50.400 --> 33:56.720
papa's papa told me once about a man, a brave man who invented Spider-Man.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.440
So I'm going to steal that from that dead fool because he didn't copyright that shit.

34:01.440 --> 34:05.000
But I'm going to add a hyphen so it's legally different.

34:05.000 --> 34:12.740
It could be, I have no interest in LARPing as a Confederate general.

34:12.740 --> 34:16.160
That's not something that appeals to me in the least.

34:16.160 --> 34:23.200
But in the same vein, it could be fun to cosplay as say Stonewall Jackson and just be out there

34:23.200 --> 34:29.040
and get shot instantly and fall down and be like, oh, I landed on my little beeper and

34:29.040 --> 34:35.200
I shit my pants and I have shit, like if there's a high school there, like, oh, no, my always

34:35.200 --> 34:40.960
diarrhea that I have and I'm going to pass down to all my ancestors, oh, no.

34:40.960 --> 34:47.480
The only good thing about being on the Confederate side in a Civil War reenactment is that you

34:47.480 --> 34:51.120
know the exact picture that will be used of you when you get canceled.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.120
Oh, yeah.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.120
Sure, sure.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.160
It's nice to have that kind of image control, I think, because like, that's the one they're

34:56.160 --> 34:57.160
running, right?

34:57.160 --> 34:58.960
Like, that's the one.

34:58.960 --> 35:04.800
You know, that's the shot, is you charging forward, saber aloft, defending the-

35:04.800 --> 35:05.800
For racism!

35:05.800 --> 35:06.800
Yeah, right?

35:06.800 --> 35:07.800
That's the image.

35:07.800 --> 35:08.800
Oh, no, no, no.

35:08.800 --> 35:09.800
Sure, for sure.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.080
But then you look closer at the picture and does he have his hand down the front of his

35:13.080 --> 35:18.240
pants and he's wincing like his balls always hurt and he shit his pants like he's making

35:18.240 --> 35:19.240
fun of Stonewall Jackson?

35:19.240 --> 35:20.240
That's funny.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.800
That's funny, actually.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.440
Look here with a magnifying glass.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.240
That in his pocket, is that a note that says, I'm inventing Spider-Man?

35:27.240 --> 35:28.240
That's wild.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.160
This is a picture of Griffin dressed up as Stonewall Jackson.

35:31.160 --> 35:35.080
Wait a minute, but look, his pants fell down and he's wearing a diaper that says, I'm an

35:35.080 --> 35:36.080
idiot on it.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.080
Oh, man.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.080
I guess he fucking got it.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.080
Oh, shit.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.080
Is this a- Griffin did a protest!

35:40.080 --> 35:41.080
Griffin did a protest, everybody!

35:41.080 --> 35:42.080
What's he protesting?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.080
Stonewall Jackson, I guess?

35:43.080 --> 35:44.080
Wait, but he was in the reenact- Yeah.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.080
Yeah, I know.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
That's the weird thing.

35:46.080 --> 35:56.080
He was wearing a shitty diaper that he had drawn the words, I'm an idiot on it, with

35:56.080 --> 35:57.080
Sharpie.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.080
Wow.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
That's a beautiful statement, huh?

35:59.080 --> 36:01.640
It really makes you think about family.

36:01.640 --> 36:08.560
The place where you people fuck up in Civil War reenactments is that they get out of their

36:08.560 --> 36:12.000
Yaris and they walk to where the fight is.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Yeah.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.080
If it's me, kind of the bad boy of reenactments.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.080
As you are now.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.240
I drive the Yaris right up to it.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.240
Yeah.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.120
I'm like, hey, guys, I fucking invented cars.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.120
Let's go.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
Yeah.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.120
Let's go.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.600
Let's plow through the Confederates in my Toyota Yaris.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.800
Hey, everybody, get in.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.320
I'm sick of this bloody battle.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.560
We're going to go have an eating competition.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Yes.

36:32.560 --> 36:36.440
Let's settle this with food eating.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.280
With food eating, as they say.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.280
Come on.

36:39.280 --> 36:44.600
And that's how my great-great-great-grandfather, Joey Chestnut Sr. Sr. Sr. was invented.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.760
Excuse me, Joseph?

36:46.760 --> 36:47.760
Yes?

36:47.760 --> 36:48.760
People don't get invented.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.760
Yes.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.760
That's a good point.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.760
Oh, excellent.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.760
I guess I'm fucking high on hot dogs right now, dog, I don't know what to tell you.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.040
I tripped out of my mind on sliders, ate too many.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.040
I got too many sulfates.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.040
I don't know what's happening.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.040
I had too many sulfates, bro.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.040
I don't know what to tell you.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.040
I'm in a hard head space right now.

37:02.040 --> 37:10.160
I don't know if you saw, but I ate four pounds of flaming hot Cheetos, so I'm having a pretty

37:10.160 --> 37:11.160
bad day.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.160
I just lied about my family.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.160
I'm sorry.

37:13.160 --> 37:18.760
And now I'm going to give you some Oracle of Delphi-style prophecies as I huff these

37:18.760 --> 37:19.760
wiener for you.

37:19.760 --> 37:24.200
I want to be sure with you, I don't know where the food goes.

37:24.200 --> 37:29.720
My brain creates these elaborate lies to try to justify it, but I mean, to be straight

37:29.720 --> 37:31.080
with you, I haven't pooped in five years.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.520
I don't know where it goes.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.080
But I got lumpy arms.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.080
Help me.

37:35.080 --> 37:44.440
The ripples of Joey Chestnut's bonkers actions every July 4th in this country radiates out

37:44.440 --> 37:52.120
away from the impact event, so much so that I feel like we spend the run up to July 4th

37:52.120 --> 37:58.200
and also the rest of the summer after it talking about Joey Chestnut a lot.

37:58.200 --> 38:04.080
Around Christmas time, that dude's as good as dead, but if it's hot outside, my-

38:04.080 --> 38:07.640
Yeah, the thermometer goes up as does our awareness of Joey Chestnut.

38:07.640 --> 38:08.640
Exactly.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.080
I will be sweating outside, and I'll be like, man, I sure am sweaty.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.080
It's hot.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.560
It's hot like the summer months.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.000
July is a summer month.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.520
The 4th of July is a day in this month of July.

38:19.520 --> 38:25.800
Hey, Joey Chestnut sure eats a fucking lot of hot dogs, huh?

38:25.800 --> 38:31.000
The poor man, every year it seems like he's breaking the record, and that's got to be,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.960
I bet there's some July 4th where Joey wakes up and says, I don't actually feel like eating

38:34.960 --> 38:35.960
a lot of hot dogs today.

38:35.960 --> 38:36.960
You know what?

38:36.960 --> 38:39.400
I'm not actually in the mood for hot dogs.

38:39.400 --> 38:45.320
I want to post up a respectable number, but I bet he wishes the first time he won, he

38:45.320 --> 38:49.560
had won by one hot dog.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.080
He shouldn't have pushed it so hard.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.920
Just eat one more than the other person, because then you could break your record consistently

38:54.920 --> 38:57.920
by a hot dog every year, not by several.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.320
He could just stop, wait for the other person to be done and be like, what did you get up

39:01.320 --> 39:02.320
to?

39:02.320 --> 39:03.320
Okay, boop, I'm done.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.320
Yeah, I'm done.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.920
I eat one more than you.

39:07.920 --> 39:15.680
We need to take a break and serve the corporate overlords.

39:15.680 --> 39:22.360
I want to tell you about stamps.com.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.360
Do it.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.360
So here's what happens, right?

39:24.360 --> 39:25.560
You got a letter.

39:25.560 --> 39:28.000
You wrote a letter to your pal, right?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.080
This is your pal.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.600
They live in a different state and you got to give this letter to them.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.600
You go to put it in the mail.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.600
What?

39:33.600 --> 39:34.600
Oh no.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.560
I don't got a stamp.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.560
What are you going to do?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.880
Drive to the post office?

39:39.880 --> 39:42.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:42.160 --> 39:46.440
You're going to use your digital scale and you're going to print off postage right from

39:46.440 --> 39:47.440
your computer.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.920
Yes, my friends, this is the future we're living in.

39:50.920 --> 39:58.640
The future is now with stamps.com, a website on the worldwide web that can give you postage

39:58.640 --> 40:01.120
for your letter to your pal.

40:01.120 --> 40:06.000
You can print official US postage and shipping labels 24 seven without having to leave your

40:06.000 --> 40:09.680
desk ever or by any fancy equipment.

40:09.680 --> 40:13.120
All you need is your computer and standard printer and it's not just US postage.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.120
You could do UPS shipping services from your computer as well.

40:16.120 --> 40:22.600
They offer deals you can't get anywhere else, like up to 40% off USPS and up to 66% off

40:22.600 --> 40:29.020
UPS shipping rates and you never leave your desk ever because you're going to ship it.

40:29.020 --> 40:33.560
The post office person is going to come to your desk, leave the door open a little bit

40:33.560 --> 40:37.500
and a note on the door that says, please come to my desk and get this letter and I'll give

40:37.500 --> 40:39.640
you a Dove chocolate.

40:39.640 --> 40:43.920
Stop wasting time going to the post office and go to stamps.com instead.

40:43.920 --> 40:52.040

41:11.140 --> 41:16.500

41:16.500 --> 41:18.120
Never go to the post office again.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.460
It's totally safe.

41:20.460 --> 41:26.000
Food waste is a massive problem in this nation and there's a lot of different ways you could

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
address the problem.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.200
Well, here's one great way.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.200
It's imperfect foods.

41:30.200 --> 41:34.720
Every day, delicious groceries, just they don't, they don't look so good.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.720
You know what I mean?

41:35.720 --> 41:36.720
Like they don't look like in the test book.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.040
Oh, like the weird ones where you look at it and you're like, what is that?

41:39.040 --> 41:41.640
I prefer to use the term imperfect, Travis.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.760
Yeah, but I mean like a durian or like a star fruit.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.320
No, no, no, no, no.

41:46.320 --> 41:50.000
Not the intrinsically weird ones, like the sort of like off brand ones.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.560
You know, the imperfect foods is turning this around by sourcing quirky, but delicious foods

41:55.560 --> 42:00.000
and delivering them in a way proven to reduce emissions.

42:00.000 --> 42:06.020
And did you know in 2019, this is shocking, 35% of the food supply went unsold or uneaten.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.020
That's wild.

42:07.020 --> 42:09.080
That's a wild amount of waste.

42:09.080 --> 42:14.560
So you could get these delivered to you and cut down on this waste.

42:14.560 --> 42:21.560
It delivers by neighborhood, which is a unique model that produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions

42:21.560 --> 42:24.220
than individual trips to the grocery store.

42:24.220 --> 42:29.320

42:56.480 --> 43:01.160
Tell me about it.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.160
Video games.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
Video games.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.160
Video games.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.720
You like them?

43:05.720 --> 43:07.340
Maybe you wish you had more time for them.

43:07.340 --> 43:08.960
Maybe you want to know the best ones to play.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.600
Maybe you want to know what happens to Mario when he dies.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.960
In that case, you should check out TripleClick.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.200
It's a podcast about video games.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.680
A podcast about video games?

43:17.680 --> 43:19.480
But I don't have time for that.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
Sure you do.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.600
Once a week, Kickback is three video game experts give you everything from critical

43:23.600 --> 43:28.120
takes on the hottest new releases, to scoops, interviews, and explanations about how video

43:28.120 --> 43:32.800
games work, to fascinating and sometimes weird stories about the games we love.

43:32.800 --> 43:37.700
TripleClick is hosted by me, Kirk Hamilton, me, Jason Schreier, and me, Maddie Myers.

43:37.700 --> 43:41.640
You can find TripleClick wherever you get your podcasts and listen at MaximumFun.org.

43:41.640 --> 43:42.640
Bye!

43:42.640 --> 44:11.280
Welcome to Munch Squad is a very brief podcast

44:11.280 --> 44:15.640
within a podcast which we spend a lot of time talking about Jungle Cruise, which in hindsight

44:15.640 --> 44:16.640
was the right move.

44:16.640 --> 44:21.240
If we don't talk about it now, when are we going to talk about it?

44:21.240 --> 44:22.720
If not now, when?

44:22.720 --> 44:23.720
Last week when it was released?

44:23.720 --> 44:24.720
Now!

44:24.720 --> 44:25.720
Don't be crazy.

44:25.720 --> 44:26.720
We can't go back in time.

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
Don't be silly.

44:27.720 --> 44:29.360
We were busy talking about Halloween.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.880
We were talking about Halloween.

44:31.880 --> 44:36.640
Very very briefly, Marble Slab Creamery has Hot Cheetos milkshakes, but that, I don't

44:36.640 --> 44:37.640
have a story.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.400
I just want to let you know that that's happening.

44:39.400 --> 44:40.840
Okay, thank you.

44:40.840 --> 44:45.920
You could, if you have one of those around you, you can go get some hot ice cream.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.560
So there you go.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.560
Bojangles.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.720
Now you guys know the sad tale of Bojangles as it pertains to me personally, Justin Mapel.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.360
The one near you closed.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.840
No, sir.

44:55.840 --> 44:58.540
The one near me got extremely popular.

44:58.540 --> 45:04.040
So popular, in fact, that they had to redirect traffic, as I detailed in an episode of My

45:04.040 --> 45:08.480
Brother My Brother and Me, they had to redirect traffic because there was such a massive line

45:08.480 --> 45:10.280
to go to Bojangles.

45:10.280 --> 45:15.120
And then they opened another one and everybody's like, well, fuck this, there's two of them.

45:15.120 --> 45:20.560
And somehow they cannibalize each other's businesses to an extent that they both shut

45:20.560 --> 45:21.560
down.

45:21.560 --> 45:27.300
And now if I want to go to Bojangles, I got to drive two hours to Lexington, hard pass.

45:27.300 --> 45:35.760
So they, this is why I'm angry about it because Bojangles has unleashed a new hand breaded

45:35.760 --> 45:37.720
chicken sandwich.

45:37.720 --> 45:40.120
And it's just like Popeye's chicken sandwich.

45:40.120 --> 45:47.040
Just last week said, we're sorry to start the war, but we're ending it now.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.240
Let there be peace.

45:48.240 --> 45:55.200
And Bojangles just stumbles drunkenly with no appreciation for what ballot, the delicate

45:55.200 --> 45:58.200
ceasefire that they are unsettling.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.920
They're just like charging in here like, we got a new one too.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.520
Now it's big like the others.

46:02.520 --> 46:05.000
To be fair to Bojangles, I would say-

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
There's no need for that.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
They closed, they broke.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.520
But here's what I'm saying, is if I was in the war, right?

46:10.520 --> 46:13.880
And I really wanted to kill somebody, there was someone I really wanted to kill.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.080
And the other side was like, hey, how about a ceasefire?

46:16.080 --> 46:18.320
I'd be like, give me one second.

46:18.320 --> 46:25.760
I need one quick thing that can't be counted as a murder and then the war can be over

46:25.760 --> 46:27.240
because I hate my friend Doug so much.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.120
I'll definitely sign that paper in just a second.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.120
I'll sign it.

46:31.120 --> 46:36.960
But hey, they probably did that like, hey, we're about to quit and give up the war.

46:36.960 --> 46:41.440
Does anybody have anybody they really, really, really wanted to kill before it will be a

46:41.440 --> 46:43.240
murder in a second?

46:43.240 --> 46:44.880
Yeah, I'd like to.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.960
Okay, you have 10 minutes, okay, but that's it.

46:47.960 --> 46:54.280
How many months after it do you think people would kill people they didn't like and just

46:54.280 --> 46:55.280
be like, oh, the war's over?

46:55.280 --> 46:56.280
Oh, I didn't know.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.280
Over?

46:57.280 --> 46:58.280
Oh, sorry.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.280
Oh, man.

46:59.280 --> 47:02.280
We don't have TV or internet or anything yet.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.280
I just hadn't-

47:03.280 --> 47:06.360
I just, I hate my cousin Doug from Georgia so much.

47:06.360 --> 47:09.320
And I swear I heard him saying some stuff.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.640
He said he wanted to start.

47:10.640 --> 47:15.200
He said actually the words, I'm starting it back up again and I was like, no, and I'm

47:15.200 --> 47:16.200
a hero.

47:16.200 --> 47:20.320
And I'm confused then and I felt like I was doing a good thing.

47:20.320 --> 47:21.320
Shoot.

47:21.320 --> 47:22.320
Yeah.

47:22.320 --> 47:27.400
Do you think when like the people were having this terrible civil war that was pitting American

47:27.400 --> 47:30.040
against American, brother versus brother, do you think-

47:30.040 --> 47:31.040
Dad versus dad.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.040
Dad versus dad.

47:32.040 --> 47:35.560
Do you think one of the things they thought was like, well, this is so sad.

47:35.560 --> 47:38.400
No one will make jokes about it at least, you know?

47:38.400 --> 47:39.400
Yeah.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.400
Okay.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.400
So Bojangles-

47:41.400 --> 47:42.400
Okay.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.400
I've just been reading the press release verbatim to this point.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.520
It's several pages long.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.520
Let me skip.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.520
Let me see.

47:47.520 --> 47:53.080
Civil war, civil war, civil war, brother versus brother, dad versus dad.

47:53.080 --> 47:59.920
Bojangles knows a thing or two about delicious, perfectly flavored chicken served right.

47:59.920 --> 48:04.640
So who better to give fans a chicken sandwich that is sure to please?

48:04.640 --> 48:09.960
It's from Chef Marshall Scarborough, Vice President of Menu and Culinary Innovation

48:09.960 --> 48:11.640
for Bojangles.

48:11.640 --> 48:17.680
And we could say with confidence that Bo's chicken sandwich is so clucking good, you

48:17.680 --> 48:19.640
know it could only be Bojangles.

48:19.640 --> 48:24.760
I have one of my pet peeves is when people do that and they like take an obvious curse

48:24.760 --> 48:29.280
word and change it a little bit because like it's clearly there so that everyone knows

48:29.280 --> 48:31.520
that he meant fucking good, right?

48:31.520 --> 48:37.040
So all you're doing is just muddying the waters of, just say, hey, in this press release for

48:37.040 --> 48:40.960
a Bojangles chicken sandwich, it's fucking good.

48:40.960 --> 48:45.720
You're gonna, you're not gonna like the rest of this press release.

48:45.720 --> 48:50.400
Listen to this extra description of the same chicken sandwich everyone has been releasing

48:50.400 --> 48:52.440
since Popeye's.

48:52.440 --> 48:58.680
Pillowed between a toasted and buttered, I don't think that counts.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.360
I don't think you can pillow it.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.360
Nope.

49:01.360 --> 49:07.880
Pillowed between a toasted and buttered bakery bun, so the bakery, okay, so it was baked

49:07.880 --> 49:08.880
in a bakery.

49:08.880 --> 49:09.920
Well, that's a hell of a thing.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.560
What a bun.

49:11.560 --> 49:19.880
Pillowed between a toasted and buttered bakery bun is a juicy marinated chicken breast, juicy

49:19.880 --> 49:25.360
marinated chicken breast, hand breaded with crispy buttermilk coating and dusted with

49:25.360 --> 49:27.120
a secret mix of bold spices.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.960
It's a fucking chicken sandwich.

49:28.960 --> 49:29.960
We get it.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.960
Accompanying the chicken.

49:30.960 --> 49:41.000
Is a layer of creamy, zesty mayonnaise, affixed, affixed, I say, with thick cut dill pickles.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.160
It's a chicken sandwich.

49:44.160 --> 49:47.360
Our team had a blast perfecting this.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.360
Wee!

49:48.360 --> 49:49.360
Woohoo!

49:49.360 --> 49:51.600
Hand me another pickle, buddy.

49:51.600 --> 49:52.600
You got it.

49:52.600 --> 49:53.600
Woo!

49:53.600 --> 49:54.600
Oh, man.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.600
I've eaten 12 of these things.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.600
I don't have the time of my fucking life.

49:57.600 --> 49:58.600
Wee!

49:58.600 --> 50:00.960
They had a blast perfecting this sandwich.

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
We can't wait.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.960
I don't miss my kids at all.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.120
I'm not going home.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.120
I sleep here.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.120
I love these things.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.120
I'm going to pillow myself on this bun for a pillow.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.520
I'm pillowing myself on this pillow.

50:11.520 --> 50:17.920
One flavor packed bite will have even the most well mannered person saying, that's so

50:17.920 --> 50:18.920
clucking good.

50:18.920 --> 50:19.920
Jesus Christ.

50:19.920 --> 50:22.280
What did you just, what the fuck did you just say?

50:22.280 --> 50:23.480
You're usually so well mannered.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.480
I'm sorry.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.480
I'm sorry.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.960
I was just so clucking good.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.800
I'm kicking you out of seminary.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.980
Get out of here.

50:30.980 --> 50:38.880
This is actually, this next one may be one of the most sort of soul crunching things

50:38.880 --> 50:47.040
I've read on Munch Squad, and it's a pretty high bar at this point, but I think I can't

50:47.040 --> 50:52.480
believe I had to say the thing about meddling in the affairs of dragons, staying one step

50:52.480 --> 50:59.440
ahead of the quote, so good you could put it on a t-shirt end quote reaction.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.480
This sandwich is bound to elicit.

51:01.480 --> 51:07.680
Bojangles did put it on a t-shirt, anitope bag and a bucket hat.

51:07.680 --> 51:12.800
Fans of the brand can snag theirs here, and it is a non-functioning link.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.440
It's not linked to anything.

51:14.440 --> 51:24.360
So I guess I had to go to their actual website, and they have a bag, and it says so clucking

51:24.360 --> 51:30.640
good on it, and then there's a Bojangles retractable pen for 95 cents.

51:30.640 --> 51:37.160
So I can't, I do have to credit them for their reasonable prices on this stuff.

51:37.160 --> 51:40.520
They got an airbrushed koozie that says biscuit beach on it.

51:40.520 --> 51:41.520
Well, I do like that.

51:41.520 --> 51:42.520
Wait, hold on.

51:42.520 --> 51:43.520
Huh?

51:43.520 --> 51:44.520
That's pretty good.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.800
They got t-shirt that says we're the real deal.

51:47.800 --> 51:52.200
And then there's like a lot of biscuit beach merch that I actually need.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.000
Greetings from biscuit beach.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.560
It's a yellow type, man, I'm getting this.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.880
I can't try these.

51:59.880 --> 52:05.900
So let me know, you know, if you want to fuel the chicken sandwich wars, stir them back

52:05.900 --> 52:10.080
up again, head on over to Bojangles and, or get it at the app.

52:10.080 --> 52:13.120
You know, they don't have, everybody's going to have an app now.

52:13.120 --> 52:16.120
Just real quick, before we move on to the rest of the show, I'm workshopping a new game

52:16.120 --> 52:18.400
in my head called Would You Rather?

52:18.400 --> 52:22.520
It's where Justin and Griffin get into the mindset of Dan Rather, and then I ask them

52:22.520 --> 52:28.000
if Dan Rather would do something, and then they answer me as to whether or not Dan Rather,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.460
they think as Dan Rather, if they would do it.

52:30.460 --> 52:34.920
So I just need people to tweet at me things that they would want to know if Dan Rather

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
would do or not.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.920
Yeah, I think our audience definitely knows who Dan Rather is.

52:38.920 --> 52:43.840
Yeah, so if you want to send me those, you can just tweet at me and just add the hashtag

52:43.840 --> 52:49.660
Would You Rather.

52:49.660 --> 52:51.440
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

52:51.440 --> 52:52.440
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

52:52.440 --> 52:57.880
Man, we helped less people than normal, and that's saying a fuck lot.

52:57.880 --> 53:03.520
You know what, actually, real quick, let's just do one more because I feel so guilty.

53:03.520 --> 53:06.560
Last year, my wife and I moved upstate and bought some chickens, embracing that gay farm

53:06.560 --> 53:07.560
life.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.880
My family and hers have been watching and cheering on our chicken-raising journey all

53:10.880 --> 53:14.080
along, which has been great, but the other day, I got a text saying my cousin just got

53:14.080 --> 53:20.600
chickens too, and they're the really fancy kind, you know, with fluffy legs and heads.

53:20.600 --> 53:25.040
Now my family always brings up her chickens when I try to talk about mine.

53:25.040 --> 53:29.060
Brothers, how can I get my family to see that mine are the superior birds that's from high-class

53:29.060 --> 53:30.060
hens in the Hudson Valley?

53:30.060 --> 53:34.120
Man, I was about to make like a Pokemon joke, right, where it's like, you got to make them

53:34.120 --> 53:37.280
battle, and I realized, like, that's cockfighting, and then I was like, wait a minute, that's

53:37.280 --> 53:38.280
Pokemon.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.280
Wait a minute.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.280
Yeah.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.280
Oh, come on.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
Wait a minute.

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
Wait a minute.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
Uh-oh.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
Geodude, I'm sorry.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.280
Hold up, guys.

53:46.280 --> 53:47.280
Let me get on my...

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
I got to get on my game point.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.280
Geodude, I'm so sorry, dude.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.280
I didn't know.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.280
I got to let go a lot of...

53:51.280 --> 53:52.280
Well, I can't let go of my Geodude.

53:52.280 --> 53:53.280
He's my strongest one.

53:53.280 --> 53:54.280
Okay, Pidgey, you're free.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.280
Buy two dozen eggs from the store.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
Put two dozen eggs underneath your chicken.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
Send a video of your family.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
Anyway, I'm doing my regular stuff today.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.280
I'm going to get the eggs from the store.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.280
I'm going to get the eggs from the store.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.280
I'm going to get the eggs from the store.

54:01.280 --> 54:07.800
Anyway, I'm doing my regular stuff today.

54:07.800 --> 54:08.800
Going to get the eggs from the chickens.

54:08.800 --> 54:11.400
And then you هicle the chicken, there's a two dozen fucking eggs in position.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.480
But you don't feel free to just be like...

54:13.480 --> 54:14.680
Ah, the normal number.

54:14.680 --> 54:17.140
A regular hole today.

54:17.140 --> 54:19.640
Good average work, Joan the chicken.

54:19.640 --> 54:21.940
Could you shave the other chickens?

54:21.940 --> 54:26.200
Not pluck, that sounds terrible, but just like trim the feathers back on these fluffy

54:26.200 --> 54:27.200
birds?

54:27.200 --> 54:31.260
So they look a little dumb when a dog gets wet and all their hair goes to the fox and

54:31.260 --> 54:34.540
Are you talking about sabotage?

54:34.540 --> 54:35.380
Ooh.

54:35.380 --> 54:36.220
Are you talking about sabotage?

54:36.220 --> 54:38.580
A little bit of sabotage.

54:38.580 --> 54:40.860
Are you talking about indulging

54:40.860 --> 54:44.220
in the nefarious art of sabotage?

54:44.220 --> 54:45.540
Perhaps I am, Justin.

54:45.540 --> 54:46.380
What's going on?

54:46.380 --> 54:48.700
Well, that's just a pick-up line.

54:48.700 --> 54:53.700
Just a wee whiff of the old sabotage.

54:54.940 --> 54:57.740
A little under-the-table leisure mane

54:57.740 --> 55:00.060
that goes by the name of sabotage.

55:00.060 --> 55:03.860
Perhaps I am, if you are rapscallion enough.

55:03.860 --> 55:07.740
Some ill-intentioned leisure mane

55:07.740 --> 55:11.380
which I like to think of as a whole sabotage.

55:11.380 --> 55:12.660
Perhaps I am, Justin.

55:14.260 --> 55:15.820
Griffin! Yeah.

55:15.820 --> 55:17.340
Did you hear the news?

55:17.340 --> 55:18.660
Yeah, I did.

55:18.660 --> 55:23.660
Travis, your brother has suggested sabotage.

55:24.580 --> 55:26.940
Do you have any thoughts about this

55:26.940 --> 55:29.740
most intriguing development?

55:29.740 --> 55:32.020
I was just thinking it'd be pretty cool

55:32.020 --> 55:33.620
if former Reds third baseman-

55:33.620 --> 55:35.740
Yeah, go on, yes, continue, please.

55:35.740 --> 55:38.500
Wait, we're on Tinder hooks.

55:38.500 --> 55:41.780
I can't wait to hear how you employ sabotage.

55:41.780 --> 55:45.980
So far, we have two gentlemen chicken saboteurs.

55:45.980 --> 55:46.820
Yeah.

55:46.820 --> 55:49.460
How will our third brother

55:49.460 --> 55:52.820
figure into our machinations of sabotage?

55:52.820 --> 55:55.820
I was just wondering if it would be badass

55:55.820 --> 55:58.700
if former Cincinnati Reds third baseman,

55:58.700 --> 56:02.180
Chris Sabo, released a hip-hop album called Sabotage?

56:02.180 --> 56:05.500
That would be cool.

56:05.500 --> 56:08.380
I'm telling all of y'all it's Sabotage!

56:08.380 --> 56:10.340
Jung Jung! Jung Jung!

56:10.340 --> 56:12.820
Chris, do you have to do all the guitar sounds

56:12.820 --> 56:13.660
with your mouth?

56:13.660 --> 56:16.540
I don't know how to play the instruments.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.660
Do you need a ball thrown?

56:18.660 --> 56:21.420
I'm also writing another song called Saboname.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.700
It's the best I've got.

56:22.700 --> 56:25.660
Saboname? Saboname, Saboname.

56:25.660 --> 56:27.940
Hey, Chris, we're gonna have to let you go.

56:27.940 --> 56:29.460
I get it. Sorry, Chris.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.900
Yeah, no, it makes sense.

56:30.900 --> 56:32.700
I thought this was my thing after baseball,

56:32.700 --> 56:33.540
but it's not.

56:33.540 --> 56:34.380
You know, whatever.

56:34.380 --> 56:35.580
Do you think that's the first joke

56:35.580 --> 56:38.340
we've ever done on the show that Jesse Thorn liked?

56:38.340 --> 56:44.300
Blending, finally blending his passions

56:44.300 --> 56:45.660
for hip-hop and baseball.

56:45.660 --> 56:48.060
Hey, thanks so much for listening to our program.

56:48.060 --> 56:49.660
Now, this is the end.

56:49.660 --> 56:51.380
And we helped that person with the chicken,

56:51.380 --> 56:54.720
so now we've earned our rest.

56:54.720 --> 56:58.360
But we really appreciate you being here with us.

56:58.360 --> 57:02.840
It's always such a joy and a treat, which is a joy.

57:02.840 --> 57:03.840
Yeah, that is a joy.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.240
We've got some new merch over at McElroyMerch.com.

57:06.240 --> 57:08.000
Our pin of the month is Work of Fart.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
It is wonderful.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.400
And it benefits One Tree Planet,

57:10.400 --> 57:11.920
which is dedicated to making it easier

57:11.920 --> 57:13.320
for individuals and businesses

57:13.320 --> 57:14.880
to give back to the environment.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.240
They asked us to keep,

57:16.240 --> 57:17.760
when we told them what the pin was,

57:17.760 --> 57:20.960
they were like, huh, well, huh.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.520
We'll think on it. Thank you.

57:22.520 --> 57:23.600
Thank you, I guess.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.960
It helps create a healthier climate,

57:24.960 --> 57:26.000
protect biodiversity,

57:26.000 --> 57:29.800
and help reforestation efforts around the world.

57:29.800 --> 57:31.320
There's also some pixel art stickers

57:31.320 --> 57:34.160
of their brothers and everything else.

57:34.160 --> 57:37.200
And the My Life is Better with You

57:37.200 --> 57:39.000

57:42.040 --> 57:42.880
Yeah.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.920
And that will be at bit.ly slash Montaigne, M-B-M-B-A-M.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.720
And thanks to Montaigne, of course.

57:48.720 --> 57:49.560
Of course.

57:49.560 --> 57:50.380
For the use of all these things.

57:50.380 --> 57:51.880
Of course.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.600
Hey, y'all want the final Yahoo?

57:53.600 --> 57:54.440
Yes, please.

57:54.440 --> 57:55.260
Yeah. Absolutely.

57:55.260 --> 57:56.100
Awesome.

57:56.100 --> 57:57.880
This one was sent in by Randy.

57:57.880 --> 57:58.720
Ooh, what a gift.

57:58.720 --> 57:59.800
Quaid.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.200
Oh.

58:01.200 --> 58:03.160
Sorry, did you say Quaid or Quaid?

58:03.160 --> 58:05.000
Randy Quaid.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.560
That's what it says.

58:06.560 --> 58:07.600
A different person.

58:07.600 --> 58:11.920
This is from Randy Quaid at gmail.business.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.720
And it's-

58:15.720 --> 58:18.160
Dude, why did you talk so fast?

58:18.160 --> 58:19.000
Why did you do it?

58:19.000 --> 58:19.840
That's for sure.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.400
We don't usually do that.

58:21.400 --> 58:22.640
Fuck, I shouldn't have said that.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.480
And he lives in a-

58:24.480 --> 58:27.680
All right, it's also asked by Randy Quaid.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.200
Why does it say, why did he-

58:29.200 --> 58:30.840
He sent his own question?

58:30.840 --> 58:32.800
He sent his own question, man.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.200
That's embarrassing.

58:34.200 --> 58:39.200
Yeah, and it looks like Randy Quaid asks,

58:41.400 --> 58:45.280
looks like Randy Quaid asks, hold on, it's loading.

58:45.280 --> 58:50.120
Yeah, what time does Ponderosa Steakhouse close?

58:50.120 --> 58:50.960
Dang.

58:50.960 --> 58:55.000
My name is Justin-

58:55.000 --> 58:57.640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.560
This has been my brother and my brother,

58:58.560 --> 59:00.640
may you kiss your dad square on the lips.

59:00.640 --> 59:02.300
It's better with you.

59:06.300 --> 59:11.300
My life, it's better, it's better with you.

59:11.300 --> 59:16.300
It's better with you.

59:18.160 --> 59:23.160
It's better, it's better with you.

59:24.200 --> 59:29.200
