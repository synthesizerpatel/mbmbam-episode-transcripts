00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
It's a new phrase, and good girls do you want it?

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Just say, hey, I want it.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Just say, hey, I want it.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello everybody, and welcome to the island.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Justin Island boy.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
McElroy here.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Wait, hold on.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Let me just, I have prepared this for you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Let me get it finished stirring it up.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll get that mint out of there.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Perfect.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I've prepared you this mojito.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Please take it.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Take a sip.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Make sure the mint's not too pronounced.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Sometimes my muddling gets away from me.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm still Justin McElroy by the way.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Hi there, I am Travis hammock time.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
McElroy stop hammock time.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Take a little nap here.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
I've strung this hammock up over the cool white sand between these two palm trees.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
You can just slightly hear the crackle of a bonfire down the beach.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
We're getting some roast pork ready for you.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
But for right now, you just take a little nap here.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Hi, I'm Griffin, coconut bra, McElroy.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
And hey, where'd my plate with a nice fresh sandwich on it go?

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Well, it looks like a couple little hermit crabs got it and scuttling down the beach.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
That's okay, little dudes.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
You can keep that one.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Just listen to that fucking tide roll in.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So soft.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Welcome to our super chill, anxiety free oasis.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Welcome to my brother, my brother, me island.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
A place where you can get away from it all for an hour and just fucking chill.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
There's a lot going on in all of our lives right now.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
And I mean everybody.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Some people are having babies.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Some people are about to have babies.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
There's election stuff going on.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Hey, man.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Hey, excuse me.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm Gary.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
And it looks to me like you brought some anxiety into the anxiety free episode.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
So I'm gonna need you to put that in this basket.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We're just gonna push it on down the river.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
There's a river and a beach.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So put that right in here now.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Visualize it floating away.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Listen, I know you got some stress from freak out juice in there too.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I need you to just barf all that up right here in this basket and down the river.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
It goes.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And where do the baskets end up?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It's a mystery that will never solve.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It's like lost season five.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
A gator just ate my anxiety.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Does that make me feel better or worse?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Feel bad for the gator.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, defo.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
That's the anxiety.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
That's the anxiety gator.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
He's got the weight of a nation's woes upon his show.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
His scaly shoulders.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
He's a fucking hero.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah, champion.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And we're not going to dwell on him though.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Don't look at the anxiety gator.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It's not your problem anymore.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Welcome to this super chill episode of My Brother My Brother and Me.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It's going to be so relaxing.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm going to do a Jimmy Buffett tune later.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh, that'll be nice.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, I think that'll be really nice.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
That'll be up a little later in the show.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I want to know more about Gary.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I've got a kite museum.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
A museum all full of kites?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah, they're all my kites.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I bought them.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Well, that's great, Gary.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Nobody's going to try to take them from you soon.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I know they won't because that would give me anxiety.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And that's against the law here.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Is it just a room full of store-bought kites, Gary?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, I did some decor on some of them.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Cut little holes in fun shapes.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Now they don't fly so much anymore, but that's okay.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
These aren't flying kites.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
These are display kites.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
You don't have any fighter kites like Doug Plenty's dad made?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
You're right.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't have...

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
See?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Damn it, Justin.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I don't have those.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Damn it, Justin.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I'll get you one later so don't even worry about it.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh, nice.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
That was close.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
We'll get to our music a little later.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
We got a lot of fun, easygoing questions for you.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
It's just going to be a real chill episode here at the island.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So kick back, relax.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm going to routinely just smell my baby's head.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Just smell that baby's head.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Take me away.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Take me away.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
So here's our first question.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
I go to college and my school has a shuttle system to help us get around the campus.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
It's not real efficient, but it beats walking around late at night.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Tonight was really busy with lots of people getting on and off and I made the mistake of sitting in the very back.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
The shuttle driver forgot about me and general social nervousness has stopped me from speaking up.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Now the shuttle driver parked and went into a Popeye's.

05:00.000 --> 05:08.000
I presume to pick up his dinner and he has left me sitting in the Popeye's parking lot.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
I am locked in and oh my God, I have no idea what to do.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Do I politely cough when he comes back?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Do I wait until other people come on and then leave with them?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Please help me.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
This has gone on for far too long and I'm terrified I'll become the shuttle ghost.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
Please help my God help meek and marooned in Maryland.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And there's a postscript.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
P.S. this is not the first time this has happened, but last time it was just with the McDonald's drive through.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
This may be the most lose lose scenario.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Like lose lose lose lose lose lose scenario I've ever.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
I don't know if it's that I'm just a little bit like sleep deprived.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't know what to tell you.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, first of all, the good news is you're at Popeye's.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
So you can go in there and you can get some of that good chicken.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Also another sort of follow up question here is your bus driver Elliot Kalin?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Cause if so, just like hang out with him.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Ask him the good things to get. He's got the good records.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh I have an idea. I have an idea.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Move up to the front seat of the shuttle and be waiting patiently.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
And when he comes back just say, did you grab those biscuits for me?

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
And now it's on him. Now he's forgotten a whole interaction he had.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Can you imagine Travis? You are this shuttle bus driver.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
The end of a long shift dropping off ungrateful college users.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And then finally dropped them all off.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Time to lock this baby up and go in for my favorite part of my whole week.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
My Popeye's chicken meal.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
My doctor says I can only have one Popeye's chicken meal per month or else I'll instantly die.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So I'm really going to savor it.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
So you get it and you have it and you savor it.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And then you go and you open up the bus that you think is empty.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
And some smart aleck is just like, hey where's my...

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
You would have a lot to feed the anxiety gator after that particular run.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
What do you do? Do you cough in the back and he turns around and just throws his Popeye's at you?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm coming up with solutions and none of them...

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
The problem I keep coming up against is this.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
If you alert him to your presence, he's going to feel obligated to drive you somewhere.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And his food is going to get cold.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And that's no good.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
And he's going to resist that.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm worried about you indirectly murdering this man.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
That the shuttle driver is going to come back and you're going to go ahem.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
He's just going to die.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, he'll die.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
That's my main point of concern right now is how do you not kill this hardworking Popeye's man.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Here's an option.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
When he returns to the van or it's a shuttle.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
When he returns to the shuttle, just stand up very slowly in the back and start slow clapping.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
And then when he's like, excuse me, you say congratulations.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And he'll be like, what?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
And you'll say, well, I am a secret writer.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I am paid by the shuttle company.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
I've been evaluating your performance all day and you have done one hell of a job in all my years.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I've not seen better service in a shuttle driver.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So congratulations.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm going to be telling HQ if you could just drop me off at HQ, which looks like a dorm, very much like a dorm at your leisure.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Feel free to enjoy your chicken.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You've earned it.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
But if you could just do that for me, I'm so proud of you and you've done such a wonderful job.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I can't.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
I've decided that this person might like shuttle ghost is the appropriate thing because you live in that shuttle now.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But you do other people.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yes.

09:04.000 --> 09:14.000
Other people, though, if you find yourself in this scenario, I would say that this is one of the few scenarios I can think of that out like outreaches anxiety and social anxiety.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
You have to say something before it gets to this point.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
Like you have like if you're the last one on the bus, you could just say, like, drop me off anywhere.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Don't wait until you're already parked and locked in the shuttle at the Baba's.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It might be too late.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I yeah, maybe too late for you.

09:31.000 --> 09:40.000
I take Umbridge with the post script of this bus driver driving their bus through a McDonald's drive through.

09:40.000 --> 09:50.000
Because if I was working a drive through and I saw a fucking bus pull up to the to the, you know, the burger zone, I would just throw myself in the deep fryer.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
There is no way I want to handle an order that convoluted for everybody on the bus.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Do you think it was the same shuttle driver both times?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
But if you're like a ham, they're like, damn it again.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
God, they've still been on the shuttle. They haven't figured out a way to get get off yet.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Can I read you a food related who?

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, is that like a who? Yeah, because it's got an exclamation point.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
We don't always we don't always enunciate that.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So I'm thinking we just sort of backload.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
We make the word bottom heavy a little bit more and just pick Yahoo.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
It's in its fucking death throes. And I just wanted I want to party with Yahoo before it's gone.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
Mm hmm. This one was sent in by Pete Carl to maybe the second.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
But like he specifically mentions in the email that he wants to be called PK to which is a very good name.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And also very kind of drug.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Thank you, BK to it's by Yahoo answers user.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, it loaded for a second.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Sarah Sarah asks, How old do you have to be to eat out at a restaurant?

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
My friends and I, six of us in total are planning to go out to the mall.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
There are restaurants in the mall and we're wondering if we're allowed to go out to eat at legit places.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
For example, Lazy Dog Cafe Bistro.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
I hope there's not an actual place on Earth called Cafe Bistro.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
That's crazy. We're all we're all 13 years old.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
If we can't go to restaurants like stated above, does anyone know what sort of places we could possibly go to?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Now, I know you're hearing this and you think, Griffin, this is a stupid question.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
This is a stupid question for dumb people.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
But there's a right answer to it in there.

11:38.000 --> 11:47.000
Because if you're a host or a hostess at an outback steakhouse and a fleet of six year olds walks in.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
How's that going to how's that going to shape up?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
How's that particular encounter going to break down?

11:51.000 --> 12:00.000
I feel like it's interesting to me because had they said it's me and one friend, I would have said 13 is too young.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But for some reason, six 13.

12:02.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm wondering if there's some kind of like conglomerate age rule of thumb that if your combined age is older than 75 but younger than 200, that group of people is allowed to go to that thing.

12:15.000 --> 12:27.000
It has never been my experience that the more tweens in a flock, the better socially it is for everybody else around.

12:27.000 --> 12:35.000
I guess as a patron of the restaurant, if I looked over and saw two 13 year olds having a meal together, it would be weird.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
But if I see six of them, I'm like, oh, they're celebrating something.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Maybe if you see two 13 year olds eating together, they're filming a scene for Boy Meets World at the end.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
Or they just got out of their first date at Prince of Egypt and they were just wowed by a beautiful historic tale with music by the Osmonds.

12:53.000 --> 13:02.000
And they just wanted to get, you know, a blooming onion and then maybe go home and see what happens.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Prince of Egypt has inspired me, honey.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Let's go home and see what happens.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
So it's six 13 year olds looking for a place to eat?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Let's abstract it.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
You're the host of the Olive Garden.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Justin, I know this is a fucking dream for you.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Finally, I rose up.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Rose up the ranks.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You are a host of Olive Garden.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
And let's stick with two because I like the idea of it being two of them.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
We have important things to discuss.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm just going to say a number and we'll walk it up, okay?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Two five year olds walk in and they're like, spaghetti please.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Spaghetti pizza.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
That makes my night.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I'm going to be on the nightly news, I think.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
In the local news, like, you'll never believe it.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
These two five year olds had a spaghetti date.

13:48.000 --> 13:59.000
I can definitely say, like Disney has taught me, that the gap between two dogs coming in for spaghetti and five year olds, I definitely don't allow between that, though.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
You're either two dogs or five years old.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's obviously adorable, right?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
This is a fucking business.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
This is a place of business.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And they're unaccompanied?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
They are unaccompanied.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
These are just two five year olds.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Pa-scappy peas.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
Do you want spaghetti and peas or are you just like, do you have money?

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Like, you guys are not as concerned about these two five year olds as I am.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
How did you get here?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
How are you getting home?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Griffin, I just don't know how I would look them in their tiny eyeballs and turn them on.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
No.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Go away.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Go away hungry five year olds.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Here's a handful of Andy's mints.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Never come back to the Olive Garden.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Okay, then let's walk it up.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Ten year olds.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Two ten year olds.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
No.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
No.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Hard no from Travis.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Hard no.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
You're turning them away?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Not without parents.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
What if they just got off work?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They just want to relax.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
That's a good point.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't know.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
They can't go see a James Bond movie by themselves.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't know if they could eat by themselves.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
You will need to cut their-

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm definitely going to need to see the green.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
You're going to need to flash that wad before I let them in.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
But that's discrimination now.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
That's going to be hard.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay, I'm rethinking the five year olds.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Okay, thank you, C.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
What if they're like, I'll have the Thai peanut noodles, please.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
And you say, do you have a peanut allergy?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And they say, I have absolutely no idea.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Let's find out together.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I'm a real bad ass five year old with a leather jacket, by the way.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Do you know the number that makes the big ambulances come?

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
Just in case I do have an adverse reaction to the peanuts.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
Do you know the big, they're big loud scary cars

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
and they put sick people into them to go to the Hopsiddle.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Is that right?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Am I saying that correctly?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
I've written down here just a list of all of my food allergies

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
just to make sure there's no confusion.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
This is just like a squiggle, yes.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Yes, that's exactly right.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't see the issue here.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Do you take American Express?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Oh, and I had an oopsie, if you could send someone out.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I did have a Duke.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
And also, this is very important, I did see a fire truck today.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
So excellent.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Thank you very much.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I'll await my dish.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I will need you to cut it up for me.

16:30.000 --> 16:39.000
What if two 150 year olds just sort of slug slop their way,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
their skin masks in through the door,

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
leaving a trail of just spume behind them.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Two fit nurses bring them in in wheelbarrows,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
just dump them onto the chair.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
Just sort of filling the wheelbarrows with their self crud,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
and they say,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Be secretly pleased.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
Travis, this one's for you.

17:07.000 --> 17:14.000
Would you sit these two 150 year old wheelbarrow people?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I would, Griffin, but not together.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I would find them like a table with an empty seat,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
two tables, I guess, with an empty seat each.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
And I would just kind of force a Tuesdays with Maury kind of scenario.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh, for a five year old to one 150 year old.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
I liked the scene in Tuesdays with Maury,

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
where the small boy had to dump the spaghetti onto the 150 year old Maury man,

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
and then he just sort of, he sort of sat there and he, Mitch described,

17:45.000 --> 17:57.000
in graphic detail, how the spaghetti sort of just sort of formed into his 150 year old sloppy body.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
It just kind of was engulfed by his skin bag,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
and it just kind of was Maury at that point.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Excuse me, waiter.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
When you bring the spaghetti, could you bring a lot of it in a small pool?

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Yes, I believe it's the Patch Adams.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
I hate to go off menu, but it's my life dream to sweat.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Could you serve that?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
A swimming pool full of noodles?

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And the five year old leans over and says, I'll have what he's having.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah, that's good.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You guys hear that?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
I didn't.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
I actually didn't.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, because my Skype is breaking up pretty bad right now.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I just hear like three seconds of silence.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah, it's weird.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh, that's so strange.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I want a much!

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Squad!

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
I want too much!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Squad!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Squad!

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
This is the anxiety free fucking island party zone, Travis.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Let's go all in.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I can't yell, it would wake my baby up.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
That's causing me anxiety.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Squad!

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
There it is.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
I said it with a smile.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Is that better?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
A little bit.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
You can tell that you want to hear the difference?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Squad!

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Squad!

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Justin, what violent delights do you have for us this week?

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
Well, who's, first I should say, who's hungry?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
I actually kind of am right now, but I bet that's not going to last.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
That's not going to impact this.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Is it going to be a fucking kids pool full of spaghetti that a 150 year old man can just

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
kind of like slop around in?

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
No, but slop's the right word because we're headed over to Carl Junior's or Hardee's

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
depending on where you are.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And we're just going to keep on driving.

19:47.000 --> 19:55.000
We're going to pull in and we are going to order the Budweiser beer cheese bacon burger.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
No.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
No.

19:58.000 --> 20:09.000
Do you know, do you know how when you have Budweiser and cheese, you think, good.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
But when I washed one down with the other, I really liked that combo.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Well, good news.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Hardee's is there for you.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
It's like this is the equivalent of like it's a fresh new salad, but we washed it with toilet

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
water.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
Do you know how they're known for pioneering in the quick service restaurant industry by

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
regularly releasing creatively charged industry first premium burger offerings?

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
Well, according to this press release, they have done it again with the Budweiser beer

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
cheese bacon burger.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Now, this is served on a brioche style premium bun.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Brioche style bun, not brioche, but there's something in that style.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
As inspired by the artist formerly known as brioche.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
It's so far from brioche, we can't legally call it brioche.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
We'd really have the bread boys breathing down our neck if we tried to pull that shit

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
again.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
But do not sweat it.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It is premium as fuck.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
This is a primo fake brioche.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.000
This is the same like fast food restaurant that like put potato chips and a hot dog on

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
a hamburger, right?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
They'll put fucking anything on a hamburger.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Yeah, they're crazy.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
At Hardee's.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
But listen, this is a new burger with, and this is piled high with thick cut applewood

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
smoked bacon.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
Nobody knows still what applewood is and what that does to the flavor of the bacon, but

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
it is applewood and it's got Swiss cheese on it, but the cheese don't stop there.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
It's topped with Budweiser beer cheese.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
Why did they double cheese this one?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Can I ask who the chef was on this project?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Who ate this without cheese and was like, not cheesy enough.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
But it's a hot and creamy cheddar cheese sauce blended with the classic taste of America's

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
number one full flavored lager.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
So when you drink Budweiser and think that getting drunk is fine, but I'm really here

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
for the flavor.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I wish it was in a non-alcoholic cheese.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
They've got you covered.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
Are you sure that the cheese, first of all, I'm still obsessed with this layer of Swiss

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
and its purpose.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I think it might be load bearing.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I think it may be a low-carb layer of Swiss.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
It sounds like they had another burger laying around and they're like, okay, we'll just

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
serve this.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
No, we've already served them.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
Are you sure, Justin, it's non-alcoholic cheese?

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
Positive it is non-alcoholic cheese.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
That would really turn this whole thing around for me.

22:42.000 --> 22:52.000
There is one situation in which Budweiser is your choice and it is when you are at some

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
sort of tailgating party and that's it and you don't want to be there and you want to

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
just sort of have like a cool friend in your hand.

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
I actually think that's the Budweiser slogan, your choice of beer when you didn't get to

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
choose the beer that would be there.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
It is football happening and you didn't really get a say in it, have your cool friend in

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
your hand.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
But by the way, this version of it, there's no alcohol.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
So what are you fucking doing?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
And it's cheese.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I got Brad Haley on the line.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
And it's cheese.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
You can't even drink it.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
And also it's cheese this time.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I got Brad Haley on the line.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
He's the chief marketing officer.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
What's he sound like, I wonder?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Carl.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
Our new Budweiser beer cheese bacon burger combines the best of what we do with Budweiser

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
beer cheese sauce.

23:39.000 --> 23:47.000
Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions on the char-broiled grass fed all natural

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
beef patty.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
It really is a beer and burger lovers dream come true.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Hey, beer and burger lovers, dream bigger here.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Hey, hey guys, can you dream bigger for me?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Can you do that for me?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Burger and beer lovers.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
You're dreaming of Budweiser and fast food cheese on your burgers and beer?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Here's what I want.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Here's a dream I have.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
This will be a fun, crazy, weird, like a hamburger stout.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
That's crazy.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
That's a dream.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
A burger that it sounds like maybe someone actually spilled some beer on and then it

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
sat long enough for it to no longer be alcoholic.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
It's maybe not the dream I have.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
I don't know of any beer lover that's like, you know what, my dream, like if I could just

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
have Budweiser but not, not alcoholic and in cheese form.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Now.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
That's my dream.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Now.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Is there more quotes?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Are there more tasty quotes?

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
Because I have an idea.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
It is being promoted with a documentary style new ad campaign.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
No, fuck that.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
See, this is my idea.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Fuck that ad campaign.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Okay.

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
I think instead of doing the patented Carl's commercial, that's basically just like a,

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
you know, a woman on a car and the burger is getting just all over.

25:09.000 --> 25:18.000
Same vein, but control F find Jessica Simpson, control R replace with one of the Budweiser

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
horses, one of those Clydesdales and this Clydesdale is up on a Ferrari and he is just

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
smashing this fucking thing to pieces cause he weighs two tons and he is not supposed

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
to be up there.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
But also he is just, he is just ruined with this beer cheese just all over him.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
And he's enjoying, I think he would enjoy the burger, but there is no way like he is

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
just slopping and he just like smashed a hoof through the windshield and is freaking the

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
fuck out.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Yeah.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
And then the last second of the commercial they cut to the Budweiser frogs and they're

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
like, now we're horny.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That makes some sense.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
And then they fuck right there.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
And they have a baby and then they lay eggs and then out of the eggs emerges the Carl

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Jr. slash Hardee's Budweiser beer cheese bacon burger.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Loving it.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
And then the three frogs are on the car and they're eating the burger, but the hot cheese

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
falls on them and burns them to death.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
And they say, what a decadent, decadent way to die.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
They take turns saying the words in it.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
I should have mentioned that Josh Halpern, who's the vice president of small format

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
and on premise for Anheuser-Busch was complimenting the Carl Jr. and Hardee's partnership.

26:30.000 --> 26:36.000
And he says, Carl Jr. and Hardee's are known for pushing boundaries and they truly share

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Anheuser-Busch's commitment to quality ingredients and authenticity.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Could we leave some boundary?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
Did we, when we started pushing boundaries, did anybody stop for a second to think what's

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
on the fucking outside of those boundaries?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And maybe we put those boundaries up for good reason.

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
I have put some weird shit on a sandwich and no one's ever been like, no one's ever

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
said that Travis, he sure does push boundaries.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
They've just said that Travis, he sure has made some sandwich monstrosities in his time.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
He's a human wreck.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
I mean, not anymore.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Now I'm someone's father.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yeah.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Can we do a quick question?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
I think we've got time for one more quick question from the Money Zone, yeah?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Yes, please.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
I own several calf high socks as a result of various circumstances.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
However, as a big boy, my calf high socks quickly become very uncomfortable ankle socks.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
I get to the bottom of my sock drawer and I start wondering if garters can be everyday

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
wear.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
How do I ensure maximum ankle comfort?

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
And that's from trying not to have a cow over my calves in Montana.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
I'm curious what everybody's sock choices are because I have evolved several times in

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
my life and I'm curious where you're all at.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
And now you were into those tall, tall gold toe shits for a while.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Used to be into that.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
Then I got into like the sneaky ones that are real small and peep just above the shoes.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Shh, shh, shh.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Hello.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Don't tell.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Don't you tell.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Tell you what I love.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Black ankle socks.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
They're like black.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
They're like your traditional white sock, only black.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
They go with nothing.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
But they also don't ever get dingy and gross looking.

28:15.000 --> 28:24.000
I fucking got a subscription to foot cardigan, not a sponsor of the show, just a proud member

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
of their community.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Every month I get a fun new sock pattern.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
I'm like rip Taylor down there now every day.

28:31.000 --> 28:38.000
But when it's time for something a little bit more serious, I have a 16 pack, a very

28:38.000 --> 28:47.000
short, very sexy Puma socks that Rachel got me at Costco and I'll wear those and they

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
breathe.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
And then if I have to like leave the office and go to the basketball court, it's just

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
an all day thing.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
It's an all day wear.

28:56.000 --> 29:04.000
I bought a bunch of dark socks right before we filmed our show because Maximum Thorn, Maximum

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Fun founder.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
I am Maximum Thorn.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Maximum Thorn.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
Maximum Fun founder and style guru, Jesse Thorn, told me, quote, I don't want to be

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
on TV wearing white socks.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
So I bought a bunch of dark socks because that had not even injured my, I had no idea,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I guess, the white socks.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
And I'll tell you the fun thing about starting to wear dark socks more is like they probably

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
look the best when you're wearing that outfit.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
They're the least durable, I think, style wise.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
You took one article of clothing away and you are a disaster.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
This is true.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
You switch to shorts because it gets a little hot.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Oops, you're a mess.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
You're a total wreck.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
I really, I have a few pairs of the fancier patterned socks like Griffin described and

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I love them.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
I love them so very much.

29:49.000 --> 29:57.000
But my chosen footwear is cowboy boots and it feels weird to have that kind of flashiness

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
and no one can see it.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
It just feels like the most narcissistic sock choice to put on a flashy, like I have a pair

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
I got from Loot Crate, not a sponsor of the show, just a big fan, that are Sonic the Hedgehog

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
themed with rings all the way up.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, well, don't wear those.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
And when I wear those.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
No, don't wear those.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Don't wear those.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
But that's just a secret for me.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
But that's just a secret for me.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
But now everybody knows, Travis, I'm going to assume you're always wearing them.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
In my mind, when I picture you holding my beautiful new niece, you're wearing those

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
fucking socks and I can't take you seriously.

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
I'm someone's father and I accidentally wore a pair of Deadpool socks to the NICU because

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
it was what I grabbed out in the dark out of the drawer.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Now no one could see them because I was wearing long pants, but I knew, I knew I was someone's

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
father holding, wearing, holding a baby, wearing some Deadpool socks.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
Maybe also I wore the Sonic socks on a different day, but that was on purpose so I could have

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
my own little Sonic secret just for me.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
Did somebody else at the hospital look over and like look at your feet and look at you

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
holding a small human life and then you looked at them and smiled and just said, gotta go

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
fast, chili dogs.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
And then I slammed with my free hand, because one hand had the baby, I just slammed the

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
chili dog in one, like one mouthful with my left hand.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
And then Dr. Robotnik came in and turned all the babies into bad robots.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
And then you had to fight them all off.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Man I love that little blue bastard.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I wish it was real.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Gotta go fast.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
God I hope that's what heaven is like.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Going fast.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Let's go to the money zone.

31:29.000 --> 31:43.000
We talked a lot about socks here today and those are fine, but they don't touch your

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
dick.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Unless you're the red hot chili peppers I guess.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
But I want to tell you about me undies.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
It doesn't just touch your dick, it touches your genitalia you got down there.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Whatever you're working with, me undies will cover it and keep that your secret.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
Imagine a world where putting on a new pair of underwear isn't just fresh, you're stepping

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
into a better day.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
It's the first thing you put on, the last thing you take off unless you're nasty.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the planet?

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
I do want to say, sometimes I wear me undies as socks but that's just because I have a

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
very random personality and a very random like South Park humor.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
I do it but only because I have a very polished floor and I like to really slide around on

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
it.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah, it's fun.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
That modal really, really go.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
It's a real slickery fabric.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Yeah.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
It's a special fabric made with the best in class raw materials that are scientifically

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
proven to be three times softer than cotton.

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Do you guys feel like, we don't do a lot of evening recordings, do you guys feel like

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm a really good voice tonight?

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
I feel really, I'm articulating things really well.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
I feel really good about the instrument.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
It's funny you say that.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
I feel like my throat is full of Anheuser-Busch beer cheese.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Yeah.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
I actually-

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
I just feel like mine's rough and raw.

33:14.000 --> 33:22.000
I coated mine in that good wet cheese because I went to Carl's Jr. and I said, hold the

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
burger please, just a small cup.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Just take one of those free water cups, fill it in with-

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
And cheese me.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
You know that golden stuff I crave.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
When Carl wants to please me, he's only got to cheese me.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
Yeah, they will actually put it on fries for you but they crumble bacon on top of it because

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
why not?

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Health is why not.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Health.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Oh yeah.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Living.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
That's-

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Living life with health in it.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
Not even a lot of health but a normal amount of health is why you wouldn't, I think.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Oh, and self-respect is the only other reason.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
That's the only other thing.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
There's just health and self-respect is why not to do it.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
As a new dad, I would like to tell you guys about the most important thing in the world.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Sleep.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
I was trying to come up with a joke there but you see, I'm so sleep deprived, I couldn't

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
think of anything funny to say right now and I'm going to keep this anxiety free.

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
Sometimes I'm sleeping two hours at a time and then feeding for an hour, feeding the

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
baby for an hour.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Damn, that's a hungry, thirsty baby.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
Yeah, well there's a lot of diaper changing in there too and unwrapping and rewrapping

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
of various onesies and swaddlers and stuff and then we sleep for two hours and I tell

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
you what, if we weren't doing it on a Casper mattress, I don't know that we would get

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
to really just savor those two hours like we are now.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
You know, but it's easy to lay right back down, fall right back asleep thanks to our

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Casper mattress.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
Casper is a sponsor of the show this week as well as we're still working on that episode.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
It kind of got thrown for a loop a little bit because-

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
On our Halloween special.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, well we weren't anticipating a surprise baby and it kind of threw off the schedule

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
a little bit.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
But Casper is an online retailer of premium, obsessively engineered mattresses and the

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
best thing is they're a fraction of the price of what you would pay at a big box mattress

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
store because they keep their overhead down and it's all done online and when you open

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
it up, it's real fun.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
They ship it to you in a box that looks way too small for a mattress to be in.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You open it up, it kind of fooms out.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
It impresses everybody.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
It's really cool.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Everybody that you've invited to your mattress unboxing, which should be all your closest

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
friends really, but they have a risk-free trial and return policy so you can try sleeping

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery to the US and Canada and painless returns

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
and the mattresses are made in America, which is always great if you love America like I

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
do.

35:48.000 --> 35:54.000
Pricing is about $500 for a twin size mattress and $950 for a king size mattress, which is

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
just a great deal for anyone who can tell you who's ever shopped for mattresses before

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
and my brother, my brother and me listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
by going to Casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code mybrother, all one word

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
at checkout.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Terms and conditions apply.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
We got some junk.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
What's wrong?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Nothing.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I read the first personal message.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Oh no.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
We're going to get there.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
I do want to say we have not had any openings for Jumbotrons lately.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
It's because we just got all full up, but Maximum Fun is going to open up some slots

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
in 2017.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
So if you do want to get a message on the show, those slots are going to open up on

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Monday, November 28th.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
That's Cyber Monday at noon Pacific.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
So the spots are again going to be in 2017.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
It's weird even like having to like say this.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
It's so humbling and great that folks are just like so excited to get messages on the

36:52.000 --> 36:58.000
show that they are, they have filled us right the hell up for like a whole year.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
But if you want to get a message on the show in 2017, again, those spots are going to open

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
up Cyber Monday, Monday, November 28th at 12 noon Pacific.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Justin, you want to read this message since you were goofing on it?

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Yeah, I just got a kick out of, and this is, this is adjacent to what you're just discussing.

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
This is a message for Kate and it's from Leslie and it says it was between this or another

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
haunted doll this year.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Happy birthday, Kate.

37:21.000 --> 37:28.000
That's, it's like a D with 15 O's after it.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
And it just says, she'll know.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
So hopefully Kate appreciated that.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Maybe that's her ASMR.

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
The reason I laughed is because the preferred timeframe for this message to air is it says

37:38.000 --> 37:45.000
next recording April 8th is, was her birthday, but I totally get if you can't make that date

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
happen.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, that is putting it mildly.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
Y'all, we used to joke about like we're closer to the next birthday than we are like a month

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
closer to the next birthday than we are the last one.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
So maybe since we're selling all the Jumbotrons for 2017, like all at once, maybe they can

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
like be shuffled in such a way where that would be closer.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Yeah, I don't know.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
That sounds like a nightmare to try to do.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
We should force Stacey to do that, but I have it when you, when you buy a Jumbotron, date

38:16.000 --> 38:22.000
it for two that like say happy birthday in 2018 and then they'll all be hopefully early.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I have another message here.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
This one is for smart, sexy, science lady.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
And it's from your bearded bus driver, Bo, maybe boy or maybe just Bo.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't know.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
They say to smart, sexy, science lady.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Hey, I want to just say how much I love you lady.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
I may not have the weekends off anymore, but we will try to find time to do things together.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Like listening to all of the McElroy Brothers content.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Thank you for making my life easier and more enjoyable.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
Hopefully I do the same for you.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Now this does sound like they know each other.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I'm going to bring you home some good, good Popeyes later.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
By the way, there's a ghost in my bus again and I'm going to need you to call the priest.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
This does sound like they know each other and this is definitely like a relationship

39:08.000 --> 39:13.000
message, but there's also a world in which this is a bus driver who has seen like a sexy

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
science lady come on his bus and usually has the weekends off so he works Mondays,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
but now they've changed his schedule so he doesn't have weekends off anymore.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
And this is like his missed connections, like this is his ad.

39:24.000 --> 39:31.000
A woman that, that this person is attracted to walks onto the bus with two Erlenmeyer

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
flasks full of fluid and it's like blue and like green science fluid.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
And so he just knows what her field is.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
And she looks at them a lot and goes, hmm, and then mixes them.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
And there's a little like poof cloud that comes out of the top and she quickly jots

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
down her observations.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
That's fun.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
Every week we release a medical history podcast called Sawbones.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
We go over the history of the dumbest, grossest, weirdest stuff humans have been doing to each

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
other since the dawn of mankind.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
But it's a funny show.

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
But it's also so disgusting and stomach turning you won't believe it.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
But it's also like funny.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
It's funny.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
It is the wildest, grossest, nastiest stuff you can imagine.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
It's a real hoot.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
It's called Sawbones and we release it every week on iTunes, wherever podcasts are sold

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
and right here on MaximumFun.org.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Yeah, when are we going to do this musical number?

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
I'm wondering when will be the best time to just sort of deploy that.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I got a great Jimmy Buffett tune lined up.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I think maybe the end of the show or maybe.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
Okay.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
All right.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
That sounds good.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
What if we forget though?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Probably won't.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Probably won't.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
What if we do though?

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
So this one was sent in by Brandon Giles.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Brandon Giles.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Oh, hey.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Friend of the show, the fam.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Brandon Giles.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Thank you, Brandon.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

41:00.000 --> 41:07.000
They're anonymous and for good reason because their fucking question is, which is the baby,

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
the egg or the sperm?

41:11.000 --> 41:24.000
Guys, how is this not like a chicken or the egg, cake or pie, diaper or bucket situation?

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
I think it's obvious.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
The sperm is the baby and the egg is the house.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
This is a good theory.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
Travis, can you talk for maybe like 10 whole minutes about the science behind what you

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
just said?

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Well, Griffin, let me explain.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
I'm pretty sure the egg stays in one place once it settles into the uterine lining and

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
it's the sperm that's active and mobile and finds the egg.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Yeah.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
So it seems like the sperm is active before the egg is.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
So it seems like it starts there.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Yeah.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
If you're going by motility or mobility, I can't remember which one's which.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
Do you just want to also point out that you just had a baby a couple of weeks ago and

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
I'm expecting-

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
The doctor explained all this to me.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
In less than a month.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Yeah.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
I guess I just sort of wasn't paying attention about the whole birds and the bees process.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
I just know it's a lot of fun for me, right?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Right, fellas?

42:16.000 --> 42:24.000
It actually wasn't until I held the baby for the first time.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
But the doctor kind of leaned her head around the corner and went, by the way, it started

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
with sperm.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
And she just kind of ran away.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Yeah.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
It was very confusing.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
This was sperm first and it lived in an egg house.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Bye.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
And the doctor's coat she was wearing, she was actually wrapped herself in toilet paper

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
in a reasonable simulacra of a doctor's coat.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
It was weird.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
It was weird.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
And I had never seen her before and I was at a 7-Eleven.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Uh-huh.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I have another theory.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
And I'm sorry, Dr. Travis.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
No, please.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
It's the inverse theory.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
And again, theory, because all of this is unprovable.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
I think the egg might be the baby, but it's not active yet.

43:05.000 --> 43:13.000
And then my sperm is like a magic spell that just brings that egg to life.

43:13.000 --> 43:22.000
So you're saying that the egg is an android and the sperm is like the wish that Haley

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Joel Osborn makes on a star in AI, basically.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
That's one good way of thinking about it.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Topical.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
I mean, crack open an ordinary chicken's egg to make a French toast or some sort of

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
late night egg meal.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
And what's in there is just like a chicken that didn't quite get the start it needed

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
from the magic spell cast by his daddy, Nut.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
That's really good.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
Well, until you said that last part about Rooster Nut, but other than that, that was

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
actually a really well-posited theory.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Think about it.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
So I guess another way you could think about it is the egg is kind of like our body.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
And that nut is sort of like the soul.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
Our bodies are just these fleshy exosuits.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And this is the theory, guys.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
This is it.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
This sperm just kind of climbs inside the egg.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
And the sperm is like the alive thing.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
But then the egg grows and grows and grows and becomes like the body, the baby body.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
But that sperm is in there sort of controlling it from within like the little funny alien

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
from Men in Black.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Okay.

44:30.000 --> 44:45.000
So you're saying basically that the egg is sort of the Jaeger and the sperm is the Charlie

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Hunnam.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
But you're saying basically that's right, right?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
That's basically it?

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
I mean, any way you want to shake it.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Any other sort of mech-based thing you want to reference.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yes.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I'm out.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm out.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Okay.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
No, we think there's Voltron and then the five.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
I was going to make a Duran Lagan poll, but I think there are listeners of this show

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
who would know that stuff better than myself.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
You guys have to agree with me, right?

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
Because every other sort of thing you could think of is complete garbage.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
And really, well, I may have just sort of unlocked life if you think about it.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Mm-hmm.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Mm.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Well, I'm trying to remember how Look Who's Talking starts.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Yeah, what's the first shot?

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
And I'm pretty sure the egg lands and you can hear the egg think like, I'm just a body

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
waiting for a little soul.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
And then a sperm shows up.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.000
And I think he's got a fun accent, but I won't do it because I can't do accents.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
And he says something like-

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Hello, hello, hello there.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Pull this in.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm a nut.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
I'm a little bit of soul, aren't I?

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
And then he just like swims in.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And then I think it's Bruce Willis.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I think it turns into Bruce Willis.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
And I think the whole movie, like, I think Kirstie Alley keeps looking at the baby and

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
going, all this because some sperm animated my egg.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Yeah, Justin-

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
And she says that line a lot.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, a few times.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
It feels like Travis and I might be doing most of the scientific heavy lifting on this question.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Just wanted to get your-

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Yeah, it's weird.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Just wanted to get your beak wet.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Yeah.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
No, I feel like you guys have really covered the scientific end of this.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I can't help but take a more religious approach.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
So I'm kind of abstaining because I don't want to step on any toes.

46:26.000 --> 46:32.000
I mean, abstaining would be a more sort of religious approach to the process.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
But I'm-

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I think I'm just-

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
I'm looking at my body now.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I'm talking, right?

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
I'm moving my hands.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
I'm gesticulating.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
I'm gesticulating.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
All this is just coming from some coming.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
That's inside me and it's just like, it's fucking pulling the tendons and the strings

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
and it's like making me think the things I think.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Wait.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Hold on, Griffin.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
Are you pitching like a meet Dave scenario in which the sperms are controlling your body?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Travis, Travis.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Do not get it twisted.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
That is explicitly what I'm saying everybody is.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Everybody's just a sperm suit?

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
I mean, that's a gross way of thinking about the beautiful miracle that is life and existence,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
but yeah, Trav.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Here's a question-

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
You want to move on from this, huh?

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
You don't want to spend another 13 minutes sort of unpacking it?

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
I have one I want to read really quick just to give a quick thumbs up or down, a quick

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
am I good clearance.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I pranked a guy in college.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
I replaced his protein powder with Nesquik and he said I was dead to him.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I found out we're in the same wedding party.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
If I don't go to the wedding, am I good?

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
That's from Pranks Men in Charleston.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
I know you wanted to get through this quick.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
We have to acknowledge the fact that this is a pretty bonkers prank to pull, right?

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
It's one of those pranks where it's like, so what?

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
You changed the beverage to a tastier beverage and also there's fucking literally no way

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
that this person would have known that they were not drinking protein powder anymore.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
Yeah, his roommate was going to the gym and cranking it, shredding it, goes home to give

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
his muscles what they crave and they just get that bunny milk.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That's not doing them any good.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
The problem is if you miss one serving of the protein powder, all your muscles deflate.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
That's what they don't tell you.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It's a razor's edge kind of regime.

48:15.000 --> 48:22.000
This guy deflated so much you could see the sperm pilot inside of him.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You could see his 21 sperm pilot.

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I know you wanted to move on, but I have to think that your body grows, right?

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
Your sperm pilot probably grows too, so it's like the size of a big snake in you.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Is that what your fucking spine is?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Holy shit, you guys.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
It's your skull and your spine.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
It makes sense.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
It all makes sense.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
It looks like that nut.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
It just looks like the nut if you think about it.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
It looks like that nut.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
Your brain is there and your brain would be in the skull of the sperm telling it how to

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
swim good to get in the egg.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It all makes so much sense.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
It makes a lot of fucking sense.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
You've cracked this nut wide open.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
They have to go to the wedding, right?

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
They still have to go?

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Oh yeah, you have to go.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
You have to go.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
This is the most innocuous prank ever.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Don't sweat it.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Don't sweat it.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I went to a Halloween party with my friends.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
I didn't know what to expect at this party, and when I got there, I saw that there were

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
finger foods, which causes me pretty severe anxiety.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
What?

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
I smoked far too much weed and discovered just how serious my anxiety is.

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
I had an emotional breakdown right there in front of the spinach dip.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
Can I come back from this and hang out with my friends or do I need to leave town?

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
And that's for too high for this shit in Oregon.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
I don't want to rag on this person's anxiety.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Obviously, this is a fucking anxiety-free zone.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
I could see why you would get, you know, freaked out.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
I would request that we not put the finger foods into the anxiety basket and send it

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
down to the anxiety alligators who probably enjoy it for a change.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
I'll be the anxiety alligator for this particular anxiety, by which I mean, pass that dip down

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
Griffin's way, because, Jesus, I'll destroy it.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Oh, man.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
Do we need to record, like, a comedown?

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Let me say this.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I will say this to you.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
This seems so innocuous to me that I actually think you might have given your friends a

50:22.000 --> 50:30.000
gift with this, because this is a fun story of that time one of your friends was so high

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
that they cried over spinach dip.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
That's not – I don't know that there's a friend of yours right now who's like,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I fucking hope they never show up again.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Like, it's not like –

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I hope they always show up everywhere.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
That was amazing.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah, right?

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
Like, that's a fun story of, like, I remember there was one time in college they got so

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
high they cried over spinach dip.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
That's funny.

50:50.000 --> 50:56.000
They're not so drunk that you, like, wrecked their car or, like, set their couch on fire.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Sure.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
But when you're – I don't know how to explain this to you, boys.

51:02.000 --> 51:12.000
When you're sailing on the SS Good Cush, you can do some stuff sometimes that may seem

51:12.000 --> 51:18.000
kind of whack to the outside observer in a way that makes them sort of, like, a bit

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
uncomfy.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
I don't know if you – I feel like I have a similar story to this where one time I was

51:23.000 --> 51:33.000
at a party and I was the first mate of that particular voyage and I saw an ex and it gave

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
me a real bad, real bad feelings that I didn't –

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
An ex?

51:38.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah, I saw an ex that my big sperm didn't really know how to handle and it's, you know,

51:45.000 --> 51:52.000
dubered up state and so my friend, who was the one who invited me on the boat, so to

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
speak, he told me to grab onto the back of his shirt and the two of us ran from the party

51:59.000 --> 52:05.000
just squealing and giggling to the point of tears while he sort of quarterback, like,

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
snuck me out of the party, like, through the fucking front porch that everybody else was

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
hanging out on and I remember thinking the next morning, like, I need to shoot myself

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
into space because I live on the fucking sun now.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
I'm the king of Mercury now because I can never, ever face any of those people ever

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
again.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
But they don't know what was wrong with you.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
They probably knew what was wrong with me.

52:32.000 --> 52:42.000
At the same time, like, I don't – no judgment if I see somebody who's, like, on that ship,

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
on that rocking and rolling boat and I see them having a bad time.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
I don't hold it against them.

52:48.000 --> 52:53.000
It's just I get where this person is coming from and I can see them not laughing it right

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
off.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.000
I feel like you have to – before it gets to a judgment zone, I feel like everybody's

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
seen the – like, if you party and your friends party, I feel like you've – probably everybody's

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
seen their friends over party.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Everyone has partied too much.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
I feel like you don't enter the judgment zone until it becomes, like, oh, they're

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
the one who parties too much every single time.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
Like, five or six times of crying at spinach dip or a big X apparently.

53:24.000 --> 53:30.000
Or one time of you physically fighting the spinach dip.

53:30.000 --> 53:36.000
Like, you show up to the party on the good cush and then you see the spinach dip and

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
you immediately fight it before anybody can enjoy it and it's homemade.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
And you just keep yelling, I'm strong to the fennec.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Yeah.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
And just, like, over and over again.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Yeah.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Folks, that's going to do it for us on our anxiety-free cruise.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
We hope you enjoyed it.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Did we do a good job?

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
I hope you did.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
I feel like it was pretty chill.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
I think it was a pretty chill zone.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
I would like to pitch something.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Okay.

53:57.000 --> 54:04.000
I would like to pitch, like, a 20-second bubble in which I can say something that may induce

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
anxiety, but then Justin, you're going to swing it right back with your musical number.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Okay.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Well, let's save that for, like, literally the end of the show.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
How about that?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
You got it.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
How about we finish this, we hop on the bubble, and then we get right back on the boat real

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
quick.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Okay.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
That's the anxiety thing that's coming later.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
No.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
It's so fine.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
I do want to say maybe this will help.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
I have a daughter now.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Oh, yeah.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Yay.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
And she's doing great.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Her name is Barbara Lee McElroy.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
We're calling her B.B. Lee, and Lee is her middle name.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It's not like a hyphen or anything.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.960
It's Barbara Lee McElroy, B.B. Lee.

54:38.960 --> 54:42.800
She was born on October 25th.

54:42.800 --> 54:47.000
She was a little early, but she's healthy, and she's home, and everything's going great.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
And Teresa's doing great.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Can I ask you a question?

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
I've got to ask a question.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.160
You have a beautiful baby, and congratulations.

54:52.160 --> 54:55.240
But which was the baby, the egg or the sperm?

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
Do you know?

54:56.240 --> 54:58.080
Because you're right up against it now.

54:58.080 --> 55:03.320
I mean, I really thought it was the sperm, but now I'm convinced that the sperm is just

55:03.320 --> 55:05.520
piloting the egg.

55:05.520 --> 55:09.400
And that really makes the most sense to me, Griffin, I've got to tell you.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.400
But B.B.'s doing great.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.400
Teresa's doing great.

55:11.400 --> 55:14.160
We're all doing great.

55:14.160 --> 55:22.480
You know, and I do want to say, I have been deeply moved by everybody on Twitter and Facebook

55:22.480 --> 55:28.400
and everywhere that has just, since she was born, poured out so much support and love,

55:28.400 --> 55:33.520
and everybody has been so happy to see pictures of her.

55:33.520 --> 55:39.800
And we spent a little time in the NICU, and it was very scary at first, and knowing that

55:39.800 --> 55:46.120
there was just this, like, squad of people, this, like, huge, like, support network of

55:46.120 --> 55:49.460
people telling us, like, hey, it's going great.

55:49.460 --> 55:50.460
You guys are great.

55:50.460 --> 55:51.460
Everything's going to be fine.

55:51.460 --> 55:52.460
She looks beautiful.

55:52.460 --> 55:53.460
Like, all that stuff.

55:53.460 --> 55:54.460
It meant the world to us.

55:54.460 --> 56:00.600
So we just want to say thank you for everybody who has supported us during the beginning

56:00.600 --> 56:03.600
of this new phase of our family.

56:03.600 --> 56:04.600
Thank you, everybody.

56:04.600 --> 56:09.960
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song instead

56:09.960 --> 56:13.760
of Parchoff, the album putting the days to bed.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.760
Thank you very much.

56:14.760 --> 56:15.760
It's a good song.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.040
Also, I want to thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

56:18.040 --> 56:20.720
Go to MaximumFun.org and just click on all the shows you see there.

56:20.720 --> 56:24.920
You're going to love more than six of them, I bet.

56:24.920 --> 56:28.520
Also, we have a bunch of other podcasts and video projects that we do.

56:28.520 --> 56:30.800
You can find all those at McElroyShows.com.

56:30.800 --> 56:37.920
Did you guys announce the February release date for the My Brother, My Brother and Me

56:37.920 --> 56:38.920
TV show on CISO?

56:38.920 --> 56:39.920
We did.

56:39.920 --> 56:40.920
We talked about that last week.

56:40.920 --> 56:41.920
But yeah, February, what is it?

56:41.920 --> 56:42.920
21st?

56:42.920 --> 56:43.920
23rd.

56:43.920 --> 56:44.920
23rd.
