00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:49.440
All right, get ready to sail the seven seas of comedy with my brother of a brother meeting

00:49.440 --> 00:53.360
advice show for the modern era brought to you by Pirates of the Caribbean now on Stranger's

00:53.360 --> 01:06.160
Hide.

01:23.360 --> 01:32.120
And I'm Davy Jones Coulier, who's the dark pirate of comedy.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.000
Cut it out or you walk the plank.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.640
So we're three pirates of comedy.

01:37.640 --> 01:42.560
We've sailed under Jack Sparrow for lo these many years aboard the Black Pearl, taking

01:42.560 --> 01:46.240
in his tutelage and this is a theme podcast.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.580
His high seas tutelage.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.240
This is brought to you, of course, by the new Disney picture.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.440
I think it's going to be a big smash.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.360
It's Pirates on Stranger Tides.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.400
We, in the know, just call it Pirates because what else could you be talking about?

02:02.400 --> 02:08.080
I call it P4 because I'm a real fan.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.360
Are you going to P4 this weekend?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.600
You know it.

02:12.600 --> 02:19.120
I thought the real fans didn't count three, so this would technically be P3 in the canon.

02:19.120 --> 02:24.080
In the canon, spelled with two Ns because we're just so crazy about pirate ships.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.560
All aboard for hilarity.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.560
So this is a device show, of course, obviously.

02:31.560 --> 02:38.720
We take your questions and turn them, like using the magic of the mysterious island of

02:38.720 --> 02:41.160
Tortuga, into wisdom.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.120
Like the witchcraft of Teodolma.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
Here we go.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
A torch of destiny.

02:45.120 --> 02:52.280
I'm just going to say that every time somebody asks.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.520
My girlfriend refuses to make decisions.

02:54.520 --> 02:59.600
From things like, what should we do, eat, watch tonight, if you're still figuring out

02:59.600 --> 03:00.600
what to watch tonight?

03:00.600 --> 03:04.940
Why is it just Pirates of the Caribbean 4 on Stranger Tides P4?

03:04.940 --> 03:08.840
To things like, where would you like to go on vacation?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.920
Or which apartment should we lease?

03:10.920 --> 03:13.680
Tortuga is the spot.

03:13.680 --> 03:22.180
I get the same, up to you, matey, response.

03:22.180 --> 03:26.880
I try to counter with, no, no, it's up to you this time, or similar, but at some point

03:26.880 --> 03:28.680
a decision has to be made.

03:28.680 --> 03:35.000
How can I force my girlfriend to decide on things from time to time to also indecisive

03:35.000 --> 03:38.120
in Coral Springs?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
Make her walk the plank.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
That's A.

03:40.120 --> 03:44.160
Step one.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.520
Here's an interesting idea.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.700
Here's something that's going to kind of blow your mind.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.640
She already has told you.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.120
Like is not.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.440
She has already told you where she wants to eat, but now it's a puzzle that you've got

03:58.440 --> 04:01.560
to piece together from the past two days.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.720
You have to reassemble the clues and figure out-

04:03.720 --> 04:09.960
So are you saying if she mentioned sushi the day before, you need to say sushi?

04:09.960 --> 04:17.200
When she says, oh, whatever you want, in her head she's screaming, remember when I said

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
sushi?

04:18.200 --> 04:21.240
Please remember when I said sushi?

04:21.240 --> 04:24.480
Is that really that special to her, you think?

04:24.480 --> 04:30.320
Just is it more special that he remembers that like a week ago they watched P4, and

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
so like now-

04:31.320 --> 04:32.840
Now that she wants seafood?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.840
Wants Long John Silver's.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.040
Well I think that, I think it's broader than that.

04:37.040 --> 04:41.880
I think it's like, you need to remember that she's allergic to shellfish and not take her

04:41.880 --> 04:42.880
to Red Lobster.

04:42.880 --> 04:48.200
Well, bitch, I don't think he's going to take her to a place where he's going to kill her.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.600
That's probably implied in like the off the table choices.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.600
Just like I don't go to the stab restaurant anymore because I hate getting stabbed.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.600
Like it's probably the same thing.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.680
Oh, but their croutons are so good.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.680
They are so good.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.920
They do that thing with the herbs.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
I don't know what it is.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.600
It's something in the oil and it's delicious and it almost makes getting shivved with it.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.560
I'll tell you what it is.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.560
Before they serve that oil, they stab it.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.560
Yeah.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.920
They stab the oil and it really opens it up.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.600
If you do carry out, they'll just cut your inner thigh like someplace easy to hide.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Yeah.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.760
And not super deep or like a surface.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.320
I appreciate that.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.320
Yeah.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.520
We can't go to that restaurant anymore.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.520
No.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
Yeah.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.520
I don't care how good this crouton is.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.960
I go to that restaurant just to feel.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.320
Can we go to Shooties instead?

05:37.320 --> 05:39.920
Shooties is good.

05:39.920 --> 05:45.240
There is a surprisingly high prices though, which for a restaurant where you get shot

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
a lot, I don't understand that.

05:46.240 --> 05:51.320
Can we go to some of this food is poisoned?

05:51.320 --> 05:56.280
That used to be way better, but it got out by Denny's and now it's way too corporate.

05:56.280 --> 06:00.240
I think all that fake kitsch on the wall where it's not like, you know, it's like, take

06:00.240 --> 06:02.680
my wife, please, ha ha ha, signs.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.240
You know how Denny's has baconalia now?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.240
Uh huh.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.240
Yeah.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.440
That was an innovation inspired by some of this food is poison.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.440
Oh.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.440
Yeah.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.440
Some of this food.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
Little food facts for you.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
Some of this food was poison.

06:14.440 --> 06:19.840
The challenge there was actually the best and last episode of Man vs. Food.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.840
I miss him still.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.960
I don't know why their challenge was to eat all the poisoned food and I don't know why

06:24.960 --> 06:30.480
he accepted it, but here we are.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.760
Also decisive in Coral Springs, that is part one of the advice.

06:34.760 --> 06:39.760
Part two is just start deciding my man.

06:39.760 --> 06:45.080
And I would suggest this, maybe purposefully make some wrong choices until she steps up

06:45.080 --> 06:46.080
her game.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
Okay.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.080
Yeah.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.080
I'm saying like when she's like, where do you want to eat?

06:49.080 --> 06:53.680
There's be like McDonald's every time she's like, maybe I'll decide tonight.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.440
And you're like, okay.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.640
You know that there are a sponsor this week, right?

06:57.640 --> 06:59.200
Oh, that's awkward.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.200
Yeah.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.200
Just kidding.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
Go.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
It's just saying, just take her out.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
Because it's delicious.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.800
Go get some big and tasties and shove them in your mouth.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.160
So go ahead and make those choices.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.920
It may just be hard for her to decide and that's a facet of her personality that you've

07:15.920 --> 07:19.880
got to sort of learn to incorporate.

07:19.880 --> 07:27.120
But also listen to her because she will probably drop hints if you pay attention.

07:27.120 --> 07:32.160
And a lot of times that's more important than what the food ends up being is sort of

07:32.160 --> 07:35.680
knowing that you were there for her.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.320
And maybe rather than like one of you making a decision, you can provide options and be

07:39.320 --> 07:43.920
like, well, would you rather have, are you thinking like sushi or are you thinking like

07:43.920 --> 07:47.300
maybe go to like a steakhouse or something and then let her say, well, I'm not really

07:47.300 --> 07:51.600
feeling in the mood for sushi and make it a discussion rather than one of you has to

07:51.600 --> 07:52.760
make the decision.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.800
Break right up with her.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
Okay.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
That would be a decision.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
Certainly.

07:58.800 --> 08:03.400
Life is too short to suffer indecisive people.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.480
Just tell me what you want, Catherine.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.600
What you really, really, really want.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.520
I'm 30 year old dude in rural Kentucky and I have a hard time meeting and maintaining

08:12.520 --> 08:15.720
relationships with women because I'm an open atheist.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.240
I'm not confrontational about my lack of belief, but I don't hide it either.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.160
Whenever a prospective lady friend asks if I will go to church with her or just how much

08:23.160 --> 08:27.900
I love the sweet Lord, baby Jesus, I have to tactfully answer in the negative.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.580
Then I get dumped.

08:29.580 --> 08:32.080
At this point, it has gotten demoralizing.

08:32.080 --> 08:37.220
I know the remedy for my love life would be more urban and educated area, but I'm unwilling

08:37.220 --> 08:41.320
to leave my family in the lurch just so I can have some female companionship.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.720
What say you brothers three?

08:42.720 --> 08:49.360
Can you shed some insight on my lack of apostate lovin', Wes?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.600
I think you should move to a more rural area.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
Yeah.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.520
A lot of people always eliminate the super easy options, like we can just knock this

08:56.520 --> 08:57.520
out of the park.

08:57.520 --> 09:03.040
Like you need to move to where there are more people like you, like in your situation.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.520
Or learn to keep your mouth shut.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.520
Kind of.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.520
One of those two things.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.520
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
Hey, how about this?

09:08.520 --> 09:11.920
When people start talking about how much they love Jesus, why don't you just go in the

09:11.920 --> 09:15.360
other room and make yourself, I don't know, whatever atheists eat.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
Like make yourself that.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
Why?

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
An empty sandwich.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.360
An empty sandwich.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.160
I feel like you guys are ignoring the easiest solution, which is to accept the love of sweet

09:23.160 --> 09:25.800
Jesus baby in your heart.

09:25.800 --> 09:32.120
Jesus came on a rocket ship and landed in Kansas low these 33 years ago.

09:32.120 --> 09:41.280
He was raised by Mom Pa Kent to save us all from Krypton and from Lex Luthor, and I think

09:41.280 --> 09:45.040
we should all believe in him because he's flying up above us, waving down.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.040
In space.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.480
And also Green Lantern is there.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.040
Green Lantern is hanging out with him.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.040
Who's that?

09:50.040 --> 09:53.520
Thor is hanging out and they're having God talk.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
Just chatting about God stuff.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.520
Yeah.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.520
My three gods.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.520
My three gods are Green Lantern, Superman, and Thor.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.720
That's my favorite TV show.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.720
It's my favorite.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.720
My three gods.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.720
Yeah.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
It's a pretty good show.

10:05.720 --> 10:13.200
Wes, there are many people that I know that I've known for, I don't know, almost a decade

10:13.200 --> 10:18.280
that I, if you put a gun to my head, could not tell me their religious beliefs.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.280
Yep.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
That's the thing.

10:20.280 --> 10:24.960
You say you're not being confrontational, and I believe that you're not, but I also

10:24.960 --> 10:29.160
believe that you're maybe being more vocal about it than you have to be.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.160
Yeah.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.560
You just gotta keep your mouth shut about it.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.560
And like, if you get to a point where-

10:33.560 --> 10:35.600
So who else here hates Jesus, right?

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
Yeah.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.600
Yeah.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
Right?

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
That crosses a load of baloney, right?

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
Like, what are you doing?

10:40.600 --> 10:46.480
I, yeah, I mean, like, just keep your, just don't talk about it.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.520
And that advice, really, like, I kind of think that extends to everybody.

10:50.520 --> 10:59.120
Like, it's such a, if alcohol is a social lubricant, then religion is like social silly

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
putty.

11:00.120 --> 11:04.800
It just gums up everything, and no real, like, super productive, fun talk can come out of

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
that.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.560
Because the thing is, once you bring it up, that's all you're talking about for like

11:08.560 --> 11:11.920
the next hour and a half until somebody gets up and walks away from the table.

11:11.920 --> 11:12.920
Yeah.

11:12.920 --> 11:13.920
Here's what I think.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.200
If you're an atheist, it means you don't believe in any god, make up a god.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
Another one.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
They gotta respect that.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.200
Yeah.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.200
And also, Wes, look at it this way.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.000
If you're with a girl that's gonna break up with you because she believes something

11:24.000 --> 11:27.120
different than you, you don't want to be with her anyways.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.640
But you're saying he's gotta get his nut off, but he's gotta get his nut off, and he doesn't

11:30.640 --> 11:34.280
know where to find girls that will take him.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.280
Get his nut off?

11:35.280 --> 11:36.280
Excuse me?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.280
Pardon me?

11:37.280 --> 11:40.280
He's gotta get his seed out, and he can't find girls that-

11:40.280 --> 11:42.680
His one, is it his nut or his seed?

11:42.680 --> 11:45.720
You're throwing down a lot of arboreal references right now.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.720
He's gotta plant-

11:46.720 --> 11:49.480
He's gotta germinate his stamen and or pistols.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.280
He's gotta drop some sap, won't that be?

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
Hey.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
Hey.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
Hey.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.280
How about a Yahoo?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.280
Yeah.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.280
Okay.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.280
Give me.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.280
This one is sent in by Steve Lewis.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
Thank you, Steve Lewis.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, oh great.

12:03.720 --> 12:11.080
Listen to the Easter Platypus who asks, how long do you think it would take for someone

12:11.080 --> 12:15.000
wearing a Batman suit to be thrown out of the mall?

12:15.000 --> 12:20.640
Do you think he might get away with it for a couple minutes at least if he pretends to

12:20.640 --> 12:27.960
be there to promote something Batman related, so he hands out flyers or something?

12:27.960 --> 12:34.280
Well I think the factor we're ignoring there is the security guard assuming that that is

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
Batman.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.640
Yeah, he could just be like, oh thank God, somebody to help me carry the burden.

12:39.640 --> 12:40.640
Holy fuck.

12:40.640 --> 12:48.320
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, Batman Paul Blart crossover comic coming this fall from

12:48.320 --> 12:49.320
Dark Lord.

12:49.320 --> 12:57.360
Paul Blart Dark Knight, Crisis on Infinite Sandwiches.

12:57.360 --> 13:03.520
I like the image of this guy fervently typing this into his phone as he walks into the mall

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
in a Batman costume.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
I try, guys, listen.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.520
Update, 23 minutes.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
23 minutes.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.320
23 minutes, no one has taken me out yet.

13:11.320 --> 13:16.280
I honestly think that if you showed up to the mall dressed as Batman, the amount of

13:16.280 --> 13:19.400
time you could walk around dressed as Batman is infinite.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.520
I don't think anybody's going to be like, get out of here Batman.

13:22.520 --> 13:27.600
Now unless you're like Batman with like a crotchless costume, you're not getting booted

13:27.600 --> 13:29.040
out of the mall for dressing like Batman.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
Do they sell this?

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
You're going to get looked.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.480
I don't want to talk about it.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.440
Let me reach in my utility belt.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.440
What's this?

13:35.440 --> 13:36.440
It's my bat bow.

13:36.440 --> 13:41.320
I've only got one tool, but it's good for everything.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.160
This is my utility dog.

13:43.160 --> 13:47.440
I can't tell you how happy I am right now picturing Batman in Bed Bath and Beyond.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
With his dick hanging out?

13:48.440 --> 13:49.440
Where are your facial scrubbers?

13:49.440 --> 13:53.280
Why are you hanging out with Batman with his dick hanging out, Travis?

13:53.280 --> 13:56.680
This isn't the loofah I deserve, but it's the loofah I need.

13:56.680 --> 14:04.800
Why are you in the mall in a Batman costume, sir?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.200
Pardon me, sir.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.400
Can you explain your whole situation to me?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.000
I'm not trying to kick you out.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.320
I'm worried about you.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.720
I just want to know.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.200
I want to get to the bottom of this.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.440
You're the world's greatest detective, and I want you to explain this mystery to me.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.440
Why are you in Petland?

14:20.440 --> 14:22.440
Why are you in Petland, Batman?

14:22.440 --> 14:26.720
If I see Batman, I'm running the opposite direction because wherever he is, the penguin

14:26.720 --> 14:28.600
can't be far behind.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.840
He knows what shadows hide in the hearts of men.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
Nope.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.840
Nope.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.840
That's not it at all.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.880
If you see a guy dressed as a shadow at the mall, oops, he's a hobo.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.880
That's your mistake.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.880
That's on you.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.080
If he tries to control your mind, well, they all have to.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.400
Can we go back and just really explore that Paul Blart-Mall-Cut-Batman crossover?

14:48.400 --> 14:51.000
Because I think there's a lot of room for-

14:51.000 --> 14:55.320
So are you talking like Paul Blart as Batman, or like a team-up power deal?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.320
I'm talking about team-up.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.520
I'm talking about a match-up maybe, but maybe like Bane comes in and breaks Batman's

15:00.520 --> 15:05.040
back, and then Paul Blart has to put on the mantle, only it doesn't fit because Christian

15:05.040 --> 15:09.920
Bale's like cut and ripped, and Kevin James is like super fat.

15:09.920 --> 15:14.600
And there's like a montage of him trying to fit it into the costume to the sound of

15:14.600 --> 15:17.760
like, I don't know, maybe Brick House or something?

15:17.760 --> 15:24.840
I think it would just be like a tuba.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.520
And also for some reason, Jonah Hill is his sidekick.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.680
Yeah, Jonah Hill would be his Robin.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.280
Well, could we do Robin?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.120
We might get extra comedy if it's Batgirl.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.320
It's, hey, Jonah Hill's cross-dressing you guys.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.880
What if we get Alicia Silverstone?

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
Uh-huh.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
Oh, okay.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.520
Well, that's kind of on the nose, but I guess we could get her.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.520
What's she doing?

15:43.520 --> 15:49.960
I think it would be interesting if we did like Batman, colon, Generations, and so we

15:49.960 --> 15:54.320
had Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl, and we had Christian Bale, and then-

15:54.320 --> 15:56.360
So you're saying, okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.360
Dane DeVito, Penguin.

15:57.360 --> 16:04.120
All these guys are fighting a war of crime inside of Paul Bart's mall.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.120
Okay.

16:05.120 --> 16:09.400
Oh, and it turns out that Paul Bart is Batman from the future.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:10.920 --> 16:18.480
So they will pass, if I understand your Generations concept, what you're saying is that at some

16:18.480 --> 16:26.500
point in the narrative, Batman will become unable to do his job, and he will pass the

16:26.500 --> 16:31.600
suit on to Paul Bart, who will fit into it in a tube of music, and then Batgirl will

16:31.600 --> 16:36.360
become incapacitated, and Jonah Hill will have to take the Batgirl costume and rise

16:36.360 --> 16:37.360
up as Batgirl.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
Is that what you're saying?

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
Yes.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.920
What I'm saying is Bane has two knees.

16:41.920 --> 16:47.180
He's gonna crack Christian Bale, gonna crash loose to Silverstone, and then where are those

16:47.180 --> 16:53.600
cowls going other than the sweet and chubby heads of Jonah Hill and Kevin James?

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
Okay.

16:54.600 --> 16:59.520
So who does, what happens at the, do they fight the same penguin, or does the penguin

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
get passed on to somebody else?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.700
The penguin's played by Ed Helms.

17:03.700 --> 17:11.200
The penguin gets passed on to Ed Helms, Bane is the Hulk, Hulk Hogan.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
Okay.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
Okay, sure.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.880
I want you to know right now I'd see this movie.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.720
I would watch, why, where are the advertisers for a movie like this?

17:18.720 --> 17:21.360
Why can't this be the sort of thing they're putting in the multiplex?

17:21.360 --> 17:26.640
I would watch a Batman movie that is nothing but two hours of Arnold Schwarzenegger making

17:26.640 --> 17:29.120
Mr. Freeze puns.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.280
Chill.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.480
I'm going to Orange Julius.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.800
I hope they put ice in my drink.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.360
Like that's the level of puns that we're talking about.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.360
Yeah.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.520
Just saying, him saying ice in different ways.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.580
I'm going to Jared to get some ice, I mean diamonds.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.240
It was ice to meet you.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.080
Yeah, that's actually one that they say in the movie.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.920
Oh, burn in hell, really?

17:55.920 --> 17:59.480
I scream, you scream, we all scream for cold stone ice cream.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.280
Can you cut more ice into my ice cream?

18:02.280 --> 18:04.760
That's my top, that's my big sin.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.320
I had an illegitimate child.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.080
Oh, that's who Mr. Freeze can be.

18:09.080 --> 18:13.040
Mr. Freeze can be played by Arnold Schwarzenegger's 10 year old love baby.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.040
The baby shorts?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.040
Yeah.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.040
Baby shorts.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.040
Is that 10?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.040
Is that thing 10?

18:18.040 --> 18:19.040
Yeah, it's 10.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
And then we're out there.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.840
There's like a super cut 10 year old just getting real.

18:22.840 --> 18:23.840
What is his future?

18:23.840 --> 18:28.320
10 years though, that's a good job.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.880
Getting cast in a major Hollywood movie.

18:29.880 --> 18:34.680
No, I'm saying 10 years keeping a secret love child on the down low for 10 years.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
Oh, Travis.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.000
He's already got a job in Batman Generations.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.280
Or on the flip side, maybe he's right now walking around a wall wearing a Batman costume

18:45.280 --> 18:49.560
and sending in questions to Yahoo.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.560
What is the best thing in life to maybe see a boob someday?

18:53.560 --> 18:58.120
Hey, NBNB AM, I have a problem.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.480
Whenever I meet a lady, I'm usually very funny.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.480
Oh, good.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.440
That lasts for a few months until it becomes more serious, at which I'm extremely nice

19:05.440 --> 19:07.080
but dull.

19:07.080 --> 19:11.480
Now I was never not nice to the ladies, but when it is less serious, I worry less about

19:11.480 --> 19:12.600
offending them.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.960
How do I bring back the funny but not offend them Gmail?

19:16.960 --> 19:24.880
Wait, do you realize that there's a difference between when like a relationship gets serious

19:24.880 --> 19:29.960
and when you have to get serious, you can still be funny.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
Nope.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.640
It's not like we're dating now.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.760
Let's talk about death.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.760
It's like putting on, it's putting on like comedy sweatpants.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.760
You just give up.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.080
Like no more comedy makeup or comedy curling your hair.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.760
You're just, you're just laying out some conkers and calling it a day.

19:44.760 --> 19:45.760
So are we dating now?

19:45.760 --> 19:49.000
Cause I'm just about out of Napoleon Dynamite references.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.080
Love only makes you less funny.

19:53.080 --> 19:58.680
That is why I have remained single for so many, so many years.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
It's for the show.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.520
He's a, he's a chuckle monk basically.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.560
I am a chuckle monk.

20:04.560 --> 20:14.760
I am, uh, I am silly, but boy, I need to go write that down real quick.

20:14.760 --> 20:15.760
Don't do it.

20:15.760 --> 20:16.760
Yeah.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.280
Hey, I got another, I got, I got another point I came up with.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
What's that?

20:19.280 --> 20:20.280
Check this one out.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.280
Diabetes.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.280
Hey, right?

20:22.280 --> 20:23.280
Pretty good.

20:23.280 --> 20:28.440
Um, yeah, that's, I mean, that's, I mean, that's for real.

20:28.440 --> 20:33.560
If I would lose the jokes, I would pull a fucking Eddie Murphy, holy man, like full

20:33.560 --> 20:35.360
on 180 career shift.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.360
Yeah.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.600
And all of a sudden you're doing haunted mansion and meet Dave.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
Uh huh.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
And why?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600
Cause I've got kids now.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.400
Hey kids, come laugh at haunted mansion.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.400
What's this?

20:44.400 --> 20:45.400
Beverly Hills cop?

20:45.400 --> 20:46.400
No, put that down.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
Put that down.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
You're too young for that.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
Kids are the kryptonite to a funny career.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.640
Did Mike Myers get kids before he did love guru?

20:51.640 --> 20:52.640
Is that what happened?

20:52.640 --> 20:54.120
It would explain a lot.

20:54.120 --> 20:59.520
I, yeah, I, I think that's, that's so true when you see a movie and it's like, I want

20:59.520 --> 21:01.120
to do something my kids could watch.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.000
It's like, why are your kids want to watch shitty stuff or are you letting watch?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
You know what?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
You know what?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.560
If you want your kids to be cool, let them watch trading places cause that would make

21:09.560 --> 21:10.560
for a cool kid.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.800
When, when I become a movie star and I make a shitty movie, my explanation in the interview

21:14.800 --> 21:18.280
is going to be, I wanted to make something that I could make my kids watch when they

21:18.280 --> 21:19.280
misbehave.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.080
I need to have a, a punishment tool.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.840
Now you have to watch meet Dave.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.840
You sit down.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.840
With your friends.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.840
Your friends are going to watch it with you.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
You sit down.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.660
You're getting, you, you wrote on the walls with crayons.

21:29.660 --> 21:31.560
You're watching Pluto Nash.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.560
Come on in here.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.560
Strap in.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.560
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

21:36.560 --> 21:41.840
We're doing a back to back of RV followed by RV and then I'm just going to talk to you

21:41.840 --> 21:45.080
for 30 minutes cause nothing could be worse than that.

21:45.080 --> 21:50.800
Hey, speaking of this, this is what your, your, uh, pattern in relationships is exact

21:50.800 --> 21:53.600
same tack adopted by Robin Williams and the American public.

21:53.600 --> 21:58.840
You try to be funny for like the first third and then you just, just give up and sort of

21:58.840 --> 21:59.840
plunk it.

21:59.840 --> 22:04.240
You keep, I think we've talked about this before, but it's the idea of if you are putting

22:04.240 --> 22:11.160
on like a personality to impress someone in the beginning of your relationship, eventually

22:11.160 --> 22:12.840
you're going to drop that.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.080
Just be yourself from the get go.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.920
And if yourself is funny, be funny for like the rest of your life.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.120
You don't have to stop being funny.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.080
It's such a, such a hassle though.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.620
Be funny forever.

22:24.620 --> 22:25.620
Can't do it, man.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.120
Well, if you're not funny, then don't be funny.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.960
Don't like, don't try to be funny in the beginning.

22:28.960 --> 22:29.960
Don't wear yourself out.

22:29.960 --> 22:30.960
Just be like, Hey, this is me.

22:30.960 --> 22:31.960
I'm kind of boring.

22:31.960 --> 22:37.080
In the beginning of our relationship, you should always sell yourself short.

22:37.080 --> 22:42.680
You should always, so like under promise over deliver under deliver under don't, don't promise

22:42.680 --> 22:48.520
zero promises and then like half ass delivery and then you can pick up the speed and pick

22:48.520 --> 22:52.720
up the pace as it goes along and then it'll be like, you're just getting funnier and it's

22:52.720 --> 22:54.680
like you're just getting better and better.

22:54.680 --> 23:00.520
I was, I was unsure about staying with you in the beginning, but now in the immortal

23:00.520 --> 23:05.680
words of wide life, all things just keep getting better about you, Jerry.

23:05.680 --> 23:10.280
Kiss my boobs.

23:10.280 --> 23:14.360
Get over here right now and kiss on the back.

23:14.360 --> 23:20.680
I have two big bags of blood on the front of my body that needs some kisses and it's

23:20.680 --> 23:22.240
time for you to do the man.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.960
Is that what they are?

23:24.960 --> 23:29.400
I've never WebMD'd it, but I would like to know what's going on in there.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.880
It's just blood, blood and milk.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.560
How come when vampires bite people, they don't bite them right on the boob?

23:37.560 --> 23:38.560
Because that's inappropriate.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.560
Griffin.

23:39.560 --> 23:40.560
Yeah.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.560
I can't show that on TV then.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.560
Jesus.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.520
Hey, how about a Yahoo answer question?

23:44.520 --> 23:47.520
Yeah, let's do that.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.880
This one was sent in by Sarah Westlake.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.200
Thank you, Sarah Westlake.

23:51.200 --> 24:00.840
That's by Yahoo Answers user Jack1081, who asks, how much fart can you store in a typical

24:00.840 --> 24:05.280
large glass jar?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.280
Such is the sort you buy pickles in.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.280
We are assuming-

24:08.280 --> 24:09.560
Such is the sort.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.400
This is what we're assuming, you guys.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
Okay.

24:12.400 --> 24:17.120
We are assuming that you've got a vacuum seal with the right equipment.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.720
The only time that the seal's broken is when you're sitting on the receptacle and ready

24:20.720 --> 24:21.720
to fart.

24:21.720 --> 24:28.640
A flat mechanical lid slides open, the machine sucks fart in, and immediately closes the

24:28.640 --> 24:29.640
lid.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.640
Oh, God.

24:30.640 --> 24:37.520
Oh, like a postal pneumatic tube, like, got that fart.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.520
Oh, Jesus.

24:38.520 --> 24:43.000
Basically, you know that thing in Ghostbusters, the trap, the proton trap or whatever?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.760
We're talking about that, but for flash lights.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.520
So like a really big Twinkie full of farts.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.520
Well-

24:49.520 --> 24:50.520
Oh, God.

24:50.520 --> 24:57.920
I think this person, like, hey, FBI, if you need the heads up on the dirty people that

24:57.920 --> 25:03.400
are going to like steal toddlers and dress them up and make them do mock pageants in

25:03.400 --> 25:08.120
their basement, like, this is the person, like, this is the person that will do that.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.120
You need to get them.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.120
Go get them.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.120
I think there's a-

25:11.120 --> 25:12.120
Go get them.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
Go catch.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.120
Go catch them.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.520
I think there's a time in every person's life where they think about how many farts

25:16.520 --> 25:21.440
would fit inside something, and that time is like four years old.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.440
Yeah.

25:22.440 --> 25:26.560
I wonder if I could fart into my toy train and then keep it there forever, like, oh,

25:26.560 --> 25:27.560
you can't grow up.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.560
All aboard the Fart Express.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.560
Toot, toot.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
Toot, toot.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.560
Get it?

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
Dummy.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
Some Yahoo!

25:34.560 --> 25:42.960
Answer user, Bacon Lever, responded, in a typical glass pickle jar, you can fart as

25:42.960 --> 25:48.220
many times as you want, but it's impossible to fill it up 100% of the way with farts.

25:48.220 --> 25:52.360
Too much fart will escape when you try to close the jar after farting in it.

25:52.360 --> 25:56.920
According to my estimations, you can fill it up about 42% of the jar with farts.

25:56.920 --> 25:57.920
What?

25:57.920 --> 26:02.400
According to my calculations, didn't this guy already tell the plan of how he's not

26:02.400 --> 26:03.520
going to let the farts escape?

26:03.520 --> 26:06.680
He's got a secret plan to keep the farts inside.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.160
What fucking estimations are you doing?

26:09.160 --> 26:10.160
What equations-

26:10.160 --> 26:14.240
I punched the numbers here into my, uh, my, my calc, and-

26:14.240 --> 26:15.240
It looks like 42%.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.720
A little bit less than half is what you're going to get in that jar.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.600
You're going to get in that jar, it's going to be around 42% farts.

26:23.600 --> 26:30.040
Actually, uh, it's funny, 42% farts is actually the first component of Avril Lavigne's new

26:30.040 --> 26:31.040
perfume.

26:31.040 --> 26:40.140
It's 42% farts, 29% sandalwood, 11% um, the smell of newborn babies, and about 8%

26:40.140 --> 26:41.140
perjury.

26:41.140 --> 26:44.400
Are these Avril Lavigne's farts, or are we, are we dealing with, like, uh-

26:44.400 --> 26:48.320
Oh, no, no, no, they get them from, uh, they get them from Indonesian kids.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.320
These are Pete, these are Pete Wint's farts, get these out of here.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.320
Whatever you do.

26:52.320 --> 26:57.520
Do not buy, like, the CVS knockoff version, it smells like Avril Lavigne's farts.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.400
No, it's Manny Morse farts, you don't want that.

27:01.400 --> 27:05.080
Um, uh, um, why, why are you doing this, guy?

27:05.080 --> 27:06.080
Hey, hey, guy?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.080
Hey, guy?

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
I'm-

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
I have a better Yahoo question.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.760
What is it?

27:10.760 --> 27:11.760
Why are you doing this?

27:11.760 --> 27:12.760
I, I-

27:12.760 --> 27:13.760
Why are you doing this?

27:13.760 --> 27:20.280
I'm a pretty nostalgic guy, and I like to, I like to have little treasures from the past.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.280
Um, but-

27:21.280 --> 27:23.040
You know what, guys?

27:23.040 --> 27:29.840
If I've learned one thing from the supercollider, sometimes science is just for science sake.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.840
You think this is a science-

27:30.840 --> 27:31.840
You don't have to have-

27:31.840 --> 27:32.840
You think this is a science project.

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
Yeah!

27:33.840 --> 27:37.760
At this point, his wife has left him, he's lost custody to his kids, but he has got to

27:37.760 --> 27:40.120
answer this question for science sake.

27:40.120 --> 27:44.720
I think it's more amazing that he's invented an apparatus that lets you fill a container

27:44.720 --> 27:48.640
with gas without letting the previous gas out of the container.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.640
Yeah.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.640
Uh-huh.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.640
How do you differentiate-

27:51.640 --> 27:52.640
This is his wife.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.760
Because, because science says that there's displacement going on in there, right?

27:55.760 --> 28:03.820
Like you, you put the fart gas in, and it lets non-fart gas out, um, but how do you-

28:03.820 --> 28:08.480
How do you differentiate between the two?

28:08.480 --> 28:11.200
Well answer that, and you get the Nobel.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.200
One will be brown.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.200
And one will be clear.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.720
You think one will be brown, you think it'll be dense with farticles, and then-

28:15.720 --> 28:16.720
Exactly.

28:16.720 --> 28:21.680
We're looking for the god farticle here, Griffin.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.800
I uh, I think that this is his life's work.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
That's the important-

28:25.800 --> 28:27.400
The important thing is not that he-

28:27.400 --> 28:28.800
The important thing is that it'll be done.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.800
Like there's not-

28:29.800 --> 28:30.800
That I have a practical application.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
Yeah.

28:31.800 --> 28:32.800
I think when he-

28:32.800 --> 28:33.800
This isn't for him, this is for his kids.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.560
When he looks at his tombstone, it's gonna say, here lies Greg.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.280
As it turns out, about 29 farts.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.920
1960 to 19- 2011.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.960
If we're lucky, he will be dead soon.

28:47.960 --> 28:56.000
How pissed off are those CERN guys gonna be if by inventing a fart storage, a perfect

28:56.000 --> 29:00.480
fart storage apparatus, this guy actually discovers the Higgs boson particle and not

29:00.480 --> 29:01.480
them?

29:01.480 --> 29:02.920
The Higgs boson farticle, of course.

29:02.920 --> 29:03.920
The Higgs boson farticle.

29:03.920 --> 29:10.680
Like, oh, you guys built like a 35-mile long tube that cost you like a trillion dollars?

29:10.680 --> 29:11.680
That's cool.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.680
I just farted in this jar.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.240
Oops, the god element found it.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.160
Big Bang made it in this jar.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.120
I have my own little tiny universe.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.800
Talk about a Big Bang.

29:19.800 --> 29:28.880
I think on that note, it's time to take a trip together, just three brothers, going

29:28.880 --> 29:37.600
on a journey to the Money Zone.

29:37.600 --> 29:44.560
Travis, who are we taking?

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
Who's going with us?

29:45.560 --> 29:46.560
Who's in the trunk?

29:46.560 --> 29:47.560
Cut up in pieces.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
Whoa.

29:48.560 --> 29:49.560
Oh god, no.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.560
Oh god.

29:50.560 --> 29:56.400
Um, well, riding shotgun in the RV on the trip to the Money Zone is Lacey Harbour, soon

29:56.400 --> 29:58.760
to be Lacey Smith.

29:58.760 --> 30:03.400
She wants to send out a special wedding gift message to her fiance and soon-to-be husband

30:03.400 --> 30:04.400
Brian.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.400
Brian with a Y.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.400
Yeah, he's hip.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.400
It's a mysterious Y.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.400
He's down.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
He's hip with a Y.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.280
When can we expect their nuptials?

30:12.280 --> 30:17.440
They're getting married on June 4th of this year to Brian.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.920
That's like next fucking week.

30:18.920 --> 30:19.920
Yeah.

30:19.920 --> 30:20.920
Oh my god.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.920
God, are you guys nervous?

30:21.920 --> 30:22.920
Cold feet?

30:22.920 --> 30:23.920
You got cold feet?

30:23.920 --> 30:24.920
I got cold feet.

30:24.920 --> 30:25.920
What are they into?

30:25.920 --> 30:26.920
What's their deal?

30:26.920 --> 30:32.800
Well, he received a master's in science by inducing E. coli to produce- no, I read that

30:32.800 --> 30:33.800
wrong.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.800
Inducing E. coli to produce human hemoglobin.

30:36.800 --> 30:41.440
Oh man, you read that so wrong.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
I've been inducing E. coli to produce.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.440
You'll never catch me.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.680
You'll never take me alive, fruit cop.

30:48.680 --> 30:53.120
Enjoy that bok choy, motherfucker.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.020
He's a super good at Super Meat Boy.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.080
He is sadly allergic to black pepper.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.360
That's the best kind of pepper that there is, though.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.360
Yeah.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.880
I think you're gonna have white pepper?

31:02.880 --> 31:03.880
Because that's good.

31:03.880 --> 31:04.880
It is?

31:04.880 --> 31:07.080
And not just salt?

31:07.080 --> 31:14.520
He proposed to me on top of Guadalupe Pete in Texas.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.520
Where did he propose to Lacy?

31:15.520 --> 31:19.160
That must have been so special for you.

31:19.160 --> 31:25.160
He even made her a special meal to eat at the top, because he's a great cook, except

31:25.160 --> 31:30.760
where he uses kind of a light hand with the black pepper, because that would kill him.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.760
I want to blow your guys' minds and say he's safe for two years to buy the right.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
That's the trick.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Two years' salary.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
I always say that.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
Jesus Christ.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
Mm-hmm.

31:39.760 --> 31:40.760
Jesus Christ.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.760
You'll know.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.920
Travis, one of these days, you're gonna make that magic leap, and you are gonna know the

31:44.920 --> 31:45.920
kind of sacrifices that-

31:45.920 --> 31:47.760
I can't save two weeks' salary.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
I know.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.520
You spend all of it on pancake materials.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.560
Stuff to make pancakes with.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
Jars.

31:54.560 --> 32:01.640
So, congratulations to you guys, and especially to Brian, for whom we are a gift, treasured

32:01.640 --> 32:02.640
gift-

32:02.640 --> 32:03.640
You're welcome, Brian.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.920
That you can keep forever.

32:06.920 --> 32:15.360
Our other message comes from Ben Sawija, and he submits that we should officially come

32:15.360 --> 32:19.520
out in support of Luminous Electric in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.520
That's right.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.000
They are a skilled electrician serving homeowners, contractors, and commercial customers in the

32:24.000 --> 32:25.440
Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.440
Holy Christ.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.440
Yes, we-

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
What do you need?

32:28.440 --> 32:29.440
What do you need?

32:29.440 --> 32:30.440
What do you need?

32:30.440 --> 32:32.200
You need updated electrical panels in older homes?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.200
Whatever.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.200
Done.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.200
Check mark.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.200
How are your electrical issues?

32:36.200 --> 32:37.200
Oh, you have them?

32:37.200 --> 32:38.200
We will solve them for you.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.200
Check mark.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.520
Lighting design and installation?

32:41.520 --> 32:42.760
Check mark.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.360
Free estimates?

32:44.360 --> 32:45.360
Probably.

32:45.360 --> 32:50.760
Do you want to have flashlights installed in your hands, like a super power?

32:50.760 --> 32:51.760
Yeah.

32:51.760 --> 32:52.760
Or maybe a light bulb eyes.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.600
Do you want to replace your veins with wires?

32:55.600 --> 32:56.600
Yes.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.720
Can I replace my heart with a ticking clock?

33:00.720 --> 33:01.720
Yes.

33:01.720 --> 33:05.520
Turn yourself into a mechanical man.

33:05.520 --> 33:08.320
Some sort of mechanical man with Luminous Electric.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.680
Luminous Electric will turn you into a mechanical man.

33:10.680 --> 33:14.480
Honestly, if you live in the Twin Cities area, and you're listening to this, and you

33:14.480 --> 33:17.760
do not hire these motherfuckers, what's wrong with you?

33:17.760 --> 33:19.760
That's like the best electricians ever.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.920
Can you imagine how awesome that would be?

33:21.920 --> 33:22.920
What?

33:22.920 --> 33:23.920
What?

33:23.920 --> 33:24.920
I mean, okay.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.000
What else is there to do in Minneapolis-St. Paul other than get turned into a robot and

33:28.000 --> 33:29.960
then have like robot races?

33:29.960 --> 33:30.960
Yeah.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.960
Uh-huh.

33:31.960 --> 33:36.760
So they will transfer- they might say at first like, I don't understand what you're saying

33:36.760 --> 33:37.760
and we can't transfer-

33:37.760 --> 33:38.760
Uh-huh.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760
They have to say that because the FDA.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.760
Yes.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.760
You're right.

33:41.760 --> 33:42.760
And the FBI.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.760
The code word is French Stewart.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.760
Yeah.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.000
You say French Stewart and they will-

33:46.000 --> 33:47.720
Give me a full on French Stewart.

33:47.720 --> 33:48.720
Give me the French Stewart.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.920
He's saying, wait, holy shit.

33:50.920 --> 33:51.920
Is he a mechanical man?

33:51.920 --> 33:55.380
He is a malfunctioning mechanical man.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.560
His light bulb eyes don't work.

33:57.560 --> 33:58.560
No.

33:58.560 --> 34:03.960
So that's- go to LuminousElectric.com and you can just hire them.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.040
Just get them.

34:05.040 --> 34:09.520
And I honestly, if you listen to this and you don't choose them as like your cool electrician,

34:09.520 --> 34:10.520
I don't know.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.520
I don't know what's wrong with you.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.520
Justin.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.520
So, yeah.

34:13.520 --> 34:32.360
You're going to need to jingle it up and you have so much to go on here.

34:32.360 --> 34:43.360
But I'm out on top on Guadalupe Peak, made the decision and with his mouth he speaked,

34:43.360 --> 34:44.360
shit.

34:44.360 --> 34:54.240
I take you Lacey to be my bride and I want some robot parts inside.

34:54.240 --> 35:03.080
I want to take you down the aisle with super robot strength.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.080
Hold your hand.

35:04.080 --> 35:09.040
Try not to crush it.

35:09.040 --> 35:15.160
Thanks Luminous Electric for making me your robot man.

35:15.160 --> 35:19.040
Half love, half husband.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.040
All robot hero.

35:22.040 --> 35:25.360
Electro Brian.

35:25.360 --> 35:30.520
I said clap.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.680
Clap for me.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.680
Go crazy.

35:37.680 --> 35:44.520
So thanks to Electro Brian and Luminous Electric and the wonderful Lacey Harbour, soon to be

35:44.520 --> 35:48.680
Lacey Smith, for taking everybody to the money zone.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.840
We got a- I got a question here.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.360
I'm a graduating high school senior.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.080
I don't want to go to my ceremony.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.560
The reason is that I have not made any good memories in high school.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.600
When I look at all these people, I think about how horrible some of them treated me.

36:00.600 --> 36:04.600
Some of my old best friends have ganged up with me a lot last year and bullied me saying

36:04.600 --> 36:11.120
backhanded comments all the time like I'm ugly and they act like I was beneath them.

36:11.120 --> 36:15.920
Our school said that if it's all right if we don't want to walk the stage, but I know

36:15.920 --> 36:18.200
that graduating is a big deal to my parents.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.160
I don't know how to tell them that I don't want to go.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.960
I don't know what excuse to make up.

36:22.960 --> 36:27.360
Should I just not go and tell them I forgot?

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
Hey mom and dad.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.360
Oops.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.360
Was that today?

36:30.360 --> 36:31.360
Was that today?

36:31.360 --> 36:35.160
That's from Kelly in California.

36:35.160 --> 36:42.720
You already dropped- I know you already dropped a hundo on your Jostens robe like-

36:42.720 --> 36:45.320
Yeah you had- Did all three of us walk?

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
Did you walk?

36:46.320 --> 36:47.320
Yeah.

36:47.320 --> 36:48.320
I didn't walk in high school.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.320
I didn't walk in college.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.320
It took me five years to get through.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.480
I wasn't going to be like I finally did it mom and dad.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.120
I got my acting degree in five years.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.120
I did it.

36:57.120 --> 37:02.280
I think that this is one of those things that I look back- I'm glad that I did everything

37:02.280 --> 37:06.800
that I could in high school so I don't look back and go man I wish I'd gone to prom or

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
I wish I'd walked the stage.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.680
You did all of the requisite high school-y shit.

37:10.680 --> 37:11.680
Yes.

37:11.680 --> 37:17.440
What I'm saying is there's no sense in skipping this similar experience that is just like

37:17.440 --> 37:19.760
this one time it'll happen to you.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.760
Yes.

37:20.760 --> 37:24.000
You can be snarky about it but it is a big deal.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.280
Like graduating high school is a big deal.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.280
Yeah.

37:27.280 --> 37:31.960
Yeah and it is a big deal and you know like don't think of it as like I'm going to miss

37:31.960 --> 37:33.600
high school so much.

37:33.600 --> 37:41.580
Think of it as you rose above these fucking assholes who are trying to keep you down and

37:41.580 --> 37:46.360
you're about to go into college where everything is cool or go into the real world where everything

37:46.360 --> 37:50.240
is equally cool and nothing sucks as bad as what you just went through.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.120
You know that's a great- like Kelly it ain't about them.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.240
Yeah it's about you.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.240
You fucking did it.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.240
It's about you.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.240
You did it.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.240
You killed it.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.560
You- you know like they tried to keep you down and you fucking won.

38:01.560 --> 38:05.600
You know what the high school graduation rate is in this country right now?

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
It's like eight.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.600
It's like eight percent.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.380
It's like eight percent and Kelly you beat the odds.

38:10.380 --> 38:13.760
You're not in that nine- that's the stupid 92 they call it.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.640
You're not- you're not in that group.

38:15.640 --> 38:19.120
You're- you're uh- you're- you're going for it.

38:19.120 --> 38:24.860
You're going for uh- it's like you- you set your mind on a goal much like Captain Jack

38:24.860 --> 38:29.320
Sparrow set his mind on the goal of retrieving the black pearl and now you've got your black

38:29.320 --> 38:33.120
pearl so you're going to walk across the stage and take your- take your victory lap.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.120
You did it.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.120
And shoot Barbossa.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.120
Shoot Barbossa.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.120
On the stage.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
Only-

38:38.120 --> 38:39.120
Metaphorically speaking.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.120
Metaphorically speaking shoot Barbossa when he's flesh.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.120
Not flesh man.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.320
Take a gold piece.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.520
Take the bloom from the cursed chest.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.520
Yep.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.520
Gain-

38:47.520 --> 38:48.520
Get the zombie monkey.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.520
Gain immortal life.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.560
Like what else do you need to know?

38:51.560 --> 38:55.800
Also it- also this is really special to your parents and it's one of the- there are things

38:55.800 --> 39:00.920
in your life that you will always be faced with like this is something you are doing

39:00.920 --> 39:05.120
for them and for you but not for your asshole ex friends and those people.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
No.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
This is for you and your parents.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.120
I'm saying fuck your parents.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.120
I'm saying this is Kelly time.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.120
This is Kelly time.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.800
I'm saying you get on that stage and you let everyone know how you feel about them.

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
Like-

39:14.800 --> 39:16.800
And maybe give your principal an extra hard handshake.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.800
Give him a handshake and-

39:17.800 --> 39:18.800
Nothing big.

39:18.800 --> 39:19.800
Just like-

39:19.800 --> 39:22.960
Turn towards all of your shitty classmates and just get your dick out and be like bite

39:22.960 --> 39:23.960
it.

39:23.960 --> 39:24.960
And it'd be like bite this wiener.

39:24.960 --> 39:25.960
No.

39:25.960 --> 39:26.960
No.

39:26.960 --> 39:27.960
Not this at all.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
You gotta do something like super memorable that'll get on TV and everything.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.320
How is that not memorable?

39:31.320 --> 39:35.480
Just turn around and be like make sure to listen to my brother when my brother meets

39:35.480 --> 39:36.480
at mpnbam.com.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
Goodbye.

39:37.480 --> 39:42.760
And maybe just yell San Dimas high school football rules.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.000
So Kelly this is for you.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
It's not about them.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Fuck those guys.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.320
This is your time and you won.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.800
You succeeded.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.400
You triumphed.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
And now it's time to-

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
Oh my god.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.520
Shit is about to get so good for you.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.520
Oh Kelly.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.840
The next four years of your life is gonna absolutely rule.

39:59.840 --> 40:02.320
A switch is about to flip.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.440
A rad switch.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.120
An awesome switch.

40:05.120 --> 40:09.960
So guys I was reading Cosmo like I do.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.580
Like you do.

40:11.580 --> 40:14.080
And I bypassed.

40:14.080 --> 40:17.980
There was one article that I really wanted to read and it was 17 things you don't know

40:17.980 --> 40:23.320
about your vagina because it sounded mysterious and I want to know what my vagina's up to.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.160
But I bypassed that through 25 surprising things that turned men on.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.160
Okay.

40:28.160 --> 40:33.960
Now the terrible stupid thing that Cosmo has done here is they asked guys to submit them

40:33.960 --> 40:35.400
on Twitter.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
Okay.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.080
So these are straight up submissions.

40:38.080 --> 40:42.680
Before we start can I say that the thing that turns me on most in this world is exploring

40:42.680 --> 40:44.440
the secrets of the vagina.

40:44.440 --> 40:47.600
The 17 dark secrets.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.440
What your vagina does when you're not around.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.120
Some of my favorites on this list.

40:53.120 --> 40:57.520
Number two is that early in the morning or tired at night phone voice.

40:57.520 --> 41:02.600
Which translates to me of like can we please just go to bed.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.600
Why are you up so early?

41:03.600 --> 41:04.600
Daniel.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.600
Daniel.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.120
I'm secretly turning you on.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.120
Number three.

41:10.120 --> 41:14.900
Girls who swim.

41:14.900 --> 41:15.960
Like mermaids.

41:15.960 --> 41:16.960
I guess.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.720
She's moist all the time.

41:18.720 --> 41:19.720
She smells like chlorine.

41:19.720 --> 41:20.720
I love it.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.880
She's the best.

41:21.880 --> 41:22.880
Number eight.

41:22.880 --> 41:23.880
All caps.

41:23.880 --> 41:24.880
Paying for your own dinner.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.720
Got a major boner.

41:27.720 --> 41:31.680
She pulls out that visa and this boner just jumps right off.

41:31.680 --> 41:36.560
You should see when the when the guy at Chili's is like is this together or separate she's

41:36.560 --> 41:40.440
like together but he's with me.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.920
I'm using my early in the morning voice.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.900
These are number these are okay these aren't things dudes like about women right.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.120
These are turn ons.

41:48.120 --> 41:53.080
These are I am getting I'm getting I am I am made erotic by this.

41:53.080 --> 41:57.800
I am I am eroticized when you pay at Chili's.

like weird characters I'm not gonna get into it Sarah asks is is my we didn't start the

46:18.800 --> 46:27.240
fire continuation decent okay like it says decent I know it's not good and some parts

46:27.240 --> 46:33.760
don't flow well but that's okay it's supposed to be 1990 through 2009 I don't know a lot

46:33.760 --> 46:41.360
about the 1990s so there's a little lack of that or you ready what universes are you ready

46:41.360 --> 46:45.920

46:58.760 --> 47:07.760
Wi-Fi eBay Dan Brown Sarah Palin global warming Madonna internet marijuana Obama Titanic

47:07.760 --> 47:14.840
Harry Potter organic steroids animation cell phones immigration Facebook Walmart Google

47:14.840 --> 47:27.640
modern art he called I bird flu Michael Jackson new Hans Zimmer Green Day Guantanamo Bay hold

47:27.640 --> 47:35.800
on did you see Lewis gossett did I hear equal I bird poop in there equal I bird flu bird

47:35.800 --> 47:42.560
bird flu what was no did they say Lewis gossett I don't think they said Lewis gossett can

47:42.560 --> 47:48.680
you can you elucidate the last stanza for me again equal I bird flu Michael Jackson

47:48.680 --> 47:54.880
who knew Hans Zimmer Green Day Guantanamo Bay okay all right hold on who knew what who

47:54.880 --> 48:02.280
knew what I guess that Michael Jackson was gonna die and if that is the case then everybody

48:02.280 --> 48:09.080
okay I wouldn't my bigger problem with this is not about the flow of her lyrics but more

48:09.080 --> 48:15.040
do we live in a world where this gets updated like the encyclopedia like at the end of a

48:15.040 --> 48:19.080
decade it's like well we need to go back and add a couple stanzas by the end of time we

48:19.080 --> 48:24.360
didn't start the fire is gonna be eight hours yeah it's gonna be an epic poem written by

48:24.360 --> 48:28.960
poet laureate Billy Joel I'm glad I'm glad somebody's stepping up here because yeah like

48:28.960 --> 48:33.720
I don't want our school kids to be like and then in the year was 1990 and after that there

48:33.720 --> 48:38.680
is no more history I mean Sarah touches on some good points here I mean definitely definitely

48:38.680 --> 48:44.600
CSI and Twin Towers and Wi-Fi should all be sandwiched together like that pretty much

48:44.600 --> 48:49.840
they're pretty much like the same level of stuff right Dan Brown definitely deserves

48:49.840 --> 48:57.720
to be remembered for and Hans Zimmer wait Hans Zimmer you know and Harry Potter's in

48:57.720 --> 49:03.480
there potters in there he's up with that that's a revolution that's fresh that's great Hans

49:03.480 --> 49:11.320
Zimmer like what what what what what what contribution of Hans Zimmer's are you are

49:11.320 --> 49:17.760
you honoring here like that did you feel is it oh I know excuse me he did the motion picture

49:17.760 --> 49:23.180
soundtrack for Pirates of the Caribbean on stranger so that that that makes perfect sense

49:23.180 --> 49:29.040
he did that OST so yeah I mean what what what are we forgetting here there's got to be some

49:29.040 --> 49:36.040
other important events like Iraq Afghanistan something like that Pirates of the Caribbean

49:36.040 --> 49:45.640
on Stranger's Tide Iraq Afghanistan Pirates of the Caribbean how about Robert Downey Jr's

49:45.640 --> 49:51.080
return to the screen that's pretty big deal Robert Downey Jr's return to the screen like

49:51.080 --> 49:56.080
I don't think so now what about Grey's Anatomy and then the spin-off Private Practice let's

49:56.080 --> 50:02.920
here's what's it I'm looking through this and I think my problem isn't my problem is

50:02.920 --> 50:11.220
what didn't make the cut so like oh Dan Brown made it but not Hurricane Katrina like uh-huh

50:11.220 --> 50:19.480
yeah so Sarah Palin is up in the mix not 9-eleven though so yeah well she said Twin Towers and

50:19.480 --> 50:25.400
that sort of shorthand for 9-eleven never forget Twin Towers it could be see it could

50:25.400 --> 50:35.040
be referring to the second Lord of the Rings movie it cannot no it could not Grey's Anatomy

50:35.040 --> 50:42.080
is made for you Kung Fu Panda one and two there I think that's better because it gets

50:42.080 --> 50:45.800
some like super important cultural stuff I think that it would be better if it was all

50:45.800 --> 50:52.000
just not like what happened in the world but like a personal recount of your 1990 to 2009

50:52.000 --> 50:57.520
so it's like met a guy we broke up went to dinner met some people then I went to college

50:57.520 --> 51:01.400
and it was pretty cool and it was just like a personal telling of stuff that happened

51:01.400 --> 51:05.240
in your life can you explain to me the sort of sliding scale that puts going to dinner

51:05.240 --> 51:09.040
with some people and graduating college on the same import like it's a good dinner it

51:09.040 --> 51:16.600
wasn't it wasn't a very good college it was a very good verse it was mostly a party school

51:16.600 --> 51:23.600
