WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:48.080
Welcome, my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:48.080 --> 00:51.920
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and I'm doing this one shirtless.

00:54.640 --> 01:00.080
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm wearing multiple shirts to make up for that fact.

01:00.080 --> 01:09.680
I am your baby brother, Griffin McElroy, and I am talking to you with my wiener.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.120
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.880
You're not curious about that at all. You're already moving on. You don't want to know how

01:14.880 --> 01:15.920
it's working.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.040
I don't want to think about it.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.160
Is it like a ventriloquist, puppetry of the penis kind of thing?

01:20.160 --> 01:21.600
I can't do this with you.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.920
It's sort of, it is sort of puppetry of the penis. Yes, Travis, except it's very,

01:25.920 --> 01:32.400
it's a very literal translation of that idea. Let's just say I've been working on my urethra

01:32.400 --> 01:34.560
control. Justin, you want to keep going or?

01:34.560 --> 01:36.000
Yeah, I'm just gonna, okay.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.960
Ladies, let me paint you a picture.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.400
I have just arrived from the shower. I've got my two tight Levi's on.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.880
My hair is still dripping wet.

01:46.880 --> 01:53.040
Uh, do you guys, you guys know Joe Mangliano, the, uh, the, the werewolf from True Blood?

01:53.040 --> 01:54.960
Are you talking about this?

01:54.960 --> 01:59.200
Imagine, imagine him, except now imagine Joe Pantliano from The Matrix.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.680
That's what you're getting right now.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.280
Or perhaps actress Tea Eliano.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.320
Or perhaps Chuck Mangione.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.240
Imagine Luigi and Mario.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.000
Combined into one horrible person.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.760
Just arms and legs and mustaches everywhere. That's me right now.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.400
This is an advice show for the modern era where we take your quandaries

02:22.400 --> 02:28.880
and we turn them alchemy-like into, into wisdom and knowledge and, and I think growth.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.720
I think that's really our, our sort of focus has been in 2012 is growth.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.120
I want everyone to better themselves and I want to be the vehicle upon which

02:37.120 --> 02:39.440
you ride to betterness town.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.960
We want to be the hoverboard that you take to better city.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.280
That was the, uh, that was actually the title of Joel Osteen's last book.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.640
What's the hoverboard you take to-

02:48.640 --> 02:53.600
Don't get fucking brainy with us trying to say names that you think people know.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.040
No, he's the religious guy.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.640
He's the, he's the mega preacher.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.320
So is he, oh, so he's like the, the religious version of like Malcolm Gladwell or-

03:02.320 --> 03:05.520
No, he's the religious version of Tony Robbins, basically.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.240
Tony Robbins is, is anti-religion?

03:08.240 --> 03:10.720
No, Tony Robbins teaches you to believe in yourself.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.720
And Joel Osteen teaches you that God believes enough for the both of you.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.960
There's a tiny God inside of you that you should also believe in.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.920
Does he have giant teeth?

03:21.280 --> 03:22.400
They all do.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.920
You really can't be a leader of men without big, big chompers.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.600
That is leadership.

03:30.240 --> 03:36.880
I'm surprised that we, the vehicle that we used to start the show wasn't my recent engagement.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.400
It's not like I get that it's like already old news, I guess, for you guys.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.120
Well, you were keeping, I thought you were keeping it like a secret.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.920
I mean, like you haven't gotten it to social media.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.400
Well, just because I haven't tweet blasted it,

03:48.400 --> 03:51.520
you think I'm fucking ashamed of my, of my new bride-to-be?

03:51.520 --> 03:54.400
You're saying this is an exclusive for NBNB AM listeners.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.320
Oh, we're dropping this bomb.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.600
Sorry, ladies.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.160
Heart's broken.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.200
Sorry, ladies.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.880
The whole crew is taken.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.200
And suddenly a gasp went out from across the land.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.080
Sorry, ladies and so inclined dudes.

04:08.080 --> 04:08.960
Well, there's more than a few.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.440
And over affectionate dogs.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.040
Well, I'll take it where I can get it, I guess.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.680
Are you saying what I think you're saying, Travis?

04:15.680 --> 04:19.840
Listen, dogs won't fuck this.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.120
I can't say, I can't like, I am flattered.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.600
That's all I'm going to say about the matter is that I'm flattered.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.120
But no, but I can't anymore.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.920
Legally, I legally can't or else she will take me.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.200
She will take everything.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.000
You've built something.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.280
You're trying to build something.

04:35.280 --> 04:35.840
We're trying to build something.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.920
I told you not to sign that pre preenup.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.600
Yeah, it's a pre pre.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.400
And it is, let's just say, it does not favor this guy.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.120
Let's just say, if shit go rough, I'm going to need a place to crash for a while.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.320
I got a fruit on, so.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.160
Pardon?

04:52.160 --> 04:54.080
You know you're going to have to explain what that is, right?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.760
Like, why did you even pause?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.200
It's a fruit on that I left an apple on for you to eat.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.720
So there's literally fruit on it.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.240
Continental breakfast, baby.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.120
If you're good, you get a croissant there.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.560
Where?

05:08.560 --> 05:11.760
We're registered at Bath and Body Works, if you want to.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.480
Just Bath and Body Works?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.680
Just Bath and Body Works, yeah.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.280
Both of our skin is just so fucking ashy.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.560
Like, we need it.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.080
You should have gone to Bed and Breakfast and Bath and Body Works and beyond.

05:28.080 --> 05:28.480
The quint.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.440
The quintuple, big.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.240
You should have gone to Better Business Bureau, Bed Bath Works and beyond.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.280
I had all these goos prepared to talk about it.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.520
Like, how I proposed to her by firing her ring at her from a t-shirt cannon.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.960
She was tragically killed, and now she's on the mark again.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.280
I had to dig it out of her arm, but it was very romantic after that.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.400
After that one hiccup.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.800
I feel like this is going to be a really good one.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.680
I think shirt, maybe I've been, by doing it shirted for so long,

06:01.680 --> 06:06.160
that I've been hiding my lighter under a bushel a little bit.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.000
Yeah, I think so too.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.880
But when I'm around, if you could keep that bushel on hand still,

06:13.680 --> 06:14.640
that would be great for me.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.360
Well, I don't want to expel all my energy.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.960
Hey, let's get into some advice here.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.840
I want to help some people.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.040
Congratulations, Griffin.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.240
Oh, thanks, brothers.

06:22.240 --> 06:22.880
Oh, God.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.960
I don't need to congratulate you on our program.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.840
I did it in, like, real life in a private ceremony.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.480
Millions of people didn't fucking hear that, Justin.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.000
I want them to know that you approve.

06:33.040 --> 06:33.760
Okay, okay.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.680
Millions?

06:35.680 --> 06:36.320
Yeah.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.440
You're assuming that, like, after our crime spree,

06:39.440 --> 06:43.040
profilers by the millions are going to return to these clips

06:43.040 --> 06:44.960
and look for clues that they missed along the way.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.000
Once my episode of Doomsday Preppers goes live,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.840
like, my Google profile is going to explode.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.640
I can't keep up with all these alerts.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.400
I'm getting Google alerts daily.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.600
Thank you, Doomsday Preppers.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.680
I really hitched it.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.640
Hey, Griffin.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.360
Hey, what?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.840
I just want to say I'm very proud of you and congratulations.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.040
Yeah, I love you.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.960
Well, thank you, Travis.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.200
Justin, it just feels kind of, it feels a little...

07:09.200 --> 07:10.320
A little hollow.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.240
Feels a little forced at this point.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.920
I shouldn't really have to ask for it.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.280
Have you guys decided what reality TV shows

07:17.280 --> 07:18.880
you're going to be participating in?

07:18.880 --> 07:19.840
Are we going to go...

07:19.840 --> 07:20.480
Great question.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.880
Say Yes to the Dress, Amazing Race,

07:22.880 --> 07:24.160
Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.000
I'm doing, actually, O3 Weddings.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.200
What's three weddings?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.560
Three weddings that you've never seen

07:30.560 --> 07:33.120
where three different women are getting married

07:33.120 --> 07:34.880
and then they go to each other's weddings,

07:34.880 --> 07:36.240
or is it like four weddings?

07:36.240 --> 07:36.960
I don't know.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.920
There's multiple weddings,

07:37.920 --> 07:39.360
and then they judge each other's weddings,

07:39.360 --> 07:42.240
and then whoever they decide had the best wedding

07:42.240 --> 07:43.200
gets a free honeymoon.

07:43.200 --> 07:43.700
Hmm.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.280
That really is quite atrocious, but...

07:47.280 --> 07:50.400
I was thinking we would just do Doomsday Preppers,

07:50.400 --> 07:51.600
but like a wedding edition.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.520
Oh, so romantic.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.600
So like, maybe we could plan on getting married

07:55.600 --> 07:57.200
right on December 23rd.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.360
Right on December 21st, 2012.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.760
And then like, just sort of get ready for old Quetzie

08:03.760 --> 08:06.080
to come out of the ground and swallow his whole.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.520
But like, maybe we do it romantically planning around that.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.880
19 days left, people.

08:10.880 --> 08:11.680
19 days left.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.880
What if we mount him and ride him into the heavens

08:15.520 --> 08:16.000
with our love?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.840
Now that would be a truly...

08:17.840 --> 08:19.920
That's technically eloping, I think.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.640
I think so too.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.520
Let's get into the advice.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.320
Let's get into the questions.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.040
I'm ready to help.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.680
I have a coworker who has a language issue.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.280
He seems to think the phrase...

08:30.960 --> 08:31.460
Okay.

08:32.080 --> 08:32.580
Okay.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.040
He seems to...

08:36.400 --> 08:38.080
God, you are 14 years old.

08:39.120 --> 08:39.920
Okay, I can do this.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.400
I can do this.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.520
He seems to think the phrase blow my load

08:43.520 --> 08:46.560
means the same as the phrase blow my top.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.120
He uses it frequently to describe when he feels angry.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.240
Needless to say, I'll find this hilarious,

08:54.240 --> 08:55.920
but I don't want him to hurt his career

08:55.920 --> 08:58.000
with the use of this phrase.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.880
Should I ruin this beautiful situation by telling him

09:00.880 --> 09:03.040
or keep it a secret until he gets old?

09:03.040 --> 09:05.120
That's from Amused in New Orleans.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.920
Is it possible that your coworker

09:09.920 --> 09:12.720
just finds really random shit erotic?

09:12.720 --> 09:13.220
Yeah.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.760
I swear to God, if the boss tells me

09:15.760 --> 09:18.240
to finish our report sooner one more time,

09:18.240 --> 09:19.360
I'm gonna blow my load.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.040
Maybe he's like a very...

09:21.040 --> 09:23.360
He's a weird sort of like S&M guy

09:23.360 --> 09:27.200
where it's not like he wants a lady to step on his balls.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.720
He just kind of wants the printer to act up, you know?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.520
He kind of just wants to, you know,

09:33.520 --> 09:34.640
forget his lunch at home.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.920
Carlene, if you don't get back in here

09:41.920 --> 09:44.720
and make a pot of coffee after you finished it,

09:45.440 --> 09:48.880
I'm gonna blow my load all over, all over the place.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.500
Carlene.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.340
Oh, God. I don't have anybody like this in my life.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.220
You understand that this person is a unicorn

09:57.220 --> 09:58.820
and this thing doesn't really happen.

09:58.820 --> 10:01.460
It only happens in American Pie movies.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.580
Why the fuck would you ruin it by telling them?

10:04.580 --> 10:06.820
Yeah, you are currently working

10:06.820 --> 10:10.180
with a mid-90s S&L Rob Schneider character

10:10.180 --> 10:15.380
and you need to just keep that roll rolling, you know?

10:15.380 --> 10:16.900
Keep it going.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.060
I'm also willing to bet that if you even like

10:19.060 --> 10:20.980
voice a concern about telling him,

10:20.980 --> 10:23.220
you will be swarmed by like 30 different people

10:23.220 --> 10:24.980
who've been like, Todd, you can't.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.420
Todd, you can't tell him.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.860
This is all I've got, Todd.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.140
My family life is shit.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.540
Think about this, Amuse in New Orleans.

10:31.540 --> 10:36.660
If some other crankster had come along

10:36.660 --> 10:39.060
and fixed this before you got to it,

10:39.780 --> 10:41.380
we would never have heard of it.

10:41.380 --> 10:42.980
Think about that for a second.

10:43.620 --> 10:44.340
That's true.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.700
And it wouldn't have brought joy to my life.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.340
Also think about the fact that if you talk to this guy,

10:48.340 --> 10:52.100
that's gonna be in the Guinness Book of World Records

10:52.100 --> 10:54.580
for the shittiest conversation ever.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.220
Cause it's gonna go, hey, Todd,

10:57.220 --> 11:00.100
that thing you've been saying, it means coming.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.860
And then he's gonna fall to his knees

11:03.860 --> 11:06.420
and he's gonna lash himself.

11:06.420 --> 11:07.220
Here's the thing.

11:07.220 --> 11:10.980
If you tell him, if you're the guy who tells him,

11:10.980 --> 11:15.860
you are immediately responsible for every single time

11:15.860 --> 11:18.420
he has said that and you have not corrected him.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.100
Oh, great point, Justin.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.380
Cause he's gonna sit there and think,

11:21.380 --> 11:25.860
well, I said it to you when the boss's niece was around

11:25.860 --> 11:27.300
and you didn't say shit.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.140
You just let me keep saying it.

11:29.140 --> 11:30.100
What's the matter with you?

11:30.100 --> 11:33.380
Oh, hey, by the way, it means coming.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.380
It does mean coming, sir.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.660
If everybody doesn't know.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.140
I mean, they know.

11:42.980 --> 11:44.900
Everybody but this gentleman knows it.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.300
Everybody except this gentleman has read 50 Shades of Grey.

11:48.020 --> 11:50.740
And that's all they say in that book is like.

11:51.860 --> 11:53.220
I'm gonna go blow my load.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.500
Blowing my load.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
But they also use it inappropriately too.

11:57.140 --> 11:59.060
So the woman will actually say,

11:59.060 --> 12:02.180
oh, Christian, blow my load all over the place.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.060
That doesn't, I don't understand.

12:05.060 --> 12:08.420
Well, I've seen a few videos.

12:08.420 --> 12:13.300
Sorry, Nani.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.300
How about a Yahoo?

12:17.300 --> 12:18.340
Yeah, I'll give you Yahoo.

12:19.220 --> 12:19.860
It's Yahoo.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.300
I didn't mean to say that so sexually.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.580
Why is it all getting dirty?

12:22.580 --> 12:23.300
I don't know.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.180
Let's get innocent.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.780
Let's revive the innocence.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.380
This one was sent in by Steve Lewis.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.260
Thank you, Steve.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.740
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Boris, who asks,

12:34.180 --> 12:36.660
can doctors do plastic surgery on animals?

12:36.660 --> 12:39.860
I would like to make my cat look more Garfield.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.340
He's already a ginger tomcat,

12:44.820 --> 12:48.980
but all it would require would be some large cheek implants

12:48.980 --> 12:51.540
and he would be the pitting image of Garfield.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.740
What would this sort of surgery cost?

12:55.780 --> 12:56.500
Your soul.

12:57.220 --> 12:57.940
Yeah, really.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.260
And also more importantly, your cat's life

13:00.260 --> 13:03.140
because no way would a cat survive that.

13:03.140 --> 13:07.460
It is becoming more of a thing.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.780
People are getting into it.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.580
For instance, if your dog has a lot of sagging

13:14.580 --> 13:19.860
and their skin is covering their eyes from all the sagging,

13:20.660 --> 13:23.700
then you can get that fixed.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.340
I swear, I saw a Sharpay the other day.

13:26.340 --> 13:27.540
It looked like Joan Rivers.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.700
It was horrifying.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.020
Okay.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.660
Also, then you got nauticals.

13:32.660 --> 13:33.140
What about that?

13:33.140 --> 13:34.820
That's pet plastic surgery, right?

13:34.820 --> 13:36.740
I don't know what you're, I don't know what you're saying.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.740
Well, you put balls on their fingers.

13:38.740 --> 13:43.220
No, nauticals are when you give them testicular implants

13:43.220 --> 13:45.220
after you remove their nudes.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.300
Why does it have such an adorable name?

13:47.300 --> 13:50.500
I know, they sound, here's my problem, they sound delicious.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.580
If you give me a ranch flavor nautical,

13:52.580 --> 13:54.180
I might actually go to town on that.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.460
If you can give me cool ranch.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.140
Yeah, I went to Macaroni Grill

13:57.140 --> 14:00.500
and they had a special for endless bowl of nauticals.

14:01.060 --> 14:01.860
It was delicious.

14:02.820 --> 14:05.860
Justin, if I came home for the holidays to your house

14:06.660 --> 14:09.300
and your cat turned around at me

14:09.300 --> 14:12.980
and it had a pure like Garfield face,

14:12.980 --> 14:15.140
like from the CGI Garfield movie,

14:16.340 --> 14:19.380
there would be a Griffin shaped hole in your wall.

14:19.380 --> 14:19.860
Adios.

14:19.860 --> 14:24.420
It would be like, hi, every, why?

14:24.420 --> 14:26.180
And I wouldn't be there anymore.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.140
I wouldn't be there anymore.

14:27.140 --> 14:29.060
And I would never be there ever again.

14:29.060 --> 14:32.420
Does this gentleman, Boris not realize

14:32.420 --> 14:35.380
that when he does this for the rest of his cat's

14:35.380 --> 14:38.580
brief horrible life, every time somebody sees it

14:38.580 --> 14:39.860
and goes, what the fuck?

14:39.860 --> 14:41.380
He's like, yeah, I had those put in.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.300
That's gonna end that friendship or whatever it is.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.140
The mailman will no longer come by.

14:47.140 --> 14:48.580
He'll probably be taken to prison.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.220
Also, I think that the surgery,

14:52.180 --> 14:53.860
it would require some maintenance

14:53.860 --> 14:56.660
because I'm pretty sure that we would be dealing with a like

14:56.660 --> 15:00.820
Rocky from mask scenario within days.

15:01.700 --> 15:02.820
Yeah, they'll scratch there.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.460
They scratch there.

15:05.460 --> 15:08.820
What if they scratch their implant

15:08.820 --> 15:10.580
and then it leaks all over the place?

15:10.580 --> 15:11.460
You gotta clean that up.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.260
That's another mess.

15:12.260 --> 15:13.620
Aren't cats enough hassle?

15:13.620 --> 15:16.100
Better yet, what kind of back alley veterinarian

15:16.100 --> 15:17.700
do you think you're gonna find is gonna be like,

15:17.700 --> 15:18.580
what do you wanna do?

15:18.580 --> 15:19.220
Okay, cool.

15:19.220 --> 15:22.740
Okay, you wanna put a fake voice box in,

15:22.740 --> 15:24.420
make him sound like a Lorenzo music?

15:24.420 --> 15:25.060
I can hear that.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.540
I can adjust his taste buds,

15:27.540 --> 15:29.460
make him just crave lasagna if you want.

15:29.460 --> 15:29.940
Fuck it.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.620
Yeah, my cat and I are going through

15:35.620 --> 15:37.460
a several year long procedure

15:38.020 --> 15:40.260
to make him more like Garfield.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.180
He's got a plastic Garfield face surgery.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.500
I give him electroshock therapy one day of the week.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.860
I will let you guess which day.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.540
You can probably suss it out.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.860
Well, I gave him the shock collar

15:53.860 --> 15:55.940
so every time my dog Odie comes around,

15:55.940 --> 15:57.700
I hit it just so he gets a nice,

15:57.700 --> 16:00.820
you know, nice intolerance towards the dog.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.740
I'm currently getting iris removal

16:02.740 --> 16:07.620
so I more resemble the character that owns him.

16:08.180 --> 16:13.220
I have also broken up with my longtime girlfriend

16:13.220 --> 16:14.820
so I am terribly alone.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.420
And I dyed the lady cat next door pink

16:18.420 --> 16:22.900
so I might be arrested for that one.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.820
I know too much about Garfield.

16:24.820 --> 16:25.380
Garfield.

16:25.380 --> 16:32.820
Why is Garfield so funny,

16:33.940 --> 16:41.700
but not in any way that his creator can harness?

16:42.980 --> 16:46.340
Why is everyone else able to make Garfield funny,

16:46.340 --> 16:49.460
but somehow the ability to elude it

16:49.460 --> 16:53.620
escapes Jim Davis daily seven times a day.

16:53.620 --> 16:58.100
This motherfucker can't get the funniest strip correct.

16:58.100 --> 17:04.100
He is unable to see what he has made and use it for good.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.100
It's one of those things where Garfield minus Garfield

17:06.100 --> 17:07.620
is like some of the funniest shit around,

17:07.620 --> 17:09.540
but if he had just drawn that strip,

17:10.740 --> 17:12.980
it would have been fucking mind-blowingly terrible.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.140
Ultimately, the comedy that we find in it

17:15.140 --> 17:18.260
is a direct result of Jim Davis's impotence.

17:18.260 --> 17:20.500
Right, his inability.

17:21.220 --> 17:21.940
Right, exactly.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.580
If he were more competent as an artist or creator,

17:25.140 --> 17:28.420
then we wouldn't be, but see like, okay,

17:28.420 --> 17:30.020
you look at Garfield minus Garfield

17:30.020 --> 17:33.140
or really any sort of deconstructionist Garfield rap

17:33.140 --> 17:33.940
that we have done,

17:35.140 --> 17:37.220
if Jim Davis had the artistic ability

17:38.420 --> 17:39.940
to kill his little darlings,

17:39.940 --> 17:42.020
to have the sort of foresight,

17:42.020 --> 17:44.100
that scalpel, that artistic scalpel

17:44.100 --> 17:47.140
to cut away the inessentials of his comedy,

17:47.140 --> 17:49.860
he could be one of the great ones.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.540
Excuse me, Bill Watterson.

17:51.540 --> 17:54.980
He could be the greatest comic artist of all time,

17:54.980 --> 17:56.420
but he is unable.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.420
He cannot see beyond his mediocrity.

17:58.420 --> 18:01.780
But in a way though, isn't that his legacy?

18:02.820 --> 18:04.020
I'm saying it's intentional.

18:04.020 --> 18:06.660
I'm saying that Garfield, people wouldn't be talking,

18:06.660 --> 18:09.060
Garfield wouldn't be as relevant as it is today,

18:09.060 --> 18:11.540
which is to say incredibly relevant.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.020
Sure, yeah.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.580
If it was just like, if it was the funniest thing ever,

18:14.580 --> 18:16.100
if it was Mad TV, you know?

18:17.540 --> 18:18.500
Wait, excuse me?

18:19.780 --> 18:21.220
That's a whole different rabbit hole.

18:21.220 --> 18:22.660
I don't want to go down right now.

18:22.660 --> 18:26.980
If it was the funniest thing ever, a la Mad TV,

18:26.980 --> 18:28.420
then people wouldn't be talking about it

18:28.420 --> 18:29.700
because there would be nothing to say,

18:29.700 --> 18:31.540
except did you see the latest Garfield?

18:31.540 --> 18:32.900
And people would say yes and say,

18:32.900 --> 18:35.060
I laughed so hard that I forgot to feed my kids.

18:36.820 --> 18:41.060
Here's the Garfield Wikipedia page

18:41.060 --> 18:43.460
has actually been locked by Wikipedia

18:43.460 --> 18:45.460
because of quote frequent vandalism.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.660
It is a serious problem for the Garfield Wikipedia home.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.860
I think he's great.

18:53.860 --> 18:56.420
Hey, listen, I love Garfield.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.140
There it is.

18:57.140 --> 18:59.060
Hey, and also I have another thing.

18:59.060 --> 19:02.260
My husband often makes plans that include me

19:02.260 --> 19:06.020
and are at our house, but doesn't let me know of said plans.

19:06.020 --> 19:10.660
I always find out my slash our weekend plans from one of our friends.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.540
It's not that I don't want these plans to happen

19:13.540 --> 19:16.260
and I don't need or want him to feel like

19:16.260 --> 19:18.660
he has to ask me permission to arrange plans,

19:18.660 --> 19:20.500
but it would be nice to know from him,

19:20.500 --> 19:23.060
not a third party, what my weekend plans are.

19:23.780 --> 19:25.460
How do I approach this gently?

19:25.460 --> 19:29.620
That's from uninformed in Indianapolis.

19:31.140 --> 19:32.900
Why must it be gentle?

19:32.900 --> 19:34.020
Yeah, how about you say-

19:34.020 --> 19:36.820
I feel like you'd be completely just fine and going,

19:36.820 --> 19:38.100
hey Frank, what the fuck?

19:38.100 --> 19:41.860
Hey Frank, we were gonna go see fucking Argo this weekend, you dummy.

19:43.620 --> 19:47.940
I have the strangest feeling that maybe she has just told him

19:48.740 --> 19:51.860
by writing into their favorite comedy and rice podcast.

19:51.860 --> 19:52.420
Maybe.

19:52.420 --> 19:58.580
I am so tired of being a pawn in your people's romantic relationships.

19:59.220 --> 20:02.500
Stop using us to break bad news to your loved ones

20:02.500 --> 20:04.020
and just start communicating.

20:04.580 --> 20:05.700
How do you pull that off though?

20:05.700 --> 20:07.700
Cause we're like 20 minutes deep now.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.700
Do you think she just sat there for 20 minutes?

20:09.700 --> 20:13.140
Sort of fidgeting, like waiting, just like, oh, hold on.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.780
Something's gonna be really germane to where we are.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.220
Yeah, you also have to remember Justin,

20:17.220 --> 20:20.180
we get sent like 150 questions a week and we maybe do four.

20:20.740 --> 20:24.100
So that's really a Russian roulette style of breaking news

20:24.100 --> 20:25.940
cause after an hour and five minutes,

20:25.940 --> 20:28.660
usually if we haven't said it, you gotta turn to him and go,

20:28.660 --> 20:32.740
hey, by the way, tell me when you make fucking plans.

20:32.740 --> 20:33.940
We're gonna go see Argo.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.900
Why is he not making these plans with you?

20:36.900 --> 20:37.700
That's why I went.

20:37.700 --> 20:38.580
Uninformed?

20:38.580 --> 20:40.260
Why isn't it saying, what do you want?

20:40.260 --> 20:44.740
I understand being out in the world and you see some friends

20:44.740 --> 20:46.340
and they're like, hey, what are you up to this weekend?

20:46.340 --> 20:48.100
And you say, I don't know, let's hang out.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.180
You know, you guys can stop by

20:50.180 --> 20:52.020
and maybe play some cards or something.

20:52.020 --> 20:57.540
But then your next step is to call your SO and be like,

20:57.540 --> 21:00.580
hey honey, is this cool or should we figure something else out

21:00.580 --> 21:02.020
or what were you thinking?

21:02.020 --> 21:05.700
No one will leap to inconsiderate spousal behaviors

21:05.700 --> 21:07.780
defense quicker than Travis will.

21:08.740 --> 21:11.220
Travis needs to keep the bridge open

21:11.220 --> 21:14.660
for whatever sort of inappropriate conduct

21:14.660 --> 21:18.580
that he will employ in his own relationship.

21:19.620 --> 21:25.220
I just happen to be a proponent of being a part of a whole,

21:25.220 --> 21:28.260
you know, that you are a part of the relationship

21:28.260 --> 21:30.580
that does not mean you have to constantly answer to them.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.620
And she even says in the email

21:33.620 --> 21:35.700
that she doesn't need him to check in with her

21:35.700 --> 21:37.700
before he makes the plans.

21:37.700 --> 21:40.340
I'm just saying that he's skipping a very important step,

21:40.340 --> 21:43.540
which is like step two, tell her.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.700
Oh man, I hate plans.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.820
I hate them too.

21:46.820 --> 21:47.780
You hate plans?

21:47.780 --> 21:49.140
Oh, I hate plans.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.780
You know, life is what happens when you're making other,

21:51.780 --> 21:52.820
have you ever heard that?

21:52.820 --> 21:55.620
I've heard, well, you didn't finish this.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.660
Life is what happens when you're making.

21:59.460 --> 22:02.420
Life is what happens when you're making other plans.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.060
Think about it.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.980
Think about that for a second.

22:06.100 --> 22:06.660
That's horrible.

22:06.660 --> 22:06.980
That's a really dark tunnel.

22:06.980 --> 22:08.260
I hate plans, guys.

22:08.260 --> 22:13.140
If I know I have nothing can ruin a weekend faster for me

22:13.140 --> 22:14.660
than knowing I have plans.

22:15.860 --> 22:16.980
You know what always kills me?

22:16.980 --> 22:19.460
It's like I make the plans,

22:19.460 --> 22:21.700
say on a Thursday to do something Saturday

22:21.700 --> 22:23.300
and I'm like, yeah, okay, this is gonna be awesome.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.180
We're all gonna hang out.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.260
Then Friday, it's like, oh, we're doing that thing tomorrow.

22:26.260 --> 22:28.980
And it's always like 10 minutes before the event.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.220
Yes, and you're, oh, I don't wanna do this thing.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.340
I want you to stay home, watch Star Wars.

22:34.340 --> 22:34.900
I just got so comfortable.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.700
That happens to me for concerts.

22:38.660 --> 22:42.020
I always buy tickets for concerts months in advance

22:42.020 --> 22:43.140
and I look forward to them.

22:43.140 --> 22:47.540
And then the day of, maybe my tummy hurts

22:47.540 --> 22:50.180
and maybe we just started watching Battlestar Galactica again.

22:50.180 --> 22:54.020
And it's like, well, this is way better than the other thing.

22:55.380 --> 22:56.100
It really is.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.740
Concerts are an investment that really,

23:00.180 --> 23:01.860
I'm not sure they always pay off

23:02.980 --> 23:06.660
because it is just a constant stream of inconvenience

23:07.300 --> 23:12.260
for a moment when you lose yourself in the music.

23:12.260 --> 23:12.900
It really is.

23:12.900 --> 23:17.380
It really is out of control inconvenient to go to any shows like that.

23:17.380 --> 23:18.900
Any concert ever has been.

23:18.900 --> 23:22.340
What about an outdoor show where you have to park a hundred years away

23:22.340 --> 23:25.540
and walk with your bottle of wine in your chair?

23:25.540 --> 23:27.780
And they give you a fucking mason jar at the entrance

23:27.780 --> 23:28.980
that you have to poop and pee in

23:28.980 --> 23:30.820
because there's no bathrooms anywhere.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.060
And then imagine if you're like me

23:33.060 --> 23:35.860
and all the bands that you like also share a demographic

23:35.860 --> 23:39.060
with 50 year old rednecks who will smoke in your face

23:39.060 --> 23:41.620
and bump you and dump their beers on your blanket.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.660
Fortunately for you, Travis,

23:42.660 --> 23:44.900
the only artist that you like is Neil Diamond.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.060
That is not true.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.940
Once that is scratched- Neil Diamond and Journey and Stix.

23:49.940 --> 23:51.380
How many of those have you scratched off the list?

23:52.740 --> 23:54.020
I've seen Journey.

23:54.020 --> 23:54.260
Okay.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.740
I've not seen Neil Diamond.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.580
I had the opportunity in Dallas

23:58.580 --> 24:01.620
and tickets where I shit you not like $250 a piece.

24:01.620 --> 24:05.060
Man, that story about when Travis almost went and saw Neil Diamond

24:05.060 --> 24:06.740
is one of my favorite anecdotes.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.300
Did you meet him?

24:07.300 --> 24:08.740
I always think it's not gonna pay off.

24:08.740 --> 24:09.380
Did you meet him?

24:10.820 --> 24:11.860
Neil Diamond you say?

24:11.860 --> 24:13.620
Yeah, did you meet him at the concert you almost went to?

24:14.420 --> 24:15.540
I almost met him.

24:15.540 --> 24:17.300
I almost met him.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.740
I swear we were in the parking lot.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.900
I was standing on the hood of my car looking for him.

24:20.900 --> 24:21.940
He wasn't there.

24:21.940 --> 24:23.460
Well, that's a shame.

24:24.420 --> 24:27.140
That reminds me of the time I almost met Mitchell Musso

24:27.140 --> 24:29.140
from iCarly.

24:29.140 --> 24:29.540
Right.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.220
I wish you would stop mentioning names.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.060
He was at the Grove the day before I was.

24:35.060 --> 24:35.860
Oh, I see.

24:35.860 --> 24:37.780
Oh, you're like an almost name dropper.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.660
Yeah, Griffin and I almost met Tim Heidecker once

24:40.660 --> 24:42.420
because we saw Prometheus with him.

24:42.420 --> 24:43.940
And I got too nervous to talk to him.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.860
And we were too nervous to say hi.

24:45.860 --> 24:46.740
It was a great story.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.780
Oh, you should make plans to almost hang out with someone.

24:53.540 --> 24:55.220
We're planning on this weekend.

24:56.740 --> 24:59.700
You guys should almost come over

24:59.700 --> 25:01.380
and we should almost go see Argo.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.620
But at the last minute, we should blow it off,

25:03.620 --> 25:05.140
get some Thai food and stay at home.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.060
Or like we should make plans,

25:07.060 --> 25:09.060
but you thought we were going to the five o'clock one

25:09.060 --> 25:10.820
and we thought we were going to the seven o'clock one

25:10.820 --> 25:13.060
and we almost watched the same movie together.

25:13.060 --> 25:13.700
That'd be great.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.340
Griffin, can I get a Yahoo up in this piece?

25:16.340 --> 25:17.860
Yeah, I'll pop off.

25:17.860 --> 25:19.220
I'll blow my load.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.740
This Yahoo is sent in by Supindle.

25:22.740 --> 25:23.620
Thank you, Supindle.

25:23.620 --> 25:26.900
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nick101 who asks.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.380
I'm looking to learn about Nick,

25:29.380 --> 25:31.060
but I want to get it on the ground level.

25:31.620 --> 25:34.900
Do you have any advanced courses like a Nick202 or?

25:34.900 --> 25:37.940
Hey man, if you really want to start in on the Nick situation,

25:37.940 --> 25:39.380
you got to start with Nick101.

25:39.380 --> 25:41.460
I took Nick AP classes in high school.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.300
Those credits transfer over.

25:43.300 --> 25:47.300
Hey, so my parents found a dildo I ordered.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.900
How do I handle this situation?

25:50.340 --> 25:52.740
I'm 19 and not gay or anything,

25:52.740 --> 25:55.140
but my parents accidentally opened my package

25:55.140 --> 25:57.220
and found that I had ordered a dildo.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.380
After having an extremely awkward conversation

25:59.380 --> 26:00.660
with my mom over the phone,

26:00.660 --> 26:02.580
I am left with quite a situation to sort out.

26:02.580 --> 26:03.140
Please help.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.100
Yeah, this is quite the situation.

26:06.100 --> 26:07.780
It is quite a situation, Nick101.

26:07.780 --> 26:11.860
Is it a gift dildo?

26:13.300 --> 26:15.060
I guess it's a dildo.

26:15.060 --> 26:16.820
See, if you order from Extreme Restraints,

26:16.820 --> 26:19.780
they ship everything with like a fake,

26:19.780 --> 26:22.100
like a facade over the actual present

26:22.100 --> 26:25.300
that makes it look like a Kindle Fire or something like that.

26:25.300 --> 26:29.860
Yeah, keep your piles like super straight come Christmas time.

26:31.220 --> 26:34.260
Keep them really, really diligently straight.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.060
They actually, Extreme Restraints,

26:37.060 --> 26:39.780
actually does send you a Kindle Fire with every purchase.

26:39.780 --> 26:41.620
And then you press a special button on it,

26:41.620 --> 26:44.260
and then it digitizes a dildo right there for you.

26:44.260 --> 26:46.740
It uses 3D modeling technology to-

26:46.740 --> 26:48.260
Dildos in disguise.

26:49.300 --> 26:50.820
It transforms.

26:50.820 --> 26:54.740
It goes, and then you put it inside you,

26:54.740 --> 26:57.460
and then you take it out and angry birds.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.780
It actually turns into a flock of angry birds.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.540
Why did you put me inside you?

27:03.540 --> 27:06.580
I can't finish unless somebody shoots

27:06.580 --> 27:08.420
a bunch of angry birds at my junk.

27:08.980 --> 27:10.820
That is the only way I can do it now.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.660
I think the best course of action for this gentleman

27:14.660 --> 27:16.420
is misdirection.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.780
And when his mom's like,

27:17.780 --> 27:18.900
hey, why did you get a dildo?

27:18.900 --> 27:21.380
You say, no, mother, why did you open my package?

27:21.380 --> 27:22.420
Was it addressed to you?

27:23.300 --> 27:25.460
Good day, I forgive you.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.260
You're forgiven.

27:26.260 --> 27:32.900
Man, again, this is one of those,

27:33.700 --> 27:35.620
like 90% of the questions on this show,

27:35.620 --> 27:36.820
we just need more info.

27:37.540 --> 27:40.180
I need some more details.

27:40.180 --> 27:43.060
I feel like it is unfair of Nick to say,

27:43.060 --> 27:45.780
I ordered this dildo, I'm not gay.

27:45.780 --> 27:46.260
Or anything.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.940
Didn't finish that sentence with,

27:48.500 --> 27:51.540
the reason I did is blank.

27:51.540 --> 27:54.340
Well, maybe he did order it to like ram jam it,

27:54.340 --> 27:57.300
but like, I don't know.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.860
I don't, why don't you tell your parents to fuck?

27:59.860 --> 28:00.740
You're 19.

28:01.460 --> 28:03.460
You can't drink yet, but you can smoke and vote.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.660
Yep, at the same time.

28:06.660 --> 28:09.780
At the same time, you can smoke, vote,

28:09.780 --> 28:12.420
and ram jam a Bilbo right up in you.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.540
And you don't need to explain yourself

28:13.540 --> 28:17.620
to goddamn anybody, except the polling place attendant

28:17.620 --> 28:19.300
who's gonna wonder why you're ram jamming

28:19.300 --> 28:20.740
inside the polling place.

28:20.740 --> 28:21.700
And why you pressed,

28:21.700 --> 28:24.020
why you selected it with a cigarette.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.020
This one's for you, Obama.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.900
I just recently got told by a friend of mine

28:30.900 --> 28:32.340
who also works in theater,

28:32.340 --> 28:34.740
that sometimes if they need to drop in a line

28:34.740 --> 28:36.980
to like hook something in above an audience,

28:37.700 --> 28:40.580
they'll tape a dildo to the line because it's soft

28:40.580 --> 28:41.700
and they don't have to worry about it,

28:41.700 --> 28:43.140
like hurting somebody,

28:43.140 --> 28:45.460
but it's heavy enough to pull the line down.

28:45.460 --> 28:48.420
Pause, pause the world.

28:48.420 --> 28:52.020
Because if that, so the logic is it's not heavy and hard,

28:52.020 --> 28:54.260
so if it falls on somebody, it doesn't kill them.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.620
But if you're watching,

28:55.620 --> 28:57.140
oh, this is my favorite production,

28:57.140 --> 28:58.020
like Beth, I've ever,

28:58.020 --> 28:59.380
well, what just hit me in the ear?

28:59.940 --> 29:00.340
It kind of feels like-

29:00.340 --> 29:01.220
Well, they tape it up.

29:01.220 --> 29:02.020
They dress it up.

29:02.020 --> 29:05.380
They wrap it in foam so it is not identifiable as a dildo.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.340
But apparently it is a very commonly used theater practice

29:08.340 --> 29:10.580
to use a dildo to wake a line.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.740
Okay, how about a book?

29:12.740 --> 29:14.500
Or how about a Nerf missile?

29:14.500 --> 29:15.940
Or how about a banana?

29:15.940 --> 29:18.660
Or how about the other 100,000 things?

29:18.660 --> 29:20.020
Did you not know, Griffin?

29:20.020 --> 29:21.540
Techies is freaky.

29:21.540 --> 29:24.340
I guess, I guess, I suppose.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.540
Techies is freaky.

29:27.540 --> 29:29.220
I think you should just tell your parents

29:30.100 --> 29:31.140
why you got the dildo,

29:31.140 --> 29:32.980
whatever that reason may be.

29:32.980 --> 29:33.700
And then they'll respect you.

29:33.700 --> 29:36.660
Mother, father, may I sit you down for a moment, please?

29:36.660 --> 29:38.020
I brought this dildo for me.

29:39.300 --> 29:40.740
I don't have to answer your questions.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.820
I'm gonna use it to fling Angry Birds at my dick.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.980
Because that's how I do.

29:44.980 --> 29:48.260
I'm feeling like 20 Does

29:48.260 --> 29:50.100
has been about obviously getting it.

29:50.100 --> 29:52.100
I feel like, and we're still weighing

29:52.100 --> 29:54.820
a few different options for 2013 themes,

29:54.820 --> 29:58.660
but I feel like maybe 2013 should just be No More Secrets.

29:58.660 --> 29:59.140
Yeah.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.700
How many of our, like,

30:02.500 --> 30:05.220
how many of our problems here on the show

30:05.220 --> 30:08.340
would be solved by just No More Secrets?

30:09.460 --> 30:11.060
You know, let's stop it.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.340
Let's just be honest.

30:12.340 --> 30:13.540
No More Secrets, guys.

30:13.540 --> 30:14.820
Yes, but that's not good.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.020
It's 13.

30:16.020 --> 30:18.900
I can't think of anything that rhymes with 13

30:18.900 --> 30:19.940
that makes it sound.

30:19.940 --> 30:22.420
20 Does is like 22, you know?

30:22.420 --> 30:22.980
22.

30:22.980 --> 30:23.300
Right.

30:23.300 --> 30:23.780
Do it.

30:23.780 --> 30:24.740
Just do it.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.380
Just get it.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.340
Just do it, Nike.

30:27.140 --> 30:27.860
Just do it.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.100
Just get it, Reebok is their motto.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.260
Jump good.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.220
Skechers, it's the S.

30:37.620 --> 30:40.180
Faster, faster, faster, faster, Nike.

30:40.180 --> 30:40.580
Faster.

30:40.580 --> 30:43.780
These shoes, these shoes are for poor kids.

30:43.780 --> 30:44.280
Keds.

30:45.940 --> 30:46.900
Poor Keds.

30:46.900 --> 30:47.700
Keds.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.660
Get them.

30:49.780 --> 30:50.820
What year is it?

30:50.820 --> 30:51.540
British Nights.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.020
I could do this all day.

30:56.020 --> 30:56.500
It's fun.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.780
I really, really want some.

30:57.780 --> 30:58.500
Reebok bump.

30:59.780 --> 31:00.820
They don't sell them anymore.

31:01.940 --> 31:04.420
If you move fast enough, the end kind of looks like a Nike.

31:04.420 --> 31:11.620
New Balance.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.900
What in the world?

31:12.900 --> 31:13.380
Uggs.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.620
I wish I could just let it.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.180
I'm a Depression era child in Appalachia.

31:32.180 --> 31:37.780
Paperbacks.

31:37.780 --> 31:38.280
God.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.420
I think we should probably go to the money zone.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.700
I mean, we just got a bunch of money from all of those.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.980
For Uggs and Moon Shoes.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.100
Did we do Moon Shoes?

31:52.100 --> 31:52.660
No, we didn't.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.900
Hey, I'm going to fucking kill that kid.

31:56.900 --> 31:57.460
Wheelies.

31:57.460 --> 32:02.580
That's the shoe speaking, right?

32:02.580 --> 32:02.820
Yeah.

32:03.460 --> 32:08.740
No, I hate these fucking rolly pieces of shit that won't stop rolling around.

32:08.740 --> 32:09.540
Just walk.

32:09.540 --> 32:11.220
In my day, we walked.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.980
We didn't have wheels in our shoes.

32:12.980 --> 32:28.580
Our first message is for Chelsea from Joe, who is in all caps.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.340
Boyfriend.

32:30.340 --> 32:31.300
Boyfriend.

32:31.300 --> 32:32.100
Boyfriend.

32:32.740 --> 32:33.940
Let there be no doubt.

32:34.900 --> 32:35.940
I am boyfriend.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.340
You made it to 25, Chelsea.

32:38.340 --> 32:39.620
Congratulations.

32:39.620 --> 32:44.660
You're a Pokemon master, sexy freedom trail tour guide, and all around awesome lady.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.180
He said fucking awesome lady.

32:48.180 --> 32:48.500
I know.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.820
I'm trying to tone it down.

32:50.820 --> 32:52.660
We're coming up on candle lights.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.340
We love the shit out of you.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.380
He said shit, so.

32:56.100 --> 33:00.580
Happy birthday from Joe, Connor, Terry, Lauren, and Mike.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.900
Don't be late for the bug now.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.860
I want to know what the sexy freedom trail is.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.660
And I really look forward to visiting.

33:08.660 --> 33:11.700
Travis, I'm not a linguistic expert.

33:12.900 --> 33:17.060
I'm pretty sure he's saying she's a sexy guide on the freedom trail,

33:17.060 --> 33:23.140
not as you have surmised here, a guide on a sexy freedom trail.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.940
Justin, do you know what happens when you assume?

33:25.940 --> 33:27.300
I guess you got me there, Trav.

33:27.300 --> 33:27.860
I'm sorry.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.020
You didn't even like take a second to Google it.

33:30.020 --> 33:32.420
I need you to Google sexy freedom trail, please.

33:32.420 --> 33:35.780
I'm pretty sure it's just the one freedom trail in Boston.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.580
Isn't that what they call it when, like, you have pubes on your gut that, like,

33:38.580 --> 33:41.860
leads down to your butt, to your pee-pee or vagina?

33:41.860 --> 33:42.340
Yeah, right.

33:44.260 --> 33:49.860
Speaking of pee-pees and vaginas, we also want to tell you guys about Extreme Restraints.

33:49.860 --> 33:55.380
It's a website where you can order all the latest fuck props.

33:56.020 --> 34:00.180
They say, I think toys is too much for these works of art.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.060
I think there are tools.

34:01.060 --> 34:02.260
Fuck a couture mall.

34:02.260 --> 34:03.140
A couture mall.

34:03.140 --> 34:08.020
How about a couture mall?

34:08.020 --> 34:09.620
Cannot, cannot.

34:11.700 --> 34:12.260
Cannot.

34:12.260 --> 34:16.500
If you use a coupon code MEDALIST, you can save 20% at the site,

34:16.500 --> 34:21.540
which is, of course, located conveniently at ExtremeRestraints.com.

34:22.980 --> 34:26.180
Go there and get all your couture mall.

34:26.820 --> 34:27.300
Nope.

34:27.300 --> 34:36.100
Guys, we got so many tweets last week from people, like, overjoyed that this partnership

34:36.100 --> 34:41.220
had been struck up, that it had been reignited.

34:41.220 --> 34:44.180
Because there were some fears after we went without for, like, one week.

34:44.180 --> 34:45.540
People were like, what happened?

34:45.540 --> 34:46.420
Was it me?

34:46.420 --> 34:47.700
Was it something I did?

34:47.700 --> 34:48.900
Talk to me, daddy and mommy.

34:48.900 --> 34:49.860
Did I not buy enough?

34:49.860 --> 34:51.620
Did I not buy enough dillbows?

34:52.340 --> 34:53.380
Here's what I would say to you.

34:53.380 --> 34:56.100
Please go to the website, use that coupon code,

34:56.100 --> 34:59.780
because every once in a while we get a list, an anonymous list,

34:59.780 --> 35:02.100
of all the things our listeners have bought with that code.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.700
And it is really the highlight.

35:03.700 --> 35:07.380
It's, like, we don't get, other than, like, tweets and books,

35:07.380 --> 35:09.140
which is what you call Facebook interactions,

35:10.420 --> 35:15.540
like, we don't get to, like, gauge you guys, like, the kind of people that you are.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.180
Or what gauge of dildo you're getting.

35:18.180 --> 35:21.620
Yeah, so when we get a list saying, like, you bought,

35:22.180 --> 35:25.220
you bought, like, a butt hammer called Lil Stomper,

35:25.220 --> 35:30.500
then, like, that informs us about the shape and angle of your character.

35:30.500 --> 35:33.700
That helps us to customize the show for your enjoyment.

35:33.700 --> 35:34.420
That's it.

35:34.420 --> 35:35.860
Think of it like a focus group,

35:35.860 --> 35:37.780
because we want to know the angle of your dangle.

35:37.780 --> 35:38.980
And this is how we do.

35:38.980 --> 35:39.940
This is how we do that.

35:39.940 --> 35:42.580
I want to say a big hello to Sam Seeger.

35:42.580 --> 35:46.420
This is from Alex, Ali, Chris, Mary, Max, Nat, and Will.

35:46.420 --> 35:48.900
They have a very specific script here, so I'm going to read it exactly.

35:49.460 --> 35:53.060
Sam, yes, you, Sam Seeger.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.980
We can see you.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.620
Don't just sit there in your striped cardigan,

35:57.620 --> 35:59.460
sipping water at your desk,

35:59.460 --> 36:03.060
or watching your shocked face from the camera in the hippo statue.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.300
You need to stop masturbating all the time.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.340
Stop masturbating.

36:06.340 --> 36:08.020
Your friends just want to say happy birthday.

36:08.580 --> 36:09.780
Here they are.

36:09.780 --> 36:14.020
And then it says here, talk in funny voice, which I don't know.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.300
I have two problems.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.940
First of all, we're not fucking clowns for hire.

36:19.700 --> 36:20.420
We are a little bit.

36:20.420 --> 36:24.660
If you want clowns for hire, hire us from our clown service.

36:24.660 --> 36:25.300
Silly guys.

36:25.300 --> 36:29.540
Moreover, hey, has anyone ever been to a fancy restaurant?

36:29.540 --> 36:31.220
You can't just go with eight people

36:31.220 --> 36:33.140
and then get the most expensive dish on the menu

36:33.140 --> 36:35.460
and be like, oh, all eight of us are going to split it.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.500
Let's watch these.

36:36.500 --> 36:40.100
Let's keep, let's keep it to a minimum on these group messages.

36:40.100 --> 36:40.900
These pile on.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.660
Are you saying that each one should have bought an individual message for Sam?

36:42.660 --> 36:45.940
I'm saying each one of them could have maybe picked up the tab.

36:46.820 --> 36:49.140
And our next message is also for Sam.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.700
And also this one and this one.

36:51.700 --> 36:52.340
And this one.

36:52.340 --> 36:52.660
Right.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.860
There's no Groupon for what we're doling out.

36:55.860 --> 36:56.260
Yeah.

36:56.260 --> 36:58.500
Guys, let's try to get a handle on it.

36:58.500 --> 37:03.380
I want to get a handle on Jeff in North Attleboro from his buddy, Mike Cantor.

37:04.180 --> 37:04.980
Maybe his lover.

37:04.980 --> 37:05.620
I don't know.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.140
I wouldn't suppose.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.220
But happy 29th birthday.

37:09.220 --> 37:09.700
His boss.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.140
Maybe his boss.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.820
Maybe his lover, his lover, his boss's dog.

37:14.820 --> 37:15.700
Maybe his nemesis.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.300
A shades of gray kind of situation where they signed a contract.

37:19.300 --> 37:23.700
We can only assume because we got literally no information other than happy 29th birthday.

37:24.260 --> 37:28.260
So we're guessing here, but we hope Jeff has a great one.

37:28.260 --> 37:29.860
And that's for your buddy, Mike.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.020
So happy 29th, Jeff.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.100
Or as you call him, Mr. Cantor.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.740
How did you guys spend your 29th?

37:38.340 --> 37:43.460
I spent my 29th getting into a car accident and thinking about doing 365 new things before

37:43.460 --> 37:46.180
I turned 30.

37:46.180 --> 37:46.580
Pretty good birthday.

37:46.580 --> 37:47.540
All at the same time.

37:47.540 --> 37:53.540
It all flashed into my mind as I collided with the pleasant elderly couple in front of me.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.940
Were they so pleasant that you just had to destroy them?

37:57.940 --> 37:58.900
Is that what happened?

37:58.900 --> 37:59.300
Yeah.

37:59.300 --> 37:59.940
Was it like an air raid?

37:59.940 --> 38:01.620
Stop that fucking railroad track.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.140
Who does that, old people?

38:03.140 --> 38:05.060
I just wanted to destroy something elderly.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.420
I wanted to destroy something weathered.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.900
Jesse Thorne here, proprietor of MaximumFun.org.

38:10.900 --> 38:16.660
Look, we had a great time in the Poconos and everything, but there's no way we are forgetting

38:16.660 --> 38:20.900
about our annual trip to Lake Arrowhead here in Southern California.

38:20.900 --> 38:27.700
So unless the world ends first by Mayan prophecy, Max Fun Con West will be held May 31st through

38:27.700 --> 38:29.860
June 2nd, 2013.

38:29.860 --> 38:34.580
Join us for a showcase of elite stand-up comedy performers in the world, and we'll see you

38:34.580 --> 38:38.900
next time on Max Fun Con.

39:04.820 --> 39:07.780
About three months ago, me and my best friend started dating.

39:07.780 --> 39:12.180
Since we're both part of a small community of mutual friends and colleagues who love

39:12.180 --> 39:14.900
to gossip, we kept our relationship secret.

39:16.260 --> 39:17.380
Enjoy it while it lasts.

39:17.380 --> 39:21.620
You got fucking 29 more days of that for 2013.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.540
No more secrets.

39:23.540 --> 39:28.500
But now that we're serious, I feel silly having to keep my distance from my boyfriend when

39:28.500 --> 39:33.060
I'm out in public and my friends trying to set me up with guys since they think I'm still

39:33.060 --> 39:33.860
single.

39:33.860 --> 39:36.420
How do I convince my boyfriend it's time to go public?

39:36.420 --> 39:40.340
And how can I break the news to this small community without it becoming dramatic gossip?

39:40.340 --> 39:42.420
That's from Mary in Illinois.

39:42.420 --> 39:43.540
How do you not?

39:43.540 --> 39:44.040
How?

39:46.420 --> 39:49.540
What does everyone love more than anything else in the world?

39:50.500 --> 39:52.180
People they know getting together.

39:52.180 --> 39:52.680
No.

39:53.780 --> 39:54.820
You're wrong.

39:54.820 --> 40:01.220
The answer is knowing some shit that they shouldn't know that maybe not everybody else

40:01.220 --> 40:01.720
knows.

40:01.720 --> 40:10.680
So in your attempt to keep gossip from happening, you have created the juiciest, most mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.360
Do you know how you avoid gossip?

40:12.360 --> 40:15.560
You do the fucking Alan Aldamu from West Wing Season 7.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.060
Yes.

40:16.060 --> 40:19.400
You hold a press conference and you just talk it out for like four hours.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.520
You answer every question.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.200
You stand and you fucking deliver.

40:22.200 --> 40:26.520
Because what you have, God, it's so fucking going to blow my load.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.240
It's 31 flavors and I want to taste each one.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.880
You have done fucked up.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.080
You have created the juiciest, most mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

40:35.080 --> 40:39.880
They have probably hired a fucking private investigator because they want to know so bad.

40:40.760 --> 40:41.800
Oh, God.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.320
When the first person-

40:43.320 --> 40:47.480
You hid the press in the closet and then you told the kids not to go in the closet or else

40:47.480 --> 40:48.520
Santa wouldn't come for them.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.720
And now fucking the closet is all they can think about.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.480
And it's too late now because you've already had a brief period.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.440
You're trapped in the closet.

40:56.440 --> 41:01.080
If you say it now, if you come out with it now, all they're going to talk about is those

41:01.080 --> 41:04.200
two fucking devilishly sexy months.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.080
Who knows what's going on?

41:05.080 --> 41:05.960
What were they doing?

41:05.960 --> 41:07.400
What was that about?

41:07.400 --> 41:10.760
They probably didn't want us to know because of how they were just pressing their butts

41:10.760 --> 41:11.720
together all the time.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.640
They were just pooping back and forth nonstop.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.560
Travis, Griffin, wait till you get married.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.800
You are going to learn so much about what sex is.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.400
Well, I heard once you get married, they don't let you put your butt on their butt again.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.720
No, you need to put your fanny against their fanny.

41:25.720 --> 41:31.880
I heard if you put a penny in your jar every time you put your butt on her butt in the

41:31.880 --> 41:37.480
first year of marriage and then every time after you take him out at the end, then at

41:37.480 --> 41:39.800
the end, you have to put all the pennies in your butt.

41:40.920 --> 41:41.560
That is true.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.680
100% true.

41:42.680 --> 41:43.180
That is-

41:44.840 --> 41:47.160
I read that in Malcolm Gladwell's The Outliers.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.000
Man, Travis just wants everybody to know he read a book.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.960
I just want it to be known.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.720
And to be fair, I listened to it.

41:58.840 --> 41:59.720
I cannot read.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.220
Jesus.

42:01.000 --> 42:07.320
Well, ma'am, as it says in Malcolm Gladwell's The Outliers, I'll have the chicken McNuggets

42:07.320 --> 42:08.680
and an extra large Coke.

42:09.880 --> 42:10.440
Excuse me?

42:11.320 --> 42:12.040
Can you not hear me?

42:12.040 --> 42:13.640
I'll turn down my book on tape.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.360
Sorry.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.560
I apologize.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.600
Yeah, listen.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.100
You gotta-

42:18.440 --> 42:21.880
And first and foremost, I need you to be honest.

42:21.880 --> 42:25.880
I truly believe that anytime someone says, we're going to get together, but we need to

42:25.880 --> 42:29.800
keep it secret from our group of friends, the reason you do that is because you guys

42:29.800 --> 42:32.760
weren't sure if it was going to work out and you didn't want to make it a big thing.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.040
Travis is 100% right.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.160
He's very wise.

42:35.160 --> 42:39.640
So now that you know it's going to work out, you need to just straight up be like, hey,

42:39.640 --> 42:40.520
we're dating.

42:40.520 --> 42:45.080
And don't just tell one person because that's how you create gossip.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.120
Yeah.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.280
That's like damming a river, right?

42:48.280 --> 42:50.520
And then you put a small hole in it.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.080
That's how it all breaks apart and becomes a thing.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.080
Just tell everyone all at once.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.440
Travis had it right the first time.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.920
Do an Alan Alda press conference.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.120
Can you do a press conference at the office?

43:02.120 --> 43:03.000
Just have everybody-

43:03.000 --> 43:03.480
Hello.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.360
Thank you all for coming.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.040
I've called you together for an important announcement.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.880
That problem is, where are you going to find a sign language interpreter at this hour?

43:12.600 --> 43:15.880
I know you're probably wondering why me and Derek are touching our butts together.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.480
Well, let me go ahead and clear up any confusion there may be.

43:19.480 --> 43:23.880
Hola, me llamo Greg.

43:23.880 --> 43:28.120
Es mi hermana Kelly.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.000
That means sister.

43:29.000 --> 43:29.400
Let me start over.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.920
My sister Kelly and I.

43:30.920 --> 43:35.240
Now I know that this seems especially shocking now that you know we are blood relation.

43:36.360 --> 43:39.480
We have been secret brother and sister and secret dating.

43:39.480 --> 43:40.520
How is your world?

43:40.520 --> 43:41.560
We just changed it.

43:41.560 --> 43:45.240
To be fair, we've only been brother and sister for a month and we've been dating for three.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.760
So figure that one out.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.480
Thanks for getting married, mom and dad.

43:49.480 --> 43:50.600
New mom and new dad.

43:52.440 --> 43:58.920
Yeah, but just to be straight up, you create gossip by not telling people.

44:00.680 --> 44:04.440
What's interesting to people is not knowing for sure whether you guys are together.

44:04.440 --> 44:07.080
Now, how much of full disclosure are we talking about?

44:08.040 --> 44:10.600
Do they really have to be like, we are dating

44:10.600 --> 44:13.400
and we press our butts together on the reg twice a day?

44:13.400 --> 44:17.720
If you just come out and say, hey, so just so you guys know, Derek and I are dating,

44:17.720 --> 44:21.160
then they're going to be like, oh, we're so happy for you.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.600
And then when you leave the fucking room, the second you do, they're going to turn to

44:24.600 --> 44:27.480
each other and be like, what do you think their butt pressing schedule is like?

44:27.480 --> 44:30.200
That is exactly what people do.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.960
Tell me about the routines.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.480
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

44:34.040 --> 44:38.120
What if you just pretended like you assumed everybody already knew?

44:38.120 --> 44:42.440
So like, go out, go out on like a group thing or whatever and just like hold hands and kiss

44:42.440 --> 44:45.000
and like do all the PDA and we're like, what the fuck?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.480
Be like, we've been dating for like two fucking months.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.200
Where have you been?

44:48.200 --> 44:52.440
When did Travis become the wizard of fucking Oz?

44:52.440 --> 44:54.200
Like he's so smart, right?

44:54.200 --> 45:08.600
Like I read fucking Malcolm Gladwell's The Outlaw.

45:08.600 --> 45:09.880
Oh man.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.680
We need to wrap this up.

45:14.680 --> 45:15.720
This has been a lot of fun.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.000
We've had a lot of fun here today.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.200
Let's do one more.

45:18.200 --> 45:18.700
Okay.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.600
Real or Yahoo or what?

45:21.480 --> 45:22.920
Well, I have a Yahoo.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.040
You want to see if you guys like it?

45:24.760 --> 45:25.880
Yeah, let's see how it tastes.

45:25.880 --> 45:26.440
It's working.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.680
I figured we should do at least one Candle Nights question.

45:29.480 --> 45:29.980
Okay.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.560
It was sent by Emily Wall.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.600
Thank you, Emily.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Poppy who asks,

45:36.200 --> 45:37.480
gerbil Christmas presents?

45:38.200 --> 45:38.700
Oh.

45:39.960 --> 45:43.160
Well, I'm going to switch out Christmas for Candle Nights for the rest of the question.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.600
Well, because who celebrates Christmas anymore, really?

45:46.600 --> 45:49.080
Yeah, that's a little 2011 for my taste.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.680
Well, this year for Candle Nights, I have no idea what to get my gerbils.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.880
All I have got is a great ball.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.040
A toilet roll.

45:59.160 --> 45:59.880
Please help.

45:59.880 --> 46:00.680
Wait, what?

46:00.680 --> 46:01.480
A toilet roll?

46:02.600 --> 46:03.960
Yeah, gerbils look like they...

46:03.960 --> 46:05.560
It's like a fun little bunker for them.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.920
Oh, like the inside tube.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.420
Yeah.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.560
Not like to wipe their gerbil butts.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.440
No, no, no, no.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.320
Well, I don't know.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.040
I don't know how gerbils do.

46:16.040 --> 46:19.560
I can't understand the words of the question.

46:19.560 --> 46:20.120
Okay.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.800
Should I do it again but slower?

46:21.800 --> 46:22.840
Yeah, do it again slower.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.280
So I can finish.

46:26.760 --> 46:30.680
Well, this year for Candle Nights, I have no idea what to get my gerbils.

46:30.680 --> 46:33.240
All I have got is a great ball.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.200
A toilet roll.

46:37.160 --> 46:37.720
Please help.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.800
Does he say he's already got a ball and he needs another idea?

46:45.240 --> 46:47.880
I got the ball, I got the toilet roll, but that's not enough.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.200
You're going to throw that back in my face.

46:50.200 --> 46:53.480
I guess what I'm asking is, do you know what my gerbils are getting me?

46:54.680 --> 46:57.880
How much have they spent so that I know how much I need to spend?

46:57.880 --> 47:03.000
The only answer on the question says a great ball or a toilet roll.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.920
I mean, you got your bases covered.

47:08.920 --> 47:13.320
What if he sells his car to get them some new chew toys,

47:13.320 --> 47:19.880
but they sell their teeth to get him a new air freshener for his car?

47:19.880 --> 47:21.080
Give to the mad gerbils.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.400
Man, my portmanteaus are on fire today.

47:25.400 --> 47:25.720
I love-

47:25.720 --> 47:30.520
Even worse is when he gives them the great ball and the toilet roll and Rolex watches

47:30.520 --> 47:32.920
and they're like, oh, we didn't get you anything, Steve.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.080
Steve, I didn't know we had that kind of relationship.

47:35.960 --> 47:37.160
I mean, we are gerbils.

47:37.160 --> 47:38.040
Do you want me to bite you?

47:39.000 --> 47:39.880
That's a thing I can do.

47:39.880 --> 47:44.760
And then one of them runs into their hutch real quick and like throws a bottle of wine

47:44.760 --> 47:46.520
leftover from a dinner party into a bag.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.000
And they're like, here, Steve, we picked this out just for you.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.800
The cork came out accidentally.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.400
I don't understand how it happened.

47:54.040 --> 47:55.160
And we chewed on it.

47:55.160 --> 47:55.880
We chewed on it.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.040
Sorry that we're gerbils and you don't have a girlfriend.

47:58.040 --> 47:59.560
I know what you can get a gerbil.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.760
How about you get him a nut?

48:05.000 --> 48:06.760
It's so cute when they try to get in there.

48:06.760 --> 48:07.800
What are they trying to get at?

48:07.800 --> 48:11.400
Give him a few corn nuts and you try to stick them all in his mouth at the same time.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.440
And he's got those big old cheeks like Garfield.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.200
Ooh, get him surgery.

48:18.200 --> 48:18.840
Yeah.

48:18.840 --> 48:19.320
Can you make your cat-

48:19.320 --> 48:21.000
He drew an eye on that plastic surgery.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.920
Make your gerbil look exactly like Garfield.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.360
That's going to be a cool look for him.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.040
He'll be the toast of, I don't know what you give him, a cage?

48:30.040 --> 48:31.400
Of the terrarium.

48:31.400 --> 48:32.120
Hutch.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.240
You know, here's the thing, though.

48:33.240 --> 48:33.640
What's up?

48:33.640 --> 48:39.000
I'm going to be honest and say when my dog was still around, I got her Christmas present.

48:39.000 --> 48:39.400
Yeah, sure.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.040
But that's a fucker.

48:40.040 --> 48:45.560
Yeah, Travis, but you didn't ask internet strangers how many plastic bones to buy.

48:45.560 --> 48:48.600
Oh, so you're saying that it's cool as long as you keep it secret and safe.

48:48.600 --> 48:52.120
No, I'm saying why don't you know your gerbils well enough to know what they want?

48:53.160 --> 48:57.080
Why do you think the internet has a deeper personal connection with your gerbils than they do?

48:57.080 --> 48:58.920
Are you just going to check your gerbil's Facebook?

48:58.920 --> 48:59.560
What the fuck?

48:59.560 --> 49:06.680
Go to your gerbil's armoire, see if they're out of white diamonds, and just buy them some more.

49:07.320 --> 49:11.000
Buy them things they've already got and just replenish those if you're out of ideas.

49:12.040 --> 49:14.040
Gerbil, have you ever seen 12 Monkeys?

49:14.040 --> 49:15.240
I got it for you on Blu-Ray.

49:15.800 --> 49:16.840
I thought you might enjoy it.

49:18.760 --> 49:19.880
Oh, you're afraid of monkeys.

49:19.880 --> 49:20.600
And TVs.

49:20.600 --> 49:21.880
And Blu-Ray, and discs.

49:21.880 --> 49:23.400
And discs, great.

49:24.040 --> 49:24.760
Cool, cool, cool.

49:25.480 --> 49:29.240
This has been our advice show, my brother, my brother, and me.

49:29.240 --> 49:32.440
We hope you've had as much fun as we have, which is to say some.

49:34.440 --> 49:35.480
Thank you for listening.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.080
Thank you for tweeting about the show.

49:37.080 --> 49:45.880
Thanks to Deconique, Roman Noodles, Stump Freak, Jason E. Becker, Whittleton, Iron Sean, Iggy K.

49:47.640 --> 49:51.800
MBMBAMWisdom is an account that tweets out quotes from the show.

49:52.680 --> 49:55.240
So, you know, go follow that one.

49:55.240 --> 49:59.640
It's got 1400 followers, believe it or not.

49:59.640 --> 50:03.160
Also, we're preparing for our special Candle Nights episode.

50:03.160 --> 50:06.440
I think this year we're going to go with like a gift giving gift guide theme.

50:07.160 --> 50:10.040
We've already gotten a couple of really awesome, great questions.

50:10.040 --> 50:14.120
So make sure to send in all of your Candle Nights gift giving questions

50:14.120 --> 50:16.040
and try to put it in the subject line.

50:16.040 --> 50:17.960
You know, Candle Nights or something along those lines

50:17.960 --> 50:19.640
so that I can recognize them right away.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.320
I can't wait for Candle Nights, you guys.

50:23.320 --> 50:23.800
I'm so excited.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.160
I know, it's getting closer.

50:25.160 --> 50:29.000
And of course, as all Candle Nights episodes, it will be it'll be cuss free.

50:29.000 --> 50:29.480
Yes.

50:29.480 --> 50:30.920
It'll be family friendly.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.600
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

50:32.600 --> 50:34.760
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.680
Off the album, putting the days to bed.

50:36.680 --> 50:37.240
The what?

50:37.240 --> 50:37.560
Sorry?

50:38.360 --> 50:38.920
The album.

50:38.920 --> 50:39.400
The album.

50:39.400 --> 50:39.880
The album?

50:39.880 --> 50:43.880
Yeah, you crack open the disc and it's that soft membrane through which all the rock lives.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.200
So thank you.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.400
Thank you, John Roderick.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.880
I had something I wanted to say and I can't remember it now.

50:49.880 --> 50:54.840
I want to say we were reminded from a couple of tweets this week that there is only a month

50:54.840 --> 51:01.320
left in 20 Does and if you have not gotten it yet, you have like 28 days to get it.

51:01.320 --> 51:05.000
A reminder to get your tickets for Max Funcon West.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.360
You go to maxfuncon.com.

51:07.080 --> 51:11.560
I'm sure there's going to be a ton of amazing guests and fun activities and you don't want

51:11.560 --> 51:12.120
to miss it.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.480
It was life changing for us.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.520
I think it's safe to say.

51:15.240 --> 51:16.040
Head on over there.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.640
It makes a great gift.

51:17.640 --> 51:20.040
Listen to all the other Max Fun podcasts.

51:20.040 --> 51:27.400
Jordan and Jesse Go, Stop Podcasting Yourself, Throwing Shade, Judge John Hodgman, Risk,

51:27.400 --> 51:30.040
Memory Palace, International Waters.

51:30.040 --> 51:33.560
I wish they'd stop adding them because that's all I can remember and I think I probably...

51:33.560 --> 51:34.280
Oh, Bullseye?

51:34.280 --> 51:34.840
God damn it.

51:35.640 --> 51:36.680
Yeah, you'll get them next time.

51:36.680 --> 51:37.480
There's a lot of podcasts.

51:37.480 --> 51:42.040
And make sure you subscribe on iTunes and rate us there and give us a review if you haven't.

51:42.040 --> 51:43.080
It really helps us out.

51:43.080 --> 51:49.240
It really helps us out and we got to beat, I don't know, Jimmy Pardo or somebody.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.040
I want to beat all of them.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.560
I want to beat Adam Carolla.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.360
I just want to...

51:52.360 --> 51:55.000
If we don't get to the top of iTunes, I'm going to blow my load.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.760
Griffin, do you have a final question for us?

51:58.760 --> 51:59.480
I do.

51:59.480 --> 52:03.880
This final Yahoo was sent in by Nick Robinson.

52:03.880 --> 52:05.160
Thank you, Nick Robinson.

52:05.160 --> 52:08.600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Evan E who absolutely has to know.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.640
Why does everyone think Son of the Mask was so bad?

52:14.680 --> 52:15.800
I'm Justin McElroy.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:17.080 --> 52:17.960
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.440
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

52:20.440 --> 52:21.240
Kiss your dad.

52:21.240 --> 52:39.000
My brother, my brother and me, kiss your dad square on the lips.
