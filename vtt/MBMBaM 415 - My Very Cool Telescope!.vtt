00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.520
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era.

00:47.520 --> 00:52.480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.920
Oh no. You're sweet, baby brother.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.360
30 Griffin. Are you okay?

00:56.080 --> 00:58.640
Yeah, I've just been working out my radio voice.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.680
Okay, because it sounds like you kind of like swallowed a pog slammer and it got stuck.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.520
Yeah, like a real pog throat.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.560
Podcasts are over. Radio is the future.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.920
Oh god. Now it sounds like you're melting in acid.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.080
Time for some ads.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.760
We just started. I don't want to do ads.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.120
We just had a great rock block of comedy 90 seconds for you,

01:19.120 --> 01:23.200
now it's time to hear from our sponsor, Dutch Miller Chevrolet.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.880
No, I don't want to give free publicity to Dutch Miller Chevrolet.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.280
Well, I think it's pretty narrow casting to

01:29.280 --> 01:32.000
people living in Huntington who want to buy a new Chevy truck.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.680
I'm so excited. I'm like feeling so energized right now. I'm fantastic.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.760
Oh, you're excited because that graphic novel is coming out?

01:40.400 --> 01:45.360
My graphic novel is coming out, I guess. You can probably pre-order it, I'm sure,

01:46.160 --> 01:50.960
but that is not why. It's because last night I got to hang out with my good friend,

01:50.960 --> 01:59.440
and James Buffett at his concert in Cincinnati. 51 sold out shows there in Cincinnati.

02:00.320 --> 02:08.720
He is just the biggest deal there. Summer cannot start in Cincinnati

02:08.720 --> 02:12.160
until Jimmy and the Coral Reefer band comes to town.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.920
That was really frustrating this year because he waited until mid-July.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.320
Yeah.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.680
And we were like, Jimmy, what about 4th of July? What about all the cookouts?

02:19.680 --> 02:21.200
And he was like, you have to wait.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.720
He said, don't even try to go to them.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.480
That's spring, motherfuckers.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.040
But then he came and he saw his shadow, and then Summer was able to start.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.520
I was so thrilled. Me and the whole family got to meet Jimmy, perform on Jimmy's pre-show.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.360
Yeah, I had a great time there. I'm part of Justin's family,

02:39.360 --> 02:42.080
and he definitely invited me too because I live here in Cincinnati.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.280
Yeah, it's weird.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.560
I invited Travis, and he didn't even want to say hi to me.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.680
He didn't even want to see me while I was in town. He was not interested.

02:49.680 --> 02:55.440
You invited me to come in the brief window you had when you would not be busy with Jimmy Buffett

02:55.440 --> 03:00.320
if I wanted to come say hi and wave you off like an old-timey cruise line

03:00.320 --> 03:03.200
so that you could go have fun at Jimmy Buffett without me.

03:03.200 --> 03:09.120
Didn't want you to embarrass me in front of James because he would be sure to-

03:09.120 --> 03:09.360
That's fair.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.080
I don't think that's unfair. That's not even what I'm, like,

03:12.080 --> 03:16.640
gized about, y'all. I'm on a new mission. Can we talk about it real quick?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.640
Yeah, what level are you on right now, Juice?

03:18.640 --> 03:23.840
This grind I'm in, it's getting good. I'm in the thick of it right now on this one.

03:25.520 --> 03:32.480
It occurred to me recently that the third season of Pete & Pete isn't available on DVD,

03:33.440 --> 03:36.800
and for some reason I had been talking or thinking about anything else

03:36.800 --> 03:44.080
when now that I have the world's tiniest and most adorable bully pulpit that I want to-

03:44.080 --> 03:44.560
Yeah.

03:44.560 --> 03:51.520
So I'm going to try to shake a few trees. I'm on the case. See where I can shake out.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.800
And guys, I think I'm making a little headway.

03:54.800 --> 04:01.200
Except for catching the attention of the giant corporation that would need to actually make this

04:01.200 --> 04:09.120
happen and could with, I assume, an email. I haven't quite caught them yet,

04:09.120 --> 04:14.880
but things are going pretty good. Here are the people that I've got involved in this case right

04:14.880 --> 04:15.440
now.

04:15.440 --> 04:15.920
Okay.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.280
Did you talk to Jimmy about this?

04:17.840 --> 04:21.520
Didn't talk to Jimmy about this. Should have brought it up with Jimmy. God, kicking myself.

04:21.520 --> 04:26.000
Also, did see Emilio Estevez at the show. Did not bring it up to Emilio Estevez.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.840
Oh, you guys got some clout.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.920
By the way, apparently Emilio Estevez is in your hood, Travis, so get on it.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.600
Oh, yeah. He's a big fan. He filmed a movie here, bought a house here. Loves it.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.720
Loves it over the Rhine.

04:38.320 --> 04:45.040
Okay. I've looped in PJ and Alex from Reply All because they do some internet investigations,

04:45.040 --> 04:48.480
so I'm trying to get them on it. I do have Danny Tamberelli,

04:48.480 --> 04:52.800
little p, is involved with this discussion. It's big.

04:52.800 --> 04:59.440
And then someone was like, I think it was PJ, actually said, according to this,

04:59.440 --> 05:06.720
it's because of a single unlicensed Luscious Jackson song that was on an episode that Nick

05:06.720 --> 05:11.840
didn't get the rights to. And then I tweeted about that, and then Luscious Jackson comes back

05:11.840 --> 05:17.200
on their official Twitter feed and is like, pardon, no one has ever spoken to us about it

05:17.200 --> 05:21.280
from Nickelodeon. We are open to talking about it. So I don't know, Nick. You tell me.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.000
Oh, shit, building bridges.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.360
You tell me, y'all.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.760
Let me check. Oh, Justin, I just checked my GPS tracker and it seems like the ball

05:28.560 --> 05:29.680
is in their courts.

05:29.680 --> 05:34.560
Yeah. It seems like, listen, it's not up to Luscious because Luscious Jackson is down.

05:34.560 --> 05:42.400
It's not up to little p, because he's down. I haven't heard from big p yet. I can't imagine

05:42.400 --> 05:44.640
he's the one standing in the way. So you tell me.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.120
Who is it?

05:45.120 --> 05:45.920
Endless Mike.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.960
Is Endless Mike in the way?

05:46.960 --> 05:48.160
Might be Endless Mike.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.360
Is it Rick Gomez?

05:49.360 --> 05:52.000
Get at us, Rick Gomez. Lift the van.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.880
The problem, I think the hardest part about this campaign, and it has been difficult and

05:56.880 --> 06:01.680
challenging for me in mind, the problem is that I'm also trying to get into the movie

06:01.680 --> 06:07.520
Trolls 2 or Trolls Will 2 or now if you prefer. So I can only tap resources that I don't think

06:08.880 --> 06:15.600
necessarily will aid me in getting into the movie Trolls 2. So I am trying to keep these two.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.280
I can't put the full force of my efforts behind it.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.800
Have you guys ever thought about the fact that the three of us are basically living

06:22.800 --> 06:29.360
our lives as if they are big dumb Christmas lists made by large children who are just like,

06:29.360 --> 06:34.560
I want to be in Trolls and I want the Pete and Pete 3 on DVD and I want to be Jimmy

06:34.560 --> 06:38.960
Buffett's best friend and I want to do a high five to Emilio Estevez. And it's like,

06:39.520 --> 06:44.880
whatever forces govern sort of the universe are like, okay, let's see what we can do.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.800
Let's see what we can do to get you in the picture.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.520
It really makes me think that like the McElroy brothers, not the three of us,

06:51.520 --> 06:57.360
but I mean the idea of us, our careers might be dying and everyone's just really nice to us.

06:58.160 --> 07:03.360
No doubt about that. Yeah, I've seen the numbers. I've seen the figures.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.920
Let's get into the questions before we do one quick update. I think I just gave myself

07:07.920 --> 07:13.200
food poisoning with the old hot dogs I ate for lunch. Now they're from 4th of July.

07:13.200 --> 07:19.360
I know they're from 4th of July and they were still in the package. I figured they were okay,

07:19.360 --> 07:23.920
but I'm starting to feel, you know how you start to like feel it and I'm just starting to feel it.

07:23.920 --> 07:30.160
So let's get going. And I just wanted to set you guys up for that. We might have to stop.

07:30.160 --> 07:34.640
Okay. Well, I consider myself ward now, I guess. Good.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.960
Let's get into it. Here's our first question. I live on the third floor of an apartment building.

07:40.960 --> 07:47.040
One day after coming home from a run, the lady who lives on the bottom left of my building

07:47.040 --> 07:53.200
whispered, come here, and gestured to her door. As I walked to her door, she went inside and I

07:53.200 --> 07:56.960
waited outside for a couple of minutes. And then she came back with a box of chocolates.

07:57.760 --> 08:02.640
But before she could hand them to me, she asked me where I live. I told her I lived on the top

08:02.640 --> 08:07.600
right of our building. She then frowned, shook her head and put the box of chocolates away.

08:07.600 --> 08:13.040
She told me she thought I was the woman who lived on the top left and then closed the door.

08:13.840 --> 08:18.000
I couldn't have eaten the chocolate anyway, but I was very sad that she took them away.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.640
The woman she was talking about looks nothing like me anyway. What did the woman across from me

08:23.200 --> 08:29.200
do to deserve chocolate? How do I prove to the old lady that I am also deserving of chocolate?

08:29.200 --> 08:33.520
That's from Sad About Sweets in San Diego. Now, normally this is an advice show,

08:33.520 --> 08:39.760
but Sad About Sweets has asked us to dip our toes into what? Prognostication?

08:40.400 --> 08:41.200
Mind reading?

08:41.200 --> 08:43.280
More like life coaching, I think.

08:43.280 --> 08:49.760
Yeah, I got some life coaching and it's, I can highlight four different places you fucked up

08:49.760 --> 08:57.680
so bad. It's almost a one per sentence, which is a pretty good ratio. Let's see, a stranger opens

08:57.680 --> 09:04.800
the door in your apartment building and they say from their room, come here, and then you oblige,

09:04.800 --> 09:13.680
that's one, that's one, that's one off the bat. They hand out some chocolate and then they pull

09:13.680 --> 09:18.320
it back real quick and you continue staying there, that's two. They say, where do you live, you

09:19.040 --> 09:20.640
answer three.

09:20.640 --> 09:28.400
This is, listen, I know it's too late to pick a theme for 2018, but I think part of it should be,

09:28.400 --> 09:32.640
don't tell anyone where you live, unless they know, unless they know.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.560
In general, they don't give you the chocolate, which you couldn't have eaten anyway,

09:36.560 --> 09:40.160
but you were still sad about. The fact that you were sad about that you didn't eat these

09:40.880 --> 09:48.720
neurotoxin filled chocolates is like wild to me. It is wild to me. Do you want to know what the

09:48.720 --> 09:54.000
person did that lived on the floor above on the left over them where they live on the bottom left,

09:54.000 --> 09:57.920
they stomp it too loud. They do a stomp and they do a dance and it's too loud.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.240
They do the stomp when the neighbor's parent is trying to sleep and now they're having to die

10:02.240 --> 10:02.560
for it.

10:02.560 --> 10:11.440
Yeah, and they're having to eat the neurotoxin to get very, very, very sick forever. It's weird

10:11.440 --> 10:18.160
because you're so good, but you're also so bad and you got to just take a look at it and think

10:18.160 --> 10:22.400
a little bit better when you think your thoughts when people sort of confront you with a situation

10:22.400 --> 10:23.280
like this.

10:23.280 --> 10:30.480
I will also say, one of my favorite, like top 10 favorite things about being an adult

10:30.480 --> 10:36.960
is I no longer have to earn candy from it. Like, I don't have to go trick or treating.

10:36.960 --> 10:42.880
I don't have to like hope that somebody in my class splurges on buying everybody those four

10:42.880 --> 10:50.640
chocolate, peanuts, Valentine's things. Like if I want candy, I can just go get it.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.440
No question.

10:51.440 --> 10:58.240
So the idea of wasting a single thought after this of like, I have to be living a day. No,

10:58.240 --> 11:02.960
if you want something, go get it. You don't have to take handouts from anybody.

11:02.960 --> 11:08.000
I watched one of those YouTube movies where they made skittles, but like in a kitchen,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.920
and I said, man, those look good. And it was about 1130 at night. I was like, wow,

11:11.920 --> 11:16.240
those look really tasty. And I was like, oh, that's right. I'm 31. And I went and I got

11:16.240 --> 11:20.000
in the car, drove to the gas station, got some skittles, came home, ate them all.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.800
Had a hard time going to sleep because all the skittle energy inside of me, but I did

11:24.800 --> 11:26.000
it because I could.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.080
Sold my Spanish teacher some skittles for a fundraiser once. And later I asked how they

11:32.080 --> 11:36.240
were. She said they're really good, but they're so sweet. She had to cut them in half.

11:37.120 --> 11:37.840
Whoa.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.280
She's a thrilling woman.

11:39.280 --> 11:44.320
That doesn't make, I guess, unless you're eating them half at a time.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.880
Hey, you own a Yahoo?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.080
Yeah, I'd love that, Griff.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.680
All right. All right. I mean, this one was sent in by Adrian Calles. Thanks, Adrian.

11:51.680 --> 11:56.400
It's an anonymous Yahoo answer user, but I'll call him the Geico Lizard asks,

11:58.400 --> 12:01.360
what would you do if someone laughed at your telescope?

12:02.320 --> 12:04.400
Oh man. Tell me about it.

12:04.400 --> 12:12.560
Oh, you're just trying to get away from the jocks on earth by putting your head in the

12:12.560 --> 12:17.360
clouds up in the stars, looking at God's great creation, checking out some of your favorite

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
constellations. I'm talking about Virgo and Sagittarius and all the great ones. Gemini

12:26.000 --> 12:26.960
is up there too.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.160
The big ones.

12:28.160 --> 12:35.040
Then all of a sudden, a bigger scientist comes over and says like, oh, is that it?

12:35.680 --> 12:39.920
You may as well be using a little paper towel tube, you little putts.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.200
And that makes me feel like shit.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.200
I think the worst case scenario would be like, you're looking through your telescope,

12:47.200 --> 12:54.560
you look at like Mercury or Venus or whatever, and you see an alien with a telescope that's way

12:54.560 --> 12:59.680
nicer than yours. And you can see through your telescope, though it's a little blurry, that alien

12:59.680 --> 13:02.720
talking to their friends and pointing at you and laughing.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.440
Oh no.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.720
And you're like, there's life out there and they think I'm a dingus.

13:08.480 --> 13:13.440
Yeah, they've like written on the face of Neptune, like huff my shorts, Daryl.

13:15.120 --> 13:20.480
Ow, that would hurt so bad. You spend your whole life dreaming of like, oh, I wonder if there are

13:20.480 --> 13:24.960
aliens. And you're like, there are, and they're making fun of me. Oh.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.360
I don't like when people feel the need to point out that my telescope is made of cardboard

13:29.360 --> 13:35.440
and has no lenses in it and does not increase the distance that I can see.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.480
No, it's just a cardboard tube.

13:38.480 --> 13:44.800
And I can't, I don't know how to get one of the big telescopes. And if I did spend the money on

13:44.800 --> 13:49.440
it, I wouldn't know how to use it. So can a kid just have some fun with a cardboard tube,

13:49.440 --> 13:53.520
pretend he's a space pirate looking for his next celestial plunder?

13:54.800 --> 13:59.200
Yeah, I don't see any problem with that juice. That's just an imagination.

13:59.200 --> 13:59.600
That's what I call that.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.360
I think I'll get off my case about it.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.320
I think a power move, if somebody was like, oh, that's a real dinky telescope,

14:06.320 --> 14:10.880
you just suddenly tip it towards the ground and say, it's a microscope, asshole.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.160
And now they look dumb.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.080
I just added upside down for a second so I could polish the lens.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.720
Now you look stupid, Steve.

14:20.720 --> 14:25.760
You know what I'm going to use this to look at? Your dignity.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.440
Because it's minuscule now.

14:28.080 --> 14:28.960
Got them.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.960
You do that with their muscles too. Like, oh, I guess it is because I'm looking at your

14:32.960 --> 14:35.520
muscles and there's nothing there, noodles.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.080
You can make fun of how weak they are because they don't have any muscles.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.440
You can't see them even with a really good, a decent telescope. It's not the best.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.160
It's not great.

14:44.160 --> 14:50.480
Yeah, so there's a lot of things you can do with a telescope bully to hurt them.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.760
Maybe shine light through one end so it magnifies it.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.640
Oh, a laser beam.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.600
No, wait, hold on.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.920
No, that doesn't work. That's not right.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.280
I'm thinking of a magnifying glass.

15:03.360 --> 15:10.720
Could you tell them that this is a model of one that you are going to order and that the

15:10.720 --> 15:15.680
salesman is so eager to book this sale that he brought you a model of the one you're considering

15:15.680 --> 15:18.720
so you can really see if it's the right fit for you.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.760
Because you're such a whale, but they're so happy to get you.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.000
They're like really buttering you up.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.080
They left one of their samples there with you.

15:27.120 --> 15:33.360
Ooh, or maybe like scratch like in the Tyson in it.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.000
And then when someone's like, that's a dinky telescope, like, oh, is it?

15:36.560 --> 15:37.280
And then spin it around.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.240
They're like, oh shit, that was Neil deGrasse Tyson's telescope.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.680
And it's not true, of course.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.480
You say, yes, I stole it from him.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.160
I made it mine because I took it.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.640
So now I see the stars.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.080
Yeah, he's dropped off, hadn't he?

15:54.080 --> 15:55.760
Haven't seen him doing his tweets lately.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.880
It's sort of holier than thou space tweets.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.560
Well, that's because he doesn't know how to see it anymore because I took his favorite

16:02.560 --> 16:03.280
telescope.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.760
So only I can see the moon.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.440
And now I'm the space king.

16:07.440 --> 16:12.160
So you could take your telescope and hit it against their telescope until a break.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.800
So you'd be like, hmm, it seems like both our telescopes are now bad.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.400
Seems like we both have bad telescopes.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
How do telescopes work, Justin?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.840
Here's one thing you could trick.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.520
They have two different glasses on.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.160
Here's something you could try.

16:26.160 --> 16:29.920
When they're not, they make fun of it and you turn around, like they just hurt your

16:29.920 --> 16:32.560
feelings because they're right before your telescope.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.440
And I bet when you turn around, they probably even go harder on it.

16:35.440 --> 16:40.000
You know what I mean, like they're like making fun of even the color and the second rate

16:40.000 --> 16:41.920
brand of your telescope.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.960
And then when you turn around, you hold it up and what have you written there on the

16:44.960 --> 16:45.760
telescope?

16:45.760 --> 16:46.560
It's their name.

16:47.200 --> 16:56.080
And it's like, I think this one is your telescope and I was keeping it for you for a second.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.040
Oh, okay.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.880
I thought you were saying this telescope is you when you were making fun of yourself.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.960
Okay, third possibility.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.680
It's also, well, I got it for you as a gift.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.920
That's a good one because you could do you have so many options you do once you pull

17:09.920 --> 17:10.720
off the move.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.840
Another thing you could do is as you're looking at telescope and something comes on says,

17:13.840 --> 17:18.880
hey, shithead dumb telescope, you kind of pull away from it and smile and look at him.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.400
You just kind of stand there smiling and they're like, what are you smiling at?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.960
And then a meteor hits them and kills them.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.480
It's pretty good.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.600
That's a good move.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.960
And you walk away whistling.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.160
Don't worry, be happy.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.160
That's a pretty good move.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.840
And it's like the end of my sort of like science coming of age movie.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.360
How about another question?

17:39.360 --> 17:41.120
Would you all be okay with that?

17:41.120 --> 17:41.840
Greetings, brothers.

17:41.840 --> 17:46.880
I frequently go hiking, but my legs are very long and I often find myself passing slower

17:46.880 --> 17:47.360
hikers.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.880
I don't like to raise my voice, especially out in the serenity of the wild.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.200
So usually just try stomping my feet real hard to get their attention.

17:55.200 --> 17:55.700
What?

17:56.480 --> 18:00.640
Very often, though, people have headphones in or just don't hear me stomping and I end

18:00.640 --> 18:06.320
up shouting, hey, or excuse me, just before I pass them to avoid getting punched.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.240
This tends to scare the hell out of people.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.600
And I'm wondering if there's something I could be doing differently.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.160
Do I need to speak up as soon as I see them?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.480
Should I carry a cowbell with me?

18:16.480 --> 18:19.600
That's from Sneakings Too Easy in East Tennessee.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.320
This is great.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.280
Who are these people going hiking with headphones on?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.440
How are you going to hear bears and shit?

18:25.440 --> 18:26.880
No, they're listening to bears.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.400
Wait, what?

18:28.400 --> 18:36.880
Yeah, they're listening to bear sound playlist on Spotify, just because you're not always

18:36.880 --> 18:38.080
seeing bears.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.120
So if you want a 24-7 bear experience.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.880
Griffin, I meant for safety, not for enjoyment.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.760
Like, no, I went hiking and I didn't see any bears.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.280
Well, that's good.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.760
A bear is dangerous, but the sound they make is beautiful.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.720
Beautiful choir.

18:52.720 --> 19:01.680
Is the impetus on Tennessee for making their hiking trails so conducive to sneakers?

19:02.640 --> 19:09.200
It seems like they need to have maybe some more mirrors on the trail and some more sort

19:09.200 --> 19:11.760
of crackly tinder, perhaps.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.040
Is that something that's an option?

19:13.680 --> 19:14.960
Crackly tinder?

19:14.960 --> 19:18.640
Just like tinder, like leaves and branches, you know, tinder.

19:18.640 --> 19:23.120
Like, I'm using it like a fire sense, but like, you know, leaves and branches on the

19:23.120 --> 19:24.080
forest floor.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.120
The crunchy stuff.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.760
The crunchy stuff.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.560
More croutons, more pretzels, more peanut shells.

19:30.560 --> 19:30.960
Thank you.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.360
More melba toast there on the floor.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.800
You know, crunchy things.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.080
The crunchy stuff.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.280
You know.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.680
I love this question so much.

19:40.320 --> 19:47.040
There seems to be like a broad category of flawed human interaction and that it starts

19:47.040 --> 19:50.960
with like baseline level, you're at the grocery store and you're walking towards a person

19:50.960 --> 19:54.800
and you both overcorrect, like you both try to get out of each other's way but keep getting

19:54.800 --> 19:56.800
in each other's way and you do it like nine times.

19:56.800 --> 20:02.400
Just sort of moving around other human beings is a real fucked up bad process, it feels

20:02.400 --> 20:02.960
like.

20:02.960 --> 20:08.560
And this is the pinnacle of that, I think, because you are already in sort of a heightened

20:08.560 --> 20:13.120
sort of like nature defense state when you're out on the trails.

20:13.120 --> 20:17.840
Can I admit something about the little grocery store shuffle?

20:18.800 --> 20:25.600
I am somebody who is desperate for human emotion, or human connection rather.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.160
What?

20:26.160 --> 20:29.440
I live, like I work out of my house, right?

20:29.440 --> 20:33.600
So like when I leave the house and especially if like my family's not around that day or

20:33.600 --> 20:36.320
whatever, I leave the house it's like, oh, people.

20:36.320 --> 20:41.200
But I'm also like an incredibly awkward person in like a social sense.

20:41.200 --> 20:48.080
There is nothing that I delight in, dare I say, revel in as the grocery store shuffle

20:48.080 --> 20:54.160
because just for a moment I have a connection with another person that is based on the both

20:54.160 --> 20:55.600
of us fucking up.

20:55.600 --> 21:02.800
And wow, and that is so, not me fucking up and dropping a big jar of pickles on my foot

21:02.800 --> 21:04.240
and everybody's having a laugh.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.000
That's a connection of another sort.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.920
This is one where we both, we've started this conversation with the phrase, I'm human, I'm

21:11.920 --> 21:15.360
fallible, I'm Justin, what's up?

21:15.360 --> 21:20.000
Justin to that same point, my favorite, that kind of connection, my favorite connection

21:20.000 --> 21:22.640
is the entirely perceived connection.

21:23.280 --> 21:29.040
So like when you find yourself similarly at a grocery store going the opposite direction

21:29.040 --> 21:34.560
of someone else, so you keep like meeting in the middle of aisles, so by the end of

21:34.560 --> 21:39.760
it, you have not interacted at all, but you have become familiar with them.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.040
Yes, very aware.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.640
I love that.

21:42.640 --> 21:47.280
Or like if you're on a long stretch of highway and like you and the same car kind of keep

21:47.280 --> 21:51.520
passing each other, you have not like spoken.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.360
You don't know who that is, but you're like, you and me, red car, we're in this together.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.400
That's real, that's real love.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.640
The card thing is like, that's where like 50% of marriages get started.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.680
The other 50% is like, I'm at match.com.

22:05.680 --> 22:11.520
Another road phenomenon, I just drove to and back Cincinnati in like 48 hours, so I've

22:11.520 --> 22:12.640
been on the road quite a bit.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.400
Another road phenomenon I was thinking about today, this is sort of in the same category

22:16.400 --> 22:18.160
of like interactions with strangers.

22:19.520 --> 22:28.160
Isn't it a weird moment where you watch someone be a total fucking idiot in the driving capacity

22:28.160 --> 22:30.720
for I mean, miles and miles.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.640
It could go on for like a long time and you just watch someone do the dumbest shit.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.920
They're like tailgating trucks.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.920
They can't see them and cutting you off.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.360
And there's that there's a moment if you pass them where you get to look over and you're

22:41.360 --> 22:45.840
like, I'm about to see what the stupidest fucking person on earth looks like.

22:45.840 --> 22:50.080
And you're imagining in your head like how dumb they're gonna look and what a piece of

22:50.080 --> 22:55.200
shit and how mean and stupid and petty their face is gonna be.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.400
It's always a let down.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.120
They never look as hateful and like a literal.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.720
It's never like the Noyb.

23:00.720 --> 23:08.400
It's never like Oscar the Grouch like, that's right, I drive too.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.440
OK, we're so far away from it.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.040
What what what's the solution?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.080
I will answer this.

23:14.080 --> 23:19.040
Why is it your responsibility that other people have made themselves so murderable?

23:19.680 --> 23:24.800
Why are you you're letting them pass the buck on to you and making you they should be trying

23:24.800 --> 23:27.760
to not get murdered and that is not your problem.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.520
They need to have their head on a swivel.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.240
It's not fair.

23:30.240 --> 23:30.880
It's not fair.

23:30.880 --> 23:35.680
But if I was this person, I was walking around listening to my bear sounds and I was on the

23:35.680 --> 23:40.640
trail and, you know, I got those primal instincts just flowing through me.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.960
And then I shaped that wasn't there before.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.960
And suddenly is there inches away from me to my side trying to pass me?

23:47.520 --> 23:51.120
I would I would react with a startled, you know, roundhouse kick.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.760
And that's not that's not fair.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.720
But that's the situation.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.320
So can you just sort of sprint like when you get close to a person?

23:58.320 --> 24:00.480
Can you just run past them real fast?

24:00.480 --> 24:05.040
And the fun thing about that is you can also look back and look really scared as if something's

24:05.040 --> 24:05.600
chasing you.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.240
I do like that.

24:08.240 --> 24:13.920
Do you really want to give someone the experience of looking behind them and seeing a long legged

24:13.920 --> 24:15.760
monster sprinting at them?

24:15.760 --> 24:16.560
Now you're in front of them.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.760
You're in front of them at that point.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.600
There's a scary monster behind them, though.

24:20.480 --> 24:24.080
What if OK, what if rather than sprinting past them?

24:24.080 --> 24:29.440
I'm just when you get close enough, you do a really like ballet leap.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.520
That's just like super fucking graceful.

24:33.520 --> 24:37.520
And out of the corner of their eye, they're just like a deer, a gazelle.

24:37.520 --> 24:38.960
Oh, I wouldn't punch that.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.000
Right.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.440
And they're like, no, that was just an amazing human being.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.280
And then you're off.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.720
That's a good point.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.120
You do a little Lion King makeup.

24:50.320 --> 24:50.640
Yes.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.360
You know what?

24:51.360 --> 24:52.320
Lean into it.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.400
Yeah, borrow that Lion King makeup from the musical and do like an antelope and just go

24:56.400 --> 24:58.720
springing through the right past them.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.240
They'll be scared for a second until they see how beautiful you look and graceful.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.440
So here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Stacy Trombone.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.240
Thank you, Stacy.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.640
It's from Yahoo Answers user who is anonymous.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.640
So I'm going to call him Ted Heaton, the third State Farm agent.

25:15.120 --> 25:19.120
Just got an ad here for Ted and he looks he looks very agreeable.

25:19.120 --> 25:25.120
And so Ted asks, what is the right way to scold my lovebird when he does something wrong?

25:27.120 --> 25:28.000
It's a real bird.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.520
Yeah, we're talking about a real bird.

25:29.520 --> 25:34.320
It's sort of a parrot, a type of parrot, like a little parrot guy.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.560
If it wasn't though.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.520
Oh, shit.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.000
No, okay.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.600
It's in category pets, birds.

25:39.600 --> 25:46.720
So this is not like you could read this like, what is the right way to scold my lovebird?

25:46.720 --> 25:50.880
My fucking parrot.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.720
What's wrong, Justin?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.760
I got an answer for you.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.920
I decided to go ahead and give you guys this.

25:57.920 --> 26:04.000
You know, it's so rare that we are actually helpful on this show that I just wanted to

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
give you guys some real helpful tips.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.120
Okay, punish this bird.

26:09.120 --> 26:14.080
Here's the rules of avian trading according to the sprucepets.com.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.600
There's three.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.480
There's just three.

26:16.480 --> 26:20.640
And let's hope we can keep these tips straight.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.600
Number one, never hit a bird.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.520
Yeah, guys.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.440
Yeah, for sure.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.400
Yeah, for sure.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.040
Definitely.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.760
Birds are extremely fragile creatures.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.120
Yeah, no shit.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.320
The slightest force can cause severe injury or death.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.520
Maybe an ostrich, I might feel comfortable hitting in an extreme circumstance.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.720
You still shouldn't.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.920
All right, rule number two, don't hold a grudge.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.680
Birds are intelligent, but also very sensitive creatures.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.840
When you express displeasure with your bird's behavior, make the lesson short and sweet.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.440
Prolonged negative attention can cause undue emotional stress for your pet.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.760
Rule number three is never compromise your bird's health.

27:06.480 --> 27:11.200
Don't punish your bird by withholding food or neglecting cage cleaning.

27:11.200 --> 27:17.040
What is the, it is so wild to me that there is a human being that is one, an owner of a bird,

27:17.040 --> 27:22.560
and two, an owner of a bird that thinks that they're going to let their bird live in filth

27:22.560 --> 27:25.600
to inspire it to better its existence.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.440
Like, it's a bird.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.200
So how, this, they're so delicate.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.080
They're so, so delicate.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.280
We're not gonna punch him.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.400
We've got that.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.920
What is the right way then to scold my lovebird when he does something wrong?

27:38.720 --> 27:39.680
Oh, you know what?

27:39.680 --> 27:41.280
Maybe love more.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.800
Maybe say like, I understand why you're doing this.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.000
It's my fault.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.600
That's probably the right answer, yeah.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.560
But the better answer I think is to, they're probably in a cage.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.320
Put their cage right in front of the TV.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.520
Put it on episode of Frasier.

27:54.080 --> 27:58.400
And then right when it's like two minutes from done, you stop it.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.240
Oh, it's gonna be stuck in their head all week.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.160
But how did he get out of this one?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.400
And you can keep doing that with the whole series.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.840
But you would go like in the bathroom and finish the last couple minutes yourself.

28:09.840 --> 28:10.720
Because you don't want to.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.640
Don't subject yourself to that kind of torture.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.320
You didn't refuse to eat seeds.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.520
The bird did.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.400
Yeah, so.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.400
Yeah, you didn't yell so loud that your cousin woke up.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.280
The bird did that.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.160
So the bird deserves the Frasier blue balls, but not you.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.080
Because you didn't yell that so loud your cousin woke up from a big nap.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.560
An important nap that caused them to work the night shift.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.520
And you know they were tired, but it wasn't you.

28:39.520 --> 28:44.640
You didn't shit in one of your Burger King Batman Forever collectible mugs.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.360
Your bird did.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.360
The bird did that.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.200
And your bird can't pretend like they didn't know that cup was important to you.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.440
They clearly know how to speak English.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.640
And they know how you feel about Jim Carrey as the Riddler.

28:56.640 --> 29:01.760
So you can wash it, but then the frosting of the mug is gonna come off.

29:01.760 --> 29:02.000
Thank you.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.480
Yeah, nobody wants to talk about it, but it's true.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.320
Let's take a break real quick and go over to the Money Zone.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.280
How would that treat you guys?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.360
Okay, let's go.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.840
I want to tell you about my unders.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.280
Yeah.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.360
As it is colloquially known.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.760
Your dumpster, your dumpster card.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.480
What?

29:32.480 --> 29:33.600
Your dumpster card.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.640
It guards your dumpster.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.080
I would like to tell you about my caboose cover.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.920
All right, MeUndies is our sponsor.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.360
Okay, well, it's true.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.600
They probably want us to say the name of their company.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.200
I mean, it's a Venn diagram.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.240
They make a hell of a dumpster guard, but that's not the name of the company.

29:50.240 --> 29:54.560
If you've listened to four episodes of My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

29:54.560 --> 29:57.040
you've probably heard us talk about MeUndies at least once.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.080
And they are my favorite underpants.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.000
And it's not just underpants.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.160
They've got brassiere options.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.920
They've got pants options.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.520
They've got a really great hoodie, like zip up hoodie.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.160
Their socks are incredible.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.400
So for right now, I want you to stop what you're doing.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.320
Go to meundies.com and take a look.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.000
And I'm going to make it even better for you

30:18.000 --> 30:19.360
because we have a deal for our listeners.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.200
First time purchasers are going to get 15% off their first pair of MeUndies

30:23.200 --> 30:28.880
and free shipping that's 15% off plus free shipping and 100% satisfaction guarantee.

30:28.880 --> 30:32.880
So go to meundies.com slash my brother.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.120
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.760
Get 15% off your first pair, free shipping.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.880
Go meundies.com slash my brother.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.680
Hell yeah.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.800
Hey, can I tell you about Quip?

30:44.320 --> 30:48.000
Not unless you love it more than I do, which is unlikely.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.840
Okay, why don't you tell me about Quip?

30:49.840 --> 30:53.200
You know, most toothbrush brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks

30:53.200 --> 30:56.720
rather than better brushing, but not Quip.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.520
Quip is a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes

30:59.520 --> 31:04.560
and packs premium vibrations for a perfect two minute clean.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.360
Plus the guiding pulses remind you when to switch sides

31:07.360 --> 31:11.280
and they'll deliver new brush heads on a dentist recommended schedule

31:11.280 --> 31:15.520
every three months for just $5, including free shipping worldwide.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.400
I've been using my Quip for quite a few months.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.520
I love so much about it.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.160
One, no dumb charger.

31:22.160 --> 31:26.160
You just put in a battery and it works for months.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.280
It has a case that flips over and goes onto the top

31:31.280 --> 31:33.360
and it turns it into a travel case.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.280
Otherwise, it's like a very discreet stand

31:35.280 --> 31:37.440
that you can actually use this reusable adhesive

31:37.440 --> 31:39.040
to stick to something to get it out of the way.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.640
The pulses are nice.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.520
They remind you to brush.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.040
The subscription thing is so cool

31:43.040 --> 31:47.040
because who remembers every three months

31:47.040 --> 31:47.920
to change your toothbrush?

31:47.920 --> 31:48.400
You don't.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.800
But Quip shows up with a fresh battery

31:50.800 --> 31:52.480
with a head for the toothbrush.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.080
It's like, hey, I don't want to be weird about it,

31:56.080 --> 31:59.520
but it's nasty now and you should get a new one.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.240
And then you do and it's easy.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.280
You don't have to go to the drugstore or anything.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.240
You just get it and use it and it's nice to use.

32:06.240 --> 32:06.880
It looks great.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.680
I don't know.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.480
I love this toothbrush.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.560
Quip starts at just $25.

32:10.560 --> 32:16.080
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now,

32:16.080 --> 32:18.640
you'll get your first refill pack free

32:19.360 --> 32:21.680
with a Quip electric toothbrush.

32:21.680 --> 32:27.200
It's spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash my brother.

32:27.200 --> 32:27.680
Check it out.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.200
You will not be disappointed.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.880
Hey, how about a Jumbotron?

32:31.760 --> 32:34.240
Okay, this one's for JP or perhaps Jape.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.720
And it's from Meg who tells Jape,

32:37.680 --> 32:40.080
happy first anniversary, my baby.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.920
That's M-Y-B-B-Y, one word.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.720
So my baby.

32:42.720 --> 32:46.640
This past year has been the best ever from an adorable role

32:46.640 --> 32:49.600
for initiative first date to buying us a house.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.240
I couldn't ask for a better life partner.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.240
Also, thank you for letting me cry so much

32:54.240 --> 32:56.560
because you are my emotional vacuum.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.320
I love you and I like you.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.120
Your baby.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.040
Your baby.

33:01.040 --> 33:01.840
Good love here.

33:01.840 --> 33:05.440
And one, it sounds like very, very eventful year

33:05.440 --> 33:06.960
from first date to buying a house.

33:07.840 --> 33:08.800
Congratulations.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.840
Congratulations.

33:09.840 --> 33:13.520
Congratulations and that's just a great partnership.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.280
I would give it a 10 out of 10, so.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.280
Well, I'm gonna say 9.9 out of 10

33:19.280 --> 33:21.760
because I always like to leave a little bit of room there.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.520
So that someone's like, yeah, we did really good.

33:23.520 --> 33:24.400
But you know what?

33:24.400 --> 33:29.040
Let's work on our communication and maybe buy some more plates.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.960
Yeah, it's aspirational.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.920
Yeah, it still gives people a thing to shoot for.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.760
This next message is from Michael and Jesse

33:37.760 --> 33:39.760
and it's for Jackson Yoder.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.680
Dear Jackson, may you always puff the fattest clouds

33:43.680 --> 33:45.680
in 2018 and beyond.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.400
That's great.

33:46.400 --> 33:51.120
Happy birthday, my dude, from your companions in sadness,

33:51.120 --> 33:53.120
Michael and Jesse.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.120
And if you're enjoying a vape right now,

33:55.120 --> 33:58.800
let's just do one, a big rip, just sort of across the country.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.040
Let them see like, you know what I'm saying?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.480
Cotton across America.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.000
Just like around the world.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.360
Cover this country in cloud and Jackson will know what's up.

34:07.360 --> 34:13.680
Three, two, one, rip and blow that shit.

34:13.680 --> 34:14.180
Yes.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.680
Justin, you want to read this next one?

34:17.680 --> 34:18.800
Hell yeah.

34:18.800 --> 34:22.960
This is for the KGB from Murphy.

34:22.960 --> 34:27.120
It says, we have an event or a booth or elections or something.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.840
I'm so glad to share this wonderful macro content

34:29.840 --> 34:30.800
with you guys.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.480
Thank you for making my ears at CMU so amazing and memorable.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.720
Keep being the awesome people you are

34:36.720 --> 34:39.520
and I'll see you as soon as you can build a structural house

34:39.520 --> 34:40.800
in less than a week.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.960
Motion to purple and get faux.

34:42.960 --> 34:46.320
Man, there is just a lot of coded language in that one.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.720
Is that actually for the KGB?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.080
Maybe it's, that's a nerve pain.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.440
It might have been.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.040
That's cool though, if it is, because it's like,

34:55.040 --> 34:56.400
now we're part of it, you know?

34:56.960 --> 34:59.840
That's the big conspiracy, I guess.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.880
Yeah, we can't get back out at this point.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.080
Now we're too deep in it.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.600
Too deep, way too deep.

35:05.600 --> 35:09.840
Real exciting and also, I think you said,

35:09.840 --> 35:12.880
thanks for making my ears at CMU so amazing.

35:12.880 --> 35:13.600
No, I didn't.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.480
My ears, there's two Y sounds.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.480
You said ears and so I just wanted to-

35:18.480 --> 35:19.920
We did say ears.

35:19.920 --> 35:20.880
It did sound like it.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.040
So I just wanted to dunk on you real fast.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.000
Okay, listen to it.

35:24.000 --> 35:24.480
My ears.

35:24.480 --> 35:24.980
Sky high!

35:26.400 --> 35:31.600
Okay, you say it together at a reasonable pace.

35:31.600 --> 35:37.040
At a reasonable pace, sure, thank you all for making my ears.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.920
Okay, do you see what you did there?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.440
Sky high, half court!

35:41.440 --> 35:44.720
Completely unnatural, no one talks like that.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.400
Beginning this summer,

35:46.400 --> 35:49.360
you can listen to new episodes of Inside Pop every other week

35:49.360 --> 35:52.400
for an even deeper dive inside the world of pop culture.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.440
Now we're still bringing you our brilliant insight,

35:55.440 --> 35:56.960
always on the nose opinions,

35:56.960 --> 35:58.880
and insider-y inside information

35:58.880 --> 36:01.360
on the most interesting pop culture stories of the week.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.200
And we'll also have interviews with the pop culture professionals

36:05.200 --> 36:07.200
who create the culture you crave.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.120
For example, we'll speak to casting directors

36:09.120 --> 36:12.000
about how they find the right talent for the right role.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.520
We'll talk to music supervisors

36:13.520 --> 36:16.640
about how they choose the music to create the right mood.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.760
And we'll grill producers,

36:17.760 --> 36:20.640
we'll discuss what exactly a producer does.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.600
Oh man, Sean, how many times has someone said to you,

36:23.600 --> 36:26.080
oh, you're a producer, so what do you actually do?

36:26.080 --> 36:28.400
So. Many. Times.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.560
Same here.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.840
So make sure to catch Inside Pop every other Wednesday

36:33.840 --> 36:37.600
on Maximum Fun to indulge your pop culture obsessions.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.880
And to hear in-depth interviews from the movers and the shakers

36:40.880 --> 36:42.800
in TV, music, film, and more.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.640
Next question.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.760
Next question.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.280
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.000
That's not a question.

36:50.000 --> 36:58.640
That's not a question.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.400
God in heaven, oh no.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.560
The corn remix is brilliant.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.600
I want a munch!

37:15.440 --> 37:15.940
What?

37:15.940 --> 37:17.280
Too much!

37:17.280 --> 37:19.600
I don't care about that at all!

37:19.600 --> 37:21.760
No, no, no, no, no.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.560
No, no, no, no.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.000
I know.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.920
The Hummus and PitaCo prepares to launch Hummus ice cream.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.280
It's coming.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.320
Didn't we do the Hummus milkshake?

37:36.320 --> 37:39.360
We did do that in Detroit, so no one will ever hear it

37:39.360 --> 37:41.120
because it was part of our Star Wars show.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.880
On the heels of the successful May launch of the first Hummus shake,

37:44.880 --> 37:47.520
I'm so glad to hear it went well, by the way.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.240
And also, I should have mentioned this earlier,

37:50.240 --> 37:51.680
you can do the Hummus shake.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.360
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.640
Remember that meme?

37:54.640 --> 37:56.480
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.760
The brand's first ice cream will be available at the Hummus and PitaCo's

37:59.760 --> 38:03.040
Chelsea location beginning on National Ice Cream Day,

38:03.040 --> 38:05.920
have they no shame, this Sunday, July 15th,

38:05.920 --> 38:09.360
oops, at all locations beginning August 1st.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.520
Okay, so you still have time to prepare.

38:12.560 --> 38:16.000
It's all natural and made with good-for-you ingredients

38:16.000 --> 38:20.320
like protein-packed chickpeas, real tahini, and pure vanilla.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.720
The four available flavors get their sweetness only from ripe dates

38:24.720 --> 38:28.640
and creaminess from either almond milk or coconut cream.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.200
The indulgent chocolate flavor is made with almond milk.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.120
Their goal here, as near as I can tell,

38:33.120 --> 38:36.080
is to talk long enough that you forget that they put hummus in your ice cream.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.200
Yeah, sure.

38:37.200 --> 38:37.680
Gotcha.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.600
Straight out, though, can I tell you fool something?

38:40.800 --> 38:44.560
The idea of like sweet hummus, I'm on board.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.880
Graham crackers and chocolate hummus.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.160
I've heard it's good, I've heard it's good.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.720
I've had dessert hummus, that's not what I'm saying.

38:50.720 --> 38:55.040
I'm saying it's just a lot of hummus to eat.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.240
It's just the idea, I just have a problem with,

38:58.240 --> 39:02.160
I put a scoop of hummus on this cone, do you want to enjoy it?

39:02.160 --> 39:04.240
I'm sure it's very delicious.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.240
Sometimes you sit down in front of some hummus

39:06.240 --> 39:07.600
and maybe you're talking with friends.

39:08.320 --> 39:12.640
For me, the best time to have hummus and suddenly like all the hummus is gone

39:12.640 --> 39:15.440
and you realize like I just ate a shit ton of hummus.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.520
Maybe that's what this is for.

39:17.520 --> 39:21.120
Like, oh, I accidentally ate a lot of hummus.

39:21.120 --> 39:21.600
I am.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.680
The quote is very good on this one.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.200
It's from founder Dave Pesso.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.600
We never get them from the top.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.080
And this one comes straight from the top from Dave.

39:32.080 --> 39:36.240
We were so blown away by the popularity of the hummus shake.

39:36.240 --> 39:36.720
Indeed.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.040
Yes, I would imagine.

39:39.040 --> 39:44.400
Yes, that we knew we had to keep inventing new treats, says founder Dave Pesso.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.680
This all started when I developed the dessert hummus

39:47.680 --> 39:51.520
as a healthier alternative for my daughter.

39:51.520 --> 39:55.360
And the response from my family was so great

39:55.360 --> 39:58.480
that we wanted to share it with the hummus and pita co-guests.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.440
As a prank, as a goof.

40:01.440 --> 40:06.960
The fiction that Dave wants you to believe is he's at home from his day job

40:06.960 --> 40:10.320
of being the founder of the hummus and pita co-guests.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.840
He invents dessert hummus at his house

40:13.840 --> 40:19.760
and then as an afterthought decides to add it to the menu of his hummus company.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.680
Oh, and make some delicious hummus.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.880
Oh, you know who would like this?

40:22.880 --> 40:23.840
Do you know who would like this?

40:23.840 --> 40:27.920
The fucking company I founded that has hummus in the name.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.440
Are you fucking with me, Dave?

40:29.440 --> 40:32.960
Hey guys, I've got a weird thing to pitch at this board meeting.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.920
You know how we make hummus?

40:35.920 --> 40:38.640
Yeah, you're all nodding, okay?

40:38.640 --> 40:40.000
I made some hummus.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.360
Do you think we could maybe sell it?

40:44.080 --> 40:46.960
Who would I talk to about getting, oh, me?

40:46.960 --> 40:47.760
It's me?

40:47.760 --> 40:48.480
Okay, great.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.480
Great idea, self.

40:53.520 --> 40:57.840
It is also so good, the idea that Dave Pesso would make a treat

40:58.400 --> 41:01.440
that he would foist on his daughter,

41:01.440 --> 41:05.760
but it may not be good enough for the guests of the hummus and pita company.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.600
It's just good enough for his family.

41:08.240 --> 41:12.800
And here's what you don't know is that he also made her a hummus dog

41:12.800 --> 41:16.080
and a hummus bed and bought her her first hummus car.

41:16.080 --> 41:16.720
His hummus.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.800
I bet it tastes fine though.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.840
I bet it tastes good.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.120
I bet it tastes good.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.240
It's just a lot.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.560
I enjoy hummus and I've heard good reviews of the sweet hummus.

41:28.560 --> 41:36.000
It's just, for me, it's the removal of the act of dipping

41:36.000 --> 41:38.480
that then makes it hummus shake, hummus ice cream.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.760
I'm sure they taste good.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.560
I still know that I am scooping heaping helpings

41:42.560 --> 41:47.520
of just pure chickpea sort of mash into my gob.

41:47.520 --> 41:51.360
And that's the thing I have trouble sort of getting over, I guess.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.160
But wait, they call it ice cream.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.440
Is it non-dairy?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.480
It sounds like it.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.280
It sounds like it's just chickpeas and vanilla and tahini

41:59.280 --> 42:01.120
and almond milk or coconut cream.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.000
Yeah, I see.

42:02.000 --> 42:02.960
It's dairy.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.840
It's gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.520
Fuck, I bet this would go down real smooth.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.400
Okay, this might be the first Munch Squad you've done

42:12.400 --> 42:14.560
where I'm like, all right, I might fuck with this.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.760
I think it's only in New York,

42:15.760 --> 42:18.160
but we're going to be there after it launches.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.040
Let's get over there.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.160
Let's give it a shot.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.200
How about a Yahoo?

42:21.200 --> 42:21.920
Yeah, do it.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.360
Okay, this one was sent in by virtually every person

42:25.360 --> 42:26.640
who emailed us this week.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.480
I've not seen a consensus like this in some time.

42:30.480 --> 42:33.360
It's from another question mark user, so I'm going to call him.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.560
Four dogs working together to use a computer asks,

42:40.160 --> 42:43.920
would you be embarrassed if someone tried to kill you in public?

42:47.040 --> 42:50.240
Oh, golly, is my face red?

42:50.240 --> 42:53.600
You're at the party and there's a bunch of college drinking,

42:53.600 --> 42:58.240
going on party and dancing, listening to LMFAO,

42:58.240 --> 43:00.240
just the staple college party stuff.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.480
And then Screamface smashes in through the window

43:04.480 --> 43:06.720
and you're like, ah, fuck, I'm so sorry.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.800
I will pay for the window.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.760
This guy sucks ass and I'm so sorry.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.800
I did not invite him.

43:12.800 --> 43:16.640
He keeps trying to do a killing to me and it sucks.

43:17.840 --> 43:18.320
I'll leave.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.800
He's going to chase me down into the tunnel,

43:20.800 --> 43:23.680
but then he gets lost in the tunnel and he gets really tired

43:23.680 --> 43:25.520
because he's like not good at killing.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.760
So I can be back here in like a half hour.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.680
I could actually swing by Super America

43:29.680 --> 43:32.880
and pick up another 18 pack of Coors.

43:33.840 --> 43:34.720
Okay, bye.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.640
All right, see you, I gotta go.

43:36.640 --> 43:40.560
Ah, see, I was picturing more of like you're walking through

43:40.560 --> 43:43.360
perhaps like a square in Venice.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.840
It's beautiful buildings everywhere.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.720
Perhaps you're walking through like an outdoor cafe

43:48.720 --> 43:51.280
where people are sipping their espressos

43:51.280 --> 43:55.440
and suddenly as a sniper shoots you from atop a cathedral,

43:55.440 --> 43:58.160
they miss, but you're really embarrassed.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.600
Oh, everybody looks up from their espressos

44:01.600 --> 44:02.800
and they're like, who are you?

44:02.800 --> 44:04.800
And you're like, oh, I'm sorry.

44:05.440 --> 44:08.400
I'm sorry, please get back to your espressos.

44:08.400 --> 44:11.360
I just, I have some international secrets.

44:11.360 --> 44:17.120
I'm Doug Born and let's just say I'm sort of a hot target

44:17.120 --> 44:19.360
for the, you name it, man.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.080
CIA, KGB, I'm the other Born, Doug Born.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.880
Do you want to see me jump super high?

44:26.240 --> 44:28.800
Do you think Damon has the guts

44:28.800 --> 44:32.160
to start a movie called Doug Born Hot Target?

44:34.480 --> 44:36.480
If I saw that in the DVD shelf,

44:36.480 --> 44:38.320
I might still give it the pass on by,

44:38.320 --> 44:40.560
but I'd give it a good think about real quick.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.480
I was doing some reading about the Borns.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.320
Did y'all know they made one

44:46.320 --> 44:47.760
and they didn't want to do the director

44:47.760 --> 44:49.040
they'd done for the other ones?

44:49.040 --> 44:53.680
And so Matt Damon from The Martian said,

44:54.240 --> 44:56.160
no, I don't, I'm not going to be in it

44:56.160 --> 44:57.360
because I love that director.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.480
And so they said, okay, we'll get Jeremy Renner instead

45:00.480 --> 45:03.840
and just Jason Bourne won't be in this Jason Bourne movie.

45:03.840 --> 45:08.240
So really the idea of Doug Born Hot Target has precedent

45:08.240 --> 45:11.280
and it would be a Bourne movie without the right Bourne in it.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.320
He's the wrong Bourne,

45:12.320 --> 45:14.880
sort of the man who knew too little situation

45:14.880 --> 45:16.560
just stumbling around.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.920
That one didn't even have,

45:18.640 --> 45:22.480
the Bourne legacy didn't even have any Bournes, right?

45:22.480 --> 45:23.840
It's like Bourne Free.

45:23.840 --> 45:25.440
Bourne Free would have been a way better title.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.600
Bourne Free would have been good.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.840
I think at one point somebody saw the back

45:29.840 --> 45:32.480
of Jason Bourne's head and said, Jason Bourne?

45:32.480 --> 45:35.440
But then he was gone and that's how they tied it in.

45:35.440 --> 45:37.680
Yes, I would be pretty embarrassed, I guess.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.440
I would be embarrassed because of me.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.440
I would probably not make some great noises.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.640
Right.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.600
If I was running away from the It Follows monster.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.280
Because you think about the It Follows monster

45:49.280 --> 45:50.640
and you think like, wow, that must suck,

45:50.640 --> 45:52.400
having to constantly stay on the run.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.400
But then you also got to think about sort of,

45:54.400 --> 45:56.960
you're at the grocery store and you're walking down the aisle

45:56.960 --> 45:58.880
and there's another person walking down the aisle towards you

45:58.880 --> 46:00.560
and you go to the left and they go to the left

46:00.560 --> 46:02.080
and you go to the right and they go to the right

46:02.080 --> 46:04.000
and you're like, I need you to get the fuck out of the way

46:04.000 --> 46:05.120
because if this thing touches me,

46:05.120 --> 46:06.800
it's gonna fuck my body up.

46:07.920 --> 46:10.080
It sort of adds multiple layers to it.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.560
That or they are actually the It Follows monster

46:12.560 --> 46:14.240
and they're just stopping at the store.

46:14.240 --> 46:17.040
If there's one thing I know about the It Follows monster,

46:17.680 --> 46:19.680
it's that it follows.

46:19.680 --> 46:24.800
And so I've never seen it, so I don't know at what distance,

46:24.800 --> 46:27.440
but it's not called the It Catches monster.

46:27.440 --> 46:30.160
Oh no, oh Trav, It does a catch in the movie.

46:30.160 --> 46:30.880
Oh, it does?

46:30.880 --> 46:33.040
Oh boy, it does a big catch.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.400
Then it's really misnamed.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.800
It should be called the It Catches You monster.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.040
Yeah, it wants to and when it does.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.000
Yowza.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.200
Yeah, it ain't pretty.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.600
You gotta see that movie, Trav, it bangs, dude.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.720
Is it scary?

46:44.720 --> 46:46.080
Oh fucking yeah.

46:46.080 --> 46:46.560
Yeah, yeah.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.480
Then I'm not gonna watch it, why would I do that?

46:48.480 --> 46:50.800
Anyway, this has been our movie review segment.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.800
I work at a very successful startup

46:52.800 --> 46:56.480
with a casual atmosphere and very friendly people.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.120
Net Nanny.

46:58.560 --> 46:58.960
What?

46:58.960 --> 47:01.120
It's Net Nanny, the company's Net Nanny.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.640
The startup Net Nanny?

47:02.640 --> 47:05.040
Yeah, they're still trying to get some investors.

47:05.040 --> 47:08.400
They think like a startup and that's why they've been so successful.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.040
Y'all ever think about Net Nanny 2018?

47:11.040 --> 47:12.320
I don't think it exists anymore,

47:12.320 --> 47:14.080
but there is a period where we were like,

47:14.080 --> 47:15.600
I don't want all the internet.

47:17.840 --> 47:18.960
Some of it's real dirty.

47:18.960 --> 47:21.200
Can I, hi, as Justin McElroy,

47:21.200 --> 47:23.440
a 37 year old man in the year 2018,

47:23.440 --> 47:24.960
can I get Net Nanny?

47:24.960 --> 47:27.280
Because I would love to have less of it.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.360
If you could give me less of it.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.520
I need an adult to tell me like,

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
to be the voice of reason of like,

47:33.520 --> 47:35.840
this is, you don't get all the internet you want.

47:36.640 --> 47:39.200
Here's the internet you need and that's all you can have.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.000
I need like one eighth of Wikipedia and Club Penguin

47:42.000 --> 47:43.600
and I am good to go.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.920
Everything else is just a fucking distraction.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.280
Anyway, we have a large open office

47:49.280 --> 47:50.640
with an employee kitchen in the center.

47:50.640 --> 47:53.680
Oftentimes you'll be getting a coffee or your lunch

47:53.680 --> 47:55.680
and another employee will walk in and do their own thing.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.000
Usually there's a polite, how high are you?

47:58.000 --> 47:58.880
And that's it.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.800
However, there is one employee,

48:00.800 --> 48:02.800
a higher up with the company who also does this,

48:02.800 --> 48:04.320
but instead of moving on after the greeting,

48:04.320 --> 48:07.840
stares at me expectantly, waiting for more to be said

48:07.840 --> 48:10.640
when there never is more to be said.

48:10.640 --> 48:15.600
He then says, well, I guess that's the end

48:15.600 --> 48:17.120
of that conversation.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.720
Christ almighty.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.280
And continues to do his thing in the kitchen around me.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.040
Holy fucking shit.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.960
This also isn't a one-time thing per employee.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.920
He has done this to me and others multiple times.

48:29.920 --> 48:33.440
This is monstrous.

48:34.240 --> 48:37.120
What should I and the rest of my office do

48:37.120 --> 48:39.200
when confronted with this awkward character

48:39.200 --> 48:41.440
that's anxious in the Big Apple?

48:41.440 --> 48:42.720
Oh my God.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.280
We've been in the game long enough

48:45.280 --> 48:49.200
that I worry now people don't even want help.

48:49.920 --> 48:53.760
They just want like us to take a little of the load.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.800
They're just trying to take a couple of the packs

48:56.800 --> 48:59.280
that they have and sling them onto our backs.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.520
Just a little help on the road.

49:02.320 --> 49:05.200
Our rind has been toughened by doing this podcast.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.680
So I think we can haul a little bit more

49:07.680 --> 49:08.800
than the average bear.

49:08.800 --> 49:11.680
But good Lord, this person's a literal demon.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.200
An absolute demon.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.360
All right, what can we do?

49:18.400 --> 49:20.320
What I think you should do is they walk up

49:20.320 --> 49:22.400
and they say, hey, how's your day going?

49:22.400 --> 49:24.160
And you say, well, I guess that's the end

49:24.160 --> 49:25.280
of that conversation.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.000
And you walk away because they can't do it.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.600
What if you just skip the middle and you say,

49:31.600 --> 49:33.280
well, thank you for asking.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.640
And then you walk away.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.520
Because that acknowledges like, hey, I appreciate you,

49:37.520 --> 49:40.080
which is probably exactly what they want of you.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.040
But you don't have to say anything more than that.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.240
Or say, you know what?

49:44.240 --> 49:45.120
That's not what matters.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.800
So what matters here is how are you?

49:47.520 --> 49:50.080
Justin, I'd like to role play this out with you.

49:50.080 --> 49:50.880
Oh, happily.

49:50.880 --> 49:51.600
Yeah, for sure.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.040
You say to me, I have an idea.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.960
You say to me, how are you?

49:54.960 --> 49:55.760
Okay.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.960
This as far as the script goes?

49:57.520 --> 49:58.560
Yeah, that's what you say.

49:58.560 --> 49:59.760
And then I have a response.

49:59.760 --> 50:00.640
We're going to see how it works.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.320
What do I do?

50:02.320 --> 50:02.800
What can I be?

50:02.800 --> 50:03.360
King Griffin.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.680
Griffin, you be Jim in the back.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.200
Jim Halpert, make us a coffee.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.320
How about Griffin has just made a delivery

50:10.320 --> 50:12.320
and he's saying his goodbyes to everyone

50:12.320 --> 50:14.160
and then he'll see us again soon.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.840
And then our scene will commence directly

50:15.840 --> 50:17.200
after Griffin's goodbyes.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.000
Oh, I like that.

50:18.000 --> 50:18.800
And where do we work?

50:18.800 --> 50:20.880
Can we get a suggestion from the audience?

50:20.880 --> 50:21.840
Staples!

50:21.840 --> 50:22.880
Staples!

50:22.880 --> 50:24.000
I heard Staples.

50:24.000 --> 50:24.800
Okay.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.160
Staples corporate.

50:26.160 --> 50:26.640
All right.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.140
Okay.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.680
Oh, I got a delivery here.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.240
It's for the rest of the Staples.

50:32.240 --> 50:32.740
Staples.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.200
And go ahead and sign here for me.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.040
That is a nice place you all have here.

50:37.040 --> 50:37.760
Oh, thank you.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.840
Can you mind if I use your toilet?

50:39.840 --> 50:40.800
Oh, we don't have one.

50:41.920 --> 50:42.560
Huh?

50:42.560 --> 50:43.360
We don't have one?

50:44.160 --> 50:46.880
Well, I see you got a big open elevator shaft over there.

50:46.880 --> 50:49.600
Do you mind if I sort of figure it out in there?

50:49.600 --> 50:50.480
Yeah, go for it.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.880
Jeffrey said we don't have a toilet.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.640
That means we don't have a toilet.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.040
Are you saying my friend Delip is a liar?

50:57.600 --> 50:58.080
No, yeah.

50:58.080 --> 50:58.720
No, I believe you.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.320
I'm just going to use the big elevator shaft.

51:00.320 --> 51:01.600
Go piss in the elevator shaft.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.560
That's what we all do.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.560
No, it's the other one.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.240
You can do that in the elevator shaft too.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.240
Hey, I have a question before you go.

51:08.960 --> 51:09.460
Yeah.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.080
If you are a hot dog.

51:12.080 --> 51:12.720
Yeah, great.

51:12.720 --> 51:13.220
Okay.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.400
Yeah, I haven't heard anything like this before in my life.

51:16.400 --> 51:17.840
So go ahead and keep talking.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.520
Like, I don't know if it's a reference to something.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.160
I don't know what it is.

51:20.160 --> 51:22.480
So I just assume you're having a conversation with me

51:22.480 --> 51:23.120
because I don't know it.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.760
Just a quick time out for people at home.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.680
This is going exactly how I thought

51:31.680 --> 51:32.800
it would play out in this scenario.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.320
So hope someone's taking notes.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.920
Okay, time in.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.720
Yeah, okay.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.000
Yeah, I don't have a TV or anything.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.120
So I miss a lot of references.

51:39.120 --> 51:41.280
So I just assume right now you're telling me that

51:42.480 --> 51:43.840
you're a big hot dog enthusiast.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.440
So go ahead and keep going.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.560
Would you eat yourself?

51:47.440 --> 51:48.880
Wow, that's a hell of a question.

51:48.880 --> 51:50.080
Yeah, it's a good question.

51:50.080 --> 51:51.120
I've never heard that either.

51:54.400 --> 51:58.080
Probably not because I recently ate old 4th of July hot dogs.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.400
I'm pretty sure I have food poisoning right now.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.800
Hence the sort of elevator shaft panic.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.640
So that's a no.

52:04.640 --> 52:06.560
When I play a character a lot of times.

52:07.360 --> 52:08.240
Oh, wait, hold on.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.040
Is this a time out?

52:09.040 --> 52:10.560
I don't know if this is another time out.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.920
Okay, time out, time out.

52:11.920 --> 52:12.960
When I play a character,

52:14.400 --> 52:17.120
I guess it just kind of accidentally sounded

52:17.120 --> 52:20.480
a little bit like Will Ferrell's impression of Harry Caray.

52:20.480 --> 52:21.760
Oh, is that what it was?

52:21.760 --> 52:24.320
And then I just kind of want to do a bit from that.

52:25.200 --> 52:25.680
Okay.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.400
No, I got that.

52:26.400 --> 52:27.360
I definitely got that.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.120
It's just that Avery, my character, didn't know that.

52:31.120 --> 52:32.320
Okay, well let's-

52:32.320 --> 52:33.120
Here's the weird thing.

52:33.120 --> 52:36.720
My character, Delip, did get it, but me, Travis, didn't.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.080
Can we get back into the scene?

52:38.640 --> 52:39.600
Yeah, let's get back in.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.440
All right, have you left yet, Griffin?

52:41.440 --> 52:42.240
I guess so.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.920
Are you really that tired of Avery?

52:44.640 --> 52:46.240
Time out, time out, time out, time out.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.440
Do you want Avery to leave?

52:48.080 --> 52:50.960
No, I actually think Avery is bringing a lot to the scene,

52:50.960 --> 52:54.880
but I feel like the tone of Avery's exit

52:54.880 --> 52:58.960
has to match the rising tone of our scene.

52:58.960 --> 53:01.680
So maybe Avery can, Avery can always reenter, Griffin.

53:01.680 --> 53:04.720
I mean, we found that test audiences really enjoy Avery.

53:04.720 --> 53:05.200
I'd rather not.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.440
So we're willing to make it kind of the Urkel character

53:07.440 --> 53:08.240
of the whole thing.

53:08.240 --> 53:08.640
Yeah, okay.

53:09.840 --> 53:10.320
Time in.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.120
Later, suckers.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.000
I'm crotch-chopping.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.240
So how are you?

53:17.120 --> 53:17.920
I know, right?

53:19.920 --> 53:20.420
Ding.

53:20.420 --> 53:25.300
The elevator got the doors open, no car.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.220
Sure enough, this thing is empty as hell.

53:28.100 --> 53:29.300
Well, here I go.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.500
Can I get a spotter?

53:31.380 --> 53:33.300
I'm just, or does somebody have a belt I can use

53:33.300 --> 53:35.060
to kind of tie myself to this guardrail?

53:35.060 --> 53:36.340
Because I'm really, oh no!

53:38.500 --> 53:40.340
We find out in episode two that he survived

53:40.340 --> 53:42.020
because he landed on the pile of shit

53:42.020 --> 53:44.260
from previous times people had used it.

53:44.260 --> 53:45.860
It's a real Shawshank situation.

53:45.860 --> 53:47.780
Let's end this fucking show.

53:47.780 --> 53:49.860
Thank you so much for listening to my brother.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.940
My brother and me, we hope you have enjoyed yourself

53:52.500 --> 53:53.860
half as much as we have.

53:55.220 --> 53:59.700
We are gonna be headed out on the road

53:59.700 --> 54:02.500
for a book tour this week as you're,

54:03.380 --> 54:05.700
this week as the crow flies as you're listening to this.

54:06.420 --> 54:07.460
Most of those are sold out,

54:07.460 --> 54:09.060
but I think we do have some tickets available

54:09.060 --> 54:11.380
for the Cincinnati show.

54:11.380 --> 54:15.300
That's gonna be on Wednesday the 18th at the Taft.

54:15.300 --> 54:19.220
You can get tickets to that at mcroyshows.com forward slash tours

54:19.220 --> 54:25.220
as well as our show in Orlando and Atlanta

54:25.700 --> 54:28.020
on August 31st and September 1st, respectively.

54:28.580 --> 54:31.540
So go get tickets to those and we hope to see you there.

54:31.540 --> 54:32.980
I have something to say real quick

54:32.980 --> 54:35.620
because this is the episode, yeah, the week of it.

54:35.620 --> 54:37.700
So San Diego Comic-Con is this weekend.

54:38.660 --> 54:41.300
We do the Adventure Zone thing Friday night

54:41.300 --> 54:45.780
and then Saturday I am doing autographing

54:45.780 --> 54:47.700
with Dad and Carrie Peach,

54:47.700 --> 54:50.180
who is the artist on the Adventure Zone graphic novel

54:50.180 --> 54:53.940
from 11 to noon at table AA19.

54:53.940 --> 54:57.940
It is ticketed, tickets are free, I believe,

54:57.940 --> 55:00.660
but it is a limited number of tickets for that.

55:00.660 --> 55:04.900
I'm also doing one with the cast of Maximum Funds Bubble,

55:04.900 --> 55:11.940
which I am a member of, one to 145 at table AA08.

55:11.940 --> 55:13.300
Once again, that is ticketed.

55:13.300 --> 55:16.740
And then from two to three, we're doing a panel,

55:16.740 --> 55:20.980

55:20.980 --> 55:22.500

55:22.500 --> 55:23.780
who was one of the story producers

55:23.780 --> 55:25.780
on the My Brother, My Brother, Me TV show.

55:25.780 --> 55:26.820
Oh, hell yeah.

55:26.820 --> 55:30.260
Location is 28DE, so that's hall 28DE.

55:31.300 --> 55:33.540
And then five to six on Saturday,

55:33.540 --> 55:36.340
I'm doing a panel with Maximum Funds Bubble.

55:37.140 --> 55:40.500
And the location for that is Neil Morgan Auditorium,

55:40.500 --> 55:42.340
San Diego Central Library.

55:42.340 --> 55:45.700

55:45.700 --> 55:47.780

55:50.500 --> 55:53.700
And that's location grand one and two,

55:53.700 --> 55:56.660
Marriott Marquis, San Diego Marina.

55:56.660 --> 55:57.540
So come to those.

55:57.540 --> 56:00.020
And you might also probably just like see me around.

56:00.020 --> 56:04.580
Yeah, but not us, because we're fucking out of there.

56:04.580 --> 56:06.340
We're taking off, we're scooting.

56:06.900 --> 56:08.820
I might not make it to next week, actually,

56:08.820 --> 56:11.140
depending on how the next couple days goes.

56:12.900 --> 56:14.820
Because of the hot dogs?

56:14.820 --> 56:16.500
Yeah, so thanks to Maximum Funds

56:16.500 --> 56:17.700

Anything else?

56:45.460 --> 56:46.260
No, that's it.

56:46.900 --> 56:48.660
Here's one that's sent in by Jordan Brandon.

56:48.660 --> 56:50.020
It's our final Yahoo of the Day.

56:50.020 --> 56:52.340
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user.

56:53.380 --> 56:55.380
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

56:55.380 --> 56:57.460
Has gone wrong.

56:57.460 --> 56:58.660
So I'm gonna call them.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.900
Amazon asks.

57:04.340 --> 57:07.300
I mean, there's an Amazon ad and there's a Discover card ad.

57:07.300 --> 57:07.940
But I'll say-

57:07.940 --> 57:08.660
You did great.

57:08.660 --> 57:09.140
No.

57:09.140 --> 57:13.620
Amazon asks, what is the name Todd short for?

57:15.780 --> 57:17.780
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:17.780 --> 57:19.140

57:47.460 --> 57:48.740
And I'm Adam Felber.

57:48.740 --> 57:51.700
Adam, I haven't gotten one thing done today.

57:51.700 --> 57:52.740
Well, let me see your to-do list.

57:52.740 --> 57:53.300
Ah, yeah.

Well, here.

57:54.260 --> 57:57.060
Make 30 second promo for nobody listens to Paula Poundstone.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.420
So at least you're getting that done.

57:58.420 --> 57:59.540
Score!

57:59.540 --> 58:01.380
Except you haven't said what the show is about.

58:01.380 --> 58:04.820
We're like a comedy field guide to life starring me and you.

58:04.820 --> 58:09.860
I give useful advice and we have real experts to talk about things like how to keep a friend

58:09.860 --> 58:12.100
or what to do when you encounter a bear.

58:12.100 --> 58:15.060
Bully for you, but you haven't said where people can find the show.

58:15.060 --> 58:21.860
Oh, Maximumfun.org or wherever you find your podcasts.
