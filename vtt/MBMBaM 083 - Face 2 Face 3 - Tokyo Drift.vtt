00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:38.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:38.000 --> 00:48.000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
It's a new craze, and the girls, they don't want to just say they are gay.

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello. Hi, everybody. Welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and Travis, I can't believe you went with the walking thing.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
We said the elves, right?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm walking by the elves.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Okay. We said that we were doing elves and ho-hos.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Griffin.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay. Oh, sorry. I'm Griffin McElroy, your youngest brother.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
It's not timely. It's not appropriate.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
2011.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
It's 2011.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm walking by the elves.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, and the other thing is I don't think you know who Joaquin Phoenix is.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I think you just had a big beard, and you were on the plane, and you were like...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Do you know anything other than his visage? Can you give me some deets?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
My last name's Phoenix, buddy.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
He doesn't have an accent, whatever accent that is.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Why you so hard on Joaquin, buddy?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Okay.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Can you just put on your goddamn hat?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Yes.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Put on your Christmas hat.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Did you focus group that goof out before you brought it to the show?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
No, I did not.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Okay. Maybe next time.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Did you focus out the goof?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
You got to run the goofs by us.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I didn't.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
So this is an advice show for the... I need a beer.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
What's up?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
This is an advice show for the modern era. We're going to get to the advice in just a second.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
But first, some lady in this audience has a secret about these two.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Yes, it's true. She knows who she is.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
She is probably too ashamed to admit it.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
When I get nervous pre-show, and I always do, I got to make peeps.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
And sometimes I have to use the one closest to the green room, which in this case was the ladies room.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
We didn't want to, I guess, ruin the magic of the show by exposing ourselves to the audience.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
There were two stalls in there. Travis and I agreed on peep procedure.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
We both went in, went in both stalls.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
There she is. There she is.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm sorry.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay. Normally I would apologize, but you did not follow the bathroom procedure.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
You didn't jiggle the handle.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You didn't knock on the door.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
She didn't expect there to be two dudes.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You always have to expect two dudes.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
You always expect two dudes in the bathroom.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
This is a classy show she shouldn't have to expect two dudes hanging out, crossing the streams.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
There were two different stalls.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Please admit you crossed the streams.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
They were separate stalls.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
We did pause in the middle and switch stalls.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
But that's just so we could get the full experience.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
And I giggled in the middle of the act because it was so ridiculous to do it.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And we high-fived as we were passing.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That part's not true.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
I definitely giggled, though, and I couldn't just...

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Was I giggling when you came in?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Because that would...

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, God damn it.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Nothing gets rid of the pre-show jitters.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Like, supreme embarrassment.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
That's a deep shame.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
God damn it.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
What?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
No, my dad reads those.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
The jig is up.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, man.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So, hey, we're going to get to the advice right now.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Is Greg here?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, boy.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Holy shit.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Greg is pumped.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh, no, that's not Greg.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
He's just a huge Greg fan.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
He didn't come to Austin for us.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
He came for Greg.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Greg says, I need a gift for my wife.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
She is finishing up vet school this year and has only asked me for boring veterinary handbooks and the like.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
I want to get her something fun and exciting, i.e. not a textbook on how to cut up horses.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Do you have any suggestions?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Sounds like good reading to me.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
First off, there's an audio book about how to cut up horses.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
It's called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It's pretty much all we talk about.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Is your wife here?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
No.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Nice.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay, good.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Does she listen to the show?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
No.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Okay, good.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
We have worked out some goofs about how you were messing up by asking in front of her.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, you're bad at presents, but you're actually pretty good.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah, your bases.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Did you stop her from coming so she wouldn't find out what you were getting her?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Classic rule.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Classic Greg.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
That's what the fans come to see.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Classic Greg.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Classic Greg play.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
So, boys, GIFs.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Okay, so we've ruled out books about cutting up horses, so anything else?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, what else is there?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
The whole world of other things.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, a cup.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
A cup isn't that thing.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Or a cup.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
No, damn it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Damn it.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay, let me hit you guys with this.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
What about a pet?

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
The pet, she could, would be like a practice dog.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Like you could...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Oh, this is my dog, Guinea Pig.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, this is my dog, Guinea Pig, or a Guinea Pig, Guinea Pig, and you test out...

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Or a Guinea Pig dog.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Why is that dog's legs on its back now?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Exactly.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Exactly.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
There's like a new...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
You made an upside-down dog.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Right.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
There's a Franken-dog.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
A Franken-upside-down dog.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
Wait, how did this go from her being a veterinarian to creating animal atrocities?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Have you ever read The Island of Dr. Moreau?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I haven't, but I'm about to reference it.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
He basically just turns dogs upside down, that whole book.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
How is that different from just turning a dog upside down?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Because his face is right side up.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
You know, you could also, the dog could be a really powerful bargaining chip.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
You know, you could say to her, this is your dog and you love it, but if you mess up, I'm going to kill it.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
That you're...

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
If she messes up in veterinary school.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
If she...

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Or she messes up in general.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Burn the roast.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
No, no.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That's just called an abusive husband.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
What I'm saying to you is that you have a sign at her vet place where...

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Clinic, I think.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
What?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Her meat locker or is she works on the pets?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Her vet place.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Okay.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
No, her pet...

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Pet shop.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
At her littlest pet shop.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
At her littlest pet shop clinic.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
And you say, if we, this is our guarantee to you, our pledge, if we kill your dog, we'll kill our dog.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Or they can kill our dog.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
This is a dog for dog guarantee.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
You can kill our dog while we watch in horror.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
We'll make our kids do it.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
How much to kill that puppy in the window?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I am now looking to see if there are any kids in the audience because that's horrifying.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Any kids, good.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
No.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
No kids, cool.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Cool.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
How about a Yahoo answer?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
This one was...

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Are there Yahoo representatives here?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
This one was sent in by Nefariousity.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Thank you, Nefariousity.

07:14.000 --> 07:25.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user hmmm who asks, is it possible for internet radiations to cause somebody stretch marks?

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I think they are causing me, but I love internet and computer.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
It helps me so much, but each time I am doing it, there is some tingling sensation.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
And then I notice at that place, a stretch mark appearing.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
If I tell my family members, if I tell my family members, they think I am being stupid.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Is it possible?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Wow.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Really?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Do you think it's instantaneous?

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Like they feel a tingle and like they lift up their shirt and watch the stretch mark appear?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Yeah, I think it's google.com enter and then they're doubled over in pain.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
And then all of a sudden the Netmata appears.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Trademark, TM, don't even try.

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
Are there possibly, and I'm just, I'm going out on a limb here, are there maybe some behaviors that you have adopted in addition to internet and computer time?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Like is internet and computer time also sandwich time?

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Because that might, if you sandwich while you internet, you may get stretch marks down there from the sandwich though, not from the internet.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Is there, is internet radiation a real thing is what I'm too afraid to ask.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
That's the question.

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
That's yeah, that's the, the secret of this hole in the stars part right now is, is, is, is there a radio?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I mean, obviously there is, right?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
That's what the 1% has been using to control us.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
But I do, I do enjoy though that this person has convinced himself that a internet radiation is a thing.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
B, acceptable risk.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
C, they're going, they don't know it's properties.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
They're still out on the fucking forefront of internet radiation research.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
They don't know if it's causing stretch marks.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
They don't know what it's doing, but they do know, they do know it's worth, whatever the help it's providing them is definitely worth the risk.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Hey, if a stretch mark appears, there's nothing good happening.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
This radiation is not like, I was good at piano.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
How many stretch marks until you stop?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Right.

09:17.000 --> 09:30.000
Well, I think it's, I think it's beautiful that this person thinks that the stretch marks may be caused by the internet and yet they're willing to use the internet one more time.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
One last chance, internet.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
One last chance to solve this problem for me.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Turn to, to, and Yahoo is the source they talked to.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Not fucking like belly stretches.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
WebMD?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah. Google, maybe try that.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
A real doctor's phone number.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You can maybe Google that.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
You can type that out.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Maybe.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I do.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
I think it's a testament to their family though.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
At least they have a supportive.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, not a supportive, but no, their family said they were stupid.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Hey, you're stupid.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
That's not how it works.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Hey, you're like twice as tall as you once were because of stretch marks.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
What happened?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
You can't, I guess they can't say internet.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
No.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Third world internet does give you stretch marks.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
No, that's true.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Here in America, we have the filtered stuff.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
It's not as fast though.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Hey, I have another question here.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
It says, I'm, excuse me, I've got a whole list here.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Hey, MBMBA M.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Hey.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Hey.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
What up?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Hey.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
My wife has joined a roller derby league and is in the...

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Fun.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, it's good times.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
And is in the training period where they learn how to kick the shit out of their opponents.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
At the end of this three-month program, she'll need a derby name that is both clever and tough sounding.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Her name is Emily and she is small, but fast on her skates.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Do you have any suggestions?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Emily small fast.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Emily skates go.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Skates, tiny skates.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Tiny blur.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Skate murders people.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I don't like that.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
No.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
No.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Skate or Emily.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
That's not very good.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Skate better Emily.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Practice.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Practice.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Hard worker.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I don't think we're good at this.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I don't think we are either.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
No.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
We have many talents.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Some friends of ours have discussed this because we have friends in the roller derby community.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
More of a family really.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
And the best name that we cooked up was Angela Landsfury, which I like.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
I like that.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Yeah.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Is she very old?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
This girl?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I guess that would be good.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
My elderly wife Emily is participating in roller derby.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
She is fast and small and solves mysteries sometimes.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Actually, a lot of people don't know this.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
When a roller derby player turns 50, they throw him into the tar pit like I'm dinosaurs.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
That was the most obscure fucking reference that we've ever done on this whole show.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Hey, I'm the baby.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Gotta love me.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
I guess.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Don't you fucking groan.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
If you got it, you laugh.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
You paid ten dollars to be here.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Might as well chuckle while the sun...

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
What did Juno use in that movie about...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
What did Juno use in that movie?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Roll it.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Roll it?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Roll fast.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Roller.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Roll fast.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Roller girls.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
I don't know what she did.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I missed that.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Directed by the incomparable auteur Drew Barrymore.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Sure.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
You could be Drew Scarymore.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I like that a lot.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Ooh, I like that.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Ellen Rage.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
God damn it.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I was just about to say Ellen Rage.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
That's it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
That's it.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
That's it, though.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Helen.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Helen.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
But then it just sounds like you're saying Helen, which is also a lady's name.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
What about Helen?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I was saying Helen with two Ls.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Oh, so like Helen Kellen.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
That's...

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
That's not good.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
She's from Austin.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
She can't.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Miracle worker.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
No.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Is she from Austin, really?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Neither does she.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
There it is, folks.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Put the kids to bed.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Put the kids to bed.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
It's 730.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
The kids are deeply offended by Helen Keller jokes.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Shut the front two easy.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
How about a yahoo?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

12:55.000 --> 13:07.000
Thank you, Galiayali.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's by...

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh, this one's gross.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.160
This one's by a yahoo answers user, SergJay, who asks, what would you do if you catch your

13:14.160 --> 13:18.240
husband pooping in the backyard?

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
Additional information.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.240
I did.

13:20.240 --> 13:27.160
I don't know if I'm in Troubles.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.880
So wait.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.160
Is this question...

13:32.160 --> 13:35.760
Is the question being asked by the catcher or the catchy?

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
Catchy.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.760
I don't know.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
Husband or wife.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
Am I in Troubles?

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
I got busted.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.760
What would you do?

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
You'd be totally cool, right?

13:42.760 --> 13:46.540
If you were married to a person who thought it was okay to just poop in the backyard,

13:46.540 --> 13:49.240
you would also be in Troubles.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.080
You would be legally bound.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.520
You would share taxes with Troubles.

13:53.520 --> 13:58.680
I mean, you said for better or for worse, and this is basically like the worst.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.680
Yeah.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.320
Doing dirty in the hydrangeas is about as worse as it gets.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.360
Doing dirty.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
In the koi pond, Steve.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
Really?

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
In the koi pond.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.920
The koi pond is the worst, but the kois hate that.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.640
I imported those from Japan.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.640
You divorce him.

14:14.640 --> 14:15.640
Right?

14:15.640 --> 14:17.640
I mean, you divorce him?

14:17.640 --> 14:18.640
You leave him instantly.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.640
Rub his nose in it?

14:19.640 --> 14:20.640
I guess.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.640
Definitely an option.

14:21.640 --> 14:22.640
Definitely an option.

14:22.640 --> 14:27.640
Just bap him on the schnoz with a rolled up newspaper.

14:27.640 --> 14:28.640
Steven!

14:28.640 --> 14:29.640
Steven!

14:29.640 --> 14:32.200
Shake the no-no can at him.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.400
Someone responded, I think I would be really shocked.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.400
It wouldn't-

14:35.400 --> 14:41.840
I think I'd be totally cash about it.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
Oh, Jim.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.700
I would try to be cool.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.360
It wouldn't make me mad, but I would question insanity.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.280
It wouldn't make you mad.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.560
I'm not mad, Steven.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.480
I'm just disappointed.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.960
How many times do we have to have this talk?

14:56.960 --> 15:00.920
I'd say disappointed would probably, I mean, yeah.

15:00.920 --> 15:01.920
Jesus.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.680
Made some troubles.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.960
Somebody said, start serving his meals outside too.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.960
You want to be a dog?

15:07.960 --> 15:08.960
I'll treat you like one.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.960
What kind of human sympathy-

15:09.960 --> 15:14.680
This is the way we should treat the mentally disabled in our country.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
All right.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.160
Well, this is what we're going with.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
You want poop outside?

15:18.160 --> 15:19.160
That's how you sleep outside.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.160
Yeah.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
Problem solved.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
He just has a dog fetish.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.040
Maybe he saw that hilarious Tim Allen vehicle.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
Dog fetish.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Dog fetish.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
The movie.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
Tim Allen.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.120
Road dogs.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.160
And I forgot what I was talking about.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
Shaggy dog?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.160
I missed road dogs.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.160
Shaggy DA?

15:36.160 --> 15:38.560
Is it just about Tim Allen wanting to fuck dogs?

15:38.560 --> 15:41.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:41.560 --> 15:47.240
I haven't seen it, but I assume that it is about-

15:47.240 --> 15:50.920
Husbands don't do that.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
Hey.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
How about no one-

15:52.920 --> 15:53.920
Humanity?

15:53.920 --> 15:57.680
It's not like if you're a bachelor, swing and single, poop in your backyard all you

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
want.

15:58.680 --> 16:03.360
Is it possible that she doesn't specify, did she maybe marry a dog?

16:03.360 --> 16:09.800
My husband, Marmaduke, keeps pooping in the backyard.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.560
And sitting on that couch like a person.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.440
He thinks he's people.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.960
He always steals the newspaper.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.960
Then he poops in the backyard.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.080
And he started on that mailman.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.560
I would prefer to think that this is asked by the guy who got busted.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.920
Oh yeah, I think so too.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.480
And dogs aren't allowed to use the internet.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.320
And the old battle axe came down on me real hard.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.320
Hey guys.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.320
The old ball and chain.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.520
Everybody, the old ball and chain didn't miss me.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.320
I was just trying to poop in the backyard like a grown man.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.440
I just wanted two minutes of quiet.

16:38.440 --> 16:43.880
The only place I can get any peace in that house is outside next to my shed in my special

16:43.880 --> 16:44.880
spot.

16:44.880 --> 16:52.760
As somebody who was very recently shamed for using the restroom, I do sort of feel for

16:52.760 --> 16:53.760
this man.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.760
I feel his pain.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.840
I don't think my crime was quite as intense as his.

16:57.840 --> 16:58.840
Right.

16:58.840 --> 16:59.840
It was.

16:59.840 --> 17:00.840
I mean, it was in public.

17:00.840 --> 17:01.840
It was around people.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.840
Yes, that's true.

17:02.840 --> 17:03.840
How was his not in public?

17:03.840 --> 17:04.840
He was in the backyard.

17:04.840 --> 17:05.840
I mean...

17:05.840 --> 17:07.840
He was in like the backyard of Walmart using the couch.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.680
Oh, if he had like a really high fence, then it's cool?

17:10.680 --> 17:15.280
If you're going to do that, that thing, there's exactly one by one foot square where it is

17:15.280 --> 17:16.280
not in public.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.480
You bought a house with a room in it specifically for that thing to be done in it.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.480
Right.

17:21.480 --> 17:25.680
You don't see me storing my cigars in a room other than my cigar storage room.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.680
Your humidor.

17:26.680 --> 17:27.680
My humidor.

17:27.680 --> 17:31.680
Hey, is Lonesome and the Lone Star State here?

17:31.680 --> 17:32.680
Hey.

17:32.680 --> 17:33.680
How's it going?

17:33.680 --> 17:34.680
Lonesome.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.680
Hey.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.680
You sound too friendly to be Lonesome.

17:37.680 --> 17:42.980
Over the past few years, Lonesome and the Lone Star State, no fewer than five of my very

17:42.980 --> 17:45.000
dear friends have all moved to the same Midwestern city.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.840
I've visited a lot, really like it, but my boyfriend is a little more hesitant to pack

17:49.840 --> 17:51.540
his bags and move away.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.840
How can I convince him that this is the right move?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.600
He's becoming more receptive, but I still got a ways to go.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.880
I know personally, I don't know why anybody would want to live anywhere other than Austin.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.680
Don't give him that.

18:05.680 --> 18:14.560
Shinerbock, Alamo, it's not in this one.

18:14.560 --> 18:15.560
Drafthouse.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.560
Yeah.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.560
Alamo Drafthouse.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.720
That's what I meant.

18:20.720 --> 18:26.840
Is your boyfriend here and sitting somewhere other than with you?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.920
It depends entirely on the Midwestern city, right?

18:29.920 --> 18:33.160
Like if it's Chicago, then that would probably be an easy sell.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.360
But if it's like the Poopsie, Missouri.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
I went to Chicago.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.600
You couldn't pay me enough to go back there.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.760
Do you know how cold it was?

18:39.760 --> 18:41.360
I waited for a train for 10 minutes.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.360
Wait, hold on.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
Are any of you here from Chicago?

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
Cool.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
Go on.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.360
Cool.

18:46.360 --> 18:47.360
Fuck that.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.360
Fuck that place.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
That place is great.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
No.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.400
If you're listening on the internet later, I'm just kidding, if you could see me this

18:53.400 --> 18:55.600
whole time, I've been winking, right audience?

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
Yeah.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
Winking.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
They vouch for it.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.040
You're saying no fewer than five.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.040
Is there more and you're just not sure?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.040
Did you lose track?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
Did you lose count?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.040
Yeah.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
You got up to five and then you just stopped.

19:05.040 --> 19:10.040
I see what you're saying.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.440
You don't know the metric for- People that used to buy sensi from you, you

19:13.440 --> 19:17.080
just want to be closer to your target demo.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.600
You know, what about a treasure map?

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
Yeah.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.760
He might not even know where he's going and then all of a sudden he follows the clues,

19:22.760 --> 19:24.000
Legend of Curly's gold.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
A million paces to the north.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.400
Walk until cold.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
You have arrived.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.400
Are you bored?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.400
You are there.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.400
Empty warehouse district marks the spot.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.040
If you see an abandoned train station- Or our friend-

19:39.040 --> 19:40.040
Congratulations Midwest.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.760
If you see our friend Darlene, you have gone far enough.

19:44.760 --> 19:45.760
She will be waiting for you.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.760
And look, there's me in a U-Haul.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.760
Surprise!

19:48.760 --> 19:50.800
Surprise, you moved.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.800
It's all your shit.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.440
No, don't do it that way.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.680
It's a lot harder to dole these out and feel consequence free about it when they're actually

20:01.680 --> 20:05.000
here and the repercussions are so terrifyingly real.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Kidnap him!

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Kidnap him!

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Whatever!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Yeah!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Drug him!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Drug him!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Don't.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
No, don't.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Don't do that.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.560
Yeah, this is really much harder than I thought it would be.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.680
You gotta get- There's gotta be a good reason- What is the city, if you don't mind my asking?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
Kansas City.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.680
Kansas City.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.680
Okay.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.680
There's a lot of stuff there.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.680
Aren't there multiple Kansas cities?

20:25.680 --> 20:26.680
Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.680
Is it in the Kansas side or the Missouri side?

20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
Oh, no, never mind.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
No, no, no, no, no.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.000
I believe my wife, Sydney, Sydney, you're here.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Hey, everybody, say hi to Sydney.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.800
Now, Sydney, you've been to Kansas City, right?

20:37.800 --> 20:39.800
Would you say everything is up to date there?

20:39.800 --> 20:40.800
God damn it!

20:40.800 --> 20:41.800
Yes!

20:41.800 --> 20:42.800
Under the wire.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.800
Yeah, you know what?

20:43.800 --> 20:45.800
That Oklahoma gag went over just as well as it should have.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
Congratulations.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.080
You just bought your own coffin, stupid.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
Joke coffin.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.560
And there's another one.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.600
Is it cool?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.880
She says it's very cool for a home audience.

20:59.880 --> 21:00.880
She doesn't have a microphone.

21:00.880 --> 21:01.880
Yeah.

21:01.880 --> 21:06.920
Yeah, I guess just to give them that, it's very cool.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.920
Sounds good to me.

21:07.920 --> 21:08.920
It's great.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.320
There's two of them, so if one like burns down, there's another Kansas City.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.360
Are you sure all your friends are in that one?

21:14.360 --> 21:15.360
Yes.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.360
Okay, good.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.360
Check, because that one's important.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.360
Yeah, that is key.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
How about a Yahoo?

21:19.360 --> 21:20.360
Yeah, definitely.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.280
This one was also sent in by Nefariosity.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.280
Thank you.

21:24.280 --> 21:31.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ray, who asks, how can I become like Jackie Chan?

21:31.640 --> 21:36.920
I want to learn how to fight like Jackie Chan, or learn how to do kung fu pro-erly.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.140
So shall I go to China and go to a special place?

21:40.140 --> 21:45.600
Because I want to learn how to do it proper-erly like Jackie Chan.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.680
Not the way they do it near my dojo.

21:49.680 --> 21:50.680
I love that.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.680
Wait, wait, wait.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.680
I said near my dojo, not at my dojo.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.680
We have a small club.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.600
The dojo's prices are outrageous.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.960
We need outside in the alley behind it.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.560
We're in front of the frozen yogurt place.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.560
No, not that one.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
The one around the corner.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.160
Walk to the employee parking lot of the Dairy Queen.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.600
You have arrived.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
Let the kicking commence.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
The dojo club.

22:09.600 --> 22:14.240
Meet me at the dojo, and you can follow me.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.200
You know why everybody just said that?

22:16.200 --> 22:19.680
In Huntington, Virginia, next to the Dairy Queen, there is in fact a dojo.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
This is accurate.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.680
This is an accurate goof.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.560
This is an historically accurate goof.

22:24.560 --> 22:28.000
There are a lot of ways you can become like Jackie Chan.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Can you throw-

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
A friend, Chris Tucker.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.640
Can you be best friends with Chris Tucker?

22:31.640 --> 22:34.120
Can you throw fast punches?

22:34.120 --> 22:35.640
That seems to be that whole guy's whole schtick.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
I guess.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.640
I'm not an expert.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.640
You know what?

22:38.640 --> 22:39.640
Are you Chinese?

22:39.640 --> 22:43.520
Because if you're Chinese, my papa probably already thinks you are Jackie Chan.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.880
You are like halfway there.

22:45.880 --> 22:49.520
I hope he never listens and hears about how racist we say he is.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
Jackie Chan?

22:50.520 --> 22:59.280
Can you have lots of goof ups during a filming of the movie, and then those make their way

22:59.280 --> 23:00.280
into the credits.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.760
I'm like, whoop, the ladder opened.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.880
Oh, am I not?

23:02.880 --> 23:06.240
You get hit like really hard with a sword or something, and then you just laugh it off

23:06.240 --> 23:07.240
because you're Jackie Chan.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.240
Because you're invincible.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.240
You're invincible.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.240
You're so charming.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.600
What kind of kung fu are you doing at your dojo that's not like what Jackie Chan is doing?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.240
We're doing tickle fu here.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.560
I don't even like this.

23:16.560 --> 23:17.560
Excuse me.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
Teach, teach, teach.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.440
This isn't like Jackie Chan.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.200
I have slid down zero buildings.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.960
I have punched absolutely no helicopters.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.320
Where's the part where I gotta go, whoa, and barely catch myself?

23:29.320 --> 23:30.400
Where's Owen Wilson even at?

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
I don't know.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.440
Was that the right Wilson?

23:33.440 --> 23:34.440
Shanghai Noon.

23:34.440 --> 23:35.440
Shanghai Nights.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.440
Shanghai Nights, Shanghai Noon.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
Justin, was that the right Wilson?

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
Sorry, say again?

23:38.440 --> 23:39.440
Owen?

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
I don't know.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.440
You have to ask Popo.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.440
Okay.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.440
And he thinks all white people are Owen Wilson?

23:43.440 --> 23:44.440
He thinks all white people are Owen Wilson.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.440
He is the worst.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.440
Yeah, he really is.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.480
At least he's an equal opportunity racist.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.480
Yeah.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.480
Okay.

23:52.480 --> 23:58.520
So, in this lull, I would like to take this opportunity.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
To acknowledge the lull?

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
I wrote.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.520
Oh, fuck.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.520
Fuck.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.520
I wrote a little something.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.640
I asked everyone for some words.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
And so I wrote.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.640
Not a goof.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.640
Like, we told you not to do this.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.280
And so I wrote just a little Madeline.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.280
No.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.280
I'm not.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.280
No.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.280
I wrote a little thing that's special for you guys.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.280
Because you're special.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.280
Can we call them SadLibs officially?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.280
Can we get the branding on SadLibs?

24:20.280 --> 24:21.280
SadLibs?

24:21.280 --> 24:22.280
So, I'm going to read this MadLib.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
I'm not.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.280
I'm going to go use the men's restroom.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.280
I just wanted you guys to hear this.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.280
Because I wrote it for you.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.280
Because I love you.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.280
I'm going to play Chrono Trigger on my iPhone.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.280
I wrote it especially for Justin.

24:29.280 --> 24:33.440
But Justin will hear it in the bathroom, I guess.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
So here it is.

24:34.440 --> 24:41.880
I hope you guys like it.

24:41.880 --> 24:45.160
One jiggly candle night's eve, Diesel McGillicuddy was snorkeling

24:45.160 --> 24:47.200
patiently in his lavender vestibule.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.200
This is even worse when I'm with you.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.940
Diesel was Santa's most tingly advisor, but his wankalicious

24:50.940 --> 24:53.620
swagger landed him in the mongoose house.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.840
Come in here, super creeps called Santa.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.840
You've really outdone yourself.

24:56.840 --> 24:57.840
Can anybody in here contribute to this?

24:57.840 --> 25:01.240
Thank you, your most perfunctory haiku-ness, responded Diesel,

25:01.240 --> 25:04.280
straightening his brassiere preposterously.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.360
Not so bubbly, farted Santa.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.880
This candle night's nonsense has side saddled long enough.

25:09.880 --> 25:14.680
Six billion grape jalapeno smoothies, and on top of that, nine whole bubbles?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.160
This is your last opus.

25:16.160 --> 25:21.080
Luckily, right at that moment, Santa was arrested on charges related to Watergate.

25:21.080 --> 25:25.720
The rarity of the anachronism ruined Camelites forever.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
The end.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.720
Thank you, everyone.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.720
I love you.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
Don't encourage it.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.720
That sucks.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.720
That's the worst.

25:31.720 --> 25:32.720
It's the worst.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.720
It's the pits.

25:33.720 --> 25:34.720
It was bad.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.720
Thank you for enjoying my art.

25:35.720 --> 25:45.520
My hope is, in the future, that you will remember their faces.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
You saw them, right?

25:46.520 --> 25:51.440
It's so nice to be appreciated in my own lifetime, so I don't have to wait until after my tragic

25:51.440 --> 25:53.680
death to be appreciated by those that love me.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.360
Mad Libs are bad, and I don't like them.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
They don't love you.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.640
They hate us.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.640
They just enjoy punishing.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.640
Wow, just the worst.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.640
That might have been the worst one.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.640
I didn't even listen to it.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.840
I've been working on that for two months.

26:05.840 --> 26:10.040
Do you know how much worse it is when I have to hear people not being entertained as they

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
were doing it?

26:11.040 --> 26:12.040
No, no.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.040
They were rapped.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.360
They were just so hard to pay attention, they weren't laughing.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.360
Were they rapped?

26:16.360 --> 26:17.360
They were rapped.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.080
Did you help them in your sway?

26:20.080 --> 26:21.880
They were so focused.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.320
They paid $10 to be talked to like children just now.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.880
Crystal, don't laugh.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
I don't want to miss a word.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.560
Did you hear that?

26:30.560 --> 26:31.560
He said Santa farted.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.560
Oh, no.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.560
I'm doing it myself.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
Oh, my God.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.560
Can we move on?

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
Please.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
Well, I did have a second one.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
Do you want me to go ahead and read that out loud?

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
I'll break this bottle in your head.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.560
Fair enough.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
Hey, dear brothers.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
I'm about to move to a new city since...

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
Oh, wait, wait.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.560
First, before I start.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.560
Is the Shazinator here?

26:45.560 --> 26:46.560
Boom.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.560
Hi.

26:47.560 --> 26:48.560
What's going on?

26:48.560 --> 26:49.560
Hey, everybody.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
Hey, sweet sweatshirt.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.560
That is a cool sweatshirt.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
Dear brothers.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.560
I'm about to move to a new city since...

26:53.560 --> 26:54.560
Oh, wait, wait.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.560
First, before I start.

26:55.560 --> 26:56.560
Is the Shazinator here?

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
Boom.

26:57.560 --> 26:58.560
Hey, what's going on?

26:58.560 --> 26:59.560
Hey, everybody.

26:59.560 --> 27:02.560
Hey, sweet sweatshirt.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.560
Dear brothers.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
I'm about to move to a new city.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
I don't know why anybody would want to leave Austin.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
Don't.

27:06.560 --> 27:07.560
Don't.

27:07.560 --> 27:08.560
Alamo.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
Don't give him those cheap heels.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
No?

27:10.560 --> 27:11.560
No?

27:11.560 --> 27:12.560
Stars at night, big and bright?

27:12.560 --> 27:13.560
His bottle's broken.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.560
Does that work?

27:14.560 --> 27:15.560
What?

27:15.560 --> 27:16.560
Sorry.

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
My bottle was broken.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
Go on.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.560
How does it work?

27:19.560 --> 27:20.560
How do you...

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
How does it work?

27:21.560 --> 27:22.560
It goes like this.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.560
The stars at night are big and bright.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.560
Clap, clap, clap.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
Deep in the heart of Texas.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
That's great.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.560
That was very...

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
That was a great show, too.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.560
So if I said, we are?

27:31.560 --> 27:32.560
Marshall.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.560
Okay.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.560
So it doesn't...

27:34.560 --> 27:35.560
Boomer.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.560
No.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.560
Come on.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.560
Don't do that here.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
So, okay.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.560
Oh, yikes.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.560
And then the crowd turned.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.560
Sports team.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.560
Let's hear it for sport.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.560
Hey, please, guys.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.560
You like our show.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
Let's not pretend.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.560
Okay.

27:48.560 --> 27:49.560
There's super fans here.

27:49.560 --> 27:53.520
Besides, I hear that was...

27:53.520 --> 27:58.640
Your favorite sport is Mario Kart.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.640
Nerd alert.

27:59.640 --> 28:04.520
Did you see that My Brother, My Brother and Me show, the 7 o'clock one?

28:04.520 --> 28:05.520
Yeah, it was good.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.600
It started out real funny, then it sucked for like two minutes while Travis read his

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
thing.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.640
And then it got super antagonistic afterwards.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.760
They were like just egging on the audience.

28:15.760 --> 28:19.160
I'm just going to start throwing like rotten peaches at you guys.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.600
Dear brothers, I'm about to move to a new city.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.800
And since finishing college, I've had difficulty meeting new people.

28:25.800 --> 28:30.360
My boyfriend will help, but I'd like to space out my time with him as to not drive him crazy.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.360
Nice.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.360
Nice.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.080
What are some good ways to meet friends?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.080
What?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.080
No, no.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.080
Sorry.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.080
Go ahead.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.080
Sorry.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.080
What are some good ways...

28:40.080 --> 28:45.080
Oh, you think that might've been alienated for those of us with wives, right?

28:45.080 --> 28:46.080
Yeah.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.080
Yeah.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
Well.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.080
I like to call that an emasculifies.

28:49.080 --> 28:50.080
Yeah.

28:50.080 --> 28:51.080
You are paying for that later.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.640
That's an emasculifies for you guys.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.640
She knows.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.280
Luckily my girlfriend doesn't listen to the show.

28:56.280 --> 29:00.240
She heard you were doing a sad live and she just couldn't break.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.360
She couldn't see you fall apart like that.

29:03.360 --> 29:08.680
So what are some good ways to meet friends in a new city?

29:08.680 --> 29:09.680
I'm glad you asked.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.680
I'm glad you asked.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.680
Is Austin the city you just moved to?

29:11.680 --> 29:12.680
Wait, I'm confused.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.800
No, I'm moving to Albany, New York.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.800
Albany, New York.

29:15.800 --> 29:19.640
That's the furthest from here.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.120
Okay.

29:21.120 --> 29:25.840
We had talked about this before and what we had agreed to do was to introduce you to everybody

29:25.840 --> 29:26.900
in the audience.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.000
One by one, it would be the rest of the show.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.920
It has only just now occurred to me.

29:31.920 --> 29:32.920
That's a dumb idea.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.000
That's a stupid idea because you're all in Austin.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.160
Anybody else here live in Albany?

29:37.160 --> 29:38.160
No.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.960
How many of you would be willing to move to Albany with her?

29:41.960 --> 29:44.720
If she could take a group with her, the whole problem's solved.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.400
I can offer you a $30 to $33 moving stipend.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.160
If you can move with her to Albany right now.

29:51.160 --> 29:55.520
We got like half a pizza backstage that, I don't know, will feed you on your trip.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.520
I don't know.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.840
That's what we'll do with pizza.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.280
What's up with Albany?

29:59.280 --> 30:00.280
Is it the skiing?

30:00.280 --> 30:01.280
My boyfriend got a job.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.280
At a ski lodge?

30:02.280 --> 30:03.280
No.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.280
I'm in it now.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.280
I'm interested.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.280
I want to get into your life.

30:06.280 --> 30:12.880
Now he's in your story because we can't do the other thing.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
What's a good way to meet friends?

30:13.880 --> 30:17.000
Go to a live show in Albany and then they'll do a similar gift.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.640
Go to my brother, my brother and me, Albany.

30:19.640 --> 30:20.640
Which now we have to do.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
We'll see you there on Tuesday.

30:21.640 --> 30:22.640
We can just do a franchise.

30:22.640 --> 30:27.320
We'll sell a franchise there and get three other brothers to do it.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.440
We're the Schmackleroys.

30:30.440 --> 30:34.120
We're McElroys too.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.760
Like Gallagher.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.160
I tell you, don't you do that sat-libs bit.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.400
It's not because we have a copywriter.

30:40.400 --> 30:44.000
We just don't want anybody else to have to go through it.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It's an art form.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.280
You can do it.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
Do you have anything to offer?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.280
Like other people?

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
Jesus.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.280
Wow.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.280
I don't know.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.280
Wow.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.280
That's like super on the nose.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.280
What are you?

30:56.280 --> 30:59.560
Let me try that with a different tone of voice.

30:59.560 --> 31:00.560
So what do you have to offer?

31:00.560 --> 31:01.560
That's not still good enough though.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
Now you're giving our job interview at a ski lodge.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.560
What's wrong with you?

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
How are you with sloping?

31:05.560 --> 31:06.560
Are you a slope?

31:06.560 --> 31:10.840
Are you a slopster?

31:10.840 --> 31:11.840
That is ski terminology.

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
Yeah.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
Okay.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.760
Just go up to talk, talk to somebody you don't know.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.760
That's the real trick of it.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.120
That's what you people came to see, right?

31:20.120 --> 31:26.640
The real hard hitting advice that only my brother, my brother and me can offer.

31:26.640 --> 31:27.640
I don't know.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.480
I'm pretty bad at getting to know people in new cities.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.220
I like to have this install base there already.

31:32.220 --> 31:35.640
Can you get on internet and use internet to, can you start just adding people on Facebook

31:35.640 --> 31:36.640
who live in Albany?

31:36.640 --> 31:37.640
Hi Pete.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.640
I'm like half joking.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.640
I hear you're a laid off dock worker.

31:39.640 --> 31:40.640
Well, my name is me.

31:40.640 --> 31:45.640
Can we be friends?

31:45.640 --> 31:49.400
We are both one of the 99%.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.400
Let's be buds.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.400
Say it now you have something in common.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
Griffin.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.400
How about Yahoo?

31:54.400 --> 31:55.400
Please.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.400
Oh, we're burning right through them.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.400
This one is sent in by Nefariousity.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.400
He sent in like all of them.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.980
Thank you Nefariousity.

32:00.980 --> 32:01.980
You really killed it this week.

32:01.980 --> 32:02.980
It's by Yahoo!

32:02.980 --> 32:08.560
Answers user Y and then an exclamation point and it's so Siri and it got cut off, but I

32:08.560 --> 32:14.120
imagine that is the Joker thing.

32:14.120 --> 32:22.400
He asks, have you ever kissed like you invented it?

32:22.400 --> 32:25.080
Does he mean like you kiss someone and then yell that's copyrighted?

32:25.080 --> 32:26.080
Yeah.

32:26.080 --> 32:31.760
Don't you try and do that to anybody else because that's mine.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.600
I don't know that inventing it is the right word.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.240
I've kissed like I've patented it.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.000
I've kissed like I own the concept and IP firsthand.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.880
I've kissed like I've made it my own.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.880
Yeah.

32:43.880 --> 32:44.880
Hey, only he kisses like that.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.800
I kissed like I reinvented it.

32:46.800 --> 32:47.800
Yeah.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.320
Who's ever been kissed him and like, what did you do?

32:50.320 --> 32:51.320
What did you do?

32:51.320 --> 32:53.120
What the hell was that?

32:53.120 --> 32:56.160
That's usually not a good sign, gang.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.280
We've been around for a few thousand years.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.080
We've pretty much sussed out all the ways.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.960
It's like you had a finger in your mouth.

33:01.960 --> 33:02.960
What happened?

33:02.960 --> 33:09.240
It was like a terrible, it was like kissing four thumbs.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.520
It was incredible.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.080
Weirdly roused.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.520
How do you even know if you've kissed like you've invented it?

33:16.520 --> 33:17.520
I've never got.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.160
You feel like you've kissed like you invented it.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.160
You're a douchebag.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.160
Yeah.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.160
Yeah.

33:22.160 --> 33:26.320
Kiss like you invented it is my favorite Tim McGraw song.

33:26.320 --> 33:31.080
I kissed like I barely grasped the concept.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.720
You can kiss like you chopped and screwed it, like you remixed it.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.720
Yeah.

33:34.720 --> 33:35.720
I like that a lot.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.720
Yeah.

33:36.720 --> 33:42.600
Maybe while you're kissing a lady or boy, you like flip them around on your mouth.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.600
You would have to lay on the ground.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
Okay.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.600
So like a sit and spin.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.600
You're not talking about like a human centipede situation.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.600
No, no, no.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
It's mouth to mouth.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.600
So that would be a human push me, pull you, if anything.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.600
Things got weird.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.600
Wow.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
Yeah.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.600
Surprise.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
Hi.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.120
It's our show.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.300
Kiss like you.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.300
Are there any answers?

34:02.300 --> 34:06.200
Did anybody talk about kissing like they invented it?

34:06.200 --> 34:09.080
Someone without a name said, I only wish I hadn't invented it.

34:09.080 --> 34:14.880
Then I would have been the first to kiss those sweet, sweet lips.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.520
Like the metaphorical sweet, sweet lips of humanity.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.280
Like I get it.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.140
I brought love to the world.

34:21.140 --> 34:22.140
I'm the shining light.

34:22.140 --> 34:24.940
I'm the Prometheus of kissing.

34:24.940 --> 34:25.940
This is confusing.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.640
That is also the name of my band.

34:27.640 --> 34:29.520
The Prometheus of kissing.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.520
I haven't.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.520
I brought smooch down from the mountain.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.520
I stole smooch from the gods.

34:32.520 --> 34:37.520
And I've brought lip, lip, lip lockin' down to you Cubans.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.520
Oh yikes.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.520
Plebes.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
I didn't read these.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.520
Somebody said, hello, sir.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.520
Knew you'd ask something soon.

34:44.520 --> 34:45.520
Lol.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.520
No, I can't say that I have, unfortunately.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.520
Thanks for the input.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.520
Wait, knew you'd ask something soon?

34:51.520 --> 34:52.520
Yeah.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.520
I've been eyeballing your account for a while now just waiting for a little activity.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.520
You came out with a club banger.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.520
Unfortunately, I have no input for you on this one.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.520
I wish I could respond in the affirmative.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
Yeah.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.520
I like to kiss them dang lips like I'm mad at them.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.520
No.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.520
I'm not a kissing expert as my wife will attest.

35:15.520 --> 35:19.520
Even I can tell you that's the wrong way of doing it.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.520
That's not.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.520
Come here.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.520
Stupid lips.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.520
Hate your lips.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.520
Give me the sweet lips.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.520
Press them against my lips.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.520
Hold still.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.520
I hate your lips.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.520
Rub them on me.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.520
I'm chapped.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.520
I put some cherry lip sparklers on and rub them.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.520
I hate your lips.

35:40.520 --> 35:44.520
Is that like an angry Bill Cosby?

35:44.520 --> 35:46.520
I got devil pudding all over my lips.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.520
Rub them on there.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.520
You have to stop doing that voice.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.520
I want to do it.

35:54.520 --> 35:59.520
I've never kissed someone like Bill Cosby.

35:59.520 --> 36:05.520
I need to save my lips because I'm going to do a Scott bit on a Harry Belafonte record.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.520
Kiss my lips harder.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.520
I can't feel anything in there.

36:10.520 --> 36:14.520
They're frozen from the pudding pop.

36:14.520 --> 36:20.520
It sounds like Bill Cosby being drawn and quartered actually.

36:20.520 --> 36:26.520
I'll never turn my back on the Scots.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.520
Man, they were truly nice.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.520
I forget the quote.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.520
I don't remember the quote from Braveheart.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.520
Don't worry about it.

36:34.520 --> 36:35.520
Oh, fuck.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.520
Is that enough comedy yet?

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
No.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.520
Never enough comedy.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
Come on.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.520
More comedy.

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
It's like a comedy marathon.

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
Hey, listen.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.520
It is every week, Travis.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
Every week.

36:45.520 --> 36:52.520
Hey, it is becoming more and more obvious that one of my best friends doesn't brush his teeth.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.520
Okay, so just so you know, this is not from someone here,

36:54.520 --> 37:00.520
but I would like to look around the room and see how many people just looked at their friends that they came with.

37:00.520 --> 37:04.520
God damn it, Dylan.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.520
His breath is so bad.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.520
How bad is it?

37:09.520 --> 37:13.520
It's so bad that I have to cover my mouth or hold my breath while he's talking to me.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.520
It sounds really bad.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.520
It's not like a good dozens bit.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.520
In a confined area, in a car, for example.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.520
Thank you, question asker, for clarifying confined area for me.

37:22.520 --> 37:25.520
Like a car or a shower or a closet.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.520
Or a small box.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.520
Car shower.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.520
A veterinary stand.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.520
Littlest pet shop.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.520
All of the other guys that we hang out with think the same thing.

37:34.520 --> 37:38.520
We want to tell him, but are not sure how to approach the matter.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.520
Do we straight up tell him?

37:40.520 --> 37:41.520
Chris.

37:41.520 --> 37:46.520
How do you not know that your mouth tastes bad with your own tongue that's in there?

37:46.520 --> 37:48.520
It's like spoiled hummus in there.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.520
I know, usually.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.520
I hate my mouth.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.520
Usually when we advise against it, it's like straight up telling someone something like,

37:53.520 --> 37:58.520
it's because, you know, it's like we're awkward and we don't want to bring it up.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.520
There is literally no way to bring this up that isn't this.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.520
Your breath stinks.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.520
Your breath fucking stinks.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
Brush your teeth.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
What are you doing?

38:06.520 --> 38:07.520
Get out of here, Cindy Mal Jones.

38:07.520 --> 38:11.520
Your teeth are your treasure, take care of them with a brush.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.520
Get a brush and pamper your...

38:13.520 --> 38:15.520
Pamper your teeth.

38:15.520 --> 38:20.520
Maybe you could set it up like a trust exercise and you brush his teeth and he brushes your teeth.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.520
And then you do it every day for the rest of his life.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.520
That was so nice, Stephen.

38:24.520 --> 38:25.520
Let's never stop.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.520
Do you...

38:26.520 --> 38:27.520
Can you guys...

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
Let me see a show of hands.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.520
Would...

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
If your breath...

38:30.520 --> 38:32.520
Who brushes their teeth?

38:32.520 --> 38:35.520
I only saw those two guys raise their hands.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.520
I'm not trying to call you all out, but good work you two.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.520
And gross everyone else.

38:39.520 --> 38:44.520
If your breath was so bad that people would write into a comedy advice show about it,

38:44.520 --> 38:48.520
knowing full well that they were going to really eviscerate your buddy,

38:48.520 --> 38:50.520
would you want to know?

38:50.520 --> 38:51.520
I mean, would you want someone to...

38:51.520 --> 38:52.520
Raise your hands.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.520
Let me see.

38:53.520 --> 38:55.520
Who would want their friend to tell them?

38:55.520 --> 38:56.520
Whoa.

38:56.520 --> 38:57.520
Okay.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.520
So we see about half of these people want to live a lie.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.520
And the other half have stinky breath.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.520
Yeah.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.520
Not me.

39:04.520 --> 39:05.520
Not me.

39:05.520 --> 39:09.520
I think I would want them to tell me right before it got to that point

39:09.520 --> 39:11.520
where you wrote into a comedy advice podcast.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.520
Your bad breath is about to become a meme.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.520
I wanted to warn you ahead of time.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.520
Can you brush your teeth while they're sleeping?

39:20.520 --> 39:23.520
Are they mouth breathers?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.520
Are they really heavy sleepers?

39:25.520 --> 39:27.520
Can you get one of those fish,

39:27.520 --> 39:31.520
those tiny fish in the ocean that clean off whales for them?

39:31.520 --> 39:32.520
Oh, right.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.520
Like a pilot fish.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.520
A pilot fish.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.520
A pilot fish.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.520
They live in your friend's mouth.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.520
You can't do that until they wake up.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.520
And then you're just standing over them and there's a fish in their mouth.

39:40.520 --> 39:41.520
Yeah.

39:41.520 --> 39:42.520
Yeah.

39:42.520 --> 39:43.520
Must be Tuesday.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.520
And then you got to say, gotcha!

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
And run out of the room.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
Psych!

39:46.520 --> 39:47.520
I'll never see you again.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.520
I'm moving to a Midwestern city.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.520
What about one of those birds?

39:50.520 --> 39:51.520
Get one of them birds that...

39:51.520 --> 39:52.520
One of them rhino birds.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.520
One of them rhino birds.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.520
There's so much wildlife that you can put right in there.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.520
Get one of those rhino birds to get the fish out of their mouth.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.520
It's a cuckoo bird.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.520
That mouth smells like fish.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
Your mouth smells like fish.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.520
I'm going to eat the fish out of your mouth and you got to clean your teeth.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.520
Then I'm going to eat the other things on your teeth.

40:05.520 --> 40:07.520
Maybe you wait until they do something really awesome and you're like,

40:07.520 --> 40:08.520
oh, that's a really great haircut.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.520
And also your breath stinks.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.520
You're saying...

40:11.520 --> 40:12.520
And so that way they're going like that.

40:12.520 --> 40:13.520
Oh.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.520
Miracle Max style.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.520
You give a little chocolate coat and it makes it go down.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
Yeah.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
Yeah.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
Right.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.520
I like beautiful new shoes.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.520
Also your breath stinks.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.520
You probably shouldn't say it like Eddie Griffin.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.520
Just for the record.

40:25.520 --> 40:29.520
You probably shouldn't say, hey, yo, your breath stinks.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.520
Maybe get their celebrity like hero to say it to them.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.520
Oh, that'll be much better.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.520
Hi, I'm Scott Bakula.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.520
And God damn, your breath.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.520
I don't know what's going on in there, bro.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.520
But God damn.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.520
Hi, I'm Jeff Goldblum.

40:43.520 --> 40:47.520
I'm Jeff Goldblum, but I don't like it in there.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.520
I do not like it very much.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.520
No, thanks.

40:50.520 --> 40:54.520
Can you wait until they're 85 and have been lonely their whole life and then

40:54.520 --> 40:57.520
they come to you and ask why and then you drop it on them.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
Can I not tell you?

40:58.520 --> 40:59.520
Oh, sorry.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.520
I meant to tell you when we're 25.

41:00.520 --> 41:04.520
Can you pretend that you are them time traveling back from the future to tell

41:04.520 --> 41:06.520
them that their breath smells bad?

41:06.520 --> 41:10.520
I know that that's my answer to a lot of questions, right?

41:10.520 --> 41:12.520
Thank God I found you.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.520
If it's not too late, you're going to meet queen, some queen.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.520
Queen Elizabeth, is she still alive?

41:17.520 --> 41:18.520
Yeah.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.520
Okay.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.520
You're going to meet the baron queen.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.520
You're going to meet queen and Paul Rogers.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.520
This is a reach toothbrush.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.520
Fucking use it.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.520
Oh wait, you can do that now in the present.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.520
That's his friend.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.520
Just hand him a reach tooth.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.520
I went with my new dentist and he has a movie he'd like to show you.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.520
Get him a reach toothbrush for Christmas.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
This is not joke time anymore.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.520
You have to take care of your friend's mouth.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.520
Yeah, this goes past like my friend chews too loudly.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.520
Like your friend's got mouth problems.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.520
Serious ginger fighter problems.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.520
Take it from someone whose gums have bled.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.520
Oh God.

41:46.520 --> 41:47.520
You're doing him a favor.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.520
Gross.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.520
Hey, how did you-

41:49.520 --> 41:50.520
Now you know two secrets about Travis.

41:50.520 --> 41:51.520
Yeah.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.520
It's getting a little too real in here.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.520
Come for the eggnog, stay for the terrible revelations.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.520
How was that eggnog everybody?

41:56.520 --> 41:57.520
Did everybody get eggnog?

41:57.520 --> 41:58.520
Yeah.

41:58.520 --> 41:59.520
Do you want to brush your teeth now?

41:59.520 --> 42:00.520
Too bad.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.520
We thought we'd get you really heavy with eggnog humors before you.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.520
How about a Yahoo?

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
Yeah, please.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.520
This one is sent in by Galiayali.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.520
Thanks, Galiayali.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user FashionA and then it cuts off.

42:12.520 --> 42:13.520
So I don't know guys.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.520
I printed these out.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.520
I'm sorry.

42:16.520 --> 42:24.520
FashionA ellipses asks, where can I find the hottest sexy Santa outfit?

42:24.520 --> 42:26.520
That's at the end of the question.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.520
Oh, okay.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.520
They can borrow mine.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.520
Your sexy walking Phoenix outfit.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.520
If they promise not to stretch it out.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.520
Is it tight in all the right places?

42:36.520 --> 42:37.520
All the right places.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.520
I would actually call those wrong places.

42:39.520 --> 42:44.520
I prefer your clothes to be loose fitting in those places.

42:44.520 --> 42:51.520
Don't you, I mean, can you make it, can you start with, it's entirely possible to start

42:51.520 --> 42:56.520
with a not sexy Santa outfit and then with some scissors and some imagination.

42:56.520 --> 43:01.520
You're going to play, you're going to pay really upmarket prices for a sexy Santa outfit.

43:01.520 --> 43:02.520
You can make it home really easily.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.520
Hey, where are your valuable bits?

43:04.520 --> 43:08.520
Just cut holes there and then we can see them and then, that's pretty sexy.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.520
That's just really upfront Santa.

43:10.520 --> 43:11.520
That's weird.

43:11.520 --> 43:12.520
That's not sexy.

43:12.520 --> 43:13.520
It's not sexy to be like, look at these.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.520
You're wearing a Santa smock, but I can see both your boobles.

43:16.520 --> 43:21.520
It's like almost a Santa outfit except your balls are really prominent.

43:21.520 --> 43:25.520
You've just been really upfront about your balls.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.520
And then they're just out there.

43:27.520 --> 43:31.520
You know, my favorite holiday song is I saw mommy grazing Santa Claus.

43:31.520 --> 43:32.520
That's the problem.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.520
If you just cut a hole for your balls, it's like, okay, present.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.520
And then you're just standing there.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.520
Is it sexy yet?

43:40.520 --> 43:42.520
I didn't plan past this.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.520
I don't have an exit strategy.

43:45.520 --> 43:50.520
I was going to do the two hand cup and shuffle off.

43:50.520 --> 43:51.520
Okay, the one hand cup.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.520
The one hand cup.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.520
Yeah, okay.

43:53.520 --> 44:00.520
I had a weird childhood and subsequently any Santa outfit's a sexy Santa outfit to me.

44:00.520 --> 44:03.520
I had some things go, it broke bad.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.520
Let's just put it that way.

44:05.520 --> 44:09.520
And I can't see.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.520
You can't catch a whiff of the smell of Ho Ho's beer.

44:11.520 --> 44:15.520
If I smell frankincense, burr, it's just whoop.

44:15.520 --> 44:23.520
I just want to, I just noticed this question does not say where can I find a sexy Santa Claus outfit.

44:23.520 --> 44:28.520
It says, where can I find the hottest sexy Santa Claus outfit?

44:28.520 --> 44:35.520
Meaning some clerk or salesperson has presented a sexy Santa Claus costume to them and they said, no, that's not it.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.520
Nope.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
Nope.

44:37.520 --> 44:38.520
I need hotter damn it.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.520
Hotter.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.520
Hell no when I see it.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.520
It's not sexy enough.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.520
Sexy or moral.

44:43.520 --> 44:48.520
There's no way I'm getting this promotion.

44:48.520 --> 44:53.520
Can you just low ride a regular Santa outfit so that people can see the back goods?

44:53.520 --> 44:54.520
The what?

44:54.520 --> 44:55.520
The goods on the back.

44:55.520 --> 44:57.520
The goods that you have on the back end.

44:57.520 --> 45:01.520
So that way you can back it up and make it shake like a bowl full of jelly.

45:01.520 --> 45:04.520
That's the fucking grossest thing you've ever said to me.

45:04.520 --> 45:08.520
That's the fucking grossest thing you've ever said right to my face.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.520
You've said, you've said some things too.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.520
You've said some shit.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.520
You've said some things sir.

45:14.520 --> 45:15.520
Are there any answers?

45:15.520 --> 45:17.520
Did anybody have any suggestions?

45:17.520 --> 45:20.520
Somebody says, oh, there's this place called the Naughty Nook.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.520
You might want to see if there's one in your area.

45:22.520 --> 45:26.520
Someone says, Fredericks has one too.

45:26.520 --> 45:30.520
Hit up your local Fredericks.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.520
Hey internet, stop helping these people.

45:33.520 --> 45:36.520
The proper response when you see that is close the tab.

45:36.520 --> 45:41.520
Don't like further push them down this road over this horrifying bath they've started out.

45:41.520 --> 45:46.520
There's a chance if you wear a sexy Santa outfit, there is a chance.

45:46.520 --> 45:49.520
Slim though it may be, passing motors, whatever.

45:49.520 --> 45:52.520
Some kid may see you and that's it.

45:52.520 --> 45:53.520
That's it for him.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.520
That's it.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.520
Then he converts, right?

45:55.520 --> 45:56.520
Something happened to me.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.520
I mean, I'm a quantum man now.

45:58.520 --> 45:59.520
I want you guys to follow me here.

45:59.520 --> 46:04.520
But the only thing that gets me through questions like these is to think that I believe in alternate realities.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.520
In some way, there's an alternate reality Yahoo answers question that says,

46:07.520 --> 46:11.520
where can I find the most modest nonchalant Santa outfit?

46:11.520 --> 46:14.520
I am Santa in my child's school play.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.520
I'm trying to be a good person.

46:16.520 --> 46:24.520
Where can I find a Santa outfit that will hide my balls?

46:24.520 --> 46:27.520
Every Santa outfit I've come across has been too revealing.

46:27.520 --> 46:32.520
I need it to hide my balls the best.

46:32.520 --> 46:36.520
I need so much coverage down there that it looks like I have panic and then you circled back around.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.520
Now you're terrible again.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.520
I need the most chaste Santa costumes.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.520
The holiest of holy of Santa costumes.

46:43.520 --> 46:46.520
Excuse me, where do you have the Santa costumes that include burqas?

46:46.520 --> 46:47.520
I need one of those.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.520
I need to hide everything.

46:49.520 --> 46:55.520
Can we try to acknowledge the situation within which one would need a sexy Santa outfit?

46:55.520 --> 46:58.520
Because it's not for a school play and it's not for Christmas morning.

46:58.520 --> 47:03.520
Are there a group of people who want to fuck Santa Claus?

47:03.520 --> 47:04.520
Is that somebody's thing?

47:04.520 --> 47:06.520
Is that somebody's dish?

47:06.520 --> 47:08.520
Have you heard the song Santa Baby?

47:08.520 --> 47:10.520
That's what it is.

47:10.520 --> 47:13.520
I don't like this world that you're introducing.

47:13.520 --> 47:18.520
I'm amazed that somebody wants to punch line to some sort of down your chimney gag and that's what they're wearing.

47:18.520 --> 47:19.520
Jingle balls.

47:19.520 --> 47:22.520
That's an awfully big investment for one goof.

47:22.520 --> 47:30.520
When it comes to dealing with my fellow co-workers, I tend to have a rather difficult time with the volume of my voice.

47:30.520 --> 47:38.520
I usually mumble quietly even when just saying excuse me or I'm sorry and fear the day I might try to say something and just end up yelling.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.520
Is there...

47:41.520 --> 47:45.520
So the problem is like they're saving it all up and one day the dam will break.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.520
Here comes my volume.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.520
They won't be able to stop yelling.

47:47.520 --> 47:50.520
They're just going to Care Bear stare the person's ears right off.

47:50.520 --> 47:55.520
Is there a simple solution or should I just start giving awkward stares with my mumbles?

47:55.520 --> 47:57.520
Just talk normal.

47:57.520 --> 47:59.520
Just talk like a person.

47:59.520 --> 48:02.520
Listen to how we're talking and then emulate us except for the subject matter.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.520
Slightly quieter.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
A little quieter.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.520
We're doing a live performance like quieter than this.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.520
But still like there is a simple solution.

48:11.520 --> 48:12.520
Talk like a person.

48:12.520 --> 48:13.520
Talk like a grown up.

48:13.520 --> 48:14.520
Or.

48:14.520 --> 48:15.520
Or.

48:15.520 --> 48:16.520
Unless.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.520
Unless.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.520
Just talk loud all the time.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.520
Yell all the time.

48:20.520 --> 48:21.520
Yelly Steve.

48:21.520 --> 48:25.520
Yelly Steve the office's town crier.

48:25.520 --> 48:26.520
Or.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.520
Or.

48:27.520 --> 48:28.520
Don't talk at all.

48:28.520 --> 48:29.520
Just stop talking.

48:29.520 --> 48:30.520
Monkey Steve.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.520
When someone bumps you in the hallway just stare at them.

48:33.520 --> 48:35.520
They'll never bump you again.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.520
Yeah because you're fired.

48:37.520 --> 48:39.520
Excuse me Johnson.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.520
Johnson.

48:40.520 --> 48:41.520
Johnson.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.520
Johnson.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.520
Johnson.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.520
Johnson come back.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.520
Johnson.

48:46.520 --> 48:47.520
Johnson.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.520
Johnson.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.520
Johnson.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
Johnson.

48:50.520 --> 48:51.520
Johnson.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.520
Keep doing it.

48:52.520 --> 48:53.520
Johnson.

48:53.520 --> 48:54.520
This is good.

48:54.520 --> 49:02.520
I think the audience is thinking when's Griffin going to do his terrible bit.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.520
You'll have to come back at nine to see that.

49:04.520 --> 49:08.520
I think if this person is if their worry is like I try to control the sound of my voice

49:08.520 --> 49:14.520
so that I don't like freak out my other employees then I would say that you're already doing

49:14.520 --> 49:17.520
that because you're the quiet mumbly guy that everyone's afraid of.

49:17.520 --> 49:18.520
When people say like.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.520
Don't.

49:19.520 --> 49:20.520
Don't bump Steve.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.520
Whatever you do.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.520
I don't know what his plan is but he's making a list.

49:23.520 --> 49:24.520
Right.

49:24.520 --> 49:25.520
Checking it twice.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.520
In the sexiest Santa costume he could find.

49:28.520 --> 49:29.520
If you.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.520
If you.

49:30.520 --> 49:31.520
Yeah you're already that guy.

49:31.520 --> 49:34.520
When they talk about the last one you'd ever suspect to do something like this they're

49:34.520 --> 49:35.520
not talking about you.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.520
You're the first one they suspect to do exactly what you're.

49:38.520 --> 49:39.520
Oh.

49:39.520 --> 49:41.520
The bad news is if you start being loud now.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.520
Now you've made the jump to the other side.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.520
Like now he's just screaming all the time.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.520
He was quiet for like three years and now he's screaming.

49:48.520 --> 49:50.520
I feel like the fuse is lit.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.520
Yeah that damn is about to break.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.520
You need to treat him with kid gloves.

49:53.520 --> 49:56.520
And maybe you quit your job and start a new job as the normal guy.

49:56.520 --> 49:57.520
Yeah.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.520
Regular guy.

49:58.520 --> 50:02.520
And maybe disappointing for them too if you just talk about dumb shit all the time and

50:02.520 --> 50:04.520
then be like oh that's what you were saying.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.520
That whole time.

50:05.520 --> 50:09.520
I'm sure he's doing mad lips over and over again.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.520
I'm sure he doesn't say dumb shit though.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
He's a listener.

50:12.520 --> 50:13.520
He's very dear.

50:13.520 --> 50:14.520
He's very dear to me.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.520
Maybe start saying dumb shit really loudly.

50:17.520 --> 50:18.520
I forgot we were talking.

50:18.520 --> 50:19.520
Some people will be like go back to mumbling.

50:19.520 --> 50:20.520
Yeah.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.520
I forgot we were talking about a person.

50:21.520 --> 50:24.520
I just hope he doesn't mumble when he tells them to listen to My Brother.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
My Brother made this great podcast he loves so much.

50:26.520 --> 50:29.520
If you say the title of a podcast it sounds like you're mumbling.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.520
It does kind of.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.520
That's why we haven't had more mainstream success.

50:33.520 --> 50:39.520
Because whenever the anchors or like Ryan Seacrest mentions our show it's all sort of

50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
down here.

50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
I don't know who that is.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.520
Do you want another yahoo?

50:43.520 --> 50:44.520
Yeah we got time for one more.

50:44.520 --> 50:47.520
There's one I sent in by It's 756 Trends.

50:47.520 --> 50:53.520
By yahoo answers user Lynn W who asks my cat's ghost is haunting me.

50:53.520 --> 50:57.520
My cat committed suicide three days ago.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.520
Now she's haunting me.

50:58.520 --> 50:59.520
Help.

50:59.520 --> 51:06.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.520
First off oh god there's so many first offs.

51:08.520 --> 51:11.520
But I think the main first off is if your cat.

51:11.520 --> 51:12.520
Is that the whole question?

51:12.520 --> 51:16.520
Yeah if your cat committed suicide it does not get to haunt you because that was in it's

51:16.520 --> 51:20.520
own paws if that's the situation.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.520
First as we all know suicide is straight to cat hell.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.520
I mean it's in the Bible.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
