00:00.000 --> 00:04.820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

00:05.760 --> 00:10.580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

00:11.480 --> 00:17.660

The sky because they're all here celebrating their November 8th birthdays now

02:39.900 --> 02:45.140
I do want to say when the episode comes out. It will be November 7th. Yeah

02:45.620 --> 02:52.460
What's your plan? Also the last time your guys birthday fell on an election day. It was a big stinker Rudy, wasn't it?

02:52.460 --> 02:57.060
Hey, thanks for reminding me bud. I totally didn't remember that. Thank you

02:57.060 --> 03:01.260
Just saying and it's for me to remember

03:01.500 --> 03:07.260
Yeah that I had that election day is November 8th because I'm not thinking about that every second

03:10.180 --> 03:16.860
Well, the only thing is you guys are like is the best day and I'm like it could you guys are in a panic spiral

03:16.860 --> 03:22.940
Right now and I am too, but mine is no I'm just mad at you Griffin. Don't misread my body language

03:22.940 --> 03:28.820
Mine's not attached to the birthday like my birthday is gonna be great. Jesus died dire

03:29.620 --> 03:30.700
consequences

03:30.700 --> 03:31.860
potentially

03:31.860 --> 03:34.700
But that's that's fine. That's the great

03:34.700 --> 03:41.460
I will receive the the greatest present for this birthday and Travis will likely receive it, too

03:41.460 --> 03:43.460
and you know what Griffin you'll even

03:43.540 --> 03:48.620
Get to get to open this one and that's that John Ossoff will get off my nuts

03:48.620 --> 03:50.620
Uh

03:51.500 --> 03:57.660
James Carville will retrain he'll take his talons out of my nuts. Yeah

03:58.540 --> 04:02.620
Where I'm not gonna say who cuz I don't want people like telling me about them

04:02.620 --> 04:09.460
But somebody who has reverend at the start of their name emails me nine times a day not an exaggeration

04:10.260 --> 04:12.540
Fresh nice memes from the rev

04:13.420 --> 04:17.860
Like I'm expecting to get like a hey man. Uh, what do you do it?

04:17.860 --> 04:23.660
Can I borrow a game you've been playing? I'm bored as hell man fucking I am

04:24.340 --> 04:29.780
Always getting texts and emails from James Carville asking to borrow my video games. He's like

04:31.780 --> 04:35.500
Red Dead Redemption 2 and I'm like that game came out a long time ago

04:35.500 --> 04:40.100
He's like you got it on Xbox 360 and it's like, why are you I don't even know

04:40.100 --> 04:45.100
They came out on Xbox 360 I often worry madden 10 with me

04:46.100 --> 04:51.180
I often worry that Elizabeth Warren is going to for some reason

04:51.460 --> 04:55.340
Actually personally text me and tell me like she ran out of gas and needs my help

04:55.340 --> 04:59.260
But it's just gonna pop up in my thing is the notification will just say hey Travis

04:59.260 --> 05:03.260
It's me Elizabeth Warren and I'll ignore it and she'll be sitting there like where is he?

05:03.260 --> 05:08.860
I I only had enough energy to text one person and Travis was the last person I texted asking for money

05:08.860 --> 05:11.420
Where is he? You know, here's how I never considered

05:12.220 --> 05:16.540
Do you think that people Elizabeth Warren texts in her day-to-day life?

05:17.080 --> 05:23.140
Do you think she is frequently getting responses to her personal text messages? They're like fuck. Oh

05:23.980 --> 05:28.500
Yeah, he stopped please unfollow stop to end unsubscribe

05:29.040 --> 05:36.580
What this is your wife unsubscribe now, it's really James Carville and I really want to borrow your Xbox. I have eight cell phones

05:36.580 --> 05:41.620
That's why I'd always come from a different number. That's what you would that's what you would say James

05:42.540 --> 05:49.340
Subscribe. I'm standing right in front of you. I got tricked by one last week and the the opener of the text was

05:50.080 --> 05:53.460
Tragic update deeply sad about Mark Kelly. It's like oh

05:54.700 --> 05:59.280
Dog died and that one I did pop open. They got me on that one. Yeah

06:00.540 --> 06:02.260
so that's

06:02.260 --> 06:08.580
Please vote. I mean we got it. You know, we have we're gonna say that and you already did vote but like vote good

06:08.740 --> 06:13.080
You know, I mean good do a good job. I guess the right way to write

06:15.080 --> 06:19.120
Fuck who knows man, you know, this isn't political advice

06:19.260 --> 06:26.660
You should vote for people that think the outcome of the election is valid. Yes. Yeah, that's a good start

06:27.060 --> 06:29.740
That's a good start. That's not political vote

06:29.740 --> 06:35.020
That's just like and listen visible. I'm gonna take a bowl political stand both of the people that aren't complete dipshits

06:35.460 --> 06:42.320
Yeah, this is this is that's too much. That's two political arms. You're choosing between two dipshits less of a dipshit then

06:45.180 --> 06:46.500
Anyway

06:46.500 --> 06:52.620
Happy birthday. I'm sorry that it got a little bit away from the main topic. Anyways back to our birthday. Thank you

06:52.620 --> 06:56.380
You're a balloon drop. Yeah, Travis and I are Travis. What are you?

06:56.380 --> 07:02.180
33 39. Yep. Oh my god. Oh my god. Do you know what age?

07:02.180 --> 07:06.240
I'm gonna turn guys 42 the nerds are gonna love this one

07:07.340 --> 07:14.040
Griffey juniors baseball number I think 42. Yeah, so I that's the last that's the last like

07:14.540 --> 07:19.400
Big one for 27 years. Yeah, and then you roll up into 60

07:20.460 --> 07:23.100
I'm looking to see if that was Ken Griffey juniors

07:23.100 --> 07:28.100
A jersey number cuz I'll be really impressed with myself. You could Travis our audience. You just say it is sure

07:28.100 --> 07:34.340
Yeah, it was literally nobody knows or is going to fact-check that or knows how to fact-check that. Oh, it absolutely was not

07:34.980 --> 07:36.980
Like he played for several different

07:37.220 --> 07:42.540
Teams and it wasn't on any of them. Okay. Hey, never mind. Hey, hey, look over there

07:42.540 --> 07:47.500
It's an advice show for the modern era. Let's bring that over here. Yes. Welcome. Welcome to our advice show

07:47.500 --> 07:50.660
We're so happy to have you here for this birthday celebration

07:50.660 --> 07:55.180
Celebration celebration. Mm-hmm. We're having a regatta for our birthday this year

07:55.180 --> 08:01.580
We're calling it a birthday celebration guys here in Cap City. It's buzzing. There's ever what is it?

08:01.580 --> 08:07.280
Cap City, this is what we call it here in capsaicin here in capsaicin. It's buzzing people are

08:08.460 --> 08:10.380
buzzing about our birthday

08:10.380 --> 08:16.060
About your birthday and about Election Day the schools here take two days off for Election Day for our birthday

08:16.060 --> 08:23.860
For Travis's birthday is on Monday and Justin's birthday. They take Tuesday off. Yeah, we take turns. They take time to really observe it

08:24.700 --> 08:31.140
I'm just want you all to know it's electric. It's electrifying. Is that what is the energy like they're electric and electrifying?

08:31.140 --> 08:38.580
People are just out on the street always now and the parties go all night long. This is like our this is like our day

08:38.980 --> 08:43.060
Do you know what I mean? Like are you guys allowed to vote? Have you thought about that?

08:43.060 --> 08:50.700
Yes, but the ballot is like a Shoney's kids menu and it's like do you think chocolate milk is good and we say

08:51.460 --> 08:57.620
We say yes, it is and they say do you want would it be cool to have people like in Congress for you?

08:57.620 --> 09:03.820
And we're like, yes. Yes, that's really that would be very cool. And they're like, okay, but how many pancakes do you want?

09:04.340 --> 09:10.100
And you know, I say three and it doesn't it then they take it and they say thank you

09:10.100 --> 09:13.180
They gave me the sticker. They put the menu right in the garbage can. Oh

09:13.180 --> 09:17.020
Do you at least get one of those lollipops where like the stick is a loop at the end?

09:17.020 --> 09:24.340
I do get a safety pop, which is oh, that's nice. Yeah, cuz I you know, I can't be trusted to vote for

09:25.100 --> 09:26.540
members of Congress

09:26.540 --> 09:32.380
But I so I clearly can't be trusted to eat like a dum-dum a tootsie roll pop a charms blow pop

09:32.740 --> 09:39.340
Cuz it's going right down the windpipe. Yeah, but and like you're running and you trip in that stick. Whoo boy

09:39.340 --> 09:44.860
That's dangerous, but we're all having a ton of fun over here. It's a fucking party non-stop. Oh

09:45.980 --> 09:52.860
Cool energy. I love it. And I love your questions. That's what we're gonna answer for you right now in this podcast

09:54.420 --> 09:58.780
Which begins now, uh, I dog sit as a side hustle. I

09:59.300 --> 10:04.020
I don't think you should announce that to the people who you are dog sitting before

10:04.020 --> 10:08.740
Yeah, but I think you should just frame it differently. Anyway, a dog sit is a side hustle

10:08.740 --> 10:15.500
I don't currently have my own dog and I'm not actively looking to adopt but I really love a few of my regular dog clients

10:15.500 --> 10:20.740
I'm wondering if there's a chill way I could tell their people that if anything were ever happened to them

10:22.140 --> 10:24.140
Yeah, go on I would look I

10:24.860 --> 10:28.980
Would love to adopt them sort of like a dog godmother. Yep

10:29.900 --> 10:32.180
It's not that there's something better we could do there

10:32.180 --> 10:37.500
We're gonna circle back on the dog godmother cuz I'm not loving it or something there and there's some confusing pronoun stuff in there

10:37.500 --> 10:43.900
Just to be clear what you're saying is I love the dogs and I want to let the people know that if anything happens to

10:43.900 --> 10:46.220
The people I'll take the dogs. Okay

10:48.420 --> 10:53.500
Okay, so is there a chill way to ask about that without it sounding like a tacit threat

10:54.180 --> 10:57.460
Nice dog you got there would be a shame if something happened to you

10:58.460 --> 11:00.460
in upstate New York

11:04.260 --> 11:05.820
Listen

11:05.820 --> 11:13.300
Listen when it's sad thing, but when pets owners die don't go on the Rainbow Road

11:13.300 --> 11:16.620
Yeah, when they go, it's the Rainbow Ridge, isn't it?

11:16.620 --> 11:20.080
Rainbow Road is in Mario humans do it. We go on the Rainbow Road

11:21.020 --> 11:25.900
When they get hit by that blue shell on the Rainbow Road and you jump the fence on the first lap

11:25.900 --> 11:31.420
And you land on the lower part of the Rainbow Road and just fucking skook your dumbass cousins

11:31.420 --> 11:34.700
And you're like being Ted's awesome

11:39.660 --> 11:41.660
That we do it is

11:42.700 --> 11:47.020
Standard practice that the pets are buried with them with the owners

11:47.020 --> 11:47.300
Yes

11:47.300 --> 11:51.180
like a pharaoh like a pharaoh so they can protect us when

11:51.540 --> 11:57.460
Charon tries to ferret us across the River Styx and we're like, I'm not I would rather actually

11:57.460 --> 12:01.980
Actually hit the Rainbow Road right now. I would have way more fun with that than in your

12:02.620 --> 12:10.780
Slow ass canoe death. Nice. Try. I'm that's why you you do need to challenge death to some Mario Kart when you get down

12:10.780 --> 12:14.140
There to return or or you could do smash if that's your thing

12:14.260 --> 12:19.860
But it's Mario Kart and smash are the only two games that he's got down there. Yeah on GameCube

12:19.860 --> 12:25.980
So it's in a sad and it's sad, but you need when the hellbats come at you

12:25.980 --> 12:29.740
You're gonna need that dog with you or kitty cat kitty cats. I'm not well

12:30.420 --> 12:36.740
Kitty cats not gonna do much the weird the weird part of the conversation will not be the initial opening

12:37.100 --> 12:43.820
It's a little macabre, but I think most people would be like, yeah, you know what if I die

12:44.180 --> 12:46.740
you got my cat my dog, but

12:47.580 --> 12:49.340
What is step two?

12:49.340 --> 12:52.860
Mm-hmm, because there's a couple different ways it plays out

12:53.500 --> 12:54.940
one is

12:54.940 --> 12:56.940
Beth call her Beth

12:57.020 --> 13:01.260
dies and then you show up at the funeral would be like

13:01.740 --> 13:04.340
This is this may seem odd

13:04.940 --> 13:09.540
But it is actually chill Beth said that if she died I can have the dog

13:09.540 --> 13:15.300
So I'll go ahead and take that with me. No problem. That's how she won. I should too is the owner is like I

13:16.140 --> 13:17.940
Guess I need to call

13:17.940 --> 13:20.940
My lawyer. Yeah to put it in the will

13:20.940 --> 13:27.460
That you have my dog. Is that not a normal thing cuz I have in my will no joke

13:27.460 --> 13:29.640
Where my dogs go or something happens?

13:29.820 --> 13:30.340
Yeah

13:30.340 --> 13:36.940
I mean because mostly I knew it wasn't Justin or Griffin and I wanted to make that super clear. They're going to dad

13:39.540 --> 13:47.120
Enjoy Carol, you're gonna love it one more on the pile baby more baby. That's four dogs total or something happened today

13:47.120 --> 13:53.320
Oh, no, I can see out trust his window dad has showed up outside his house of the baseball bat

13:53.320 --> 14:00.280
He's just protecting him with his life. He's buying Travis granola and grapes dad is bad at nutrition

14:04.520 --> 14:07.000
But Travis, but you did that already, right

14:07.600 --> 14:13.720
What I'm saying is great while I'm watching you. Could you please call your lawyer and tell them to draft a new will please?

14:13.720 --> 14:19.200
Thank you. I don't know how to tell you this question. That's good. But this like if I if something happens to me

14:19.200 --> 14:24.980
I'm leaving whatever to whoever is not normally a gig economy related, right?

14:26.160 --> 14:28.160
like because

14:29.120 --> 14:30.880
It could happen anytime

14:30.880 --> 14:31.840
Not to me, of course

14:31.840 --> 14:37.080
But to other people and so this idea of like it could happen five years from now you've moved

14:37.320 --> 14:43.520
You like you went somewhere else and it's just like hey, I need you to find this person and give them my dog

14:43.520 --> 14:44.960
Oh

14:44.960 --> 14:48.080
you could probably do okay by like

14:50.240 --> 14:56.080
Showing the dog how to get to your house. Oh, yeah, maybe if you could persuade the dog to incredible journey. Yes

14:56.080 --> 15:01.760
Okay, you know you like just you the motion the wheels are already now

15:01.760 --> 15:06.360
Hold on Justin Lee. It's been a while since I've seen the incredible journey homeward bound the incredible journey

15:06.360 --> 15:10.280
But I don't believe it was well looks like it's time for me to move on

15:10.280 --> 15:16.120
Let me check this napkin with a map on it. Damn the whole family beefed it, huh?

15:18.240 --> 15:23.680
Dog walker, I really liked it. Think she's in Poughkeepsie. Do you guys know how to get there?

15:24.240 --> 15:27.080
Can we start moseying along? I'll find it

15:27.840 --> 15:35.680
Hey, remember me my whole family died. Can I stay with now? Okay. Oh fuck. Well, oh you got your own dog in the last eight

15:35.680 --> 15:42.480
Years bummer. Okay, this this look, you know what? I'm getting out the step. This is weird

15:47.080 --> 15:49.080
Sorry, we tried everything

15:49.680 --> 15:56.020
We gave it the old college, but that one's just weird. I'm sorry. You can't do it. Can't do that one

15:56.440 --> 16:01.280
Can't do that one. Can we do it? Can we go to the wizard though? Yeah, cuz yeah, it's not

16:01.280 --> 16:09.640
really Halloween anymore, but if you wanted to have like a darkness a dark sort of I was gonna invite the wizard to

16:09.640 --> 16:11.640
Thanksgiving no

16:12.160 --> 16:14.480
No, he's still thinking a lot about

16:15.920 --> 16:19.920
He's still thinking a lot about Halloween. There's a huge banner ad for

16:20.400 --> 16:22.560
Kate Blanchett's tar on

16:23.320 --> 16:27.360
My on my screen that I can't get rid of and it's like half the screen

16:27.360 --> 16:34.400
When I do it here roof when I need to it here roof tiles or stop one of the wet bandits

16:34.400 --> 16:37.760
I only reach for one brand and that's Kate Blanchett's

16:38.280 --> 16:39.440
a

16:39.440 --> 16:45.920
Lot of people said it was strange for me Kate Blanchett to it create my own line of tar

16:46.040 --> 16:48.040
but when other tars on the

16:48.320 --> 16:50.040
target

16:50.040 --> 16:54.500
You don't know what's in my heart. You don't know what's in my heart. You don't know what's on my roof

16:54.500 --> 17:00.820
I think is what I settled for but tar is my passion. It's the stickiest pitch imaginable

17:00.820 --> 17:02.820
I can catch Cinderella on this thing

17:04.340 --> 17:08.460
I've spent two decades perfecting Kate Blanchett's

17:08.820 --> 17:14.340
Everything else has been funding for this moment my little secret. It's delicious

17:16.620 --> 17:19.540
It's great on your roof great on toast enjoy

17:19.540 --> 17:25.500
This is how to act evil a villain is usually the most fun character to play

17:25.500 --> 17:29.220
But making that kind of evil truly scary and believable takes hard work

17:29.220 --> 17:31.460
If you aren't sure how to act evil for your role

17:31.460 --> 17:36.940
It helps to start from the outside and work inward once you have the perfect look for your evil character

17:36.940 --> 17:40.500
You'll be able to focus on creating a sinister persona

17:40.500 --> 17:44.280
Just I will I want to just create a little asterisk there and say

17:44.280 --> 17:50.480
Evil character most fun to play little asterisk down the bottom except Deadpool because it looks like mr

17:50.480 --> 17:52.880
Reynolds is having a blast with that character. Yeah

17:53.800 --> 17:55.800
So it seems like it's a

17:56.400 --> 17:58.720
villain except Deadpool at the bottom

18:00.800 --> 18:05.340
So here's the first step and it is to choose the right clothing evil is

18:06.280 --> 18:08.040
for the

18:08.040 --> 18:12.780
For the photo on this one for a little doodle for a little illustration

18:12.780 --> 18:15.260
They have a dude like pulling off a t-shirt

18:16.300 --> 18:18.300
but it's not like

18:18.540 --> 18:22.860
Really germane to what the question is about

18:24.180 --> 18:25.460
and

18:25.460 --> 18:32.240
I'm gonna I'll slack the image to you guys cuz it's it's like it's like that's what you guys went with is just like

18:32.820 --> 18:39.380
Here wear dark clothing because that's the you know traditional clothing of a bad boy

18:39.380 --> 18:41.620
But like then they sent this

18:41.620 --> 18:43.100
He's

18:43.100 --> 18:45.960
He's like cut and huh? Yeah

18:46.500 --> 18:50.540
It's like choose the right clothing evil is typically associated with dark foreboding colors

18:50.540 --> 18:54.220
So when you're playing a costume for a villainous character, that's the color palette that you should start with

18:54.220 --> 18:57.940
Well this this drawing is like a photo they took too soon

18:57.980 --> 19:01.540
It's like they started drawing it and the guy they were drawing wasn't ready

19:01.540 --> 19:04.020
Yes, it's it's you could see okay

19:04.020 --> 19:09.860
So you see a chest and then hands are pulling a shirt almost all the way off and the face

19:09.860 --> 19:14.220
We're on it is a dark color. That's true. Yeah, it's probably putting on a dark color

19:14.220 --> 19:21.180
What a bizarre time to draw this this guy. Yeah, and let's step out. Let's not this isn't

19:21.780 --> 19:27.520
This is not how to do a costume. I think people who come to this article looking for help want to be

19:28.380 --> 19:30.380
a real baddie and

19:30.700 --> 19:36.460
So you've got to consider the genre of that you want to be when planning your costume you have to take the type

19:36.460 --> 19:40.460
That of seeing you're working in so as the time period into account for example

19:40.500 --> 19:45.340
While a villain in a Western and evil character in a futuristic sci-fi play might both wear black

19:45.340 --> 19:47.100
The outfits will likely be very different

19:47.100 --> 19:48.140
otherwise man

19:48.140 --> 19:55.180
I wish there really was a futuristic sci-fi play all plays I go to is just like people singing about like their

19:55.940 --> 20:02.740
Newspaper well going good dad just went and saw back in London, which is a pretty futuristic sci-fi play if you ask me

20:02.740 --> 20:06.260
Oh, yeah, unless you know about something that I don't vis-a-vis

20:07.420 --> 20:12.620
Like time travel. Well, no, it's just like that the time that he goes to in the future in that movie

20:12.620 --> 20:16.800
We already did do that one. So like I would argue that's not so much future sci-fi

20:17.700 --> 20:22.260
But if there was one where like spaceship was there and like they had like a Star Wars

20:22.460 --> 20:29.060
Muse like play with like lightsabers and like Jedi babes and like all that. Oh, yeah cool shit

20:29.060 --> 20:32.780
Um, well Griffin, I'm sorry that that's not actually futuristic because I don't know if you know

20:32.780 --> 20:34.780
The Star Wars actually happened a long time ago

20:35.180 --> 20:37.180
Okay, but you know what? I mean like

20:38.700 --> 20:41.580
Historical fiction add sinister accessories

20:42.300 --> 20:44.300
like a spiky

20:44.460 --> 20:49.780
Eyepatch spiky collar spiky collar chain wallet chain wallet chain sinister, right? Yeah

20:51.420 --> 20:53.420
Vans

20:53.500 --> 20:55.500
Fucking jinko jeans

20:55.500 --> 20:57.500
Yeah

20:57.500 --> 20:59.500
some goggles

21:01.500 --> 21:07.060
Jamiroquai hat jamiroquai style beliefs jamiroquai faith

21:11.700 --> 21:15.340
All it really takes guys is a mustard seed of jamiroquai faith

21:17.020 --> 21:20.220
That's how you walk on walls and on the ceiling you just have to believe

21:20.220 --> 21:24.580
True go for sleek hair. There may be a variety of hairstyles that work

21:24.580 --> 21:28.380
Well for your character a sleek slick back do is usually a traditional look for a evil character

21:28.460 --> 21:33.220
Pomades work best when slicking back short hair clay base for a while generalization

21:33.220 --> 21:38.460
Is it it is like maybe like a 60-40 split? I don't know. It's

21:39.900 --> 21:43.540
I'm gonna cut ahead. Well do develop a menacing stare. That's the last

21:43.540 --> 21:49.740
Yeah, avoid looking away. I'm blinking. It's hard, but if it was easy to be evil baddy then

21:50.340 --> 21:57.140
Everyone do it if I could do that if I was capable that I'd probably be doing a lot better like socially

21:57.140 --> 21:59.020
You know I mean like oh, yeah

21:59.020 --> 22:02.460
That's my bat like I can't yeah if I could stare into people's eyes

22:02.820 --> 22:05.780
For more than a second or two without having to then look away

22:06.540 --> 22:08.980
I wouldn't need to be a evil guy

22:08.980 --> 22:15.500
Yeah, I could be if I wasn't always always always staring at people's eyebrows. Yeah, I wouldn't have to look directly into their eyes

22:15.500 --> 22:17.580
And they would see yeah it

22:17.580 --> 22:22.980
Let's get fun the magic nature let's have audio fun though because this is sounding the part

22:23.460 --> 22:27.860
Make your voice deeper while a specific character might call for a certain type of voice villains

22:28.020 --> 22:33.820
Traditionally have deep throaty voice that makes them sound evil if you have a naturally deep voice you probably don't have to alter it much

22:33.820 --> 22:38.220
However if your voice tends to be higher pitch try to give it a lower more menacing sound

22:38.220 --> 22:41.780
That means you speak universally true like her deeper

22:43.100 --> 22:48.900
Travis please do sorry. It's universally. This is also like Batman voice though. This is well

22:49.700 --> 22:55.900
That means the Batman's evil to the Joker's of the world. That's a good point good. That's a good point Griffin

22:56.260 --> 22:58.700
Hello, brothers, so let's do a practice

23:00.380 --> 23:02.380
Whoa shit

23:02.380 --> 23:08.780
Whoa that wasn't me. I don't know what that wasn't burp the alphabet. I'll get you next time gadget

23:11.500 --> 23:15.420
That's my doctor why don't you you got to do more car seat that's right painful isn't it? Oh?

23:15.420 --> 23:17.540
Yeah, I can do it for about three seconds. Yeah

23:18.340 --> 23:22.180
It is literal vocal fry it fries the inside of my throat

23:22.500 --> 23:25.660
Sure identify your chest register by saying the word

23:25.660 --> 23:33.420
Whoa in as deep a voice as you can keep your hand on your chest as you speak to feel the vibrations repeat the exercise

23:33.420 --> 23:37.260
Several times it may help to record yourself, so you can listen back to what your voice sounds like we're doing that

23:37.660 --> 23:40.860
okay, I'll just you know like put your hand on your chest and just like

23:41.740 --> 23:43.740
Yeah, go ahead juice

23:44.300 --> 23:49.220
Hello, Dan on your chest and on chest and say whoa were you paying attention whoa?

23:49.940 --> 23:51.940
Wow, that's really deep

23:51.940 --> 23:55.180
Whoa whoa wow

23:55.940 --> 23:58.100
That really works that really works

23:58.900 --> 24:03.580
Holding it here. That's that's really low. That's really that's really low

24:03.580 --> 24:09.540
It sounds this is some of our worst audio yet perfect a menacing laugh really good. That's so cool though

24:09.540 --> 24:14.300
I didn't know I could do that. I'm glad you're having fun with your I'm glad your villain arc has begun

24:14.300 --> 24:19.500
Justin doesn't well you have to be evil cuz your voice can do that wait until there's villains in the Avenger zone

24:19.500 --> 24:26.060
Siebel chase you guys are gonna appreciate. Yeah, you're freak out. Hey, hey Justin. Please don't break that voice out. It's too scary

24:26.060 --> 24:30.140
It's too scary. Can you all perfect a menacing laugh for me? Yeah?

24:31.420 --> 24:33.420
No wait, but do it like you did

24:39.060 --> 24:42.220
Low yeah, it's got to be low. It's hard to laugh low

24:42.220 --> 24:44.220
I

24:47.740 --> 24:54.020
Actually think the most evil thing you can do is to respond like in this way, that's funny. Oh, that's so funny

24:54.820 --> 24:58.300
You're a really funny person. I didn't know you were a comedy guy

25:00.020 --> 25:06.240
Emphasize why didn't they call family guy comedy guy if it's gonna be mostly Joe. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks juice

25:06.740 --> 25:11.300
emphasize the right words when you're trying to act evil the way you speak your lines is almost as important as the lines themselves a

25:11.300 --> 25:16.620
Villainous character should emphasize words that have a threatening connotation or mock the other characters for example if you tell another character

25:18.140 --> 25:20.140
You may want to make sure you say

25:20.300 --> 25:26.140
With a hard edge, so it sounds like you're really twisting the knife or we could hit it another way you're pathetic

25:27.020 --> 25:32.500
I don't care what anyone don't say I'm not pathetic. You're you're the pathetic one

25:32.500 --> 25:36.700
I didn't say you were pathetic. I know but I could see it in your eyes

25:36.700 --> 25:40.100
Look at me like I was pathetic, but I'm not hey, man

25:41.140 --> 25:45.340
Listen, I don't want to diagnose, but uh you won't talk about it

25:45.340 --> 25:58.540
Yeah, what did you say?

25:58.540 --> 26:14.740
Give layers to your anger a evil character likely carries a great deal of rate. I'm getting lightheaded from doing

26:16.540 --> 26:18.540
You can't do every single health

26:18.940 --> 26:24.820
Uncontrolled anger instead try to give shades to your characters evil rage according to the story for example in an early scene you may just

26:24.820 --> 26:31.020
Glare at another character to convey your low-key anger however as you approach the climb. I want to hear me convey my low-key anger. Yeah sure

26:31.580 --> 26:33.580
Gosh darn it Thor

26:34.860 --> 26:39.620
Make sure you understand what the character is angry about in every scene. Oh hold on wait stop

26:39.620 --> 26:43.320
I gotta stop you right there wiki how cuz you know how every time

26:44.420 --> 26:49.680
Anyone plays any Batman villain it does like fuck them up like?

26:49.680 --> 26:57.600
Yeah, yes, yes, Paul Dano still has to like sleep with all of the lights on yeah, and I surround his head

27:02.160 --> 27:07.440
It's because he thought like it wasn't just like I'm I'm gonna pretend to be the Riddler

27:07.440 --> 27:12.520
It was also like but why is the Riddler so angry, but then that seeps into Paul Dano, right?

27:12.520 --> 27:17.160
And he's like I want to punish people with puzzles. Well. This is why if you're a screenwriter

27:17.160 --> 27:21.960
I don't want to give you notes, but it helps to like write in just directly into the script in like

27:22.360 --> 27:27.600
Parentheses like you're angry here, and then it's like I don't have to understand it. You just told me. That's great

27:27.600 --> 27:34.880
I know exactly how to read in fact if you could just start screeners start every line with a parentheses of like angry angry

27:34.880 --> 27:36.640
happy

27:36.640 --> 27:39.020
Horny anyway, so I don't have to like

27:39.960 --> 27:44.680
Internalize it in any way whatsoever. I would love that that would be great in my acting work

27:44.680 --> 27:50.680
Enjoy the pain of others part of being truly evil satisfaction enjoy the pain of others enjoy the pain of others when you're trying to act

27:50.680 --> 27:55.800
Evil it's important to show how much joy your character gets when other people suffer and convey that even when you don't have any lines

27:55.800 --> 27:59.600
That spell it out. Oh now wiki house kind of given you

28:00.120 --> 28:06.900
Permission carte blanche to eat up scenery in the back. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you don't need to make it always about you

28:06.900 --> 28:10.340
Yeah, like yeah when in like this in sci-fi

28:10.340 --> 28:17.800
Future in Jupiter ascending the stage musical when the dog man like breaks up with Jupiter, and she's like

28:18.100 --> 28:20.100
You can't be in the background like

28:20.820 --> 28:22.820
Like cuz then you'll get yelled at

28:23.380 --> 28:29.800
That actually got me fired as a zombie extra in walking dead. I'm somebody who get hurt my zombie will go

28:31.020 --> 28:36.540
You're like the zombies don't really laugh Travis if you could not and I'm like ah, but what is more?

28:36.540 --> 28:41.020
And you and you shout it out like fuck him up a zombie Michael and they're like, that's not

28:41.260 --> 28:42.780
The show works like well

28:42.780 --> 28:48.380
I was just trying to deepen like the bond between the zombies and maybe we could have some scenes or just the zombies interacting

28:48.380 --> 28:53.680
Like that's not really what we do and I'm like, maybe it's time to change you've been going 19 seasons

28:55.020 --> 28:58.180
Go ahead juice. I will say just for the purposes of argument though

28:58.180 --> 29:01.180
If you learn to derive joy from the pain of others

29:01.180 --> 29:08.140
And you can still derive joy from the happiness of others. It sounds like a pretty nice life. You'd be you're pretty happy

29:08.660 --> 29:13.140
Sounds like you've got a recipe for being happy all the time. I mean if everyone does it

29:14.260 --> 29:17.180
Stinks, but one or two would have different

29:18.500 --> 29:24.260
Yeah, I'm just saying like if there were more villains in movies and TV shows that just seemed happy all the time

29:24.420 --> 29:28.460
Yeah, that's so bad because like Lex Luthor seems kind of annoying

29:28.460 --> 29:30.380
shit Travis

29:30.380 --> 29:34.700
Top community Q&A. I want to be evil, but I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. What can I do?

29:34.700 --> 29:38.300
You can be evil in a broad sense seek world domination instead of hurting people individually

29:38.300 --> 29:43.540
The best evil is insidious and seems good. For example in DC Comics Lex Luthor is not evil in his own mind

29:43.540 --> 29:49.700
He's looking out for the good of humanity against the evil alien who has come from Krypton to enforce his vision of justice on our world

29:49.700 --> 29:55.580
Yeah, he's not explicitly evil just xenophobic and racist. He's bad in a lot of ways

29:55.580 --> 29:58.260
He doesn't murder banks

30:00.940 --> 30:06.460
He's like in that top point one percent of wealth and he could be doing way more with his money

30:06.740 --> 30:10.340
Instead he runs for president and hates illegal aliens

30:12.500 --> 30:16.940
Find some humanity for the characters the last tip don't do that. That's weak shit

30:16.940 --> 30:23.340
I hate that shit when it's like in Lord of the Rings when Sauron is like, you know, this is my puppy

30:23.340 --> 30:27.120
He's like I'm just doing it for my daughter. It's like I don't man

30:27.120 --> 30:32.860
I was really enjoying like I tell you you want me roof for now, right exactly that's your to her

30:33.220 --> 30:39.620
Okay, man, cuz then it's like when Frodo cuts his fucking head off, right? That's I'm then am I supposed to feel?

30:40.900 --> 30:45.460
Confused about that Samwise is like doing the like, you know, I'm crouching over you

30:45.460 --> 30:48.620
So it looks like I'm farting on you and putting my butt on your face because we beat you

30:48.620 --> 30:52.540
Yeah, I want to cheer for that wholeheartedly. I don't want to have a moment of like well

30:52.540 --> 30:58.080
But like his daughter was kidnapped or whatever. Mr. Freeze is the perfect example

30:58.180 --> 31:02.780
Yeah, you never ever ever see mr. Freeze like

31:03.520 --> 31:10.860
Making a throne of ice living it up enjoying frozen foods like that's not him every time you see this other fucker

31:10.860 --> 31:17.680
It's always like single crack in my globe frozen tears on the ground probably a rose. Yeah, I'm really sad

31:17.680 --> 31:23.940
It's like such a bummer and I've written some poems. Oh, I wrote I wrote poems and he's like

31:24.340 --> 31:28.780
He's like, but my wife died. It's like yeah, a lot of people's wives died

31:28.780 --> 31:34.600
Yeah, as if your hair died because of your cold gun you made. Yeah. Yeah. Hey

31:35.140 --> 31:39.520
Since we're on the subject of Batman organically. Thank you. Can we just take a second?

31:40.260 --> 31:42.260
second to talk about Pennyworth

31:42.260 --> 31:49.380
Because I kind of lost it a little bit today. Everyone knows that that there's a network called epics

31:49.460 --> 31:55.080
Yeah EPIX that made a show called Pennyworth. Yeah, that is the

31:55.580 --> 32:00.940
Subtitle if I'm not mistaken. No, no, don't say okay. Don't say it yet. Okay, because that subtitle is new

32:02.540 --> 32:09.640
Newly introduced. I just want to say I don't know about this channel show or subtitle. Okay, this is so good

32:09.640 --> 32:14.200
Pennyworth is a series about Alfred, right?

32:14.920 --> 32:19.040
Batman's butler. It figured that out. Yeah, it is now in it

32:19.040 --> 32:26.360
I thought this thing had been I thought it got a season and then everyone was like what happened an origin story for Alfred?

32:26.840 --> 32:32.600
Today I see ads for they're on season 3 HBO Max exclusive

32:32.600 --> 32:38.000
But in season 3 in season 3, there's a new subtitle and it is

32:38.000 --> 32:41.220
The origin of Batman's butler

32:42.440 --> 32:45.520
Now this is interesting for a couple of reasons one

32:46.240 --> 32:50.020
Pennyworth is the rare show that's probably better the less, you know about it

32:50.020 --> 32:54.040
Yeah, probably once you start thinking about they did a show about Batman's butler

32:54.040 --> 32:59.400
It starts to feel kind of bad to watch but now the fact that they're like we got to get more people in

32:59.720 --> 33:04.640
Maybe now we should reveal that this is actually a story about Batman's butler

33:04.640 --> 33:10.600
Maybe the producers just got sick of answering the question like who? I know it's Batman's butler

33:10.600 --> 33:14.200
I'm like, you know what? We're just gonna put it right there on the tin. Don't worry about it

33:14.200 --> 33:17.360
So is it like he like learns how to

33:18.140 --> 33:25.440
Like make tea and clean up clean up a mess. No, he I think he's maybe like a spy

33:25.800 --> 33:29.560
Yeah, they've done a lot of retconning with Pennyworth

33:29.560 --> 33:36.260
and Pennywise in the last couple years, which is like he's a fucking sniper

33:38.400 --> 33:43.680
Deadly cool cool dude. I like I don't want to know if it's good if you watch it

33:43.680 --> 33:47.240
I don't want to know I got lots of things. I'm watching don't defend it cuz I've never seen it

33:47.240 --> 33:50.140
I'm not attacking it. I'm saying conceptually ruinous

33:50.140 --> 33:54.360
I don't know how I kept going now that I've said it though

33:54.360 --> 34:00.920
I would like an Alien vs. Predator Pennyworth be Pennywise if we could just work that out, even if it's just animated

34:00.920 --> 34:04.240
I would love that my butler out for Pennywise. Yeah

34:06.480 --> 34:07.520
God

34:07.520 --> 34:12.000
Has Batman ever fought Pennywise two masters of fear?

34:12.040 --> 34:18.160
I'm mono a clown Oh just going at it Batman spends a lot of time in the sewer. He's definitely encountered

34:18.160 --> 34:25.520
Penny. Yeah, how much you want to bet Batman just like I can't I can't I can't I don't see that

34:28.840 --> 34:31.560
Let's take a look at the power rankings one

34:32.360 --> 34:39.520
Scarecrow is anyways, and he's kicked his ass before so and the other thing is that Pennywise got his ass beat by

34:39.520 --> 34:42.880
I think like four dipshit kids. Yeah who then grew up to be

34:42.880 --> 34:48.080
Kind of dipshit adults and they killed him again. So it's like and none of them were let me check spoilers

34:48.600 --> 34:55.800
None of them were Batman. One of them was Bill Hader. So like, you know great love Bill Hader, but not Batman. Yeah

34:56.800 --> 34:59.520
Okay, so Justin here has a oh, okay. This is helpful

35:02.640 --> 35:07.200
Let's see, this is this is a Quora article juice you found it. Yeah, it's just called

35:07.200 --> 35:11.320
How would the battle go between Pennywise Batman? There you go, and there is no further

35:11.320 --> 35:13.080
clarification

35:13.080 --> 35:19.280
Is just like what's up? Yeah, so and then there's just like they agree with me. They fucks up scarecrow

35:19.320 --> 35:22.900
He's now people he is scarier than Pennywise to a lot of people

35:22.900 --> 35:28.640
So it's like it let by the way, the article does in fact verbatim say here is Batman fucking up scarecrow

35:28.640 --> 35:34.520
Yeah, but I would I would argue that there is a fundamental this article begins with answer one

35:34.880 --> 35:36.120
But let me ask you something

35:36.120 --> 35:41.880
It says in an answer tricky. Is there anything that the vigilante of Gotham the Dark Knight is scared of?

35:42.200 --> 35:47.600
No, but yes, right like yeah, we routinely see Batman fucked up man

35:47.600 --> 35:52.160
He's afraid of shit does do all core articles have so many fucking kick-ass

35:52.800 --> 35:54.800
Bitchin pictures of Batman in them

35:58.160 --> 36:04.900
Bitchin pictures of Batman in it guys. The first question asker has written how the fight would go

36:04.900 --> 36:06.900
Yeah, if I may

36:07.500 --> 36:08.700
Yes

36:08.700 --> 36:09.820
Gotham's

36:09.820 --> 36:15.740
Location Gotham City Pennywise confronted a homeless kid and said do you want a balloon little boy the boy?

36:15.900 --> 36:18.860
Seeing Pennywise's wicked smile started to cry and run away

36:19.300 --> 36:25.460
Pennywise then transformed into a bizarre monster laughed in a scary voice and chased the kid to a small and dark

36:25.460 --> 36:31.260
It's written in past tense. Yeah, and it's written in between some of the most

36:31.260 --> 36:35.900
Fucking radical bitchin bad bad-ass Batman pics

36:35.900 --> 36:43.420
I'm a kid thought he would be done for until a shadow of bat suddenly appeared a bass-shaped logo showed on the dark clouds

36:48.020 --> 36:52.340
He was standing there on the roof of a house the Dark Knight showed up

36:52.660 --> 36:59.340
Penny raw to Pennywise started roaring angrily. He tried to attack the Cape Crusader, but Batman dodged it all

36:59.340 --> 37:05.100
Yes, get a crazy clown then received some big sucker punches from Batman. Just like this monster, right?

37:06.500 --> 37:11.660
There's some cool pictures of Batman beating the ass of some unknown beast killer croc

37:11.660 --> 37:13.220
I would guess maybe killer croc

37:13.220 --> 37:20.020
It's not Pennywise like I think logic would dictate by the transitive property if Batman could beat this monster's ass

37:20.180 --> 37:22.820
Pennywise would be dirt in the ground. Yeah

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
Taking too much damages

37:25.540 --> 37:27.540
Pennywise ground angrily why?

37:27.540 --> 37:33.180
Why can't I sense your fear? Did you sound like Batman for Pennywise? I guess they do

37:33.180 --> 37:36.220
I'm just trying to just do my villain voice. I'll take all of you

37:36.220 --> 37:41.580
I'll feast on your flesh as I feed on your fear not stopping Batman to get some

37:44.100 --> 37:48.340
Next picture Pennywise. Yeah, Pennywise turned into this mushy potato

37:48.340 --> 37:52.300
And begged Batman to spare him

37:53.980 --> 38:00.540
There's a picture of Pennywise as a mushy potato and then the next picture is Batman and over it in what I think maybe

38:00.820 --> 38:04.260
Joker font it says what's wrong scared?

38:06.260 --> 38:11.100
And then it says Batman said this in a cold voice so Griffin if you could again in a cold voice

38:11.100 --> 38:13.100
Oh

38:16.580 --> 38:18.580
Then he finished the clown oh

38:20.900 --> 38:27.300
My god guys, yeah, there's a picture of Batman walking away from what an explosion an explosion that is

38:29.620 --> 38:33.500
Right next to this in a box labeled related questions are

38:34.020 --> 38:38.340
How would an encounter between the Joker and Pennywise play out? How would Batman defeat Pennywise?

38:38.340 --> 38:45.900
What if the Joker met Pennywise who would win a fight Pennywise of the Joker who would win Pennywise parentheses it versus Deadpool?

38:46.060 --> 38:53.440
What would happen if Superman met Pennywise not fought, but if Superman I guess ran into Pennywise at the supermarket

38:53.440 --> 38:53.820
Yeah

38:53.820 --> 38:58.940
I'll tell you who wins between Pennywise and Deadpool and that's me at the theater with my kids

38:59.420 --> 39:01.420
Having the time of my life laughing

39:01.420 --> 39:08.300
Loving learning Darth Vader versus Pennywise. That seems pretty straightforward as well. I don't know

39:09.260 --> 39:14.420
This is fun. This is I wish we did a show that was just like fights. You know what I mean?

39:14.420 --> 39:16.420
It'd be better. It would be better

39:17.460 --> 39:22.820
It's just like people fighting. Yeah, sure tell him who's winning it. Hey, let's take a quick break

39:22.820 --> 39:24.820
And then we'll come back with a lot more show

39:24.820 --> 39:30.980
The party's just getting started right after this

39:36.540 --> 39:41.180
Now listen, I know we're all pretty hyped up right now thinking about Batman beating the ass to this horrible clown

39:41.180 --> 39:45.240
That scared my kids so fucking much and I would love it if this happened

39:45.420 --> 39:51.140
But we need to bring it down a little bit because this is a ad for calm and I'm I'm not there

39:51.140 --> 39:54.700
Like I'm not in the right headspace for it. So if we could work through it together

39:55.700 --> 39:57.700
Maybe let's do a simple breathing exercise

39:57.940 --> 40:02.360
Let's breathe in through our noses and hold it for about five seconds and exhale through the mouth

40:02.960 --> 40:08.900
Yeah, try not to think about all the Pennywise's you saw while trick-or-treating and you weren't sure if any of them was the real Pennywise

40:08.900 --> 40:12.980
Enjoying his time on the upside. Yeah, damn it Travis

Boys before we continue the rest of the episode, you know

44:40.400 --> 44:45.400
We're talking we've hit on a big question here and I know an expert about this kind of thing that I want to

44:46.200 --> 44:49.640
Read the question. No, no, this isn't this is a question

44:49.640 --> 44:53.360
We discussed before the break and we're just gonna touch on that and then if we have other things to ask me well

44:53.360 --> 45:05.440
But first, let me call Griffin Newman. Let me see. I didn't know you had a phone. I thought Justin was the only one with a phone. Hi, is this Griffin Newman?

45:06.000 --> 45:11.760
Hi, yes. Yes. Hi. Who is it? Hi. It's a Travis McElroy your favorite brother from the my brother my brother me

45:11.760 --> 45:14.080
Oh the my yeah. Yeah. No my number one in the ranking

45:14.080 --> 45:21.520
I think of you as as the my brother the first my brother title Wow. I'm so glad. Oh, wait a second

45:21.520 --> 45:27.040
Who's someone else on the line? Oh, yeah. Sorry. I had speaker speaker. Yeah, I believe Justin and Griffin in too. Sorry about that

45:27.040 --> 45:30.120
Oh, um, basically we were discussing before the break

45:30.320 --> 45:37.160
What would happen if Batman fought Pennywise and then become a much bigger question about the way the Joker met

45:37.160 --> 45:41.720
Pennywise and scarecrow met Pennywise and then I started talking about Pennyworth Griffin

45:41.720 --> 45:47.160
How much do you think about Pennyworth the fact you're talking about Pennyworth origins of Batman's butler? Yes

45:47.160 --> 45:54.360
Yes, I look I think about it a fair amount I think about a fair amount

45:54.360 --> 46:01.640
I think a thing that is under discussed with Pennyworth the origins of Batman's butler is that show existed for two full season?

46:01.640 --> 46:07.860
Yes, yeah on a channel. No one watches just called Pennyworth. Yes, and then they decided for season three

46:07.880 --> 46:09.880
We're gonna put it on HBO Max

46:10.280 --> 46:12.600
Right treat it like this is new

46:12.600 --> 46:18.740
Can I go like I guess the problem the reason people didn't like this is because the title lacked context

46:19.840 --> 46:22.200
We were killing it in every other regard

46:22.920 --> 46:29.920
Well, I know that that is the tradition that has been established with the epics to HBO max pipeline

46:29.960 --> 46:32.480
That was a cleanest pipelines in America

46:32.480 --> 46:38.760
I guess I guess I want to know as somebody who did a guest spot on a series that was

46:38.760 --> 46:43.040
Pulled from HBO max so they didn't have to pay me residuals

46:43.240 --> 46:48.120
How many me how many me's could you have paid by just not doing more?

46:50.680 --> 46:55.400
Why not like leave infinity trade and then just not do anymore I

46:56.040 --> 46:59.280
Refuse to believe anyone watches it refuse. I oh, of course

46:59.280 --> 47:04.800
I was on every episode of vinyl the HBO series, which also has got

47:04.800 --> 47:08.080
I I think I was on maybe nine out of ten

47:08.080 --> 47:12.440
I believe I mean most of my I stood in the background and smoked a cigarette and they went sorry

47:12.440 --> 47:15.080
We couldn't find anything for you in this one. Yeah, it was cool

47:16.080 --> 47:21.000
That would be great. You weren't hired on this show. Why do you keep showing up? You're on nine out of ten

47:21.000 --> 47:24.320
Maybe all vinyls. Yeah, and and it's it's one of those things

47:24.320 --> 47:28.240
That was one of the first shows that got zazz laughed in this recent culling

47:28.240 --> 47:34.880
Yeah of this show is not worth the money. It takes to print the residual checks for five pennies

47:37.160 --> 47:42.360
You do the math on it and you're like, it's not that you're losing money by paying me residuals

47:42.360 --> 47:48.040
You're basically saying it cost too much money to hire someone to calculate how many pennies you're paying me

47:48.040 --> 47:55.240
And then the paper itself costs more they're calculating your penny worth basically. Yeah, oh my god this that was in

47:55.240 --> 48:02.160
Fantastic. I actually did want to ask you about something griff while we got you on here, please. Yeah, let's and let's just for clarification

48:02.920 --> 48:04.920
griff to so that

48:06.400 --> 48:10.800
Yeah, yeah, well they don't call him to I'm not the first Griffin Newman

48:11.040 --> 48:16.600
He's not Tuman so okay, you don't know you know what no for the sake of this episode Griffin if you're comfortable with this

48:16.600 --> 48:22.080
How about your Griffin woman and I'm Griffin Tuman just so there's a kind of consistency. Yeah, I like that

48:22.080 --> 48:27.280
Okay, and we should establish you're in disenchanted and that's like the whole reason disenchanted

48:27.760 --> 48:33.600
Disney-plus original film premiering November 18th. I'm the voice of a talking chipmunk. That's good. That's good. That's good

48:33.800 --> 48:39.780
Let's let's soak that in for a second. Yes tip. It's good. It's good that he's casting that I'm very I hear

48:39.780 --> 48:45.040
There's a rumor according to IMDB. There's a rumor that I'll okay plays a scroll. Don't give me any dirt

48:45.040 --> 48:50.120
I want to go in line. Okay, when I want to say Griffin when the movie was announced

48:50.120 --> 48:55.000
I saw you tweeted a picture of Pip and you I believe captured it me

48:55.000 --> 48:59.020
I did not originally assume that meant you had been casting that role

49:00.680 --> 49:04.640
Yeah, you just like identified very closely with the energy of Pip the chipmunk

49:04.640 --> 49:09.760
No, which I do I mean cuz it's a thought it was a photo from the first movie where he's standing in front of a plate

49:09.760 --> 49:10.520
of

49:10.520 --> 49:15.560
Pastrami at Katz's deli with his arms spread out. I want to know what happened to the last guy that played

49:15.560 --> 49:21.800
Pip it's probably canceled. No, you know these days. Are you so hard the real?

49:22.520 --> 49:29.760
I'll give you some dirt. It's not it's not very salacious. But in the first movie, so if for those who haven't said enchanted is

49:30.560 --> 49:32.260
Like a fish out of water movie

49:32.260 --> 49:32.760
Yeah

49:32.760 --> 49:39.080
Amy Adams plays princess Giselle and she exists in a cartoon hand-drawn Disney fairy tale princess, you know

49:39.080 --> 49:39.560
It's amazing

49:39.560 --> 49:43.040
It's a great and she falls through a portal and ends up in real New York

49:43.040 --> 49:48.160
And then the whole thing is here's what if a Disney princess had to exist in the real world in New York at the beginning

49:48.160 --> 49:50.580
Of the movie in the hand-drawn sort of musical II section

49:50.580 --> 49:54.760
She's got a bunch of little animal friends like Snow White just Sleeping Beauty her whole

49:54.960 --> 50:01.280
Quarter of animal friends and Pip is her little chipmunk friend. Who's yeah, why it's cracking New York accent

50:01.280 --> 50:06.960
How are you talking about here kind of thing? He's got like three or four lines. Are we talking to Pip now? Yes

50:06.960 --> 50:10.880
Pip can join the call if

50:18.280 --> 50:20.680
Pip is officially disconnected from the call

50:20.760 --> 50:25.560
but so he only has like three or four lines and then the bit is that when he

50:25.800 --> 50:31.720
Falls through the portal and goes into the real world. He is now bound to the the rules of the real world

50:31.720 --> 50:33.080
He can't talk

50:33.080 --> 50:37.960
Okay. Okay. So for most of the movie Pip is mute. There's a great voice actor

50:37.960 --> 50:41.200
He squeaks. He squeaks. Okay, wait, so this is the thing

50:41.200 --> 50:44.480
So the director of the first movie Kevin Lima did all the squeaking

50:45.080 --> 50:51.580
And then a great voice over actor named Jeff Bennett did the voice for the couple of lines at the beginning of the movie

50:51.580 --> 50:54.160
It's only at the beginning he did like Johnny Bravo

50:54.160 --> 50:58.320
He's like one of the best voice actors in the world, but there was this weird thing

50:58.320 --> 51:02.760
So it's streaming they can't afford him get Griffin. Yeah, yeah

51:02.760 --> 51:04.760
I mean, I think you're jumping at the end of the story here. But yeah

51:08.840 --> 51:15.020
Two guys have played Pip there wasn't a clear chain of command. There's a different director on this movie. It's been 15 years

51:15.760 --> 51:21.480
I truly the way I got the part was I was asked as a favor to fill in at

51:22.120 --> 51:27.280
the table read when they were hoping to find a famous person to do it and

51:28.040 --> 51:30.960
Then they did sort of called me a week later and went like

51:30.960 --> 51:37.560
What did you have it? Did you how did you psych yourself up with like Griffin if you nail this?

51:38.080 --> 51:44.520
You're going home with this part. Did you did you walk yourself through that or is it just like just always putting it out?

51:44.520 --> 51:50.140
They're 24-7. It doesn't matter. You only know how to bring your a game. That's all you have only buckets

51:51.280 --> 51:56.940
Well, I try I try to I try to get buckets whenever I can it's a little a little we're being speaking honestly here

51:56.940 --> 51:59.220
It was a little column a little column B, right? I

51:59.220 --> 52:02.560
I I get this phone call from my friend who's the

52:03.300 --> 52:06.060
producer on the movie and he was the producer on the tick as well and

52:06.880 --> 52:13.340
He goes like you'd be doing me a really big favor if you could jump on this zoom and do this table read and basically

52:13.340 --> 52:15.340
Said to me there. There's no job here

52:15.820 --> 52:20.500
There's no job. That's what they want. They want they want to see if you'll still bring the buckets

52:20.500 --> 52:21.340
That's the thing

52:21.340 --> 52:23.940
It was sort of the test and it was like there's no job here

52:23.940 --> 52:29.900
But you'd be on a zoom in front of Disney people and in front of Amy Adams and you know, maybe you know

52:29.900 --> 52:36.580
Make a good impression for something else down. You didn't care about Dempsey just Adams like Dempsey. You'll be Dempsey Marsden Menzel

52:38.580 --> 52:40.700
From the Oscar Nunez. Yes

52:41.460 --> 52:43.980
So that was how it was maybe Alan Tudyk

52:43.980 --> 52:51.020
I don't want to know you don't Tudyk wasn't was not yet, which was exciting when he came on later, but um, no spoilers

52:51.020 --> 52:57.420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have no idea to do something. He might be a key grip. We don't know no idea

52:58.660 --> 53:03.380
But so they they say that to me and my calculation in my head juice wasn't

53:03.900 --> 53:05.340
Can I steal this part?

53:05.340 --> 53:12.340
I truly the limits of my ability at the moment how far I would allow myself to imagine was if I fucking

53:12.820 --> 53:14.820
nail this read

53:14.820 --> 53:20.660
Maybe they let me be the guy who holds the puppet off-camera for reference. Oh

53:22.100 --> 53:26.380
Yeah, truly the sky captain in the world of tomorrow. I was

53:27.140 --> 53:33.060
Absolutely. I was like, well this character's animated if they hire a more famous person do the voice

53:33.060 --> 53:37.080
They're not gonna want to be there on set. I can be the reference voice

53:37.780 --> 53:43.040
And I'll hold the puppet and I could be you could be the co Bethany Olsen the third of the Olsen triplets

53:43.040 --> 53:49.740
They only use for two shots from behind. Yeah, that was my whole that was my strategy and this is coming right right out of lockdown

53:49.740 --> 53:55.580
I've just gotten vaccinated and I'm like the idea of anyone hiring me to be anywhere is exciting

53:55.740 --> 53:59.180
so I don't need to be in this movie bring me on this set and

53:59.700 --> 54:05.100
And then like yeah, like a week after the thing they called me and they just said like you're you're so cheap

54:05.660 --> 54:10.900
This is so much easier. If we just hire they really say that Griffin to they didn't say that

54:10.900 --> 54:17.860
They didn't say that but that was the underlying reality is we could save a lot of money that we can redistribute to the CGI

54:18.460 --> 54:25.420
And if we just have you do it, it's yeah, it's hard because they they know like I as people who've been in films

54:25.700 --> 54:30.520
It's hard knowing that you're in that position because we would do anything for free, right? Yes. Yes

54:30.520 --> 54:37.660
So anytime we're not in a movie. Yeah, that's someone said that's another person who has voted like to spend money on

54:37.660 --> 54:41.920
Nothing essentially, like I'd rather them not be in the movie for nothing

54:41.920 --> 54:45.940
There's no they would detract every movie that was released without my presence in it

54:45.940 --> 54:51.620
Me that the director thought my presence in it would detract from the it was you were not worth zero dollars

54:51.620 --> 54:54.460
They made the decision to invest money

54:55.100 --> 55:00.220
Into having someone who is better at acting and voice acting than any of the three of us

55:00.220 --> 55:02.220
But Griffin, I would say statistically

55:02.220 --> 55:07.800
Insurance Griffin woman there have been plenty of movies that have gone over budget in history, right?

55:07.800 --> 55:13.700
Sure, those over budget movies went over budget instead of having Justin in them. And that's more offensive

55:13.700 --> 55:17.840
It's almost more that they would rather lose money. Yeah

55:19.220 --> 55:21.460
There's I don't want to ask you out something while we gotcha

55:22.380 --> 55:28.060
Let's not do the question. We had picked out. I only want to hear Griffin Tuman's thoughts about a Pennywise view Batman

55:28.060 --> 55:33.980
I mean, yeah, let's let's call an audible. Okay, ask you a question about pickles

55:33.980 --> 55:38.260
That was gonna be really irreverent and fun and probably we had a good time with it

55:38.260 --> 55:45.260
But I only want to know I only want to talk about Batman V. Pennywise the the incredibly

55:46.580 --> 55:53.060
Important Supreme Court case that was foundational for the fate of our country. I mean be Pennywise Dawn of Justice. I

55:53.060 --> 55:57.760
Um, it's interesting. I mean look, first of all, I appreciate you buffering

55:57.760 --> 56:02.620
Give me me some time asking some disenchanted questions so I could really stew on this one

56:03.620 --> 56:08.180
November 18th, did you say that November 18th Disney Plus original film streaming everywhere?

56:08.180 --> 56:12.180
Yeah, it was it was hard for me to focus on any of that because I was really well

56:12.180 --> 56:16.300
I know and I I was sort of talking but as I was in my head

56:16.300 --> 56:19.660
I was just doing the math because I worry if I Travis the Travis

56:19.660 --> 56:21.660
Yeah

56:21.860 --> 56:23.700
If I had answered right away

56:23.700 --> 56:29.300
I think my answer would have been rash and stupid and yeah, or we thought out and now I've really had some time to sit

56:29.300 --> 56:30.780
on this

56:30.780 --> 56:33.060
We all know that obviously the Joker is

56:33.700 --> 56:35.220
Batman's greatest

56:35.220 --> 56:37.220
Enemy, right? Yeah

56:37.340 --> 56:40.660
Crime the conference of crime. I mean the things that make us cry make him laugh. Yeah

56:43.100 --> 56:46.820
And and also I mean what the greatest character in American drama

56:46.820 --> 56:49.900
I mean has now become our number one and funniest

56:51.220 --> 56:55.100
Scariest the serious the most serious why so serious?

56:56.660 --> 56:57.700
Yeah

56:57.700 --> 57:00.260
But I think this is that thing with the Joker

57:00.260 --> 57:05.280
There's that balance where you do feel like the guy is trying to entertain you

57:05.300 --> 57:08.860
It's a thing I like about the Joker is that he has bits

57:09.260 --> 57:15.340
Even when he's doing violent stuff or mean stuff or dare I say it illegal things. Whoa, right?

57:15.340 --> 57:21.100
No, I mean, he's a he does crime guys. Yeah, he does crime under man's laws not gods

57:21.820 --> 57:26.220
But but but he's he's bringing props, right? Got the fish with the lipstick

57:26.220 --> 57:31.100
He's doing turns of phrase all that bang gun right the bank on and he's got a stick

57:31.100 --> 57:35.940
He's got an outfit a persona. Yeah doing a whole thing blow up Maggie Gyllenhaal

57:37.060 --> 57:40.700
Larry has funny funny. I think pennywise

57:41.500 --> 57:44.520
Despite falling into this evil clown trope

57:44.520 --> 57:50.240
Yeah, is pennywise ever intentionally trying to be funny?

57:52.320 --> 57:57.800
That's interesting I hadn't even right about that angle and so I'm like I'm trying to do the math in my head and go would

57:57.880 --> 58:01.640
Batman hate Pennywise more or less

58:02.640 --> 58:05.480
Because Pennywise is kind of just straight chaos

58:05.960 --> 58:08.960
Whereas Joker is putting on a show like Batman

58:08.960 --> 58:14.720
It's interesting that you are weighing this in a conversation about who would be whose ass no

58:14.720 --> 58:18.880
I think it's it it is interesting to think about like the sport of

58:19.400 --> 58:24.640
Boxing. Yes is if the if one of the boxers hates the other one much much more

58:25.120 --> 58:27.920
Then it will increase the ferocity of their

58:30.320 --> 58:34.240
Batman doesn't have powers as we know, right? He's got the very rich

58:34.240 --> 58:39.000
Which you know this it makes some very power in our broken society

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
But but then he also you know, he is driven by this this rage this sense of vengeance

58:44.000 --> 58:47.040
So I'm like, yeah, that's the special move meter, right?

58:47.520 --> 58:54.600
Right. I'm just saying I think there's something to the fact that not only is the Joker so twisted but the Joker annoys Batman

58:54.600 --> 58:58.600
Like yes drive him crazy that fills up the special move meter

58:58.600 --> 59:05.480
The the bits are also like, you know, they say that the the Joker is like all chaos, right?

59:05.480 --> 59:09.440
Right. It seems like the Joker is working pretty hard pretty hard on this to do his bit

59:09.440 --> 59:13.840
This is the one who's like I'm gonna just punch this gift. What if

59:15.720 --> 59:21.480
Batman is so annoyed by the Joker is the Batman does find Joker funny and he's trying so hard to keep a straight face

59:21.760 --> 59:23.760
Right, that's like his whole bit

59:23.760 --> 59:31.360
Like you're canonically the the only time he ever ever busted up at the Joker he fucking kills him

59:31.360 --> 59:37.880
Yeah, the only time he ever ever in history busts up at the Joker. He's like good one Joker. It made him

59:38.400 --> 59:45.480
So fucking angry that the Joker made him laugh. Whereas like Pennywise. I wonder if it's just like well, this is a bad guy

59:45.680 --> 59:48.560
So to a certain degree, it's a little more passionless

59:48.560 --> 59:55.200
It's a little more routine whipping this guy's ass because Pennywise like, you know, it's just hanging out in a fucking sewer grate

59:55.200 --> 01:00:02.560
Going like come here kid. Yeah, which is bad, which is bad, but he's not like juggling. He's not doing like

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:09.700
Committing real crimes. I see what you're saying, right? And he's also not leading with I'm pretending like I'm a normal clown

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.600
He's kind of upfront just creepy monster in the guise of decrepit clown, you know

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:23.200
Right, that's interesting. And I wonder if that pisses Batman off less and for that reason it's more just a routine ass-whooping

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.240
We are assuming yes

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:33.480
Yeah, that joke that Pennywise were he would appear today on the day that Batman lives

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.280
That he would be this clown, right? Because I feel like he would definitely come as a fortnight guy

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.320
Oh, you know like I think that he could manifest in any shape. Yeah

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.800
Uh, what I think I manifest is Steve from Minecraft or like a fortnight kind of guy

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.400
Interesting or like burger boss from for he'd pick one of the funny ones peel

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.080
Yeah, once it busts you up, man. Yeah dead

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.300
Right, I think if he does that Batman would beat the shit out of Deadpool Deadpool, right Batman crazy

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:12.640
I think if Pennywise is affecting a persona like that if he is coming in as like beef boss

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.280
Batman will get riled up. Yeah, if if he's just a creepy child abductor

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.440
I think Batman's hurts in it a little less, but does he still win though?

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.360
Well, here's the wrinkle I want to put in

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.080
Batman rarely goes up against truly supernatural. Yeah, right

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.080
Pennywise has moves

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.720
That maybe you're outside of Batman's wheelhouse. I mean clay face

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.000
Rajal ghoul clay face is science

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.480
Killer croc

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:55.480
Croc has a skin mutation. You leave him alone killer cross science. Mr. Freeze science regular just

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.080
Yeah, but he's not it take it away from the pit he's just like you or me

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.560
Exactly. Listen, if everybody's got pits when we get down to it metaphorically speaking, of course, of course

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.240
Do you think Batman ever encounters a villain who's just like a guy robbing a bank and he's like, what's your stick?

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:20.400
He's like, what do you mean? It's like what are you or your robbing man? No, I'm just my name's Doug and I'm robbing this thing

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.200
I don't I need money. I have no marketable skills

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.600
It's just like a regular crime. This isn't really a Batman thing. I'm gonna go

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.880
Why is everybody in Gotham robbing banks at night

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:41.040
That's a gentleman gentleman ghost is a Batman villain and I don't think you guys could okay convince me that that's not

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.920
Shade

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.520
That that is a good pull

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:51.220
I and I for the listener at home you did just spend a minute locking in on clearly an extensive Google search

01:02:51.220 --> 01:03:00.500
Okay, I Google supernatural Batman villains the number one one is fucking Raj Al Ghul cuz he can do magic and is

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.820
immortal and shit

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.180
Gets away from Batman or yeah, sometimes via death

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:15.360
This is a good point. Raj Al Ghul is one of the slipperiest Batman foes Batman rarely gets the better of him

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:21.100
I think the super and gentlemen ghost it's like I don't I think I think it's a bad

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:27.220
Day for Batman when gentlemen ghost shows up. Oh, yeah, he's like I know what to do with this guy. I know his moves, right?

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.580
gentlemen ghosts slippery and I wonder even just like I don't think Pennywise is

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.980
Stronger than Batman, but I think if Pennywise starts doing that fucking dance

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:43.740
Batman just might be thrown off his axis. Yeah. Oh and by the way, we are I think all in our minds imagining bills guard guard

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.260
It I don't know that we are

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:53.220
imagining Tim Curry I'd not like, you know, obviously iconic Tim creep any wise like

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:57.900
Incredible not the physicality isn't there and it's so much for me

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.220

His is more of a cerebral tear. Yes

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.580
Guard. Yes, when Bill Skarsgard does he's like
