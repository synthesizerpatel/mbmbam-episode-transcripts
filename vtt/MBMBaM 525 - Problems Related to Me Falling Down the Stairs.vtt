00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:47.040
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

00:47.040 --> 00:52.000
Mungin era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.280
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. It's time. That's right. The fall is here.

00:59.280 --> 01:06.080
The fall has fallen. The fall has fallen. I have an exciting Munch Squad episode right here at the

01:06.080 --> 01:10.720
beginning of the show that I feel like apropos. I would love to set the tone if I could, if I

01:10.720 --> 01:16.320
could invite you guys in. Yes, please. Okay, come with me. Okay. Let's just step behind this curtain

01:16.320 --> 01:26.640
here. Now, I am going to make a quick call on my phone. Who am I going to be calling, you ask? Well,

01:26.640 --> 01:33.360
Starbuck. Hello, this is David. Oh, Travis was doing some foley work. I thought it'd be fun if

01:33.360 --> 01:39.200
I could do foley work too, but I didn't really know where to put it. Okay. Hello, this is David.

01:39.760 --> 01:48.880
Hi, David. What's your role here? I'm a vampire. Oh, that's a fun choice. I don't know what we're

01:48.880 --> 01:52.480
fucking doing. No, no, no. I like it. Wait, hold on. We'll get back to Justin's thing in a second,

01:52.480 --> 01:59.600
but let's roll with this. I'm an autumn vampire. Halloween's just around the corner.

02:01.200 --> 02:06.640
Starbucks has declared that fall has begun, and the pumpkin spice latte is returning,

02:06.640 --> 02:12.880
according to Curious, our magazine, a magazine for the quick service restaurant industry. And

02:12.880 --> 02:19.120
I did want to just set the tone because I'm so excited to say that it came back two days ago

02:19.120 --> 02:23.120
as we're recording this, but as you were listening to it, it came out August 25th.

02:23.120 --> 02:29.120
So Starbucks is like, hey, listen, we can't do a lot, but maybe this. Does this do anything?

02:29.680 --> 02:36.240
Is this anything? This is sort of like the one gif of Donald Glover walking into the room with

02:36.240 --> 02:39.680
pizza from Community, you remember, and the whole place is on fire, and he turns around and walk

02:39.680 --> 02:44.720
away. Love that gif. Love that gif. Except he's holding huge cups of pumpkin spice latte, and he

02:44.720 --> 02:50.400
does attempt to up in the cups onto the fire to see if it does anything. Maybe this does something.

02:50.400 --> 02:56.080
Hey, can I also just say, this year, and maybe Justin Griffin will go along with me on this,

02:56.080 --> 03:01.120
I would like to play some moratorium on making jokes about pumpkin spice lattes and everything,

03:01.120 --> 03:05.920
because I think pumpkin spice is the least of our worries this year.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.600
Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish.

03:09.600 --> 03:16.640
Starbucks has made this even more exciting and meaningful this fall with the fall hotline,

03:17.200 --> 03:24.640
1-833-GET-FALL. Get fucked. I don't know what to expect, but I'm calling right now,

03:25.520 --> 03:28.480
and we'll just all sort of experience this together and see what happens.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.440
Hey there, all you hayriders, leaf breakers, and pumpkin spice lovers.

03:33.440 --> 03:39.600
If you're coming here to spice up your leaf life, then you have definitely come to the

03:39.600 --> 03:47.040
right place. Thou one to head out on a hayride. Thou two to practice your pumpkin mantras.

03:48.320 --> 03:54.560
Thou three to cozy up with your cup. Thou four to hear flannel on repeat.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.600
Thou five to adventure to the pumpkin cream cold brew falls.

03:59.600 --> 04:07.680
Thou six for endless PSL perfection. Thou seven to go on a lovely leaf crunching stroll.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.360
Thou eight to knit sweaters with grandpa. And if you get lost,

04:13.360 --> 04:16.160
just dial nine to be directed back to the main menu.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.840
Close your eyes while your mind walks through a forest of fall fields.

04:23.840 --> 04:29.040
Ooh, this is nice. Can I get some more treble in the mix, Starbucks?

04:30.800 --> 04:37.440
Oh god. Being out here reminds me of what life is all about. Finding laughter, love, and leaves.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.400
Also, I need to borrow like a thousand dollars. I promise you I'll pay you back.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.840
Can you imagine? I have an opportunity for free money. Hey, quack if you love pumpkin spice.

04:47.840 --> 04:54.000
Don't give the ducks pumpkin spice, please. It will make them very sick.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.880
He's feeding it to the ducks. Let's go on a hayride.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.120
Oh, this is fun. One round trip around the pumpkin patch coming right up.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.160
Take me. Oh no, Tommy fell under the wheel.

05:10.160 --> 05:19.920
He's dead. We got to go back. He can't play a banjo. Tommy's dead. He's dead, man.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.400
You want to hear the one about fucking your cup? I'll start the fire.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.400
What? Wait, is this the cup's voice talking? I'm burning your house down around here.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.040
You better get to a Starbucks quick. It's the only safe place.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.880
This is for the insurance money. It's what you were hinting at, right?

05:45.920 --> 05:48.800
We both agreed. I'd kill your mom. You kill my dad.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.280
It is wrong to wear fuzzy socks and footy pajamas. I don't want to be right.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.560
Wait, what about the fire? What? The fire is happening.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.920
The fire is happening. Also, why would you wear footy pajamas and fuzzy socks?

05:59.920 --> 06:20.560
Yeah. Oh, Susan, you're here. I wasn't expecting to see you.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.840
What's that in the back behind the counter? Is that Tommy's ghost?

06:25.840 --> 06:29.120
I don't know what they say. When the leaves start falling,

06:29.120 --> 06:36.320
the BSLs start calling. He liked that. He liked that one.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.280
More whip, please. Can you do that?

06:43.280 --> 06:48.800
You've had enough whip, sir. Hey, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.960
More whip. More whip.

06:50.960 --> 06:59.360
He's just blowing the foam off into the guy's face. Is that more whip again?

07:00.160 --> 07:04.160
You work for me, Jerry. No, my name's not Jerry.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.360
It's Tommy. Oh, no.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.640
Floats off into PSL ghost. So anyway, there is a cult about

07:13.280 --> 07:16.400
pumpkin spice lattes that Starbucks has been fostering for years.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.320
That's fine. Rush into a Starbucks.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.520
Crap. Fill that place. Fill it up with warm bodies.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.320
Close as you can pack them. Like sardines.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.400
To the window, to the wall, till the leaves all start to fall.

07:31.440 --> 07:36.320
It's pumpkin spice latte season. So welcome to fall.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.280
The autumnal energy is strong here on this episode.

07:39.280 --> 07:45.680
It's 104 Fahrenheit degrees outside. Still doing summer here.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.400
Looking forward to the PSL. You know what I call that?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.600
Hot fall. There's hot fall.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.600
There's cold fall. There's green fall.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.000
And there's fall fall. That's it.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.840
Hey, are you guys... I don't want to keep distracting Fred.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.000
This is an advice show. We will get to the advice.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.080
It's kind of a weird time. Things are weird.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.000
I just want this to be a weird show. It feels appropriately weird.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.800
Are you guys getting a lot of weird political texts from people

08:12.800 --> 08:15.680
who supposedly are sort of on your team?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.480
Fucking pretty wild. Let's talk about this.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.200
So Trav, I know you got one and yours tops mine.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.600
So I want to just share mine first.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.120
Literally, as we started recording, I got this text.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.280
With just 12 hours to go, Joe Biden is rapidly dropping in the polls.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.640
Undecided voters love Trump's convention and no one is donating to our texts.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.200
That's a fundraising bitch.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.680
First off, what happens in 12 hours?

08:43.680 --> 08:44.180
Yeah.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.880
Are we voting in 12 hours? That's very unnerving.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.240
It's voting. When the leaves start to fall,

08:52.240 --> 08:55.920
you have 24 hours to vote for the American president.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.760
Now I receive a text.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.600
James Carville here. As a lifelong Cajun, I've seen them all.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.880
This is a text in which James Carville is telling me

09:06.880 --> 09:09.920
who to vote for in the Louisiana election.

09:09.920 --> 09:16.720
And I am uncertain why I'm on this list and how I might use this information.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.480
Have you got any fun texts?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.480
All mine are very- are porny.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.800
I just get weird, porny texts.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.880
And I get the weird, porny texts to me in a bunch of other 304 numbers.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.280
And there's always somebody in the 304 numbers that's like,

09:33.280 --> 09:34.800
what's your fucking problem?

09:36.960 --> 09:38.400
I'm gonna come fucking-

09:38.400 --> 09:41.520
Somebody will send it and be like, do you want to see my wet butt?

09:41.520 --> 09:44.560
And then some random Huntingtonian will be like,

09:44.560 --> 09:46.960
I'm gonna fucking kill you in my car.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.560
When that happens to me, it's 20 West Virginians,

09:50.560 --> 09:54.000
20 rowdy West Virginians that they've gathered into one text thread

09:54.000 --> 09:55.200
who are not pleased.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.080
So this is a thread of people.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.760
Each one of the texts I'm about to read you is from a different phone number, okay?

10:01.760 --> 10:03.360
So we all get the spam text.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.400
And then someone texts, picture of a stop sign.

10:06.400 --> 10:06.880
Stop.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.320
Next person.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.040
No kidding.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.640
Next person.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.200
Stop.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.560
Next person.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.120
Stop.

10:15.120 --> 10:20.000
And then they've included the email address of the person that sent out the initial text.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.920
By person, of course, I mean robot who is not reading this.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.400
Next person, all caps.

10:26.400 --> 10:26.960
Stop.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.800
Right after that.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.480
Quick texting me, asshole.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.040
I'm getting same text messages from a third party.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.160
It's called spam.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.520
Just delete the damn things.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.040
Next person.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.400
It's not me.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.840
I'm trying to get this mess off my phone.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.760
Next person.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.640
Trying to get these guys off my phone.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.240
I am not texting you.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.360
They're saying this in a text message to the entire group.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.240
Last person.

10:54.240 --> 10:54.740
Okay.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.880
And then they were done.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.840
And then everyone got the memo.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.360
Do you guys ever get these?

11:01.360 --> 11:04.320
I get them sometimes where it's like,

11:04.320 --> 11:07.680
hey, it's dad, I left my medication at your house.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.560
Please call me.

11:09.120 --> 11:09.520
Please.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.560
I need that medication so bad.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.000
And it's using dad's phone number.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.560
Dad's phone number.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.480
It's like someone got hacked.

11:14.480 --> 11:14.800
Yeah.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.240
And I'm like, spam.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.440
And he's like, no, please.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.160
I need this.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.960
I'm having my dark cravings again.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.360
Please.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.480
Daddy likes his medicine.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.520
Can we do a question?

11:26.320 --> 11:32.880
My cat, who I assume was lost for over three years, has reappeared in my neighbor's window.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.240
The perfect crime.

11:34.240 --> 11:38.640
I don't want to take her back, but I do want to visit her as she acknowledges my presence

11:38.640 --> 11:40.480
through the clear window.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.240
Problem is, I'm very socially awkward, and I don't know what to say to my elderly woman

11:44.240 --> 11:47.680
neighbor in order to visit my courageous calico kitty.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.800
Thank you for the alliteration.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.080
It's very much appreciated.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.120
Brothers, how do I visit my cat at my neighbor's house?

11:53.120 --> 11:55.280
That's from Kitty Conundrum in the Keystone State.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.200
What's wild about this is that the middle road that you're attempting to find here

11:59.200 --> 12:00.640
is the wildest option.

12:00.640 --> 12:08.400
The two options you have are nothing or full blown Liam Neeson smash in the front door,

12:08.400 --> 12:13.520
grab the cat, smoke bomb, rappel out the window like, this is my fucking cat.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.600
The commuter.

12:16.240 --> 12:16.720
What's that?

12:18.720 --> 12:19.600
The commuter.

12:21.200 --> 12:21.700
Huh.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.160
So there's a movie called The Commuter starring Liam Neeson.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.120
Yeah, but that's not-

12:27.120 --> 12:28.160
What happens in it?

12:28.160 --> 12:30.000
And I changed that to the commuter.

12:30.000 --> 12:30.960
What happens in the movie?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.720
So he steals his cat, it's his neighbor, and he has to get in-

12:34.720 --> 12:36.640
Why wouldn't they just call that movie The Commuter then?

12:37.680 --> 12:40.160
Because it's trademarked by me just now.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.200
But this is after the movie came out.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.280
Love Actually.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.320
Now that's a movie part.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.880
Now that's a feel.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.640
No, but you would call it My Cat Actually, because you would say, that's my cat actually.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.760
My cat actually.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.640
Walking into this house and be like, hey, what's up?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.080
You stole my cat.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.280
Can I pet it?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.360
Is fucking out of this world.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.960
It's the hardest possible one, right?

13:06.960 --> 13:11.040
Because there's not a decent human being on earth who-

13:11.040 --> 13:12.960
I mean, one of two things will happen, right?

13:12.960 --> 13:17.680
If you say, hey, that's my cat, then the neighbor, who is also a person with their own thoughts

13:17.680 --> 13:21.840
and feelings, will say, well, you should take this cat back.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.680
I don't want to be a cat thief.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.480
That sucks.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.520
Or I've been watching this cat for two years.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.960
You need to go home.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.520
This cat and you don't live together anymore.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.640
They don't know who you are.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.600
There is no middle ground where they're like, joint custody, maybe?

13:39.600 --> 13:40.880
May we share the cat?

13:40.880 --> 13:41.680
Nights and weekends?

13:43.760 --> 13:44.480
Counterpoint.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.560
Okay, you ready for this?

13:47.120 --> 13:48.240
Meanderpoint.

13:48.240 --> 13:48.880
Meanderpoint.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.640
Yes, hello.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.280
Hi, I wanted to visit Cinnamon.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.200
Is Cinnamon home?

13:58.560 --> 13:59.520
Excuse me?

13:59.520 --> 14:03.360
Cinnamon, the cat, used to live with me, now lives with you.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.160
Totally cool.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.960
I just wanted to check in and see how Cinnamon's doing.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.960
I can tell you're having trouble hearing me.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.680
Let me remove my face mask and get even closer to you.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.800
Okay, go ahead.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.720
I'm here to visit the cat.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.920
I'm willing to do it here on the porch if you don't want me to come in your home.

14:21.920 --> 14:26.880
Can you pretend there's something that the cat left at your house that it is probably missing?

14:26.880 --> 14:29.440
Like this dead mouse.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.360
I know you have Mr. Cinnamon here, he left his vape pen at my house.

14:33.360 --> 14:39.120
If you will please take it back just so he has his chunky ADV that he craves.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.560
And don't forget, he likes his food warmed up.

14:43.920 --> 14:48.480
Can you not just open the front door and crack a can of Star Kist and just wait?

14:49.680 --> 14:50.960
The cat will find it.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.800
The cat will find a way.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.480
The cat's gonna get out there.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.040
That's a good point.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.160
I mean, it'll open the door.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.320
Just open a Star Kist outside.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.360
What if the reason you finally, after all this time, saw your cat in the window

15:01.360 --> 15:03.920
is your cat was trying to signal you that it needs rescued.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.600
This is the first time the cat was able to get your attention.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.080
It's like, get me out of here.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.320
This lady thinks that I am her son.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.440
Please.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.480
Cats do have this one unique ability.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.840
If you open the Star Kist can near an open window,

15:19.840 --> 15:23.760
they could actually float out on the waves, the stink waves.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.800
Yeah, I've heard that.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.760
I've seen that happen.

15:28.400 --> 15:33.600
If it makes you feel any better, the cat does not remember you.

15:33.600 --> 15:33.840
No.

15:34.480 --> 15:41.120
If that lessens the burden in any way, this cat does not remember you.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.400
Dog would.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.920
Yes, absolutely.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.240
I've seen those videos of hero soldiers.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.120
The dog would.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.640
Okay, the cat does not care.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.320
You ever see one of those videos of the cat?

15:52.320 --> 15:53.200
Absolutely not.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.560
I think we've talked about this before,

15:54.560 --> 15:57.920
but it's the most unbelievable part of the Incredible Journey.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.800
Was it called with the two dogs and the one cat,

16:00.800 --> 16:02.720
that the two dogs had crossed the bound?

16:02.720 --> 16:03.920
Homeward Bound, thank you.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.520
The Incredible Animals Journeys.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.920
Yes, where the two dogs, yeah, I believe that.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.520
Two dogs, they would jump over the Grand Canyon.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.440
The fact that the cat's like, I'm also gonna go with you two dogs?

16:15.440 --> 16:17.360
No way.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.840
I think it was called Pet Friends on the Road.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.320
I think it was just called Rambling Pets.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.800
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

16:24.800 --> 16:25.840
Yeah, please.

16:25.840 --> 16:31.360
This Yahoo was sent in by, this is an interesting one.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.960
And I'm really just gonna, it was sent in by Emma Cant, thank you, Emma.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.480
And I'm just gonna ask it.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.640
And then I'm gonna go one, two, three,

16:38.640 --> 16:40.240
and then everybody say their answer.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.920
And we're not gonna do anything else on it.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.840
I'm just really, like I saw this and I was like,

16:43.840 --> 16:44.720
this isn't a good question.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.920
It was just an interesting sort of,

16:45.920 --> 16:48.560
like Myers-Briggs personality test.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.520
So I'm gonna ask it.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.160
It was from a Yahoo Answers user, Frost,

16:52.160 --> 16:54.800
or perhaps Frayge, who asks.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.840
And again, I'm gonna ask it.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.680
And then one, two, three, and say it.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.120
And don't make it, don't be funny.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.080
Don't do your usual joke bullshit.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.880
Like let's pretend like we have a bit of respect

17:04.880 --> 17:05.920
for this podcast and its listeners.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.640
Griffin, I have never once been funny on this show.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.140
Good.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.040
Frayge asks,

17:11.040 --> 17:15.600
which chess piece is the sexiest?

17:15.600 --> 17:17.760
One, two, three, bishop.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.480
Knight.

17:18.480 --> 17:18.980
Rook.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.880
Okay, we all said different shit.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.560
I thought for sure we'd all say bishop.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.680
Well, the rook is the least sexiest, Justin, I'm sorry.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.640
It's got like a bunch of different,

17:29.680 --> 17:31.120
it's got the closest to a hand.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.180
Fair?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.640
I didn't even think about that.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.360
Now hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.800
We have not established criteria.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.880
I said we weren't gonna, I said we weren't gonna talk.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.160
I know, I'm sorry Griffin,

17:42.160 --> 17:46.240
but I was thinking about it in terms of sexiest to look at.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.280
Knight, the idea is sexy.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.440
Travis wasn't even thinking about finishing.

17:51.440 --> 17:55.360
Yeah, I was thinking about like if I was working in an office

17:56.000 --> 17:59.040
and it was like a break time and I looked out the window

17:59.040 --> 18:02.400
and I saw this chess piece cracking open a cold Diet Coke

18:02.400 --> 18:05.680
whilst working on the construction site across the way,

18:05.680 --> 18:07.200
which one would I most enjoy?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.560
I don't want you.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.000
What I most enjoy looking at, the knight.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.320
You're just gonna keep it at a distance,

18:16.320 --> 18:18.720
a romantic dalliance for your daydreams.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.520
Listen, I'm saying that maybe this is a aspiration

18:21.520 --> 18:23.760
or maybe it's just perhaps, if you will,

18:23.760 --> 18:25.600
fuel for the fire back home.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.440
I am not looking for an entanglement with this chess piece,

18:29.440 --> 18:36.080
but I like the idea of a knight and I think it's a sexy course.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.280
I don't, maybe this isn't the fucking PC thing to say,

18:39.280 --> 18:42.240
but I'd rather get to know the chess piece's mind first

18:42.800 --> 18:44.480
because that's what's sexy to me.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.400
Neither one of us went for power though.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.320
None of us went for like queen or king.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.040
We all, we know our plays.

18:51.040 --> 18:55.440
Yeah, like we know, we know where we pull, okay?

18:55.440 --> 18:57.760
But all of us rose above pawn.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.040
No one said pawn.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.800
Well, no, we're better than that.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.720
All right, come on, there's lots of those.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.080
I'm just saying if I could have all the pawns,

19:06.720 --> 19:10.320
then we may be into something of a situation.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.920
Now, Griffin, you said bishop.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.640
Does the religious aspect not scare you off there at all?

19:17.280 --> 19:20.720
Well, that's not what I was thinking about, Travis.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.560
But I don't, again, I said,

19:22.560 --> 19:24.960
when I said we're not gonna talk about it,

19:24.960 --> 19:27.280
it's because I didn't really want to get into it

19:27.280 --> 19:29.280
and I thought that you guys would share my feelings.

19:29.280 --> 19:29.680
But I guess depending on-

19:29.680 --> 19:31.200
Hey Griffin, can I just, can I say one word

19:31.200 --> 19:32.880
and you tell me if I nailed it?

19:32.880 --> 19:33.120
Yeah.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.320
Curvature.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.880
I'm gonna try one, slot.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.120
Here's another Yahoo.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.240
No Griffin, who was right?

19:43.440 --> 19:47.040
I mean, depending on how you look at the bishop,

19:47.040 --> 19:48.800
it could either look like a peepee or a jug.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.360
This Yahoo is sent in by Johannes.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.560
Johannes, thank you, it's from Yahoo Answers user Christopher

19:58.560 --> 20:02.160
who asks, if Adidas started selling t-shirts

20:02.160 --> 20:06.320
with photos of your face on them, how would you react?

20:07.680 --> 20:10.080
Confused it for, if I'm being honest,

20:10.080 --> 20:10.400
why I was chosen-

20:10.400 --> 20:11.680
Not supposed to be confused.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.360
Yeah, why was I chosen to represent any sport?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.680
Confusion wouldn't even be, well, first of all,

20:17.680 --> 20:19.360
you wouldn't be representing a sport, right?

20:19.360 --> 20:21.920
Like it wouldn't have you and then like,

20:22.640 --> 20:25.600
you know, the New England Patriots logo, probably.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.200
No, I'm not saying a team.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.520
I'm saying that Adidas, as you have said,

20:29.520 --> 20:32.720
is a sporting goods company, are they not?

20:33.280 --> 20:36.640
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that you represent sports.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.400
It just means Adidas thought that your face

20:38.400 --> 20:39.600
would be cool to put on a t-shirt.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.120
I think confusion would be the first reaction for most of us

20:43.120 --> 20:45.920
and then it would continue to be the reaction for a while.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.320
I wanna know what goes deeper than that.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.920
Can I be honest, Griffin?

20:49.920 --> 20:50.160
Please.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.440
Deeper confusion.

20:51.440 --> 20:54.000
Because at first, I would be confused

20:54.000 --> 20:55.600
why Adidas has chosen me.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.960
But then I would start to think, how did Adidas get this photo?

21:00.000 --> 21:03.280
Who within the Adidas Corporation was like,

21:03.280 --> 21:06.560
I guess, looking on perhaps Instagram or my Facebook?

21:06.560 --> 21:08.480
Yeah, it's your Facebook profile photo

21:08.480 --> 21:09.920
and then you get upset about it

21:09.920 --> 21:14.160
and fucking Zuck is like, this allowed.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.120
You put it on Facebook.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.400
It's mine now.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.560
It's mine now and I gave it to Adidas.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.040
They were scrolling by and they would have just thought,

21:21.040 --> 21:22.960
this is aesthetically pleasing enough

21:22.960 --> 21:24.800
that it will sell t-shirts.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
Then I guess maybe flattered might be.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.320
Do you think that's buried in the TOS somewhere

21:30.320 --> 21:31.520
when you go on Facebook?

21:31.520 --> 21:34.960
Like Zuck's just like, hey, Zuck,

21:34.960 --> 21:36.880
I hope you're not reading any of this legal stuff

21:36.880 --> 21:38.480
because I'm gonna sell all your shit to Adidas.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.640
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.960
All day I dream about screwing you over.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.000
You know what I mean?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.640
It'd be like, and then I'll be out on the street

21:46.640 --> 21:48.000
and I'll see somebody walking.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.040
I'll be like, man, their shoes look like my bare feet.

21:51.040 --> 21:56.400
And then it turns out Adidas has gotten my feet off Facebook.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.720
That explains why they have made those pants

21:58.720 --> 22:01.760
that look like my naked body from the waist down.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.800
Your new legs, yeah.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.400
It's your beepus and butt and everything

22:04.400 --> 22:06.640
is on these new Adidas track pants.

22:06.640 --> 22:10.000
It's your beepus and butt, your hairy legs, my feet,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.320
and Justin's face is like the whole torso.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.680
Now here's what I imagine happens.

22:15.680 --> 22:20.000
I go to Adidas and I say, hey, what the fuck?

22:20.000 --> 22:24.720
And then they say, well, turns out your body

22:24.720 --> 22:26.560
is perfectly aerodynamic.

22:27.200 --> 22:31.200
Your body is the most, you are like a blade

22:31.200 --> 22:32.320
moving through the wind.

22:32.320 --> 22:36.240
And so now every sporter wants their body

22:36.240 --> 22:37.120
shaped like your body.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.280
And I'll say, can I have some money please?

22:39.280 --> 22:42.240
And they'll say, you don't own your body.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.280
God owns your body.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.960
God owns your body and Zuck.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.080
Also that explains why all the new formula one races

22:48.080 --> 22:50.800
we've been seeing lately are just big paper mache

22:50.800 --> 22:53.920
Travis heads just zooming around the track so fast.

22:54.720 --> 22:55.600
Nature's arrow.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.680
Nature's arrow, Travis's face, which makes it

22:57.680 --> 23:01.040
all the more upsetting when there's a big accident

23:01.040 --> 23:02.400
on the field because that's my brother's head

23:02.400 --> 23:04.000
just going all topsy-turvy.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.400
But it also explains why they've put those amplifiers

23:06.400 --> 23:08.640
in the mouth so the cars are just screaming

23:08.640 --> 23:10.960
as they go around very scary.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.480
And Travis, you said the first thing you do is,

23:14.480 --> 23:16.960
and I quote, and Justin back me up on this.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.720
You go to Adidas.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.640
Tell me what that looks like.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.320
I want you to, you see on the street today-

23:22.320 --> 23:24.880
Well I imagine they're pretty, they're joys

23:24.880 --> 23:25.920
that I'm there.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.440
It's him, they'll say.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.480
Okay, stop.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.200
Stop it.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.560
Listen to me and use your fucking brain for once.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.440
You see someone's face, you see your face

23:35.440 --> 23:38.480
on both a t-shirt and an Adidas sponsored

23:38.480 --> 23:39.680
formula one race car.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.000
You say, that's fucked up.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.440
I should go to Adidas about that.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.280
Now tell me literally the next thing that happens

23:45.280 --> 23:47.600
and don't say, go to Adidas.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.280
I'd probably tweet at them.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.320
Like, where can I find you?

23:53.120 --> 23:53.440
Where are you?

23:53.440 --> 23:55.200
And they would say, well, yes, of course,

23:55.200 --> 23:56.400
you're the face of Adidas.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.400
Please come visit us.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.360
Yeah, not enough people are tweeting at brands.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.160
Where are you?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.280
Where are you?

24:03.280 --> 24:04.640
Where are you right now?

24:04.640 --> 24:05.600
I gotta get over there.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.840
Do you guys know what Adidas stands for?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.280
All day I dream about soccer.

24:10.240 --> 24:10.960
Hey Griffin.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.880
That is what I thought it was so far.

24:12.880 --> 24:17.040
Yeah, it's named for its owner, Adi Dassler.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.280
It was founded in 1924 in Germany, Adi Dassler.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.520
More like Daddy Dassler.

24:24.160 --> 24:29.360
Yeah, but of course, don't tell that to Jonathan Davis

24:29.360 --> 24:31.920
who heard one day someone said,

24:31.920 --> 24:34.320
you know, it stands for all day I dream about sex, right?

24:34.320 --> 24:37.120
And he's like, fuck, that's funny.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.480
I'm gonna sit down and write a song.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.440
I can't tell about that.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.040
Yeah, that's awesome.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.240
I think I would be disappointed.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.360
I think that would be the arc.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.920
I think I'd be confused and then flattered

24:49.920 --> 24:51.040
and then disappointed

24:52.000 --> 24:53.520
because I wouldn't get any money.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.320
If it's your face, Travis,

24:56.320 --> 24:57.680
I know what fucking face it's gonna be

24:57.680 --> 24:59.120
because you have a fucking...

25:00.400 --> 25:02.720
The face you make in all the fucking pics

25:02.720 --> 25:04.720
that you're always sharing to people,

25:04.720 --> 25:08.240
you've trademarked, you've patented that face.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.040
I get it.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.280
I don't know which one I'm gonna have on there.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.000
I don't have a go-to face.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.640
Maybe it's your face that you make

25:18.640 --> 25:21.520
when I've just said something that is dumb

25:21.520 --> 25:25.360
and you kind of curl up one eyebrow

25:25.360 --> 25:27.360
and your mouth twists into this little...

25:27.360 --> 25:28.080
That's the rock.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.120
You're thinking of the rock again.

25:29.120 --> 25:29.680
Ah, damn it, you're right.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.480
I don't do that one.

25:30.480 --> 25:31.840
The rock does that one.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.360
I've seen you do it.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.120
I make a lot of faces in photos

25:35.120 --> 25:37.920
that a lot of people see them

25:37.920 --> 25:39.600
and have to wonder,

25:39.600 --> 25:43.120
what did he just do before this photo was taken?

25:43.120 --> 25:47.040
Because it seems unscrupulous.

25:47.040 --> 25:47.760
It's a little...

25:47.760 --> 25:49.440
You're impish, for sure.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.680
You have a certain impish quality about you.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.640
But like a stinky, bad imp.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.480
You're not like a devilish trickster,

25:56.480 --> 25:59.120
like a real garbage.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.640
Justin, would you make the face

26:00.640 --> 26:02.160
that you think would be on the t-shirt,

26:02.160 --> 26:02.880
make it right now?

26:03.520 --> 26:03.760
Okay.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.200
Oh yeah, that's it.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.680
That's how I am.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.480
So my dad owns a small family business

26:10.480 --> 26:12.240
that used to be my grandfather's.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.480
My siblings and I have made many attempts

26:14.480 --> 26:16.080
to bring him in the 21st century over the years

26:16.080 --> 26:17.120
with very success.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.320
The big hurdle is this.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.840
He brings his work desktop computer with him

26:22.560 --> 26:23.520
when he travels.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.760
Going on a Disney cruise with my mom

26:26.560 --> 26:28.960
brings the desktop and sets it up in the cabin.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.040
Monitor, keyboard, tower, mouse.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.120
His favorite mouse pad.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.680
Everything comes with him.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.000
No matter how short or long the trip.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.600
We bought him a laptop last year

26:41.600 --> 26:42.880
and set it up for him.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.280
And he and my mom only use it to Zoom with us.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.600
He said laptops aren't for work

26:47.600 --> 26:49.200
because you can't trust them.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.960
We are fully at the end of our collective rope here.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.640
Is there no hope for him?

26:54.640 --> 26:58.000
Will he never know the joy of a travel size computer

26:58.000 --> 26:59.680
that's from Luddites of Long Island?

26:59.680 --> 27:00.320
Holy shit.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.120
Holy fuck.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.560
That's so good.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.680
It's rough.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.160
You know, I will say it didn't occur to me

27:06.160 --> 27:07.280
until Justin was reading it.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.760
You can't trust and comment

27:10.480 --> 27:12.800
if you just look at the construction,

27:12.800 --> 27:17.440
there is no built-in lock point in a desktop computer

27:17.440 --> 27:20.400
because no one is ever cruising around the Starbucks

27:20.400 --> 27:26.480
looking for unwatched towers that they might spear it away.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.840
Yeah, no one's gonna steal your tower.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.320
Because you see a laptop

27:30.320 --> 27:32.880
and there's also a certain guarantee of

27:32.880 --> 27:34.720
this is a functioning computer.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.040
But a lot of desktop towers,

27:37.040 --> 27:39.280
unless it has some like dope ass LEDs

27:39.280 --> 27:41.920
and some fucking real gamer coolers up in it,

27:41.920 --> 27:44.720
I'm just gonna assume it's running fucking Windows 95.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.040
Yeah, with this cat.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.400
Yeah, that would be sick

27:48.400 --> 27:50.400
if he didn't have like a monstrous vapor.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.400
He's bit mining.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.760
I can't use my laptop

28:01.760 --> 28:04.560
because I've melted my third video card this week.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.120
Maybe that was your grandfather,

28:09.120 --> 28:10.880
like an esports gamer

28:10.880 --> 28:12.720
and now your dad has taken over

28:12.720 --> 28:16.080
and he's disappointed because you aren't into esports.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.120
You're out there, I don't know,

28:17.120 --> 28:18.800
maybe studying law or whatever

28:19.360 --> 28:21.440
and he's disappointed that you didn't follow along.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.480
I brought the laptop with me on the trip now

28:24.480 --> 28:26.160
and look at my fucking frame count.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
Right now I'm gonna jack up control to ultra.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.000
I was supposed to raid with my group later

28:30.000 --> 28:31.280
and fucking look at this.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.400
Look at this fucking shit.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.280
You think anybody else on this cruise is ray tracing?

28:35.280 --> 28:37.440
I'm the only one ray tracing on this cruise.

28:37.440 --> 28:37.940
Come on.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.000
This is wild, this is wild.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.840
This laptop melted my dick off.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.360
This is how I fucking run it.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.240
That's how I run this shit.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.600
That's how I run these hogs.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.440
I actually have five computers

28:51.440 --> 28:54.560
because I keep burning them up and rebuilding them.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.400
I lost my dang Bitcoin.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.960
Someone took my laptop, stole my dang Bitcoin.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.200
Jingle-jangled right out of my freaking pocket, man.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.240
Wait, can you trust laptops?

29:04.240 --> 29:04.640
No.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.400
Hold on, can you trust them?

29:06.400 --> 29:08.000
They have the built-in camera.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.280
Do you think that's what it means?

29:09.280 --> 29:12.320
No, I think it's, hey, you look at those babies,

29:12.320 --> 29:15.520
man, a desktop, a hard G tower,

29:15.520 --> 29:18.320
you could drop that shit of a two-story building.

29:18.320 --> 29:18.720
A laptop-

29:18.720 --> 29:19.920
And it would break and explode.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.520
And it break and a thousand-

29:21.520 --> 29:24.160
A laptop, you accidentally leave a pencil in there,

29:24.160 --> 29:25.120
it's done.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.040
Why do you have a pencil inside your laptop?

29:27.040 --> 29:28.880
Because I forgot it wasn't a book.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.640
Yeah, I had a MacBook a few years back

29:35.200 --> 29:38.640
and I lost a particularly frustrating game of chess

29:38.640 --> 29:40.640
and I punched the keys so hard

29:40.640 --> 29:44.160
and it only took one punch for it to get all bent up,

29:44.160 --> 29:45.280
not working no more.

29:46.240 --> 29:46.960
Not like a tower.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.400
I'm glad that a media company

29:52.400 --> 29:54.240
I was formerly in the employ of,

29:54.240 --> 29:57.840
I had to tell them I fell down the stairs.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.320
You fell down the stairs or it fell down the stairs?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.240
Then I fell down the stairs, I was like, whoa.

30:03.120 --> 30:03.440
Okay.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.360
Wait, shut up.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.480
The keyboard was the part that was broken, right?

30:08.480 --> 30:09.440
So it was open?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.960
Everybody who's not Justin needs to shut up

30:12.960 --> 30:14.160
for the next minute

30:14.160 --> 30:17.680
while you tell me every detail about the story you told them.

30:17.680 --> 30:21.680
I got the email.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.400
Holy shit.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.480
See, by the way, media company,

30:32.480 --> 30:34.720
if you do, yeah, please, nobody tell them.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.240
I mean, please don't tell them.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.280
But if a media company, if you do hear this,

30:42.080 --> 30:43.920
let me know, I'll pay for it.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.800
It's just goofing.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.360
It's just goofing.

30:45.360 --> 30:45.920
Hello.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.840
Oh, yeah, this is all fake.

30:47.840 --> 30:51.200
Hello, my MacBook Pro is having some major problems

30:51.200 --> 30:53.120
related to me falling down the stairs.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.920
And then in parentheses, it says, I am okay.

30:59.920 --> 31:00.320
Thank you.

31:09.440 --> 31:10.400
Oh, thank God.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.160
Oh, thank God.

31:12.160 --> 31:16.080
Oh, I'm not gonna tell him that I fucking got out Kasparov

31:16.080 --> 31:17.840
and had to one punch man that shit.

31:20.240 --> 31:25.520
But doesn't all you said is related to me falling down the stairs?

31:25.520 --> 31:26.320
Travis, I was trying to,

31:26.320 --> 31:30.000
I didn't want to get into like a courtroom recreation

31:30.000 --> 31:33.680
like because I couldn't imagine the actual particulars of it.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.080
Exactly.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.040
Just things happen.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.600
It's, what did you, did you drop it down the stairs

31:37.600 --> 31:40.800
and it fell out of your hand into a big man's fist?

31:40.800 --> 31:44.240
When I was thinking, what I was thinking happened was-

31:44.240 --> 31:45.280
Was that all the detail?

31:45.280 --> 31:45.760
Wait, hold on.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.120
Was that all the details?

31:47.120 --> 31:48.480
Much love, Justin.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.920
Please send replacement.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.240
He doesn't need to, he's not gonna do a,

31:52.240 --> 31:53.840
it's not unsolved mysteries.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.440
He's not gonna do a reenactment of it.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.280
Like he doesn't need more than that.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.760
Holy shit, that's so choice.

31:59.760 --> 32:03.440
I guess in my head what happened was I had the computer open

32:04.160 --> 32:06.560
while I was walking down the stairs, which was reckless.

32:06.560 --> 32:11.760
And then I tripped and then used the middle sort of punch size

32:11.760 --> 32:14.480
section of the keyboard to break my fall.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.640
I think that's what I, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.680
That's why you're fine.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.880
If you hadn't had your laptop at the time, you'd be dead.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.880
This one's, this one's cashed,

32:22.880 --> 32:26.160
but do something to honor this hero laptop.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.920
Yeah, and I will, I would like to talk to Tim about that.

32:29.920 --> 32:33.520
I mean, you should, here's what I'm gonna say.

32:33.520 --> 32:38.720
If your laptops can't take a punch, they shouldn't run chess.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.120
Yes.

32:39.120 --> 32:39.760
Is that fair?

32:40.640 --> 32:42.160
Is that fair to say?

32:42.160 --> 32:43.600
That's what, this is what I'm saying.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.520
This is why laptops are for nerds.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.880
You can't punch them once, can't punch it one time.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.320
I'm, what if I get very mad?

32:50.320 --> 32:51.840
Yeah, Justin, it's not like Justin

32:51.840 --> 32:53.360
punching it over and over again.

32:53.360 --> 32:56.000
It was one punch, can't take one punch.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.600
It would be so dope if during one of the press conferences,

32:59.600 --> 33:01.360
Tim Cook is like, pushes the button.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.880
He's like, and in this new model, 3.6 punches.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.120
Watch, wham wham wham, boop.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.400
Record 3.6 punches.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.320
Get out of here, Brock Lesnar, fuck it up.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.120
It's my friend Brock.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.520
He and I have been lifting together.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.320
Hey Tim, it's me, Brock Lesnar.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.240
I'm so impressed with this new MacBook model.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.600
Anyway, I'm gonna punch it for you.

33:26.560 --> 33:26.960
And then I'm gonna rip it in half.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.840
One, two, three, stop, stop, stop.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.080
It's the only one I've got, don't do that.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.560
What's frustrating is you can't punch them,

33:36.560 --> 33:39.920
which you would, but you can't tear them in half,

33:39.920 --> 33:41.600
which you would never, right?

33:42.160 --> 33:43.280
Doesn't that seem stupid?

33:43.920 --> 33:45.840
You should make them un-tear-in-half-able.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.880
That's a tower, Justin.

33:48.880 --> 33:52.320
Yeah, no, I'm saying you can punch it,

33:52.320 --> 33:53.920
but you can't tear it in half.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.240
Okay.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.320
And I would never try to tear it in half in anger.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.080
I would punch it in anger.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.720
And I actually might try to tear it in half in anger.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.080
I have tried to twist,

34:02.880 --> 34:06.000
I've twisted controllers in half in anger.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.880
So wait, Justin, just to get this clear,

34:08.880 --> 34:12.720
your complaint with laptops is that you can't punch them.

34:12.720 --> 34:16.320
You cannot punch them, but you could rip them in half.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.360
But Justin, I would argue it sounds like you did punch it.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.720
No, I'm saying the problem is they can't take a punch

34:23.600 --> 34:25.360
and yet you can't rip them in half.

34:25.360 --> 34:30.080
So they can't take it, what else can a laptop not do, Justin?

34:30.080 --> 34:34.960
I'm saying that I would not in anger close my laptop

34:34.960 --> 34:37.760
and then attempt to rip it in half, right?

34:37.760 --> 34:40.240
It doesn't need that much structural integrity.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.880
It does need the power to withstand a medium punch.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.960
Now, see, I thought when you were talking about ripping in half,

34:46.960 --> 34:50.880
you meant screen from keyboard, which I could do.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.920
Anyone can, Trav, you don't have to.

34:51.920 --> 34:52.960
Anybody can do that.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.600
If we're gonna buy this dad a high-end,

34:57.040 --> 35:02.240
top-of-the-line, government-level gamer laptop rig.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.240
Something he can also stream from,

35:04.240 --> 35:05.920
something he can also Twitch from, you know what I mean?

35:05.920 --> 35:08.000
If we're gonna turn this into a Twitch daddy,

35:08.000 --> 35:08.720
we're gonna need it.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.600
Yes.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.160
And by the way, we're not going to,

35:12.160 --> 35:13.920
that's not a service we offer at the show.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.040
Not yet.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.040
Okay, but we're not gonna do that,

35:17.040 --> 35:18.880
but we should go to the Money Zone.

35:18.880 --> 35:30.000
Let's go.

35:30.000 --> 35:30.800
Hey, honey.

35:30.800 --> 35:31.600
It's me, Justin.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.720
No, I said that.

35:32.720 --> 35:33.760
No one will ever know that, though.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.400
It got edited out.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.440
I know, but I said it first,

35:35.440 --> 35:37.040
and then we had to start over again.

35:37.040 --> 35:37.520
You're waste.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.720
You're burning time.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.640
Hey, honey, this is an intro I came up with

35:40.640 --> 35:42.000
for the company Honey.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.520
And I love Honey.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.320
I wish that I could express,

35:48.320 --> 35:50.480
I wish I had a secret signal I could send

35:50.480 --> 35:53.200
for when I don't actually like an advertiser that much

35:53.200 --> 35:55.040
so I could not do it for Honey

35:55.040 --> 35:57.040
because it is the best.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.320
Takes a few clicks.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.400
It installs in your web browser,

36:00.400 --> 36:02.800
and anytime you check out, it is like,

36:02.800 --> 36:06.960
hey, let me just see if you got any coupon codes anywhere

36:06.960 --> 36:07.360
in the back.

36:07.360 --> 36:07.920
I'll be right back.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.040
Let me just look real quick.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.800
And then it looks, and if it's got promo codes

36:10.800 --> 36:11.920
that it found on the internet,

36:11.920 --> 36:13.200
it just automatically applies them for you,

36:13.200 --> 36:14.000
saves you money.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.440
I mean, you can't, it's best.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.400
It's free.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.840
Takes a second to install.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.360
It's so weird that you wouldn't be using Honey.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.800
Do you just like giving away money?

36:22.800 --> 36:23.360
Is that it?

36:24.400 --> 36:25.440
It's honestly free money.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.560
So please get Honey for free

36:28.560 --> 36:30.960
at joinhoney.com slash brother.

36:30.960 --> 36:34.960
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

36:34.960 --> 36:35.680
What do you call it?

36:35.680 --> 36:36.960
Get some, get money.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.480
Hey guys, what do you call it

36:38.480 --> 36:42.720
when you use a web app to find discounts on underwear?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.200
Me hundies.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.240
I want to tell you about me hundies.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.760
Cause I said me hundies.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.760
God, don't you love it when you can hear the pride

36:51.760 --> 36:52.480
in his voice?

36:52.480 --> 36:53.600
Me hundies.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.240
Yeah.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.840
Me hundies.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.600
And then he says it like 70 times

36:58.640 --> 37:02.000
to make it feel like a joke.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.280
Oh, that's fucking funny though.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.760
Did you hear the voice he did in that time?

37:09.440 --> 37:11.040
Oh, that's fucking great, Travis.

37:11.040 --> 37:11.520
Yeah.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.600
Me hundies just wants everyone to feel comfy as heck

37:13.600 --> 37:15.440
with the freedom foods.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.960
Me hundies.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.760
They love it.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.400
They love it.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.360
The audience loves it.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.800
The advertisers love it.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.480
The ad reps love it.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.320
The ad reps send this to advertisers

37:24.320 --> 37:25.360
and they're like, this is good.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.880
How much money do they want?

37:26.880 --> 37:28.320
We'll give them all of it.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.000
Please, is there a tipping feature?

37:30.000 --> 37:30.320
Yeah.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.200
I'd love to tip.

37:31.200 --> 37:31.920
Oh, what's that?

37:31.920 --> 37:32.560
Oh, money.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.320
Suddenly I'm inside one of those money booths.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.600
Trav, you stopped doing the voice

37:37.600 --> 37:40.240
and the advertisers love your voice.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.360
Fuck, this sucks.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.520
I can only do that one thing though.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.000
Yeah, okay.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.280
Okay.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.440
So me hundies, they got really good,

37:47.440 --> 37:50.720
good soft stuff that you put on your body.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.160
They got stuff like underwear

37:52.800 --> 37:56.720
and they got lounge pants and they got onesies

37:56.720 --> 38:00.160
and they have very, very just comfortable stuff.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.960
And not only that, it's got good patterns.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.760
Fun patterns.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.560
I just got a pair of underwear with dinosaurs on them.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.000
And I know you think, aren't you scared

38:08.000 --> 38:10.800
that they will bite you on your privacy?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.880
And I say, no, it's just pictures.

38:13.920 --> 38:18.240
And they have a sustainably sourced fabric

38:18.240 --> 38:20.160
that is from beechwood trees.

38:20.160 --> 38:20.660
How?

38:21.280 --> 38:23.440
Well, they take the trees, they turn them to pulp

38:23.440 --> 38:25.040
and then to yarn and then to underwear.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.960
But I've put my leg inside a tree before

38:26.960 --> 38:28.400
and it did not feel good.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.160
They do stuff to it between the tree and your privacy.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.720
And you can get a me hundies membership,

38:34.720 --> 38:36.480
which is a subscription that sends new pairs

38:36.480 --> 38:37.520

38:37.520 --> 38:40.560
Plus you can get site-wide savings and exclusive sales.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.960
That's mehundies.com slash my brother.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.800
Me hundies.

38:53.440 --> 38:54.160
Hey, J. Keith.

38:54.160 --> 38:54.800
Hey, Helen.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.960
Hey, you've got another true false quiz for me?

38:56.960 --> 38:57.680
Yep.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
Our trivia podcast, Go Fact Yourself,

38:59.680 --> 39:01.840
used to be in front of a live audience.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.240
True.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.920
Turns out that's not so safe anymore.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.720
Correct.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.200
Next.

39:05.200 --> 39:08.560
Unfortunately, this means we can no longer record the show.

39:08.560 --> 39:08.960
False.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.880
The show still comes out every first and third

39:10.880 --> 39:11.760
Friday of the month.

39:11.760 --> 39:12.400
Correct.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.800
Finally, we still have great celebrity guests

39:14.800 --> 39:17.920
answering trivia about things they love on every episode

39:17.920 --> 39:19.040
of Go Fact Yourself.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.000
Definitely true.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.320
And for bonus points, name some of them.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.720
Recently, we've had Ophira Eisenberg plus tons

39:24.720 --> 39:27.920
of surprise experts like Yardley Smith and Suzanne Somers.

39:27.920 --> 39:28.640
Perfect score.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.520
You can hear Go Fact Yourself every first and third

39:31.520 --> 39:34.160
Friday of the month with all the great guests and trivia

39:34.160 --> 39:35.280
that we've always had.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.720
And if you don't listen, well, then you can go fact yourself.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.400
That's the name of our podcast.

39:40.400 --> 39:40.960
Correct.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.040
Here is a question I have here.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.240
I have recently moved into an apartment with a friend

39:48.240 --> 39:48.880
from high school.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.920
Everything has been great except for one thing.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.240
She has grown overly attached to my cat.

39:54.240 --> 39:57.200
She's home a lot more than I am and therefore spends

39:57.200 --> 39:59.440
more time with her, playing with her, taking her on walks.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.320
A lot of pronouns here.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.520
It's getting confusing.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.880
I sometimes come home to find lipstick marks from her

40:04.880 --> 40:06.240
kissing my cat on the forehead.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.360
Whoa, whoa.

40:07.360 --> 40:12.080
She even has started calling her cat our cat even when I've

40:12.080 --> 40:13.280
made it clear that she is mine.

40:13.280 --> 40:13.840
What should I do?

40:14.560 --> 40:16.480
Do I need to relax or is she overstepping?

40:16.480 --> 40:19.280
I just hate the idea of my cat liking my roommates more.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.360
That's from Mift in Minnesota.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.720
I actually, you know who would be good to help with this?

40:24.720 --> 40:27.280
I cannot fathom Ron Funches.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.080
Travis read my mind.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.040
Yeah, Ron Funches.

40:29.040 --> 40:29.760
Let me see if I can.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.280
When I think about roommate cat dynamic, Ron Funches.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.680
A real cat kisser.

40:35.680 --> 40:36.720
Best in the biz.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.680
Let me call him real quick.

40:41.200 --> 40:41.520
Hi.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.040
Hey, Ron.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.400
It's Hoops.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.480
I was still dialing.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.520
Ron has one of those special phones where all you have to do

40:49.520 --> 40:53.520
is sort of hit one of the phone numbered numbers over and over

40:53.520 --> 40:55.520
and over again until you hear him yell hi.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.280
Yeah, it felt like you were knocking.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.400
So I just answered.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.960
If you ever need to get Ron Funches, just keep hitting seven

41:02.960 --> 41:07.360
and eventually he'll answer.

41:07.360 --> 41:11.760
So Ron, you are probably so familiar with this sort of question

41:11.760 --> 41:13.040
that I don't even need to tell you.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.880
But it's like the classic sort of roommate

41:14.880 --> 41:16.400
to attach to the cat kind of deal.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.320
You have to find a lipstick on the forehead.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.200
Just a regular Tuesday for Ron.

41:25.200 --> 41:25.680
Am I right?

41:26.240 --> 41:29.760
So we reached out to we're just cycling through our different

41:29.760 --> 41:32.880
Trolls World Tour co-stars.

41:32.880 --> 41:33.920
How is Justin doing?

41:34.480 --> 41:36.160
Haven't gotten JT yet.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.680
Just hasn't quite been the right fit for him.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.320
He keeps asking about it and I'm like, you know.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.520
Just nothing up his alley yet.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.120
He's like, please, Justin, please.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.320
And I'm like, crime your river.

41:47.200 --> 41:47.760
Of course.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.920
Yeah, he loves it when you reference his song.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.760
It's his favorite thing.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.720
He also demanded that Justin legally change his name

41:58.720 --> 42:00.240
before he woke up.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.640
Did you know he's never been on a thing with another Justin?

42:02.640 --> 42:05.120
Like even like a best boy key grip.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.960
Like they do need to.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.040
He was supposed to swear in Justin Trudeau

42:09.600 --> 42:14.160
at his swearing in ceremony that Prime Ministers probably have.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.760
And he just he wouldn't do it.

42:15.760 --> 42:16.560
He wouldn't do it.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.160
Trudeau wouldn't change his name?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.040
And neither one would.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.080
They were at a sailmate.

42:22.640 --> 42:27.360
So Ron, where are you at with this with cats and ownership

42:27.360 --> 42:28.800
and roommates, where are you at?

42:28.800 --> 42:31.120
Can one really own a cat, Ron?

42:31.120 --> 42:32.720
That's how I feel about it.

42:32.720 --> 42:37.120
You know, it's really about just the relationship of love

42:37.120 --> 42:38.640
and it goes back and forth.

42:38.640 --> 42:42.880
And if you're not home with that cat and your roommate is

42:42.880 --> 42:47.200
and they're building a bond, I say, why stand in the way of it?

42:47.200 --> 42:49.520
It seemed like a little bit of jealousy,

42:49.520 --> 42:52.480
if not a little bit of guilt about, you know,

42:52.480 --> 42:54.400
maybe they've been working too much,

42:54.400 --> 42:56.640
not spending enough time with their cat.

42:56.640 --> 42:59.280
So, I mean, I feel either you have to learn

42:59.840 --> 43:02.000
to let go a bit about it

43:02.000 --> 43:05.680
and let that cat be loved by a full family.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.160
You know, it takes a village to raise a cat.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.280
Everyone knows that.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.200
That's so true.

43:11.200 --> 43:16.960
I would want to know where like cat maintenance duties

43:17.600 --> 43:19.680
are being assigned at this point, right?

43:19.680 --> 43:22.640
Because like I have there's a cat that lives at our house

43:22.640 --> 43:25.760
and it belonged to my other cat that died.

43:25.760 --> 43:28.800
Very inconsiderately, my older cat died

43:28.800 --> 43:31.520
and left her cat here for us to take care of.

43:31.520 --> 43:36.000
I don't not get any of the transactional love or support

43:36.000 --> 43:38.320
or company or anything from this cat.

43:38.320 --> 43:41.440
I just clean up its duty and refill its bowl.

43:41.440 --> 43:44.640
And I feel like if this person is getting love

43:44.640 --> 43:47.600
and affection from the cat, maybe they should step up

43:47.600 --> 43:50.320
with like some food, some water,

43:50.320 --> 43:53.760
some litter box cleanings, that sort of thing.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.840
Well, because there's a very real potential here

43:55.840 --> 43:58.240
that if you say these roommates only lived together

43:58.240 --> 43:59.680
for like a year, right?

43:59.680 --> 44:01.840
When they part ways and the cat's like,

44:01.840 --> 44:04.160
okay, well, I'm going with her now

44:04.720 --> 44:06.240
because she's been the one around.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.760
She's been there for me.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.840
Oh, seen it several times.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.920
Yeah, yeah.

44:11.920 --> 44:14.080
Yeah, the cat will choose and it will make a choice

44:14.080 --> 44:15.840
and you just have to live with it.

44:15.840 --> 44:18.480
So, I mean, I think maybe she should consider

44:18.480 --> 44:22.560
quitting her job in order to spend more time

44:22.560 --> 44:24.960
with the cat and truly support.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.440
I've been watching a lot of 90 Day Fiancé

44:27.440 --> 44:30.240
and it seems like one of the best things

44:30.240 --> 44:33.520
you can do in a relationship is stop caring

44:33.520 --> 44:35.840
about yourself and your responsibilities,

44:35.840 --> 44:40.400
whether that's children, jobs, things of that nature,

44:40.400 --> 44:44.800
and to start fully focusing on the needs

44:44.800 --> 44:46.160
of the other person.

44:46.160 --> 44:46.960
Or cat.

44:46.960 --> 44:50.400
Or cat, or cat in this case.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.160
Oh, clearly, clearly, yeah.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.880
And this is such a great point, Ron,

44:54.880 --> 44:57.600
because if there's ever been a moment

44:57.600 --> 45:00.880
to start taking economical risks

45:00.880 --> 45:04.240
and quitting jobs willy-nilly, this is it.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.760
I mean, this is the moment to do it.

45:05.760 --> 45:06.480
I mean, it's also-

45:06.480 --> 45:07.280
Cats and money.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.000
Jobs and money come and go.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.720
A cat will always be there for you when you need it.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.760
Is this the time for us to get Jackson Galaxy's

45:15.760 --> 45:18.080
My Cat From Hell back in the mix,

45:18.080 --> 45:21.760
but blended with 90 Day Fiancé,

45:21.760 --> 45:26.160
just a very intensive spiritual journey

45:26.160 --> 45:30.000
that you do go on with your cat for three Gregorian months?

45:30.000 --> 45:30.560
I'm gonna say yes.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.440
I like the idea.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.520
Yeah, if Jackson Galaxy's answer was always,

45:33.520 --> 45:35.280
well, maybe you're just not working hard enough

45:35.840 --> 45:36.960
your relationship with the cat.

45:38.000 --> 45:38.400
What's that?

45:38.400 --> 45:40.880
Your cat destroyed all your plants and shit

45:40.880 --> 45:43.280
and all your shoes and bit your daughter?

45:43.280 --> 45:45.280
Well, time to quit your job.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.040
Ron's suggestion that you need to quit your job

45:47.040 --> 45:49.280
to take care of your cat is laughable,

45:49.280 --> 45:50.960
and all us humans are having a great time

45:50.960 --> 45:53.280
chuckling at it, but make no mistake.

45:53.280 --> 45:54.800
If you had a talking cat,

45:55.840 --> 45:58.320
like in the hit film, A Talking Cat,

45:58.320 --> 46:00.480
this is exactly what they would be saying to you.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.040
Like, I am the most important thing in the world.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.960
You have to start quitting your job

46:04.960 --> 46:06.480
and putting in the time.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.840
And also you need to send Nermal to Abu Dhabi.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.120
That's important too.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.880
Ron, I'm curious, where do you land

46:12.880 --> 46:15.680
vis-a-vis kitty kisses though?

46:15.680 --> 46:17.360
Oh, kisses on the forehead?

46:18.160 --> 46:19.040
Leaving lipstick.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.160
Okay, we're talking about two separate things.

46:22.160 --> 46:24.880
I'm saying no to both.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.960
I don't think it's right to kiss Nermal

46:26.960 --> 46:29.360
unless it's a cute little puppers with his sweet Toby.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.640
But a kitty cat kiss, I'm not a fan of.

46:32.640 --> 46:35.200
I think we can all get behind leaving lipstick marks

46:35.200 --> 46:36.640
on the kitty cat.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.280
Like the kitty cat is Ricky Martin

46:39.280 --> 46:41.520
and you are in the music video Livin' La Vida Loca

46:41.520 --> 46:44.400
is not great, right?

46:44.400 --> 46:44.800
Correct.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.200
Is there any will in Ricky?

46:47.200 --> 46:48.320
I hate to disagree,

46:49.840 --> 46:53.440
but I mean, A, one of the best music videos of all time.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.800
So who doesn't want to live that out in cat form?

46:58.800 --> 47:04.160
And B, cats have, you know,

47:04.160 --> 47:07.040
cats have, if you get a kiss back from the cat

47:07.040 --> 47:09.520
who has the scratchiest of tongues,

47:09.520 --> 47:12.480
which are fun, you know, that's just a different experience.

47:14.400 --> 47:14.880
So I just say-

47:14.880 --> 47:16.800
That is assuming you're getting a kiss back.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.320
I would, I have to say though,

47:18.320 --> 47:20.800
if I was a cat and you're going to leave lipstick on me,

47:20.800 --> 47:22.960
that's the one fucking hardest play.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.320
How could you do it there?

47:24.320 --> 47:26.880
I can access almost every other place in my body.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.000
Leave it on my butt.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.680
I can get there easy.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.720
I'm there anyway.

47:30.720 --> 47:32.400
I'm scheduled to be there at 320.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.560
Just leave it on my butt and I'll get to it.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.760
Honestly, it sounds like that roommate is leaving a message.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.000
You know, she possibly is claiming,

47:42.000 --> 47:43.040
I want this cat.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.280
It used to be your cat.

47:45.280 --> 47:48.080
It is now our cat and it will be shortly my cat.

47:49.680 --> 47:53.520
That is step two is that our cat is now step two of the process.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.280
Y'all know the best part of the Livin' La Vida Loca music video?

47:57.280 --> 48:02.000
I got that from a loop in one tab here.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.240
All of the sexual central things that Ricky Martin

48:06.240 --> 48:07.520
is experiencing in this video,

48:07.520 --> 48:11.920
his facial reactions are that of childlike wonderment

48:11.920 --> 48:14.880
as if he has never had these sexual experiences before.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.000
It's almost like Ricky Martin has been sort of wizarded away

48:18.640 --> 48:20.720
into this sort of sexual dimension

48:20.720 --> 48:22.400
and somebody pours wax on his chest.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.840
He's like, whoa, hey.

48:25.520 --> 48:26.720
I'm watching it right now

48:26.720 --> 48:28.880
and he seems like he's thoroughly into this.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.960
I love on YouTube, YouTube is like,

48:32.960 --> 48:34.560
oh, you like Livin' La Vida,

48:34.560 --> 48:37.760
may I recommend Lou Bega's Mambo number five?

48:37.760 --> 48:39.520
Not a bad segue.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.680
They do go hand in hand, truly.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.520
You actually, we actually found out later on

48:43.520 --> 48:45.360
that Lou Bega doesn't even like Mambo.

48:45.360 --> 48:47.280
So that was actually a big moment.

48:47.280 --> 48:50.720
Well, I'm just happy Ricky found what he was looking for.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.080
Absolutely.

48:52.080 --> 48:56.000
I love, huge spokesperson speaking out

48:56.000 --> 48:57.360
for all kinds of stuff.

48:57.360 --> 49:00.240
Very active, fully in support of Ricky.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.800
Muffins and corn.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.640
Yeah, he's a big corn lobbyist.

49:07.680 --> 49:10.560
If you like the low price of petroleum,

49:10.560 --> 49:13.200
you can thank Ricky Martin, power broker.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.840
He's up in DC cleaning it out.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.680
Corn powered car.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.640
Ricky Martin did that.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.080
Corn powered car.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.280
It's all thanks to him.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.240
And I know that.

49:26.240 --> 49:28.480
Corn cob pipes, also Ricky Martin.

49:28.480 --> 49:30.400
That's him, that's him.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.120
Corn pops.

49:31.120 --> 49:33.360
Oh, I didn't know that was Ricky.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.160
The BAMed corn, he was the co-founder.

49:36.160 --> 49:36.960
Yeah.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.600
Kicked him out.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.560
Because they wanted to change it to K

49:40.560 --> 49:42.240
and he said, I think that's going to be confusing.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.400
That's not going to help corn sales at all.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.200
Yeah, he was thinking bigger than that.

49:47.200 --> 49:50.880
Ron, we're all trying to stay busy in our own way

49:50.880 --> 49:51.600
in these times.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.080
What are you up to these days?

49:54.080 --> 49:57.360
Oh, I'm just trying to spend time with my wife.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.280
I got married a few weeks ago.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.800
Congratulations.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.080
Thank you so much.

50:02.080 --> 50:03.280
Enjoy my family.

50:03.280 --> 50:09.680
And I'm also doing a live show Saturday on September 5th

50:09.680 --> 50:12.480
that people can watch from their homes if they want.

50:12.480 --> 50:15.040
Since I can't go on the road safely right now,

50:16.240 --> 50:19.440
I'm going to bring a show or have a live audience of 10 people

50:19.440 --> 50:22.000
that's safely distanced and amassed

50:22.000 --> 50:26.240
and we'll be live streaming it out on YouTube for 24 hours

50:26.240 --> 50:26.880
on the 5th.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.200
So I've been preparing for that

50:29.200 --> 50:34.000
and just working on trying to get them to get us bigger parts

50:34.000 --> 50:35.360
in the next Trolls movie.

50:36.720 --> 50:37.680
I love this.

50:37.680 --> 50:38.160
I love it.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.600
Yeah, we're working together now.

50:39.600 --> 50:40.800
It's collective bargaining.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.360
Oh, you want Ron?

50:43.920 --> 50:46.800
Ron comes packaged with the McElroy brothers.

50:48.800 --> 50:51.680
That special is Awakening, correct?

50:51.680 --> 50:53.040
I don't think you said the name of it.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.000
I did not.

50:54.000 --> 50:54.720
They should know.

50:54.720 --> 50:56.000
It is called Awakening.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.440
They can get tickets at my website, ronfunches.com.

51:01.680 --> 51:05.040
Or if you check any of my socials, Instagram or Twitter,

51:05.600 --> 51:07.520
there's links all the way all around.

51:07.520 --> 51:10.880
And I'm just, you know, I'm working on my own game show as well

51:10.880 --> 51:13.680
on Quibi that's out right now called Nice One.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.640
What's that called?

51:14.640 --> 51:16.080
It's called Nice One.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.920
And it's just about, it's like looking at,

51:17.920 --> 51:18.960
most like my comedy,

51:18.960 --> 51:21.200
looking at the bright side of bad situations.

51:21.200 --> 51:25.200
It's just me and my favorite comedians making fun jokes

51:25.200 --> 51:27.200
and me giving out points.

51:27.200 --> 51:29.920
Now, Ron, I don't have a lot of time to watch TV.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.880
I can maybe spare one Quibi to watch something.

51:32.880 --> 51:34.320
How long is an episode?

51:34.320 --> 51:35.760
It's about a Quibi.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.560
Oh, nice.

51:36.560 --> 51:37.600
Okay, good.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.640
That's a relief.

51:38.640 --> 51:40.240
Ron, I recently saw you on Twitter

51:41.360 --> 51:43.600
telling people who spoke bad about Quibi,

51:43.600 --> 51:45.360
I believe that you would fight them.

51:45.360 --> 51:45.600
Yeah.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.800
Is that true?

51:46.800 --> 51:48.880
I did say that and I stand behind it.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.000
So if anybody listening to this has ever said anything bad

51:54.000 --> 51:56.560
about Quibi and wants to fight Ron Funches,

51:56.560 --> 51:57.920
this is your chance.

51:57.920 --> 52:01.360
Yeah, as long as you have no background in fighting.

52:04.080 --> 52:04.880
That's cheating.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.120
That would be rude if you had a background in it

52:11.120 --> 52:14.320
and are, if you were physically fit.

52:14.320 --> 52:18.720
So if you're neither of those

52:18.720 --> 52:20.960
and you talking trash about Quibi,

52:20.960 --> 52:23.440
then I will fight you.

52:23.440 --> 52:27.920
I feel like anybody who's in any sort of entertainment

52:27.920 --> 52:30.720
that complains about Quibi, the secret subtext,

52:30.720 --> 52:33.680
and I can absolutely put myself in this category is,

52:33.680 --> 52:34.800
why didn't I get a Quibi?

52:36.480 --> 52:37.680
I would love to get a Quibi.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.560
I would love to do a Quibi.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.080
Why didn't nobody ask me to do a Quibi?

52:42.080 --> 52:43.040
I'd do a Quibi.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.800
Come on, help me out.

52:44.800 --> 52:45.520
I agree.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.960
I mean, really, it's just, I feel,

52:47.840 --> 52:49.680
I understand making fun of things.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.320
I love making fun of things and talking trash,

52:52.320 --> 52:56.560
but when it was just like this actual,

52:56.560 --> 52:58.320
like wanting people to fail,

52:58.320 --> 53:02.400
I'm like, not a lot of people hand out shows.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.440
Yeah, absolutely.

53:05.440 --> 53:06.960
If a new place pops up

53:06.960 --> 53:10.080
and they need a whole new slate of material,

53:10.080 --> 53:12.400
I think that's extremely positive

53:12.400 --> 53:14.720
and not a negative by any means.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.880
And listen, as people who have had a show

53:16.880 --> 53:19.120
on a thing that failed, it's not fun.

53:19.120 --> 53:19.680
It's not fun.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.280
It's not great.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.040
It's way better when the thing succeeds

53:23.040 --> 53:24.640
and you get to keep making your show.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.440
Oh, truly.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.240
I would love that.

53:27.920 --> 53:31.040
You know, I'm not putting all the eggs in that basket.

53:33.040 --> 53:34.880
The shows are very short.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.000
That's too small of a basket.

53:38.000 --> 53:38.640
That's right.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.160
Don't be a goofus.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.800
Watch Ron's special September 5th

Oh, it's a true pleasure.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.920
You guys are so much fun to talk to

53:57.920 --> 54:00.880
and very enjoyable and truly,

54:00.880 --> 54:02.640
I don't know if they,

54:02.640 --> 54:04.800
would the movie have been successful?

54:04.800 --> 54:07.840
You know, without the work that you've done?

54:07.840 --> 54:08.560
Who knows?

54:08.560 --> 54:09.840
I'd say yes.

54:09.840 --> 54:12.400
That's a great, probably yes.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.760
At least 98% as successful as it was, I would say.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.000
Well, but you know, you need that 2%.

54:18.640 --> 54:19.280
You need it.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.600
That's what they put in the milk.

54:24.640 --> 54:25.760
Thanks, Ron.

54:25.760 --> 54:26.320
Thank you.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.680
I'm sure it'll be hilarious.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.920
And I'm sure a specific place on YouTube,

54:47.920 --> 54:50.480
not just like, I don't think it's a takeover.

54:50.480 --> 54:53.840
It's not like controlling your horizontal and vertical,

54:53.840 --> 54:54.400
you know what I mean?

54:54.960 --> 54:56.320
Yeah, it's not a takeover.

54:56.320 --> 55:00.640
It's not gonna interrupt the cabbage video you're watching.

55:01.200 --> 55:01.520
Yeah.

55:01.520 --> 55:04.560
About cabbage, because you're boring as fuck.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.080
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters
