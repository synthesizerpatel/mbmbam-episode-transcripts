00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.480 --> 00:47.520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome my brother, my brother and me. We have an exciting

00:48.080 --> 00:53.360
opening plan for you. For the first time in history, we're going to be attempting our first

00:53.360 --> 01:00.320
interactive choose your own opening. We have three different selections on tap for you today.

01:01.120 --> 01:07.920
One is, this is our hundredth Max Fun show. Second is X Games.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.320
That one's mine and it's going to be the best.

01:10.960 --> 01:19.760
Third is Arnani's birthday is today. So we have three options. If you look underneath your chair

01:19.760 --> 01:29.520
or car, look underneath your jogging pants. Don't get in there. Don't get in there in your butt.

01:29.520 --> 01:38.240
You should find a three tiered sort of button knob dial that you can turn to whichever choice

01:38.880 --> 01:45.600
you like. So go ahead and do that now and we'll see how those please be careful. You can also

01:45.600 --> 01:52.640
text. I like number two and number every five five. If you text that to everyone, you know,

01:52.640 --> 01:58.560
then that will I'm sure we're in your phone somewhere. Uh huh. And if not, it'll phone

01:58.560 --> 02:04.240
tree back to us. Happy happy. So I'm looking at the results coming in here. Happy birthday,

02:04.240 --> 02:11.040
Nani. Happy Max Fun birthday. But it looks like the winner is X Games. All right. So here we go.

02:11.040 --> 02:16.480
Well, okay. Welcome, my brother, my brother, me, the X Games of comedy. I'm your host,

02:16.480 --> 02:24.960
Super Spike, Justin McElroy. And I'm your Middle East host, Sean White. I am your baby host. I'm

02:26.160 --> 02:30.960
Tony Hawk is the only one I know, guys. I'm sorry. It's the only one I know. It's the only one.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.160
Get out of here, old man. Get out of here, old man. Me and Sean White are trying to carve up

02:36.160 --> 02:42.000
some snow. Do you guys have any comedy stunts planned for your X Games episode? I was going

02:42.000 --> 02:51.920
to a snowboard off of Bob Newhart's face. I was trying to I was going to try to do a 900 rotation

02:51.920 --> 02:58.560
off of a half pipe. But what that is, is that it rotates towards did what is what he just said

02:58.560 --> 03:02.640
racist. And then now I don't think it's racist. I think it is. And then I think it is. And then I

03:02.640 --> 03:07.200
think it is. And I think it is. And then I land it. It's a slalom. No, it's a slalom. It's a I'm

03:07.200 --> 03:12.720
turning in the air, vacillating between if what I just said was racist or not. So go ahead and do

03:12.720 --> 03:22.480
that. Okay. Hey, gringos. That one I feel like you I feel like you botched that pretty much. No,

03:22.480 --> 03:28.720
wait. Let me try it. No, I didn't do it right. Let me try it. Hey, gringos. I'm going to Harvard.

03:28.720 --> 03:39.120
Oh, wow. You see what that just did there? I just turned it. I turned the perception in back on

03:39.120 --> 03:44.480
itself. I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna try to say the word pussy, but I'm gonna make it last

03:44.480 --> 03:49.680
for a whole minute. Don't stop. Don't give up. I'll tell you what you can give up. Can you like

03:49.680 --> 04:06.480
keep going over me? We're gonna start right now. I keep doing the show over me. Oh, I thought you

04:06.480 --> 04:14.320
wanted to like barbershop quartet. Why would I ever want that? How am I supposed to succeed if

04:14.320 --> 04:21.840
my fucking crew team is acting up? I can't I'm not rowing the comedy boat. I'm trying to do fucking

04:22.800 --> 04:29.200
long form endurance comedy sports and you guys are trying to do short term shit on top of it.

04:29.200 --> 04:34.000
And I'm sticking. I'm trying to train for years. I'm trying to break the record for longest on

04:34.000 --> 04:39.360
screen kiss here. Oh, my record just got stolen by the batch guys. And now I got to take it back.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.640
Can we I know you know what we're gonna talk about the bachelor because I have no other way to do

04:44.640 --> 04:49.760
this. In the latest episode, one of the dates was they went to the Guinness Book of World Records,

04:49.760 --> 04:55.600
which first off cool day. And second off, they made them break the record for longest on screen

04:55.600 --> 05:01.280
kiss, which was like three minutes and 15 seconds. Really? I had to watch the and they didn't cut

05:01.280 --> 05:05.360
away. They did like window and window. So like you could watch it happen the whole time. I watched

05:05.360 --> 05:11.280
two motherfuck ABC made me watch two motherfuckers put their mouths together for three minutes and

05:11.280 --> 05:18.720
16 seconds. And it was the least erotic thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Yeah. Wait,

05:18.720 --> 05:24.560
what held the record before that? I don't know. But it's torture born hostile for I don't know

05:24.560 --> 05:30.480
what it was because it was fucking when you think about like all the all the spit in their mouths

05:30.480 --> 05:34.720
when they started like one and a half minutes in like surely we're almost done because my mouth

05:34.720 --> 05:41.440
has become a vault of spit. And then they look actually halfway through. It's a medical fact

05:41.440 --> 05:47.680
that after you kiss someone for 316 seconds, or three minutes and 16 seconds, you become a match

05:47.680 --> 05:54.640
for organ donors. Oh, God. It was true. It was rough stuff. It looks like the previous record

05:54.640 --> 06:04.960
holder was from a movie called Elena Undone, in which two women kiss for three minutes and and

06:04.960 --> 06:12.560
15 seconds. Yeah. Let me just update my Netflix queue. So as you've certainly guessed right now,

06:12.560 --> 06:19.600
this is an advice show where we comedy and you can give us questions or and give us a questions at

06:19.600 --> 06:27.520
mbnbam at maximum fun.org. We also take questions from the Yahoo News answer service. And we take

06:27.520 --> 06:33.440
those and we make fun of those too. So you never know, kind of grab bag here on the show. So let's

06:33.440 --> 06:39.200
grab a bag. Let's grab a bag and thump this melon. I have a little social media problem.

06:39.680 --> 06:44.320
All of my profile pictures are either years old or non existent. And I don't have any recent

06:44.320 --> 06:49.040
pictures of myself that I really like. I was planning on having someone take a good professional

06:49.040 --> 06:53.520
looking picture of myself and using that on my profile pic of everything. But now I think that

06:53.520 --> 06:58.800
might be a lazy solution. Someone who looks me up on each site would just see the same picture over

06:58.800 --> 07:04.000
and over again. Should I take the effort to make more pictures of various settings or focus my

07:04.000 --> 07:08.720
energy into one really good picture? And that's from out of focus on Facebook. And that's and

07:08.720 --> 07:15.120
that's from a non-existing question in 10 years. Yeah, that that is a really good question. I

07:15.120 --> 07:20.160
think. Is it? It is. It's the best question. It's the best question. Travis, you don't understand

07:20.160 --> 07:26.960
because you you are in the theater. You have you have a built in apparatus for having pictures of

07:26.960 --> 07:33.840
your face on hand up to date 24 sev. Justin, I don't Justin, I don't have that. People don't take

07:34.320 --> 07:40.400
people just don't take pictures of me and Justin. They really don't. They can't find me. Sorry,

07:40.400 --> 07:47.520
paparazzo. But but here's the thing, though. It seems to me like it would be beneficial because

07:47.520 --> 07:52.720
you're building a brand. And if you have the same picture on everything, but it's identifiable.

07:52.720 --> 07:58.160
It's like those people that like signed up in like 1997 for like a really super weird email

07:58.160 --> 08:03.440
address and are still using it. I went easy just to have their own name. And then when someone's

08:03.440 --> 08:09.600
like, I want your email and you're like, it's Chewbacca fan 72. Thank you for considering it.

08:09.600 --> 08:14.000
You for considering people like, oh, man, that's a fucking great email. How'd you land Chewbacca

08:14.000 --> 08:22.560
fan 72? I think it's so unfair to have this conversation with a person in the family, right?

08:22.560 --> 08:28.800
Because you have people have an infinite supply. Why does it sound like you're vomiting when you

08:28.800 --> 08:35.520
say pictures of them and like dope costumes and armor and sword fighting and fire and beautiful

08:35.520 --> 08:40.400
ladies and explosions and shit. It's not me. If you took a picture of me at my job, you know,

08:40.400 --> 08:47.440
it looks like it looks like if I had a toilet or me, I'd be pooping all day. Like hold on. Hold on.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.640
Let me ask you a question real quick. Do you think I work for Cirque du Soleil? Yeah, I think you're

08:52.640 --> 09:01.520
one of those those bendy orgy loving frogs. That's what I think. But see, in the theater,

09:01.520 --> 09:06.560
we do have these things called headshots. And it basically is the idea of one picture

09:06.560 --> 09:13.120
that you use for everything. But that but we are constant like Griffin and I, we are in a job where

09:13.840 --> 09:20.640
if you try to like you do have to kind of treat yourself like an entity, like a brand that you

09:20.640 --> 09:26.160
are selling. But also the moment you are actually doing that, you're the pits. You're the worst.

09:26.160 --> 09:32.320
Yeah. Right. So you gotta pretend you're stumbling into a great picture. You need to get and promote

09:32.320 --> 09:38.720
headshots, but with a level of discretion that is not required in theater. In fact, it's kind of

09:38.720 --> 09:43.920
frowned upon, I would say. Right. So I think that there's a market for this for us to capitalize.

09:43.920 --> 09:52.000
Whatever happened to like, whatever happened to the industry of like Ma and Pa photo companies,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.720
where you like go and you get their homecoming pictures? Does that still happen? Yeah, what's

09:56.720 --> 10:04.400
going on here? I guess. Really? Johnson's is still going strong. It's a simpler time. Let me suggest

10:04.400 --> 10:11.600
this. Next time you're hanging out with a bunch of friends, say, hold on, guys, I've got one other

10:11.600 --> 10:18.240
great friend I want to invite. His name is a popular photographer, Ricky Phillips. And then

10:18.240 --> 10:25.040
Ricky Phillips shows up and he's like, discreetly taking headshots of you with friends. So it looks

10:25.040 --> 10:32.080
like you were just hanging out cash. But really, he brings lighting. He snaps a great, great picture.

10:32.080 --> 10:37.440
He is gonna need to thread a needle in order for this to be as discreet as we need it to be.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.080
It's gonna, he's gonna have to roll up and be like, yo, what up, Michael? Hey, buddy. Haven't

10:42.080 --> 10:49.760
seen you since the funeral. Let's set up these lighting cones. So my photosynthesis will kick

10:49.760 --> 10:59.440
off because that's how I eat. I have a disease. Photosynthesis. I got a camera. Justin, Justin

10:59.440 --> 11:06.800
got me a camera for Jesus' birthday. And like, I bring it around to stuff now in Austin. Like

11:06.800 --> 11:12.800
anytime we have events, I'll bring it around and snap some great JPEGs of people's faces.

11:12.800 --> 11:17.440
But I can't like hand it off to somebody and be like, hey, can you hold this? And man, if you

11:17.440 --> 11:23.360
wanted to snap a JPEG of the G-Man, I would not hate it. You know, I would not hate you for it.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.360
Just make sure, you know- It seems to me like this is like quantum physics. Like as soon as

11:27.360 --> 11:33.280
it becomes observed, it's pointless. Well, right. You just gotta leave the camera on the ground

11:33.280 --> 11:39.200
and like just walk away from it. And then just walk away. My wife has seen me in the worst,

11:39.920 --> 11:46.560
like most compromising positions of my life. But if we are at a public event and I'm taking

11:46.560 --> 11:52.320
pictures of like her and people in the event, there is no shame greater than looking her in

11:52.320 --> 11:58.480
the eyes and saying, hey, can you take the camera for a while so I can be in some of the pictures?

11:58.480 --> 12:06.080
Like people know that I was here too. I'm 32 goddamn years old. That can't be that way. That's

12:06.080 --> 12:13.040
why there's no videos. If you were a dad born before 1980, there's no video of you. You probably

12:13.040 --> 12:17.360
don't exist. Right. You're just a voice in the background saying, no, don't eat that.

12:18.080 --> 12:22.400
Don't. And then what sucks the most is when you take all these great JPEGs of people's

12:22.400 --> 12:27.280
beautiful faces. And we're talking like three megabyte files. We're talking big. We're talking

12:27.280 --> 12:32.400
potential billboards. And then they pull out through like Nokia 9700. And they're like,

12:32.400 --> 12:36.880
let me snap you now. And it's like, oh, fucking great. Cause I've always wanted a picture of me.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.720
That was exactly three pixels. Just a two tan pixels on top of a brown. That looks like something

12:42.720 --> 12:46.960
you'd make on Mario paint. That's fantastic. Thank you. You're worrying about your aperture

12:46.960 --> 12:51.280
and your shutter speed. Do you even know about the rule of thirds? And they're just like,

12:51.280 --> 12:55.840
oh, I forgot to turn on the flash. Yeah. It's like, oh, hold on. I've got a snake game. I

12:55.840 --> 13:03.120
need to finish up. Have you been snapping a lot of JPEGs? Are you putting those on Facebook?

13:03.120 --> 13:06.800
I'm putting them on the book. Yeah. And people love them. And like there there's a thrill that

13:06.800 --> 13:12.560
goes along with like uploading a bunch of JPEGs and then just like bouncing for the day. Maybe

13:12.560 --> 13:16.640
you don't use the internet. Maybe you get some farming done and then you come back and there's

13:16.640 --> 13:21.520
like 40 notifications of people. Like I fucking love the way I look in this picture. It's like,

13:21.520 --> 13:27.920
yeah, it's because you look great. And this photo is great. Now where's, oh, where let me go. Let

13:27.920 --> 13:34.560
me lose. Let me get me on the book. Get me into my zone. My Facebook profile picture is like me

13:35.280 --> 13:41.120
in like a senior in high school, like a shitty beard. And I probably still have braces.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.960
I don't know. I don't know. Like it's not, I don't know how to use my picture at all.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.640
I'm looking at your picture. Well, let me ask you that. I think we've talked before about like,

13:50.640 --> 13:54.320
what makes a good Facebook picture? What makes a good Twitter profile picture?

13:56.080 --> 13:58.480
I think it's good if you have like a little,

13:59.440 --> 14:03.680
like half of a word balloon in the picture. So it looks like you're saying the thing that

14:03.680 --> 14:09.920
you're tweeting. That's like that. It's got to be, it's got to represent who you are. Like

14:09.920 --> 14:14.880
it's got, for me, it's gotta be, it's gotta be funny. Like maybe I'm wearing like a loud shirt

14:14.880 --> 14:21.680
and I'm sort of shrugging like, I don't know. I like it when it looks like when it's in a small

14:21.680 --> 14:26.000
version, like it's new to me, but then you click on it and it's just like a really close up of

14:26.000 --> 14:30.640
your nose or something. Oh, that's how they get you. That's how YouTube, that's how YouTube gets

14:30.640 --> 14:35.840
you. That's how you got to expand your YouTube profile is like a split second clip of like

14:35.840 --> 14:40.000
something that looks like a butt, but then they click it and they watch it and it's your elbows

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
and you, they got you. They got your view. That's how, that's how you get them on Facebook. That's

14:44.000 --> 14:48.240
how you expand your profile. That's how Brento Flores got all his views. He just puts lots of

14:48.240 --> 14:54.240
pictures of his elbows up there. You put your elbows on there and maybe your elbows have nipples.

14:54.240 --> 14:59.120
Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Maybe you've glued nipples onto your elbows. Now that may not

14:59.120 --> 15:04.560
work so well on Facebook when like Yunani is scrolling around and then she sees your name

15:04.560 --> 15:09.520
next to a profile picture that looks like boobs or a butt. And then she's like, I don't, why is

15:09.520 --> 15:16.000
this, she'll click it though. It's human nature. It's biology. It's physiology. You got to know

15:16.000 --> 15:21.520
what's up with that butt. I will take pictures of anyone for, if you need, if you need your face

15:22.640 --> 15:26.800
on, if you need a new face picture, then I will get that for you. If you want to tasteful. I tried

15:26.800 --> 15:33.600
it at holidays when Griffin first got his camera. I got some great JPEGs of you. They're not super

15:33.600 --> 15:38.400
in focus though. And that's really important. You dick. I don't want to be a monster. I don't want

15:38.400 --> 15:43.520
to be that guy. There's a really great picture of you where you look like Jamie Lee Curtis from

15:43.520 --> 15:48.720
that scene in true lies. That was a good picture. I don't know how you did that with lighting and

15:48.720 --> 15:54.960
smoke and stuff, but it looked great. Hey, do you have a Yahoo question answer? This Yahoo answer

15:54.960 --> 15:59.440
was sent in by Layla. Oh, thank you, Layla. It's by Yahoo answers user Farrah who asks,

16:00.240 --> 16:04.080
should I be worried if my girlfriend posted a twerking video on Facebook?

16:04.080 --> 16:09.920
Okay. My girlfriend and her best friend, they both posted a twerking video on Facebook and

16:09.920 --> 16:15.360
agreed to delete it after one hour. She used to be the girl who cheated and never settled down.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.320
Now since she's with me, she changed and settled down, but yet it's only been around three months

16:22.320 --> 16:32.240
together. She can go back anytime. Wow. Should I tell her not to do it or should I just let her?

16:32.240 --> 16:39.200
Wow. That was a fucking rough one, guys. I am going to very quickly-

16:39.200 --> 16:41.840
Don't Google twerking. No, don't. You'll betray the company.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.360
I'll just tell you what it is. Travis? What is it?

16:46.080 --> 16:58.800
Okay. You know when she pops the booty and then she does a booty shake and in your head,

16:58.800 --> 17:03.360
all you hear is booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty like in the hit song?

17:03.360 --> 17:08.160
Uh-huh. That is twerking and it shakes really

17:08.160 --> 17:15.920
faster. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how anybody does that,

17:15.920 --> 17:17.920
but that's what twerking is. Are you sure?

17:18.640 --> 17:23.600
Yeah. It's that fast butt shake where you're squatting down on the ground and you're twerking

17:23.600 --> 17:34.720
it. I've not heard a more incongruous word to dance action, I think, in my life. When you hear

17:34.720 --> 17:38.000
crumping, you think, well, that just sounds like somebody violently flailing. I'm like,

17:38.000 --> 17:39.920
yep, that's pretty much it. Nailed it.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.640
Twerking it, it sounds like a... I don't know. It sounds like a fun... It sounds like it could be

17:44.640 --> 17:53.200
like a kid's thing, like the jerk, but for kids. I put a twerking gif in the Skype chat,

17:53.200 --> 17:56.960
if you guys want to just check that out. It sounds like a tiny adjustment you make

17:56.960 --> 18:03.360
to some kind of bubble gum machine. Why would you put this in front of me?

18:04.640 --> 18:06.640
You guys have a visual reference to what twerking is.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.480
I thought you wanted it. Oh, goodness. Oh, goodness.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.440
I don't know how this woman is doing this. It's mesmerizing.

18:13.440 --> 18:18.000
Yeah. I don't know how she's managing to- It's got to be wires, maybe pneumatics.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.120
Yeah. This is like seeing the Matrix for the first time, but each butt shake is twerking

18:23.120 --> 18:29.040
independently of the other. It's amazing. This gif was actually made by the Wachowski brothers.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.080
They look like they're having a really terrible argument with each other.

18:33.120 --> 18:38.800
No, I like Bush. No, I like Kerry. We are on opposite sides of the political spectrum,

18:38.800 --> 18:40.160
and also a butt crack. I have to close it.

18:40.160 --> 18:45.840
Oh, I barely pulled myself away from it. I know. Let's... Oh, my God.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.920
The podcast is canceled. It hypnotized me, and now I'm going to kill

18:49.920 --> 18:56.640
the president. It Manchurian-candidated me. This twerking butt Manchurian-candidated me,

18:56.640 --> 19:01.520
and I did not sign up for this when I Google image search twerking.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.640
But call it rump bumping. Call it-

19:06.640 --> 19:08.000
Rump bumping?

19:10.000 --> 19:15.440
Call it that jiggling or something, like the jiggle jig or something like that,

19:15.440 --> 19:18.720
like something that is more representative.

19:18.720 --> 19:24.720
I mean, you're talking about hip hop dance lingo that has a word for when you

19:27.680 --> 19:30.240
finish on girl's back and then stick a sheet to it.

19:30.240 --> 19:38.800
No, that's... No, one 14-year-old rapper saying that word in one of his songs does not make it

19:38.800 --> 19:41.600
a cultural thing. Touchstone?

19:42.400 --> 19:46.000
No. I guess it's not actually technically a dance move either.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.960
No, God, I hope not. It would require... That would require some

19:51.600 --> 19:54.800
pretty crazy muscle control in order to do that rhythmically.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.560
Yeah, or just really amazing timing. I've got to get to the club now.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.280
Oh, man. I was going to say that funny thing you said, but then you said it, so I was like,

20:05.280 --> 20:07.840
well, this one goes to Trav. Thank you.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.080
Game, set, match. Game, set, match.

20:10.080 --> 20:17.120
Hey, man, where's Tony? Oh, his boss made him twerk late.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.920
Everybody's twerking for the win.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.320
You know what my favorite Fred Savage sitcom was twerking?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.960
That one was a little on the nose.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.680
What? Let me try again.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.440
Okay. I'm trying again.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.840
You don't have to be crazy to twerk here, but it helps.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.760
Okay, that's not bad.

20:42.960 --> 20:49.440
What's up with this guy, though, whose girlfriend posted a twerking video on Facebook?

20:52.320 --> 20:59.360
It's hard for us to throw any shade at this person because we just talked about that.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.800
We just talked about how you had to expand your social media profile,

21:02.800 --> 21:05.280
any which way, any which way, but loose.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.360
And there's nothing loose about twerking it.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.600
Now you got to keep it tight.

21:10.400 --> 21:14.400
And it's so hard too because you, and I can sympathize with this,

21:14.400 --> 21:21.120
you spend so much time honing this skill of twerking and you want to share it.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.880
You don't want to keep your light under a bushel.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.440
You want to show everybody how you do.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.120
You want to show them how you twerk.

21:29.120 --> 21:33.680
And I don't think it's right as a boyfriend to sort of limit your art that way.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.200
Yeah, that's true. That's a good point.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.680
Especially when she's only putting it up for an hour.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.720
Just an hour.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.680
Now that-

21:39.680 --> 21:46.080
In the great span of the universe, she's only going to be visibly twerking for a blink of an eye.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.520
That is an excellent point, Travis.

21:47.520 --> 21:53.440
I do, however, why is she putting it up for an hour?

21:53.440 --> 21:57.120
This is what I, for a limited engagement in select theaters.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.360
Select theaters.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.240
You know, I really-

22:00.240 --> 22:02.640
Sunday's Sunday for one hour only.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.200
I really wanted to watch Farrah's girlfriend twerking on Facebook,

22:05.200 --> 22:08.160
but it didn't come to my city, which is a real shame.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.520
I hear it's got a real, it's getting, picking up a lot of Oscar buzz.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.640
I got the, I got the time zones maxed up.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.480
I thought it was at four Eastern, but it was at four standard and I missed it.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.280
Four standard.

22:19.280 --> 22:24.000
Now is that a different time zone than Eastern in standard time?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.440
Central, I meant to say central.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.720
Fuck. Damn it.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.280
Podcast is canceled.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.000
Nice job, podcast.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.680
Now, Justin, you've been quiet for a while.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.600
I'm going to guess you've been Googling either the word twerking

22:37.600 --> 22:43.680
or maybe things with work in the titles that you can say twerk inside of.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.200
No, no.

22:45.200 --> 22:45.920
No?

22:45.920 --> 22:46.640
No.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.320
What were you going to say, Justin?

22:48.320 --> 22:55.040
I just want to say twerking not to fuck, that's no way to make a living, right?

22:55.040 --> 22:55.520
Okay.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.920
This girl should look into Snapchat.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.400
What's that?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.760
That's a new thing that teens are doing.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.480
I don't-

23:04.480 --> 23:11.280
Where it's a self-destructing photo or short clip.

23:11.280 --> 23:16.560
It's chat that you do with your friends, but the picture doesn't remain.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.240
Oh, thank God.

23:18.240 --> 23:24.720
A lot of people are saying, a lot of folks are saying, hey, this is May for sexting.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.040
Yeah.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.800
There is literally no other purpose for this.

23:28.800 --> 23:33.440
They are saying that only because that is exactly right and it's the only thing it's

23:33.440 --> 23:34.400
designed for.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.280
Yeah, it's a good thing.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.960
Is it made out of special vampire glass that you also can't take a picture of the temporary

23:40.960 --> 23:41.840
picture?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.600
Fucking get it together, people.

23:43.600 --> 23:48.640
I figured it out in 35 seconds and teens, this is all they think about.

23:48.640 --> 23:52.960
All the teens think about is way to see dicks and boobs and butts and vaginas.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.640
They will figure it out in four seconds.

23:54.640 --> 24:00.720
Is it possible that Snapchat was created for pirate maps?

24:01.760 --> 24:02.480
Wait a minute.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.960
You don't want everyone to be able to find your hidden gold.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.480
You want it to self-destruct.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.680
You just want your friend Brenda to be able to find-

24:13.680 --> 24:15.280
Brenda the pirate.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.080
Your booty.

24:16.080 --> 24:16.560
This could be-

24:17.920 --> 24:20.640
I mean, either way, you're helping somebody find your booty.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.760
I mean, no matter what you're using Snapchat for, it's booty-centric.

24:23.760 --> 24:30.000
National Treasure 3, Legend of Curly's Gold wherein Curly is the nickname for Benjamin

24:30.000 --> 24:32.080
Franklin and then Nick Cage-

24:32.080 --> 24:34.080
Because he had a hooked wiener.

24:34.080 --> 24:39.280
Right, like a pigtail and then Nick Cage-

24:39.280 --> 24:40.720
Keep turning, I'm not in.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.480
Nicholas Cage-

24:44.480 --> 24:47.600
Sit and spin, please, or it's very painful.

24:47.600 --> 24:55.040
Nick Cage pours lemon juice and heats up an old parchment of Ben Franklin's and very quickly

24:55.040 --> 24:58.960
an animated GIF of Ben Franklin twerking it appears and then disappears.

24:58.960 --> 25:02.960
Inside of that twerking, it was Morse code.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.240
What does it say?

25:04.240 --> 25:05.280
The Constitution.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.120
The end.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.440
Then we learned that our greatest gift is freedom.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.280
The freedom to twerk it as we choose, as we like.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.720
Nick Cage-

25:16.720 --> 25:22.640
When Ben Franklin opens a bottle of wine, that's pretty much the end of the party.

25:23.440 --> 25:28.640
You know once he gets to that point and he's corkscrewing it, then it's time for everybody

25:28.640 --> 25:29.200
to go home.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.120
Oh, you're talking about with his dick still.

25:31.120 --> 25:31.920
With his dick.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.640
I already forgot the fiction we established.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.400
Well, let's rebuild the fiction.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.280
Okay, sorry.

25:37.280 --> 25:37.760
That's it.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.160
The thing about wine.

25:40.160 --> 25:40.400
Okay.

25:40.400 --> 25:45.680
Yeah, I said, I thought earlier, but I didn't want to step on your toes there when you were

25:45.680 --> 25:50.320
saying something not as funny as opening a wine bottle with his dick.

25:50.320 --> 25:50.560
I see.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.680
So it's a new kind of competitive collaboration.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.960
It's like American Gladiators now.

25:59.760 --> 26:06.400
We're working together, but we're working against the American Gladiators of-

26:06.400 --> 26:07.360
Our listeners.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.200
We're actively working against our listeners.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.960
We're trying to destroy them from the inside out.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.680
Let's do another question.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.920
Much like Ben Franklin having sex with a woman.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.120
Okay.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.240
Okay.

26:19.040 --> 26:19.520
All right now.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.480
That would be rough though.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.560
It would be pretty brutal.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.680
But God, think about how smart he'd be after.

26:26.240 --> 26:26.640
Why?

26:26.640 --> 26:31.440
He would like be having sex with you and then he'd whisper in your ear like, quad vocals.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.440
And you'd be like, oh my God, DaVinci coded.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.520
He would drop a, what are those things called?

26:39.520 --> 26:41.440
They're like good advice.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.240
What are they called?

26:42.240 --> 26:43.600
It's got like a whole book of them.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.280
Twerk?

26:45.280 --> 26:46.080
Poor Richards.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.360
The poor Richards Almanac.

26:47.360 --> 26:50.960
He would like lean in and be like, it's super good to get

26:51.600 --> 26:53.840
boned by a corkscrew penis.

26:53.840 --> 26:57.120
And then you'd be like, I didn't even think about it that way, but that's-

26:57.120 --> 27:00.240
So poor Richards would help them forget about his poor dick.

27:00.240 --> 27:00.480
Right.

27:00.480 --> 27:01.360
That's what you're saying.

27:02.080 --> 27:02.960
He's awesome dick.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.160
No, cause like poor-

27:06.160 --> 27:08.000
Next question.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.840
I like to stay current and I spend a lot of free time getting up on the latest in politics,

27:13.840 --> 27:17.040
movies, music, viral videos, et cetera.

27:17.040 --> 27:22.000
So when a friend of mine sends me a music video or a clip of some dumb shit Bill O'Reilly said,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.160
chances are I've already heard about it.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.720
How can I tell them that without sounding like a pretentious douche?

27:27.280 --> 27:28.240
Impossible.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.040
Impossible.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.360
That's from 2hip in Texas.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.680
Yes. The answer is you cannot.

27:33.680 --> 27:33.920
Nope.

27:35.040 --> 27:35.360
Nope.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.840
Here's the skill you need to learn.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.640
Pretending.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.280
Let me give you it.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.720
Let me give you it one step deeper.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.480
Cause everybody, if you exist on the internet and the very fact that you're

27:44.480 --> 27:46.640
listening to this podcast suggests that you do.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.000
Everybody knows everything about the pop culture.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.440
Like everybody already knows everything and that person who's even telling you that shit,

27:55.440 --> 27:57.760
they even know that you know about it already.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.080
It's like an established social courtesy.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.120
It's like a handshake.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.840
It's like, I'm going to tell you this thing you already know and I'm going to see whether,

28:03.840 --> 28:06.560
how good you do at pretending that you don't know about it.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.400
Or here's, here's the solution.

28:08.400 --> 28:08.880
What's that?

28:09.600 --> 28:10.880
It's the agreement.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.800
When they're like, check out this awesome video.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.160
You go, I know, right?

28:14.160 --> 28:14.960
It's awesome.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.040
Like you don't have to go.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.320
Oh, I've seen it.

28:18.320 --> 28:24.160
I'm really happy for internet because I feel like if I didn't have internet,

28:24.160 --> 28:30.400
I would be hurdling towards just sort of like old age obscurity, like not knowing what's going on.

28:30.400 --> 28:35.200
But I feel like I have this tool now where I'm just like, in like no time in history before,

28:35.200 --> 28:37.920
I'm just like clinging to the side of the youth comment.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.520
Like I, you cannot shake me.

28:39.520 --> 28:39.920
You are.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.520
I will continue to know what's going on.

28:41.520 --> 28:41.840
You are.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.120
I will not become relevant.

28:43.120 --> 28:48.880
You are a koala bear clinging to the eucalyptus tree of youth.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.400
Yes.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.960
You cannot get the eucalyptus tree.

28:52.960 --> 28:53.600
That's me.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.480
I'm just clinging to the side with my stubby little claws.

28:56.480 --> 29:01.040
Let me give you one word that will fix your whole problem, 2hip.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.080
Here's the one rude response.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.480
You ready?

29:03.520 --> 29:04.240
Classic.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.240
This means two things.

29:06.880 --> 29:15.120
One, this video you show me is new and it will go down in my classic archive of classic comedy bits.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.000
To you, it means classic.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.040
One I've seen many times, but I'm happy you're reminded of.

29:21.040 --> 29:25.760
You have just been honest and lied with one word.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.960
Classic.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.720
May I just counter-argument?

29:29.440 --> 29:33.680
That is actually the douchiest thing you could possibly say.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.720
Classic.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.560
Oh, classic bit.

29:36.560 --> 29:37.200
Oh, classic.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.880
That is classic internet right there.

29:38.880 --> 29:39.680
Gangnam style?

29:39.680 --> 29:41.040
That is quintessential.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.360
Gotta have Gangnam style.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.720
Okay, first off, 2013, can we stop with douche?

29:47.520 --> 29:48.480
Can we let it go?

29:49.600 --> 29:54.000
You know, in the film Premium Rush, Detective Monday,

29:54.000 --> 29:59.680
when he's chasing Wiley, the Joseph Gordon-Levitt character on the bike.

29:59.680 --> 30:00.400
I am gonna die.

30:00.400 --> 30:05.120
He says, I can't believe you can just say douche on TV anymore.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.360
I think that's really offensive.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.400
Kids could be listening.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.440
I was watching the movie and of course rooting against his character

30:11.440 --> 30:13.520
because he's trying to get the envelope from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.400
I'm gonna be dead.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.680
But I was thinking that's true.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.720
We should let douche go.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.560
I think we're done with douche right now.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.680
I think douche has gone around and eaten its own tail and now-

30:25.680 --> 30:26.800
Oh, gross!

30:26.800 --> 30:27.120
Fuck!

30:32.880 --> 30:38.880
Can we instead, can we substitute for douche, can we just say Premium Rush instead?

30:39.600 --> 30:40.640
Yeah, oh god.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.040
This guy's a real fucking Premium Rush,

30:43.040 --> 30:45.200
pretending that he hasn't seen Gangnam style.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.920
Okay, but there is a point though, as you pointed out with Gangnam style,

30:51.920 --> 30:54.560
where it's like when your friend goes, oh my god, have you seen this video?

30:54.560 --> 30:56.400
It's of a baby panda sneezing.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.520
Where you can go, yes, of course I've seen it.

30:59.520 --> 31:03.680
That was the first video on the internet, you fucking Premium Rush.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.520
What does that do though?

31:05.520 --> 31:07.120
This is what I'm saying to you.

31:07.120 --> 31:10.000
Telling the truth in that situation gets you nothing.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.760
No, I disagree because here's what you're doing.

31:13.760 --> 31:17.360
You're saving that same friend from going around to all of his other friends

31:17.360 --> 31:19.360
and being like, check out this awesome video I found.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.360
So this music video is called Gangnam style.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.640
This is exactly my point.

31:22.640 --> 31:26.080
People always try to say this when they're talking about correcting people.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.680
Like, well, if I correct them, then they won't do it.

31:29.680 --> 31:34.560
Not true, not true because they are going to resent you

31:34.560 --> 31:36.400
for being the one that corrects them.

31:36.400 --> 31:40.000
If you don't correct them, they'll resent the next person.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
You get to maintain your relationship.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.040
You can create a safe space for them to be wrong in, is what I'm saying.

31:47.040 --> 31:52.480
If one of my friends came in and was like, hey, have you seen this movie, The Godfather?

31:52.480 --> 31:53.440
I just checked it out.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.240
It's pretty good.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.520
I think you should watch it.

31:55.520 --> 31:59.440
It's a little indie film from, I believe, the 60s.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.640
Then I want to be able to tell that.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.040
It's also possible your friend's been in a coma for 30 years.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.840
I want to be able to tell that friend like, hey, bud.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.360
Hey, Awakenings.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.400
Hey, bud.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.680
You know you're my bud, right?

32:10.240 --> 32:13.520
But that's what you just said was so whack.

32:13.520 --> 32:19.120
And if you say that in front of people that don't love you like I love you,

32:19.120 --> 32:24.080
then you're going to get in a spot of trouble.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.000
Have you guys seen this Premium Rush movie?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.680
Hey, friendo.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.560
Friendo, you need to lock that up, okay?

32:31.440 --> 32:33.040
I love you like a brother.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.240
There are people out there who don't.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.760
They're rooting against you.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.200
Everyone wants you to fail.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.520
I'm in your corner, Awakenings.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.240
Awakenings, I want to teach you about culture as it is today.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.880
That's the hardest part.

32:46.880 --> 32:52.160
That's the least believable part about watching Homeland is this cat.

32:52.720 --> 32:58.400
The lead cat has been in prison for eight years and then gets back in 2012.

32:59.360 --> 33:06.080
The idea that anyone could be separated from this culture for eight years

33:06.080 --> 33:11.600
and then live for more than a week after is insane to me.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.960
You basically become the old guy from Shawshank Redemption when that happens.

33:17.840 --> 33:21.840
Yeah, you work at the grocery store, but you still have to ask to use the bathroom.

33:21.840 --> 33:25.600
At one point he says, have you seen this video on YouTube?

33:25.600 --> 33:29.840
And I'm like, oh my God, you would never be able to catch up.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.400
You would just sit in front of the computer.

33:32.400 --> 33:36.400
I mean, I do that every, it is a four hour job every day.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.760
Don't tell my boss to keep up with internet culture.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.560
You know, this guy's been out for eight years.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.600
What's hot right now, Juice?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.240
In the internet?

33:46.240 --> 33:47.280
Yeah, in the youth culture.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.360
No, in the prison culture.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.040
This is going to surprise you.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.280
Twerking.

33:53.280 --> 33:53.600
Okay.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.800
Yeah, I'm getting into it lately.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.800
Past 20 minutes.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.960
So it seems to be going pretty good.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.680
I'm afraid I'll hurt my butt if I try it.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.200
Hey, you know what?

34:05.200 --> 34:08.640
If you really want to hurt your butt, I got a great place to head.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.040
It's ExtremeRestraints.com.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.440
It's an adult super site for all kinds of-

34:13.440 --> 34:16.560
We didn't put in that transition in the money zone, you dick hole.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.160
Well, like he can put it in.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.520
I don't need to say money zone.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.720
Speaking of, he can put it in.

34:20.720 --> 34:43.040
As I said, ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult super store for every hole.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.160
Every hole in your family is going to get serviced.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.280
I don't mind.

34:47.280 --> 34:52.960
There are several holes in my family that I would prefer to remain vacuous.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.720
No, your body family.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.120
Like my body is a family of hole.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.640
You know, brother butthole.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.480
Mother butthole.

35:02.160 --> 35:02.960
Father taint.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.760
My body is a family of holes.

35:05.760 --> 35:10.800
Father taint sounds like the worst character from like Rudolph's shiny new year.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.200
I am father taint.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.280
I welcome in the new baby taint.

35:18.640 --> 35:22.320
You must rescue father taint or there will never be another Kwanzaa.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.720
This is all awful.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.320
Trinity 10 speed vibrating egg.

35:28.320 --> 35:34.080
I love my vibrating egg that I have currently, but doesn't offer me enough specificity.

35:34.080 --> 35:34.560
Jesus.

35:35.120 --> 35:40.000
Just head to remote sex toys and you can get the Trinity 10 speed vibrating egg and looks

35:40.000 --> 35:43.920
like that retails for 78 bucks and you're going to be able to pick it up for 39.95.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.160
That is fucking savings and a half.

35:46.160 --> 35:52.240
With that savings, you can go and you can buy like 10 dozen real eggs and then cook

35:52.240 --> 35:53.760
a big dinner for your family.

35:54.320 --> 35:54.960
An egg dinner.

35:54.960 --> 36:00.960
Now, so here's another straight from Extreme Restraints recommended product.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.280
The ball tugging stroker.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.160
Okay, hit me.

36:06.160 --> 36:06.880
Okay.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.960
I mean, do we really need the explanation?

36:08.960 --> 36:13.280
It's all it's literally all of its functions are eponymous.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.600
Every word there just says it is what they do.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.360
It tugs balls while you stroke.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.800
It's the ball tugging stroker.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.960
ExtremeRestraints.com.

36:22.960 --> 36:30.640
You're going to be able to get 20% off any of these different penetrators that you buy.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.280
Holy shit.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.280
It looks like a penis exoskeleton.

36:34.000 --> 36:34.480
Right?

36:34.480 --> 36:34.800
Sure.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.000
It's so awesome looking.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.360
It's like a sweet Voltron.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.680
Just do one day without you saying that out loud.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.720
It's like an exoskeleton for your penis within like a special thing that goes around your balls

36:44.720 --> 36:47.280
so that as you stroke it, it tugs on your balls.

36:47.280 --> 36:53.120
When your penis has to do battle with a xenomorph, the best option is ExtremeRestraints.com.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.880
Do you need a penis carapace?

36:54.880 --> 36:55.440
Here you go.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.280
Okay, so I just we haven't actually talked about this.

37:01.280 --> 37:03.440
I joined a intramural softball league.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.320
Can I wear that in sports equipment?

37:06.320 --> 37:08.480
I think you're fine.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.040
Phenomenal.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.480
Yes, also as a great way to intimidate your competitors.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.600
Yeah, especially if you have it out.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.480
Tuck it out a little bit.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.000
I'm not going to be able to defeat that penis.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.480
So coupon code MIDDLIST, 20% off is what you're going to save.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.400
Head to the website ExtremeRestraints.com.

37:26.400 --> 37:32.960
They are the biggest supporters of our program and maybe it's time to spice things up a little

37:32.960 --> 37:33.120
bit.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.800
You know, Valentine's Day is coming up soon.

37:34.800 --> 37:35.520
That is true.

37:35.520 --> 37:41.360
And what better gift, what says romance like a cup for her nipple?

37:42.240 --> 37:45.360
Now at this point, we've done, let me check.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.640
Yes, we've done 10,000 Extreme Restraints commercials.

37:48.640 --> 37:52.640
So I assume that all of you have spent millions and millions of dollars there.

37:52.640 --> 37:57.360
So it's also important that you go back and review all the products that you've purchased.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.840
Give it a nice positive review and tell them MBMBAM sent you.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.760
Yeah, that would be good too.

38:03.760 --> 38:07.280
My best friend and I have been friends with benefits for almost two years now.

38:08.080 --> 38:11.600
A couple of months ago when I got my apartment, he immediately moved in with me.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.760
Even before then, we hung out literally every day playing games and watching movies and

38:15.760 --> 38:19.120
snuggling to the point where it became hard to hang out with other people since I'm kind

38:19.120 --> 38:20.400
of his only friend.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.760
He pretty much treats me like a girlfriend, but insists he doesn't feel love.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.560
What do I do to make him love me?

38:26.560 --> 38:27.520
What?

38:29.520 --> 38:30.080
Listen to me.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.080
Listen to me.

38:32.080 --> 38:36.080
Listen to me once out of the FWB zone.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.080
Listen.

38:38.080 --> 38:44.080
You deserve better than this.

38:44.080 --> 38:48.080
You have made this very easy for this person.

38:48.080 --> 38:54.080
Listen, we all have done this so I'm not beating up on you, but you deserve better than this.

38:54.080 --> 38:58.080
You aren't going to make this person love you.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.080
You are going to-

39:00.080 --> 39:02.080
And you shouldn't even try.

39:02.080 --> 39:06.080
Because he sounds like the biggest premium rush ever.

39:06.080 --> 39:10.080
He is a big premium rush and I know you're going to live with him, that's fine.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.080
You know, you guys be friends.

39:12.080 --> 39:18.080
But listen, something about cow and milk, you know?

39:18.080 --> 39:20.080
I forget it.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.080
There's something about it, there's a saying about it.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.080
You should look on Urban Dictionary for what it says about cows and milk.

39:26.080 --> 39:34.080
You are providing this person with every function of a girlfriend.

39:34.080 --> 39:38.080
Well not only that, but you're also providing him, it sounds like, with shelter.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.080
Well, no, I mean-

39:40.080 --> 39:42.080
With food.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.080
He's living with you as well.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.080
And he doesn't have any other friends.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.080
Oh my god, listen to me.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.080
Listen.

39:50.080 --> 39:54.080
Listen, the snuggle train and the sexing train.

39:54.080 --> 39:58.080
That train just pulled into the station everybody off.

39:58.080 --> 40:04.080
It's time for him to fly on his own little bird out of the nest.

40:04.080 --> 40:08.080
Now can I just really quick, why would a bird ride on a train?

40:08.080 --> 40:12.080
Because the birds, it's a long distance, it gets tired.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.080
This is a train for birds?

40:14.080 --> 40:16.080
This is the best thing I've ever heard in my life.

40:16.080 --> 40:20.080
What if you're the only human being on that train and you're like, oh fuck.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.080
It's a bird train.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.080
God damn it.

40:24.080 --> 40:32.080
Listen, you have gone through the physical motions of being in a relationship.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.080
And in much the same way that if you smile long enough, you're going to feel happier.

40:36.080 --> 40:38.080
The emotions have followed.

40:38.080 --> 40:44.080
It's completely rational and logical that you feel the way you do.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.080
And it's fucked that he doesn't.

40:46.080 --> 40:52.080
Justin, what you've just described is a prime example of why the friends with benefits cannot be a long term arrangement.

40:52.080 --> 40:58.080
Because it's fun at first, but after a while, emotions always follow for at least one of the party.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.080
Right.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.080
You know what I mean? And it always gets messy.

41:02.080 --> 41:11.080
But what I'm saying is that maybe this is the arrangement that she wanted also for a while, but has only now developed feelings.

41:11.080 --> 41:16.080
I'm not saying we have to make this guy out to sound like a total monster, you know what I mean?

41:16.080 --> 41:21.080
But if he's not down with what you want now, then it's time to find a new thing.

41:21.080 --> 41:28.080
Yeah, by me saying it sucks that he doesn't feel what you feel, I'm not saying that it's because he's a bad person.

41:28.080 --> 41:36.080
I'm saying it sucks for you, but you are never going to be happy in a relationship.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.080
And this goes for everybody, by the way.

41:38.080 --> 41:43.080
You are never going to be happy in a relationship that you had to con somebody into being in with you.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.080
That's never going to make you happy.

41:45.080 --> 41:51.080
If you change the context, and you were dating this person, and you wanted to say get married,

41:51.080 --> 41:57.080
and they couldn't see ever taking the relationship to that level, then you would know you needed to get out of it.

41:57.080 --> 42:01.080
This is just one step back. You want to take your relationship to the next level.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.080
They don't. That's a sign that you need to end it.

42:04.080 --> 42:11.080
The reason I called this dude a major premium rush is because he actually said out loud,

42:11.080 --> 42:13.080
Oh, I don't feel love.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.080
Yeah.

42:14.080 --> 42:18.080
Does he mean towards you, or does he mean like AI style?

42:18.080 --> 42:19.080
Good question.

42:19.080 --> 42:23.080
No, because even in fucking AI, his love was real, but he is not.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.080
Right, exactly. This guy's like a reverse AI.

42:26.080 --> 42:28.080
Fair.

42:28.080 --> 42:31.080
I don't know, guys.

42:31.080 --> 42:34.080
I think that you're above it, and probably, you know what?

42:34.080 --> 42:39.080
Probably he is too. It sounds like it's not the right circumstance for either one of you.

42:39.080 --> 42:43.080
So continue being friends, and maybe even continue being roommates.

42:43.080 --> 42:47.080
But you need to end the friends with benefits side.

42:47.080 --> 42:56.080
If you're going to start benefiting other people, then I don't think living with this dude is going to be a hot plan.

42:56.080 --> 43:00.080
Okay, I amend it then. It's probably time for him to move out.

43:00.080 --> 43:04.080
Yeah, listen, it's time for you to go.

43:04.080 --> 43:08.080
Time to get on that big long bird train.

43:08.080 --> 43:12.080
With all the other guac.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.080
Oh, man.

43:14.080 --> 43:26.080
Listen, I know it sucks, but please take care of your heart and cut it off before you do more damage to yourself,

43:26.080 --> 43:29.080
or you miss out on any more good days.

43:29.080 --> 43:35.080
Like, just get it over with, get the heartbreak over with, and move on to somebody who deserves you.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.080
Don't cut your heart off, though.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.080
Don't cut your heart off, that's true.

43:40.080 --> 43:43.080
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

43:43.080 --> 43:45.080
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray.

43:45.080 --> 43:48.080
Are you Ira Ray? Who wants to know?

43:48.080 --> 43:51.080
Not me. Yahoo answers user Zach Z.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.080
Griffin doesn't care who you are.

43:53.080 --> 43:58.080
I don't give a fuck. Come one, come all to the greatest show on earth.

43:58.080 --> 44:02.080
This Yahoo is Yahoo answer user Zach Z, who asks,

44:02.080 --> 44:06.080
How do you get the side splits? Fast!

44:06.080 --> 44:10.080
I'm going to get into a special dance team, and I need to get the splits.

44:10.080 --> 44:15.080
They are going to see if I can in about two weeks. I'm pretty far, but not far enough. Help!

44:15.080 --> 44:17.080
Have someone push you down.

44:17.080 --> 44:20.080
Say, I'm gonna do a side split. Someone can push me down.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.080
It's really just mind over matter, isn't it?

44:23.080 --> 44:26.080
You gotta keep a moist, supple taint, though, or else you'll rip it.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.080
Never, ever again.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.080
You do not want to rip your taint.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.080
Never again, those three words. Never.

44:32.080 --> 44:36.080
Because once it starts ripping, chances are it's just going to keep going,

44:36.080 --> 44:38.080
and pretty soon you'll be split in twain.

44:38.080 --> 44:42.080
That's really how you train your body to do that, right?

44:42.080 --> 44:47.080
That particular part of your body has to become whiter, right?

44:47.080 --> 44:51.080
Okay, so this leads me to a question I've been wondering for a long time.

44:51.080 --> 44:56.080
That's what they don't show you with people who are doing a side split is when they're not side splitting,

44:56.080 --> 44:59.080
their taint is hanging below them like a saddlebag.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.080
Right, like a turkey gobbler.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.080
Yeah, it looks like a...

45:04.080 --> 45:06.080
A waddle.

45:06.080 --> 45:09.080
A gobbler is what children call it.

45:09.080 --> 45:15.080
Is that another way people who don't know what it's called call it?

45:15.080 --> 45:18.080
No, no, that's what idiots call it.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.080
I mean, there might be children listening.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.080
It leads me to a question I've always wondered, which is,

45:22.080 --> 45:26.080
if you got someone strong enough and they, whilst hugging someone,

45:26.080 --> 45:32.080
grab both of their buttcheeks and pull the part really hard, could you rip someone in half?

45:32.080 --> 45:37.080
Because I feel like the butt crack is like that little slit that they make in packages that allow you to open it easily.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.080
Yeah, sure.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.080
And it's like God's way of saying, rip this person in two.

45:40.080 --> 45:44.080
Right, sure, it's your Achilles heel, except it's your asshole.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.080
Have you never wondered that, you guys?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.080
You've never wondered that? Come on.

45:48.080 --> 45:51.080
Why God perforated us? Is he tearing?

45:51.080 --> 45:56.080
You're saying that if you were to tear a human being in half long ways,

45:56.080 --> 46:01.080
that the best place to start would be the buttcheeks because it's natural handles and also there's already...

46:01.080 --> 46:03.080
Obviously. I mean, that's a given.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.080
That's not my question.

46:04.080 --> 46:09.080
My question is, I don't know if anyone's ever tried it before, but would it be a clean break?

46:09.080 --> 46:11.080
Could you do it in two?

46:11.080 --> 46:16.080
I don't think that anyone... I don't even think Hulk Hogan in his prime could do that.

46:16.080 --> 46:20.080
Maybe the power team could. It was a blessing of God's will.

46:20.080 --> 46:27.080
I just thought about it and I watched the Hulk Hogan sex tape and he actually did do that. I take it back.

46:27.080 --> 46:30.080
Brother, are you ready for my special move, brother?

46:30.080 --> 46:35.080
Here it comes. I'd rather not!

46:35.080 --> 46:42.080
Hulkamania is about to run wild all over your butt and your vagina.

46:42.080 --> 46:45.080
I'm going to tear your butt and vagina in half, brother.

46:45.080 --> 46:49.080
Then there was a 48-hour manhunt.

46:49.080 --> 46:53.080
Only one man could leave tracks like this.

46:53.080 --> 46:57.080
It's just Hulk Hogan running naked through the woods.

46:57.080 --> 47:01.080
Somebody call Tommy Lee Jones.

47:01.080 --> 47:04.080
I didn't destroy that butt, Hulk Hogan, sir.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.080
I'm pretty sure you did.

47:06.080 --> 47:09.080
We actually have a sex tape of you doing it.

47:09.080 --> 47:11.080
I'm Hulk Hogan destroying this butt.

47:11.080 --> 47:14.080
You have butt blood all over your hands.

47:14.080 --> 47:19.080
Sir, Andre the Giant is dead. There's nobody else.

47:19.080 --> 47:23.080
Have you guys seen that Hulk Hogan Andre the Giant sex tape?

47:23.080 --> 47:27.080
Oh my God.

47:27.080 --> 47:32.080
Both of them in a test for dominance trying to tear the other one's butt.

47:32.080 --> 47:36.080
It's like the opening scene in Melancholia where the two planets collide.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.080
That's basically what we're talking about.

47:38.080 --> 47:41.080
It's like the last scene in Over the Top.

47:41.080 --> 47:49.080
Except it's under the bottom.

47:49.080 --> 47:51.080
Oh, man. Can we be done?

47:51.080 --> 47:54.080
Hulk Hogan, it feels so good.

47:54.080 --> 48:04.080
I didn't think I would like the way it feels inside, but I do in fact like the way it feels.

48:04.080 --> 48:08.080
I'm going to call on you, Hulk Hogan.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.080
What the hell is that impression?

48:10.080 --> 48:15.080
That's what Andre the Giant sounds like mid-coitus, of course.

48:15.080 --> 48:19.080
Because it sounds like the baby of Andre the Giant Sylvester Stallone.

48:19.080 --> 48:24.080
If you tear my butt in half, then I do not think I will laugh.

48:24.080 --> 48:28.080
Anybody want a penis?

48:28.080 --> 48:33.080
Hulk Hogan, perhaps you?

48:33.080 --> 48:35.080
Should we make love?

48:35.080 --> 48:43.080
I have four gallons of what in my room?

48:43.080 --> 48:53.080
I have a bag of 30 hamburgers.

48:53.080 --> 49:00.080
I have that giant armchair Gallagher used to use.

49:00.080 --> 49:06.080
I have a bicycle built for two. It is just mine.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.080
I'm going to snap into some butt cheeks.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.080
What are you doing? Get out of here.

49:11.080 --> 49:13.080
Nobody wants you here.

49:13.080 --> 49:17.080
We're getting tender. Get out of here.

49:17.080 --> 49:20.080
Oh, yeah. I have a lance. Tear my butt in half.

49:20.080 --> 49:22.080
Get out of here, Randy. Please.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.080
Randy, please.

49:24.080 --> 49:27.080
Some of us are adults trying to make love.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.080
Well, everyone's childhood is ruined.

49:29.080 --> 49:31.080
Sorry, everybody.

49:31.080 --> 49:34.080
Hey, at least we didn't make the very obvious Jake the Snake Roberts joke.

49:34.080 --> 49:38.080
Okay, so that's going to do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.080
I believe. I don't think we can ruin anything else.

49:40.080 --> 49:43.080
There's nothing else I can think of to ruin.

49:43.080 --> 49:46.080
Well, there's lots of other things we could ruin, but we have lots more episodes to do.

49:46.080 --> 49:48.080
We've got to save it. Yeah, we've got to save it.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.080
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

49:50.080 --> 49:56.080
The Davenport, Evan Weston, Bearden Bowtie, Evil Chase, LG, Jared.

49:56.080 --> 50:03.080
Don Chapel, Ted Winscott, Crazy Legs 2, everybody.

50:03.080 --> 50:05.080
We really appreciate it.

50:05.080 --> 50:07.080
So, thank you.

50:07.080 --> 50:10.080
We've got a thread going on the MaxFun forums.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.080
We're going to make a new sampler.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.080
And we want your suggestions for what bits we should include.

50:15.080 --> 50:22.080
And if you can, throw in like an episode number and a time code, if possible, to tell me where to look.

50:22.080 --> 50:25.080
That'll make it a lot easier to get all that set up.

50:25.080 --> 50:30.080
And while you're on MaximumFun.org, make sure to check out all the other MaxFun podcasts.

50:30.080 --> 50:38.080
Throwing Shade, Jordan Jesse Goh, Bullseye, Josh John Hodgman, Risk, Memory Palace, International Waters.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.080
What am I forgetting? Stop podcasting yourself?

50:41.080 --> 50:43.080
Stop podcasting yourself.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.080
There's always one. There's like 13 shows.

50:45.080 --> 50:47.080
And they're all free and they're all amazing.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.080
But it's hard to remember them. They're all like a bunch of words, you know?

50:50.080 --> 50:53.080
Well, that's because MaximumFun.org is a website on the grow.

50:53.080 --> 50:57.080
Yeah, that's true. I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

50:57.080 --> 51:00.080
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

51:00.080 --> 51:05.080
They have a podcast, Roderick on the Line, with Merlin Man from You Look Nice Today.

51:05.080 --> 51:08.080
It's not on the MaximumFun network, though. Am I allowed to endorse it? I think so.

51:08.080 --> 51:11.080
Yeah, I think that's fine. Legally speaking, I think you're a fine one.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.080
Let me check our contract. Yeah, it's fine.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.080
Yeah, it's fine.

51:15.080 --> 51:18.080
And yeah, we're trying to plan some live shows.

51:18.080 --> 51:23.080
We're doing MaxFunCon West, so get your tickets if there are even any still available.

51:23.080 --> 51:26.080
It's like the most fun weekend ever.

51:26.080 --> 51:32.080
But we're going to try and do some more live shows, hopefully somewhere up New England,

51:32.080 --> 51:35.080
the Boston, New York, Philly region.

51:35.080 --> 51:38.080
So if you have any suggestions, drop those in the forum, too,

51:38.080 --> 51:43.080
or email us at movinbam at MaximumFun.org.

51:43.080 --> 51:47.080
And make sure that when you email us that you put in the subject line,

51:47.080 --> 51:50.080
either say live show in there or something along those lines

51:50.080 --> 51:53.080
so that when we're scanning through, I can pick those out.

51:53.080 --> 51:59.080
This final Yahoo Answer question was sent in by Adam Schwally.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.080
Thank you, Adam.

52:00.080 --> 52:03.080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Abdulliah, who asks,

52:03.080 --> 52:06.080
Can you get a tattoo while breastfeeding?

52:09.080 --> 52:11.080
I'm Justin McElroy.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.080
I'm Travis McElroy.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

52:13.080 --> 52:16.080
This has been my brother, my brother and me. This is your dad.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.080
We're on the whip.
