00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.360 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.280
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

00:15.280 --> 00:17.600
cool they are for listening.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.400
What's up you cool baby?

00:20.400 --> 00:24.400
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

00:24.400 --> 00:30.400
We're gonna give advice and do funny skits, laughter it is in store.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.360
Come inside and see, it's time to start.

00:33.360 --> 00:40.800
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me.

00:40.800 --> 00:47.040
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me 2021.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.280
Oh, I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.760
I'm your, I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.800
Oh boy.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.720
And I am cyber, and I am Cyberman.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.800
Looks like we made it.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.400
If you're listening to this, if you're listening to this, it's 2021.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.400
Oh, it's so rad.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
That's a big if Justin.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Huge, huge if.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.880
But if they're not listening to it, then yeah, while we record this, still 2020, still pretty,

01:13.880 --> 01:15.240
pretty bleak out there.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.520
Big hopes 2021, big ray of sunshine, song come out tomorrow, and drain the swamp.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.000
And we're so stoked for that.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I actually feel jealous of the listener.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
You know what I mean?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.240
Because we're having to do this now on, you know.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.120
We're still in the stink year.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.280
It's still the stink year here.

01:36.280 --> 01:40.120
Do you think that there was a time during the dark ages where somebody said, I think

01:40.120 --> 01:44.280
next year is the end of the dark ages, and it sucks that we're still in the, like, do

01:44.280 --> 01:47.720
you think that they had that kind of awareness then that they were like, I can't believe

01:47.720 --> 01:50.400
we have to stay in the dark ages for one more year?

01:50.400 --> 01:53.840
Yeah, they were like, I just heard about this thing called bloodletting, and it's going

01:53.840 --> 01:56.280
to turn this shit all the way around.

01:56.280 --> 02:00.080
Y'all heard about humors?

02:00.080 --> 02:03.680
We're not here to complain about the bad state of things, though.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.520
No, that year's done.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.520
That year's done.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.520
That year's done.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.080
But now we're on to the new year.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.880
And gosh, gosh, guys.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.400
Oh gosh, upon.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.660
Here it is.

02:14.660 --> 02:15.660
This is an episode.

02:15.660 --> 02:20.920
This is an annual tradition in much the same spirit of Candle Nights, Candle Nights is,

02:20.920 --> 02:23.760
by the way, either over or still going.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
I don't know.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.760
Now one knows.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
Yeah.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.720
We may be on the next one already.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.880
I would like to begin this annual tradition, which is the naming of the year.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.200
What is the naming of the year?

02:35.200 --> 02:43.960
Well, it's a chance for us to sort of pick a theme, a punny theme for the year.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.280
I would take umbrage with that.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.280
It's not always.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.760
Is someone chewing gum?

02:48.760 --> 02:50.760
Is someone chewing gum?

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
Justin?

02:51.760 --> 02:52.760
No, I'm not chewing gum.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
Okay.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.760
I have a very wet mouth today.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.760
Oh, it's going to be a wet mouth show.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.840
Okay, cool.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.680
So in the previous years, we have been doing this since we began the show.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.680
I don't know.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.040
We did name the year, even though we started in 2012.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
It was Zolo.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Zolo.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.040
Okay.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.040
Is anybody looking?

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
I'm looking.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.040
No, I know off the top of my head.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.920
I want to quiz Travis on him then.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
Okay.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.920
Okay.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
2011 was Zolo.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
No.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
No.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.520
It was 20, uh, what was it?

03:23.520 --> 03:24.800
It was 2000 in heaven.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
Get right with Christ.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.800
Right.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.800
Okay.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
Great.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
I know the next one is 20 Does.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
20 Does.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.800
Gettin' it.

03:31.800 --> 03:36.440
And then it was 20, oh, and I can't remember if 13 is first or 14 is first.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.440
You don't remember.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.440
Yes.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
13.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
Yes.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.440
13 and then 14.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
Sorry.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.440
14 and 13.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
Dig it up.

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
Get it out.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
This one was our weakest.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
20 Forward.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.440
Oh, 20 Forward.

03:48.440 --> 03:49.440
That's right.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
I don't love that.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.440
It's a little obvious.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.440
And this is where I think they really get good.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
20 Grifteen.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
The con is on.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.440
20 Grifteen.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.440
The con is on.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
Correct.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.680
The subtitle of the year is so important.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.240
And then it's 20 Fix-teen.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.240
Building Bridges.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.560
Well, I want to stick a pin in 20 Grifteen, the con is on, because it may be the last

04:08.560 --> 04:18.080
time that these ended up being correct, which is not that we would now encourage everyone

04:18.080 --> 04:23.600
to get on the grift and the con, but that everybody back in 2015 sure as hell did.

04:23.600 --> 04:30.480
I feel like 20 Serpentine, zag on them, everybody did an okay job of zagging on them.

04:30.480 --> 04:31.640
I guess so.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.280
Now, I can't remember 2018.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.560
2018 was Collaborate-teen.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.520
Collaborate-teen, that's right.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.520
Stronger Together.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
Stronger Together.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.320
And then it was Frankenstein-teen, Become the Monster.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.240
People took the spirit of Collaborate-teen, Stronger Together.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
Yeah.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.960
Yeah, yeah, we did our best.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.040
But it still was kind of a dog shit year.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.600
But I don't know how, that's not our fault.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.760
Frankenstein-teen, Become the Monster.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
So good.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.560
Still a very good one.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.740
There was 20 Funny.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.740
This one is contentious.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.520
We need to slow down a little bit.

05:03.520 --> 05:08.640
Travis felt very strongly that the year's theme was 20 Honey, Down to Beesness.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
Yeah.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
Right.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
And it became that.

05:11.640 --> 05:16.080
Griffin and I felt very strongly that it was 20 Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter and

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
Love.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.080
Yeah.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
Now, history.

05:19.080 --> 05:24.600
I conceded that, I believe, a few months ago that it was 20 Honey, Down to Beesness.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.600
It did change.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.600
I allowed it.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
It did change.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.640
It pupated and it evolved.

05:29.640 --> 05:36.040
I think what we can do is history will remember it as Honey, Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
and Bees.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
Right.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.780
I think that that is the culmination of the two becoming one, right?

05:40.780 --> 05:41.780
That is the year.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.120
To sum it up, Honey, Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter and Bees.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.840
I think that covers both.

05:45.840 --> 05:53.600
Just to, do you think that we, as a nation, because the only Americans listening to this

05:53.600 --> 05:58.200
show are the red blood Americans from the real America, and if you do know what I'm

05:58.200 --> 05:59.400
talking about.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.720
The underground America, yes, the tunnels.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.880
Do you think they got down to Beesness?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.620
Do you think folks got down to Beesness?

06:05.620 --> 06:10.440
Do you think that in any kind of sticky, coordinated way?

06:10.440 --> 06:17.880
I think that there were periods of time where there was some solid civil action that was

06:17.880 --> 06:18.880
very down to Beesness.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.520
Oh, fuck, yeah, you're right.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.640
It got wicked down to Beesness this year, I would argue.

06:24.640 --> 06:25.640
Yeah.

06:25.640 --> 06:26.960
Well put, Travis.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.360
Now this is going to be a different year.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.040
Right now, it's 2021.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.320
This is going to be a tough one because, okay, I'm going to tell you, it's three words.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.880
Is it because there's so many syllables?

06:37.880 --> 06:38.880
Because there's three words.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.880
All right, thank you.

06:39.880 --> 06:46.600
So, do you want to know something really, this is like the most that this story could

06:46.600 --> 06:47.600
be true.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.600
Sure.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.640
It's so spiritually true.

06:50.640 --> 06:56.800
Right before we got on to the call, I had this thought to myself, oh, I fucking got

06:56.800 --> 06:57.800
this year.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
I got this one.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Yeah.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
No, let me finish.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.800
Let me finish.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.800
Let me finish, please.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
Okay.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
Oh, I fucking got this year.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
Twenty Bunty.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
And then I was like, what should be the subtitle?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.400
Oh, I got it.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.080
Just get on base.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.520
Twenty Bunty.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.840
Just get on base.

07:12.840 --> 07:17.720
What two facts did I forget in having that thought?

07:17.720 --> 07:28.200
Well, one, it's 2021, and two, I had that exact same title for 2020, subtitle included.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.200
Okay?

07:29.200 --> 07:31.120
That's the kind of fucking year it's been.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.520
Hey, Justin, three, that's also not how bunting works.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.280
It advances the runner, but you're probably going to be out.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.360
Oh, you mean the second proposed subtitle that was proposed by you.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
Yeah, correct.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.040
Correcting me, Twenty Bunty, Advance the Runners was the other one.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.040
Oh, my God.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.280
It's a flat circle, folks.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.640
We are just stuck in it.

07:47.640 --> 07:53.840
I do want to give one more shout out to Twenty Palm and Terry, just in the front, party in

07:53.840 --> 07:54.840
the back.

07:54.840 --> 07:55.840
Was that last year?

07:55.840 --> 07:56.840
Yeah, that was last year.

07:56.840 --> 07:57.840
So strong.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.840
That was last year.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.800
And also, poor one out for Twenty Twice.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.880
Subtitles include One Mo' Gin, Second Chances, Twenty Twice Feels So Nice, Twenty Twice Won't

08:07.880 --> 08:13.400
Roll the Dice, Twenty Twice Sugar and Spice, Twenty Twice Twice Is Nice, Twenty Twice Let's

08:13.400 --> 08:17.280
All Be Nice, Twenty Twice A Second Look, Twenty Twice Two For The Bunny.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.560
Now, none of those would have been-

08:18.560 --> 08:20.960
Lost the plot in those last two, it feels like.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
But 2021.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.080
Time to look forward.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.120
I have three that I feel very strongly about.

08:26.120 --> 08:31.840
Well, before we get to new ones, can we, in any way, just to start the conversation,

08:31.840 --> 08:39.160
because Travis, I feel like spoiled the apple bunch a little bit on the last time we spoke,

08:39.160 --> 08:42.920
you professed that you had it, and you knew it, and you crushed it.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.040
And so, I don't want to start with that, if you are that excited.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.040
No, I'm saving that one.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.040
No, no, no.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.040
That's a third out of three.

08:48.040 --> 08:53.440
Okay, but what I want to get to before we get to any new material is, is there anything

08:53.440 --> 08:56.600
we can salvage from- No!

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
Okay, go let me finish.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
That is dead.

08:58.600 --> 09:03.200
No, hey, Griffin, if you're trying, can we use anything from last year again?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.280
Last year is dead to me.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.680
I don't want to- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

09:05.680 --> 09:06.680
no.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.680
You've gotta let me finish, bud.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.680
Let me finish, bud.

09:08.680 --> 09:09.680
You gotta let me finish, bud.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
Please.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
Okay, finish, bud.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.680
Just bud, finish.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
Bud, finish it.

09:13.680 --> 09:20.440
We would salvage it, but we would also add a rhyming word of one to it to the end.

09:20.440 --> 09:26.160
Yeah, that's what I'm, I think we, listen, I think, Griffin, we didn't leave a lot of

09:26.160 --> 09:29.080
meat on the bone and we have a whole decade.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.040
Like this is, this is what I'm running into.

09:32.040 --> 09:37.720
We are going to have to match the sound 2020 for 10 years, God willing, and the creek don't

09:37.720 --> 09:38.720
rise.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.720
Right.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.300
So yeah, I do think so.

09:42.300 --> 09:49.000
So something like 20 Funny Fun, empty your bucket of laughter and love.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Now what I did, Griffin, it's funny you should mention that.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yes.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Because my first one, what I played with is the syllables, right?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.480
All three of mine are syllable and rhyme based.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.480
Okay, cool.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.960
So 20 Good Clean Fun was what I went with for the first one.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.760
20 Good Clean Fun is cool, but it's also not-

10:04.760 --> 10:05.760
Even close.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
It's not, but it's not like-

10:06.760 --> 10:08.800
20 Good Clean Fun, 2021, right?

10:08.800 --> 10:14.440
So I'm going with that and then the, and my subtitle, 20 Good Clean Fun, let's get silly.

10:14.440 --> 10:20.280
Are you saying that we should grant ourselves the ability to ignore the second 20, having

10:20.280 --> 10:22.840
already rhymed it in the first part?

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
Yes.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.120
And not only that, there's a precedent here.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.940
Frankenstein teen, 20 Serpentine, right?

10:28.940 --> 10:33.760
It doesn't have to exactly, sometimes it can just be close enough.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.000
Collaborate teen, we didn't even have a 20 in there.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.160
There's, what do we want people to do this year?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.160
That's a tough one.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.240
Do we have so many syllables to play with?

10:45.240 --> 10:50.040
Because if we could narrow that down, because I don't think it can be anything as trite

10:50.040 --> 10:56.320
as like, let's get, let's work, let's work together, be good to each other.

10:56.320 --> 11:00.440
It's gotta be, it's gotta be, I think more concrete, especially we're starting out the

11:00.440 --> 11:04.920
year in isolation still, we've got to, you know, it's not gonna, we're not gonna be able

11:04.920 --> 11:05.920
to collaborate.

11:05.920 --> 11:06.920
Let me hit you guys with this.

11:06.920 --> 11:07.920
Okay.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.760
Let me think, what do you think about this one?

11:09.760 --> 11:14.600
20 bunny fun, and what this does is, it just says that at some point in the year, you gotta

11:14.600 --> 11:16.840
get 20 bunnies together and have a little fun.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
Just have some fun with the bunnies.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.840
I like that.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.760
And if you do that, the year is, you're good, right?

11:21.760 --> 11:22.760
Just 20 bunny fun.

11:22.760 --> 11:23.760
I like that.

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
It's actionable.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.760
Let me throw this one at you.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.240
It's prescriptive in a way that I could achieve, which I-

11:28.240 --> 11:33.440
Right, you just get 20 bunnies together, and maybe once this is safe, you know, you could

11:33.440 --> 11:35.800
make a day of it with a bunch of friends.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.040
Is live bunnies a necessity here?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.040
Oh, interesting.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
Absolutely not.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.240
I don't want images of 20 live bunnies.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
That would give me hives.

11:43.240 --> 11:47.520
I want, you know, I think that that is completely fine, but I would also love to see people surround

11:47.520 --> 11:50.160
themselves with 20 stuffed bunnies, and just having some fun.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
I like that.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
Or some porcelain bunnies.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
Just 20 bunnies together.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
20 chocolate bunnies, and you're just eating all of them.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
Oh, yeah.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
Bunny.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.400
What about, Justin, yours is very actionable, and I like it.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.880
I'm gonna throw out one that is completely unactionable, and a more of those.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.360
Is this your second of three?

12:04.360 --> 12:05.360
This is my second of three.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.360
Okay, this is your-

12:06.360 --> 12:08.640
I think Griffin should get a term before Travis takes another term.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.640
Griffin, if you have one, please.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.640
Yeah, I don't know.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
Oh, great.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.800
This is good energy.

12:13.800 --> 12:18.360
I had like, what popped into my head when you were talking about just sort of syllable

12:18.360 --> 12:21.880
synthesis, is 20 woe be gone.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
Huh.

12:22.880 --> 12:23.880
But that's-

12:23.880 --> 12:24.880
Wow.

12:24.880 --> 12:30.800
Woe be gone is a word that you hear it, and you think it means happy, because you're woe

12:30.800 --> 12:36.200
be gone, but it actually means the opposite, and it means that you're very, very, very

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
woeful.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.760
It seems like a bad word.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.760
Seems like they did a bad job, though.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.000
So that's what you're going with, though, is just like 20 sad.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.480
Yeah, or I don't want that, though.

12:46.480 --> 12:53.520
The other one I came up with was 20 marathon, but we're not even in the one.

12:53.520 --> 12:58.120
It's not an un-marathon.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.280
This one goes along a little bit with Frankenstein team become the monster, right?

13:01.280 --> 13:06.960
Where I think this one's up for interpretation, and it is 20 laser gun, pew, pew, motherfucker.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
Nope.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.400
Now, the cussing makes it non-toyetic, which I hate.

13:11.400 --> 13:16.080
Well, you put a fun asterisk in there, and then it's like kind of cheesy fun, where it's

13:16.080 --> 13:17.960
just like, oh, I know what it means.

13:17.960 --> 13:23.480
I don't think, because we could also, like, it doesn't take much.

13:23.480 --> 13:30.360
One gentle step to the left, and it could be 20 Tommy gun, brrat, brrat, brrat.

13:30.360 --> 13:36.800
And I don't want to necessarily champion that particular, you know, arms-bearing right.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.800
I see.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
You know what I mean?

13:38.800 --> 13:42.560
So you don't want to do, I did at one point think, 20 buy a gun.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.560
Let's just do it.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.400
20 buy a gun, let's just do it, is maybe the worst of both worlds, actually.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
Okay, yeah, yeah.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
No, I see it.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
I see it now.

13:50.400 --> 13:55.080
Because it's like 20 bunny fun in that it is prescriptive, where it's saying, much like

13:55.080 --> 13:59.120
20 bunny fun says, go get 20 stuffed bunnies, and let's have some fun with it.

13:59.120 --> 14:04.840
You say your objective, should you choose to accept it, is to go purchase a firearm.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.920
I don't think that that's on brand.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.160
No, I wasn't going to do that one.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.440
That's not included in my three.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.520
That's just one that kept popping into my head, and I couldn't stop it.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.520
Yeah.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.360
I would like to just go ahead and lay out my third.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.360
Just do it.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.640
Yeah, just do it.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.920
I thought a lot about this.

14:19.920 --> 14:26.560
I thought in the past we've had, it was too amorphous, it was unachievable, it was ambiguous,

14:26.560 --> 14:32.120
and I thought, here's a straightforward one that everyone can achieve that is universal.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
Okay.

14:33.120 --> 14:39.680
20 on a bun, eat a hot dog, parentheses, at some point, in parentheses.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.040
So this is kind of like the thing you put on your to-do list just so you know you'll

14:43.040 --> 14:45.560
be able to check it off to feel good.

14:45.560 --> 14:50.640
Like somebody could do that today and then not need to worry about the motto for the

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
year.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.640
This is what I'm saying.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
And the whole year is achieved at that point.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.640
20 on a bun.

14:54.640 --> 14:59.920
And at 20 on a bun, eat a hot dog, parentheses, at some point, in parentheses.

14:59.920 --> 15:04.760
And I figure it leaves us opportunities for some fundraisers where it's like, get a hot

15:04.760 --> 15:07.360
dog, give a hot dog, raise some money for food banks.

15:07.360 --> 15:12.440
And let me be clear, it can be like a vegan hot dog, it could be a bratwurst.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.440
Gluten-free bun.

15:13.440 --> 15:18.080
Yeah, it could be a chicken and apple sausage, right?

15:18.080 --> 15:22.440
But it has to be a wiener of some sort and a split-top bun of some sort.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.440
Indeed.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.440
20 on a bun.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.840
Justin's been alarmingly quiet for a little while and I wonder-

15:26.840 --> 15:28.080
Makes me think he's on Rhyme Zone.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
Yeah.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
20 on a bun.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.080
Okay.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.080
Hey, 20 thanks a ton.

15:32.080 --> 15:36.840
Can I say, Justin, it's a little rude what you just did to Travis's great suggestion,

15:36.840 --> 15:39.720
which I'm starting to think you weren't even sort of tuned in.

15:39.720 --> 15:40.720
20 thanks a ton.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.720
20 on a bun.

15:41.720 --> 15:46.000
Well, 20 on a bun, eat a hot dog, Travis, if I could take it and just twist it just

15:46.000 --> 15:48.560
a little bit, eat a hot dog today.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
Not anytime you-

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
Yours is a little too-

15:50.560 --> 15:51.840
Is it like whenever you hear it?

15:51.840 --> 15:55.740
Anytime you think of it, it's like the game.

15:55.740 --> 16:03.400
If you think of it, it's like, shit, I don't know what I'm doing today except for one

16:03.400 --> 16:09.280
meal or big beefy snack, I will be consuming a hot dog on a bun today.

16:09.280 --> 16:18.200
I don't necessarily, okay, we made a bee-themed year and so much of our branding became about

16:18.200 --> 16:19.200
bees.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.320
And I'm not sure I want that for hot dogs.

16:21.320 --> 16:26.680
Okay, Justin, you don't want pens designed where it's us as hot dog boys, but it's just

16:26.680 --> 16:27.680
like right there.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.680
It's just so-

16:28.680 --> 16:32.120
I know, but you can't tell me that that's not adorable, 20 on a bun.

16:32.120 --> 16:37.880
I like 20 on a bun, actually, but I feel like eat a hot dog today is where it's tripping

16:37.880 --> 16:38.880
me up.

16:38.880 --> 16:43.140
I would almost refer to 20 on a bun and then the subtitle is something about trying new

16:43.140 --> 16:44.140
things on buns.

16:44.140 --> 16:45.140
No, no, no.

16:45.140 --> 16:46.140
See, here's the thing, Justin.

16:46.140 --> 16:51.040
In the past, we tried to do these inspirational ones, and then the year has come back to

16:51.040 --> 16:53.400
bite us solidly in the ass.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.760
But people, but like, okay, I don't want to get too modeling or self-important, but that

16:58.760 --> 17:00.160
is life.

17:00.160 --> 17:04.760
You start on January 1 and you're like, this is the year I'm going to take it by storm

17:04.760 --> 17:09.240
and run it in the end zone, then life's like, actually, I'm not so sure about that.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.780
I'm going to do some bad things and some good things I haven't decided yet.

17:12.780 --> 17:18.840
And then when you get to December, you should feel good if you moved it a little bit.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.440
If you ate a hot dog.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.480
If you moved it a little bit, I think it needs to be-

17:23.480 --> 17:26.840
Yeah, like the length of one hot dog, a bun-sized frank length.

17:26.840 --> 17:30.960
It needs to be aspirational and then you fall short of it.

17:30.960 --> 17:36.200
I've never had a hot dog, so I've been hearing a lot about these guys lately, about whether

17:36.200 --> 17:37.200
or not they're a sandwich.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.240
And it's not good for anybody.

17:39.240 --> 17:44.360
Even if it was about hydration or something, I could get on board with it, but the idea

17:44.360 --> 17:49.160
that if you consider our year, you have to eat a hot dog, that's like some perverse version

17:49.160 --> 17:51.920
of the ring that I cannot get on board with.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.960
This is why I'm saying eat a hot dog at some point.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.080
Right now, everybody walk over to that big white board that you keep on the wall full

17:57.080 --> 18:02.600
of your yearly goals and just write, eat a hot dog, date, question mark.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.600
Yeah.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
TBD.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
TBD.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.160
I had, I was percolated.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.760
Okay, well, now we'll get to Justin's 20 thanks a ton.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.800
Who are we- Gratitude.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.920
Gratitude is something anybody can do, no matter how bad things are.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.920
If you're feeling gratitude for the things in your life, and more importantly, I think

18:22.920 --> 18:27.960
the people in your life, that 20 thanks a ton, that's powerful.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.920
Now make a subtitle, because you didn't.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.280
20 thanks a ton, hey, thanks a ton.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.920
No, no, that's good, I'm going to write that down.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.000
No, 20 thanks a ton, gratitude- Put it on a bun.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.960
20 thanks a ton, gratitude- Gratatouille.

18:43.960 --> 18:48.880
Oh, okay, 20 thanks a ton, gratitude attitude.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.360
Okay, yeah, I mean, you got to rhyme out of it.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.560
Now what if it's just gratitude with attitude?

18:55.560 --> 18:56.560
Gratitude ratatouille.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.560
Oh.

18:57.560 --> 19:04.160
I was percolating on 20 on the run, like let's get out of here.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.640
Let's lay low, 20 on the run, like cheese it.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.320
But then I also wanted to explore 20 born to run.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.520
Let's figure out, Bruce has been a big thing for a while now.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
Yeah, what's his deal?

19:16.520 --> 19:21.120
And I'll be honest that I have not explored the gentleman's body of music.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.120
Who?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
Oh, the boss.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
The boss.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.120
The big boy.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
The Jersey boy.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
I guess you're talking about Bruce Willis.

19:27.120 --> 19:33.960
No, you know I love Bruno and his great jazz, but I'm speaking now specifically about Bruce

19:33.960 --> 19:38.600
Springsteen because he did the song Born to Run and not Bruce Willis.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.420
Now I did think, because I thought of On the Run too, Griffin, and the subtitle I thought

19:42.420 --> 19:46.920
of for it was 20 on the run and then hasty getaway.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.800
And it's all about like, hey, you know, once we're allowed to travel, let's get out there.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.800
Let's get out there.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.800
Let's explore new places.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.800
Nah, because that's not-

19:53.800 --> 19:56.240
I like 20 on the run, let's lay low.

19:56.240 --> 20:01.520
Because this could be the year that maybe your goal is just like get off the grid a

20:01.520 --> 20:02.520
little bit.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.520
Not a whole way.

20:03.520 --> 20:08.100
I'm not going to be able to- like 20 on the run could be in person, right?

20:08.100 --> 20:12.960
Or 20 on the run could be just like, make yourself harder to get at.

20:12.960 --> 20:19.240
Because I feel like that could actually be a very powerful goal for a lot of people is

20:19.240 --> 20:22.440
just like, hey, have you gotten at Mike lately?

20:22.440 --> 20:23.440
I haven't.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.000
Mike's really hard to get at lately.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.880
You can't get to him and get your stinky little fingers all over him.

20:28.880 --> 20:34.760
What's neat about that, really super neat, is that I feel like 2021, our inclination,

20:34.760 --> 20:40.960
everybody's inclination in this plague-swept country of ours is that once it's over, baby,

20:40.960 --> 20:43.060
we're going to fucking rip it.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.060
We're going to rip it.

20:44.060 --> 20:45.060
We're going to ruin it.

20:45.060 --> 20:48.640
Like we're going to smash it and ruin it and fuck it and just like blast it and wail on

20:48.640 --> 20:51.360
it for like forever because we earned it.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.360
We didn't.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.360
But we earned it.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.360
And now it's ours.

20:54.360 --> 21:00.920
I feel like maybe a 20 on the run, let's lay low, almost encourages you to like patience.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.920
Like even more patience.

21:02.920 --> 21:06.960
Like even when it's like party time, like maybe don't be the first, like maybe hang

21:06.960 --> 21:14.000
back and like let's rebuild a little bit before we get out there and just start smashing it.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.680
Well, I mean, to be fair, people are definitely going to be needing to build up their tolerance,

21:18.680 --> 21:20.520
their social tolerance once more, right?

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
Sure, sure.

21:21.520 --> 21:25.400
At this point, if I rolled up to a party full of 30 people, it'd be too much, too much too

21:25.400 --> 21:26.400
soon.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.760
Give me two people max.

21:29.760 --> 21:37.600
What about, oh, what, okay, what about 20 Chase the Sun, living that beach life?

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
Whoa.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.600
Oh, that's okay.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600
I don't.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
Okay.

21:41.600 --> 21:45.000
20 Chase the Sun, live that beach life.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Okay.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Huh.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
You know what?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.840
Ah, 20 Chase the Sun ain't, ain't bad.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.440
I don't like live that beach life.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
Oh yeah.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
I think we can sum it up better.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.920
Struggle for Griffin.

21:56.920 --> 22:00.600
20 Chase the Sun, to me, feels like spiritual.

22:00.600 --> 22:05.640
Yeah, I'm very much picturing Bodie from Point Break, right?

22:05.640 --> 22:10.160
This like eternal summer, you know, I'm just following the waves, living that beach life,

22:10.160 --> 22:11.160
Chase the Sun.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.160
It's not even that.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.480
It's about the, for me, it's about the day.

22:14.480 --> 22:18.520
And I mean, we would need to be careful if we walk this tightrope because obviously sun

22:18.520 --> 22:22.960
safety is obviously very near and dear to our hearts and it should be an important thing

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
for everybody.

22:23.960 --> 22:28.520
But to Chase the Sun, when I, some days when it's nice and sunny outside and I go out and

22:28.520 --> 22:33.680
I do a little bit of yard work and I come back in, revitalized by the day.

22:33.680 --> 22:38.480
It's like something, it's like a thing I don't get from, you know, food or sleep.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.680
It's like a new energy.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.440
It's solar, solar powered.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.440
Yeah.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
Yeah.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
I love it.

22:44.440 --> 22:49.200
20, 20 Chase the Sun, maybe get that orb.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
Ooh.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
Get the orb.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.200
Get the orb.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.200
Grab the orb.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.200
Catch the orb.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.200
What about grasp, grasp the orb.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
Catch the orb.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.440
What about clutch the orb?

22:57.440 --> 22:58.440
Clutch the orb.

22:58.440 --> 23:02.040
20 Chase the Sun, clutch the orb.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.320
Clutch this orb.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.360
Clutch this orb.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.360
Clutch this orb.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.360
Okay.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.880
Now here's what's so great about this one.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.440
You are going to fail.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
Yeah.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.440
Yeah.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.600
You can chase it all you want.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.240
You're not going to catch the sun.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.480
Well, how about reach for the orb then?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.000
Cause then it's not about the grabbing.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.680
Failure will not be inbuilt.

23:22.680 --> 23:27.200
It will be taken rightfully as we have every year.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.200
Yes.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.160
20 Chase the Sun, clutch this orb.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
Clutch this orb.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.660
And that way it leaves it like you're not going to do it, but it'll leave room to do

23:34.660 --> 23:35.820
it again next year.

23:35.820 --> 23:36.820
You know what I mean?

23:36.820 --> 23:37.820
Like we can continue.

23:37.820 --> 23:40.320
We must always clutch this orb.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.320
I like that.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.320
I do like 20 Chase the Sun.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.320
Okay.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.320
Now hold on.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.320
Now hold on.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.240
20 Chase the Sun is great.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.920
Clutch this orb is also good.

23:49.920 --> 23:56.080
If you start seeing clutch this orb, which I feel is very powerful on, on various merchandise

23:56.080 --> 24:02.880
that may go on different body parts, I feel like, imagine it on a shirt.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.160
It's not great.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.160
Clutch this orb.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.160
Okay.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.160
You're right.

24:07.160 --> 24:11.200
What about chase the sun, reach for one specific star?

24:11.200 --> 24:16.840
What about just chase 20 Chase the Sun and then like something with solar power.

24:16.840 --> 24:22.600
Solar power, S-O-U-L-A-R power.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.600
Solar power.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.680
What's it mean?

24:27.680 --> 24:30.760
I think you know exactly what it means, Griffin.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.760
I don't.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.760
I need you to tell me.

24:32.760 --> 24:37.800
What if someone made their New Year's resolution to start listening to our show?

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800
Okay.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.560
20 Chase the Sun, solar power is great.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
What's next?

24:42.560 --> 24:44.640
Do we want to ask people for their suggestions?

24:44.640 --> 24:46.680
I could just put out a tweet right now.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.680
Yeah.

24:47.680 --> 24:48.680
Okay.

24:48.680 --> 24:58.080
Um, while you do that 20 everyone, uh, you're all in, you're all invited 20 come undone.

24:58.080 --> 25:04.440
Let's take apart this cage we made for ourselves now because that sounds like I'm anti-pandemic

25:04.440 --> 25:06.000
or anti-quarantine.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
I'm definitely anti-pandemic.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Hate this thing.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.360
You've made that clear.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.120
I like to think so.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.800
Ooh.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.840
What about this, 20 one-on-one.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.320
21 on one is good.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.760
Is it inherently sportsy?

25:24.760 --> 25:26.280
No, no, no, no, no.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
I wasn't even thinking about that.

25:27.280 --> 25:34.080
I was thinking about like occasionally dip off sushi to talk to, talk to, talk to your,

25:34.080 --> 25:36.860
you know, your people in real life one-on-one.

25:36.860 --> 25:40.800
What about 21 on one disconnect to reconnect?

25:40.800 --> 25:42.620
Disconnect to reconnect?

25:42.620 --> 25:43.620
That's a little preachy.

25:43.620 --> 25:44.620
Yeah.

25:44.620 --> 25:45.620
Okay.

25:45.620 --> 25:58.240
21 on one, I do kind of like it as like a get competitive, like don't be afraid to get

25:58.240 --> 25:59.240
out there.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.240
Choose an enemy.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
You know?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.000
21 on one.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Prove yourself.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Jesus.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.040
That was rough to even say it now.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.800
It's rough even the one time.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.320
Now I do like, I will say.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
21 on one.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.480
Do it you fucking chicken.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
Bet you won't.

26:14.480 --> 26:20.480
I do like this, this feeling of going from very aspirational and very motivational to

26:20.480 --> 26:23.880
much more like, listen, we're moving towards apocalypse as far as we know.

26:23.880 --> 26:24.880
It's time to get tough.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.960
It's time to get tough.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.000
Like we've all been building ourselves up.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.200
Now it's time to break it down.

26:31.200 --> 26:36.860
And then maybe we can just do 20 chicken run and then we're going to tell people.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.200
I was taking a drink of water.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.200
You son of a bastard.

26:40.200 --> 26:45.080
I was just saying that it's a great funny flick and that, you know, we could encourage

26:45.080 --> 26:47.000
people and maybe turn back to it.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.880
It didn't get its day in the sun.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.300
It did not get its day in the sun.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.200
It sounds like chicken run needs to chase the sun.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.200
Yeah.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.200
Hmm.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.860
How about, how about 2020 Dune?

26:57.860 --> 26:58.860
Work on rhyming.

26:58.860 --> 26:59.860
Hmm.

26:59.860 --> 27:00.860
Okay.

27:00.860 --> 27:01.860
Is this from the audience?

27:01.860 --> 27:02.860
It's to celebrate.

27:02.860 --> 27:03.860
No, it's to celebrate.

27:03.860 --> 27:05.120
The release of Dune.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.960
The major motion picture.

27:06.960 --> 27:11.160
I have gotten 30, oh my God, I shouldn't have asked for it.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.160
You really should know.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.280
I told you not to.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.120
Also the bad thing is I, you know, Griffin told me to.

27:16.120 --> 27:20.680
Also I asked for them to be sent to both me and Barack Obama, so it's going to be a complicated

27:20.680 --> 27:21.680
day for him.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.680
Oh boy.

27:22.680 --> 27:27.820
I'm just going to read them and if you guys like one enough to consider it, I will tell

27:27.820 --> 27:28.820
you who said it.

27:28.820 --> 27:29.820
Okay.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.400
Well, no, if you say it on the show, you should say who said it.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.760
But people's usernames are so weird.

27:34.760 --> 27:39.840
I don't even, I can't, okay, this is from blended chicken noodle soup.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.840
Jamie's got a gun.

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
Hmm.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.840
No.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
That's a, but we're not even going to get 20 in there.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.480
I feel pretty strongly we should at least have 20.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.480
Yeah.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.480
All right.

27:48.480 --> 27:55.760
Um, see, I'm saying, okay, Mal said 2021 W-O-N, but I feel like that is just begging

27:55.760 --> 27:56.760
for it.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.760
That's right.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.760
Yeah.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.760
Begging.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.880
Some more buns, some, some more buns.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.720
Okay.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.200
Trace mask face mask says 2020 done.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.680
We're not going to take it.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.680
Hmm.

28:09.680 --> 28:15.760
But this is, this is also the type of thing I'm like, it feels so obvious.

28:15.760 --> 28:19.400
Like we should all not, we should also, we should continue to not take it.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.480
Oh, okay.

28:20.480 --> 28:26.200
Mr. Skeleton suggests 2020 shun and it's a year about removing toxic people from their

28:26.200 --> 28:27.200
life.

28:27.200 --> 28:34.160
I like the, I like the idea, but shun to me has such a powerful negative feeling.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
Yeah.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.000
How about, how about 2020 stun?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Looking so good.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.760
Um, that's, that's not it.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.760
Um.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.360
No, I'm just trying to think of rhyming words.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.680
Ah, let's, let's make a deal here.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.680
The second, the second 20 has got to do some lifting.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.680
Yeah.

28:54.680 --> 28:55.680
Right.

28:55.680 --> 28:59.840
I think, I feel like you can't just do 2020 and then rhyme with the last word.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.840
Right.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.680
That's why 20 on a bun is so powerful.

29:02.680 --> 29:03.680
Yeah.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.680
20 overcome.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.680
Hmm.

29:05.680 --> 29:11.080
Not close enough for me, but I am a stickler to be fair.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
Yeah.

29:12.080 --> 29:17.720
If, if un wasn't such an easily rhymeable syllable, I would give it to you.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.720
Yeah.

29:18.720 --> 29:19.720
Okay.

29:19.720 --> 29:27.440
Now here's one from Pete, Pete queer that I want to hit you guys with 27 y'all.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.440
Ooh.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.440
Ooh.

29:29.440 --> 29:33.400
That's pretty good.

29:33.400 --> 29:39.440
How about 27 y'all savor the grape, savor the grape.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.440
This is like Travis's.

29:40.440 --> 29:46.720
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to save this one 20, 27 y'all savor the grape.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.160
I can't believe I spelled that right.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.280
And then savor the grape.

29:52.280 --> 29:56.960
So that one's kind of like Travis's hot dog one, except for grapes.

29:56.960 --> 29:57.960
Yes.

29:57.960 --> 29:58.960
Okay.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.560
Um, not bad, not bad.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.880
So what have we got so far on the list that we like?

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
Yeah.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.000
I mean, honestly, it's 20 chase the sun is tough for me.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.160
20 chase the sun solar, solar power.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.160
It really gets me going.

30:14.160 --> 30:19.880
And I'll tell you why, because it sounds like, it sounds like something that would be printed

30:19.880 --> 30:28.920
quite cheaply on a t-shirt that we would get on a Southern Baptist winter retreat or something

30:28.920 --> 30:33.320
along those lines, chase the sun solar power.

30:33.320 --> 30:40.280
It's a little new age exercise class vibe.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.580
So I don't know about that, but Oh, I'm tempted.

30:43.580 --> 30:47.840
Now to be fair, Griffin, I think it would make it a little bit more a Southern Baptist

30:47.840 --> 30:56.680
retreat if it was S-O-N, but wait, hold on, Travis has brought up a good point that there

30:56.680 --> 31:02.560
is a homonym opportunity here that we, a homonym opportunity here that we should dip our snoots

31:02.560 --> 31:03.560
into.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.960
Justin, I need you to turn off Twitter just for a second so we can take this conversation.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.880
What about 20 begotten son?

31:08.880 --> 31:12.280
No, 20 chase the son, S-O-N sun.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.920
So S-O-U-L-A-R power.

31:14.920 --> 31:19.920
And then we are, we have made a hard swing.

31:19.920 --> 31:25.360
We have really planted a flag in the ground at that point.

31:25.360 --> 31:32.480
Did you hear they're recording a new demographic over at my brother, my brother and me.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.160
I deleted the tweet asking for name suggestions.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.440
Hopefully that will stem the tide.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.440
Okay.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.400
I imagine that you got about 400 in the interim.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.240
350 actually, thank you very much.

31:45.240 --> 31:51.800
So what do you think, Justin, about a hard Christian slogan?

31:51.800 --> 31:54.440
Does that mean it has to be 20 chase the son S-O-N?

31:54.440 --> 31:55.440
Yes, correct.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.440
Okay.

31:56.440 --> 32:03.280
Ah, man, it's just enough people that have a complicated past with Jesus and all of his

32:03.280 --> 32:04.280
great friends.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.280
I wouldn't love that.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.280
Yeah, I see that.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.280
I see that.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.280
I see that.

32:08.280 --> 32:13.400
Okay, but now, but now boys, here's the Piccadillo we've gotten ourselves into.

32:13.400 --> 32:20.000
Now I feel like we can't go with 20 chase the S-U-N solar power because people are going

32:20.000 --> 32:26.480
to think that we're trying to backdoor it in now, that there's no way we're trying to

32:26.480 --> 32:30.680
get a little bit of Jesus in there for you.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.800
There's just enough.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.080
It's just like silverback, you know what I mean?

32:34.080 --> 32:36.280
There's like a mild pecan of Jesus.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.680
There's a sliver of Jesus.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.680
Life house.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.680
There's just a kiss.

32:40.680 --> 32:41.680
Just a kiss of Jesus.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.680
A life house.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
A kiss of Jesus.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.680
Life house.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.680
Half teaspoon of Jesus.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.520
20, okay, I am on rhyme zone now, 20 megaton.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.400
That feels 20 megaton is like, we don't need it.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.440
We don't need that level of-

32:55.440 --> 32:57.080
But that's a powerful rhyme.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.080
I will just say it's a good rhyme.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.680
It is powerful.

32:59.680 --> 33:03.560
It's not quite as good as chicken run, which I think we all agree is the way we're leaning

33:03.560 --> 33:04.560
right now.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.200
I'm still sticking by 20 on a bone.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.000
The message that I'm leaning towards is this.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.600
And it's the thing that I think could be the most pragmatic and the kind of thing I would

33:15.600 --> 33:22.760
stand behind is that as the year 2020 has been dog shit, but I feel like the thing that

33:22.760 --> 33:33.120
has come out of it is a toughened hide or an adoption of certain skill sets or becoming

33:33.120 --> 33:38.200
an expert in a certain type of thing or doing things that you didn't know you were capable

33:38.200 --> 33:39.200
of.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.200
All of that is powerful stuff.

33:40.200 --> 33:45.720
That is the kind of stuff that you do when you're faced with a rough situation.

33:45.720 --> 33:51.280
I want to encourage people not to shed that, not to lose that.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.280
You know what I mean?

33:52.280 --> 33:58.000
Even when it's all over, there's good stuff that comes with toughening your chitin a little

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
bit.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Yeah.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
But how do you rhyme that with un?

34:01.000 --> 34:04.960
Oh, but you weren't building to a theme.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.840
No.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.280
What about 20?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.280
It's begun.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.280
Ooh.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.280
I like that.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.960
20 it's begun.

34:12.960 --> 34:16.840
We did forget to do commercials.

34:16.840 --> 34:22.040
I'm wondering if we should do those and then, uh, get back into, what do you think?

34:22.040 --> 34:23.400
Yeah, that would give me some time.

34:23.400 --> 34:28.140
And the commercials people, listen, I'm not going to be all in the right head space for

34:28.140 --> 34:29.140
these commercials.

34:29.140 --> 34:30.140
I'm going to be thinking of rhymes with one.

34:30.140 --> 34:37.400
Can I just say, Rhyme Zone, got a lot of on, not a lot of un, because mastodon is good,

34:37.400 --> 34:39.680
but that doesn't rhyme with 21.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.880
Maybe we all just start saying it's 20-20 on.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.880
20-20 on.

34:43.880 --> 34:48.320
And then we can, okay, let's go to the money's on.

34:48.320 --> 35:05.240
20, my grandson.

35:05.240 --> 35:16.920
Folks it's me, a paid endorsement guy, and I want to talk to you about, let me see this

35:16.920 --> 35:19.920
here, Squarespace.

35:19.920 --> 35:24.880
Seems like, um, I mean, this isn't my kind of thing, but, uh, it says here you can make

35:24.880 --> 35:27.000
a website and it's really easy.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.600
They got a lot of different kinds of people that are doing it and it sounds like a good

35:32.600 --> 35:33.600
deal.

35:33.600 --> 35:40.160
Uh, they got coaches on here and writers and, and, uh, designers, instructors, record labels

35:40.160 --> 35:47.320
and agencies and art galleries and healthcare and financial services, and they're all, uh,

35:47.320 --> 35:48.320
making websites.

35:48.320 --> 35:54.520
You, I never knew really how those were getting made, but I guess you can do it yourself.

35:54.520 --> 35:59.960
And take it from me, a paid endorser, this is the number one way I know of to make a

35:59.960 --> 36:05.960
website and, uh, uses Squarespace that the templates on there, you gotta see them.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.960
Oh boy.

36:06.960 --> 36:13.200
They're gonna, they're, it's, they are just top notch, um, uh, analytics.

36:13.200 --> 36:20.840
So you can make sure your dad's visiting as often as he says he is and, um, great hosting,

36:20.840 --> 36:24.400
you know, they'll put a charcuterie out or whatever for your guests.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.480
I don't know all the ins and outs of this kind of techno babble stuff.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.120
Let me see here.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.640
Um, oh, there's a, so we got a deal for our listeners.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.760
Take it from me, a paid endorser.

36:35.760 --> 36:42.500
If you go to squarespace.com slash my brother up, my brother for a free trial.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.700
And when you're ready to launch, you can use the offer code, my brother, my brother, sorry,

my brother to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.480
So you, I guess you have to buy the websites.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.980
I I'm sorry, folks, I can't make heads or tails of it, but Squarespace seems like a

37:00.980 --> 37:05.000
good thing and they're a good friend of the show and good friend of the program.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.640
And I'm just so happy to have him supporting, uh, my brother and, and my brother and me.

37:10.640 --> 37:14.320
And Justin is, Justin's now taking off his headphones and leaving the sound booth.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.800
Oh, he's gotten in his car.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.840
It's driven away.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.280
You know what I miss?

37:22.280 --> 37:23.280
What do you miss Travis?

37:23.280 --> 37:25.200
I miss licking stamps.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.960
You remember when you used to have to lick stamps?

37:27.960 --> 37:28.960
You remember this?

37:28.960 --> 37:29.960
Sure.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.840
And you lick the envelopes and you'd send them to people and they know you, your tongue

37:33.840 --> 37:36.720
had touched their envelopes in at least two places.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.720
You remember this?

37:37.720 --> 37:38.720
Yeah.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.720
It's like a, yeah, it's like a kiss.

37:39.720 --> 37:40.720
Yeah.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.280
But like the tongue, I French kissed this letter for you.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.280
Yeah.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
You don't do that anymore.

37:44.280 --> 37:48.260
So what's the point of even going to the post office if you can't lick the envelopes?

37:48.260 --> 37:51.460
You might as well just use stamps.com at this point.

37:51.460 --> 37:54.640

37:54.640 --> 37:58.640

Together we're The Flophouse.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.120
Know the Movie, and also Who's That Grandma?

podcasts.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
Bye!

39:46.160 --> 39:51.720
That was certainly enough time for us to come up with some good names for the year.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.400
Because I'm looking at the list.

39:53.400 --> 39:57.240
I was carrying a load on my shoulders of advertising, as was Travis.

39:57.240 --> 40:00.720
Griffin, why don't you just slather them on, baby?

40:00.720 --> 40:08.160
Okay, I had 20 Never Done, Keep It Going, Keep the Fire.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.520
20 Never Done.

40:10.520 --> 40:15.160
What about 20 Octagon, Let's All Do MMA?

40:15.160 --> 40:17.840
Again, we're getting back into On territory.

40:17.840 --> 40:18.840
Oh, you're right.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.840
You're right.

40:19.840 --> 40:20.840
You're right.

40:20.840 --> 40:21.840
20 Tons of Fun?

40:21.840 --> 40:27.240
20 Tons of Fun, it could be the sequel to 20 Funny, Fill Your Life with Laughter and

40:27.240 --> 40:28.240
Love that everybody's asking for.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.280
It could be the sequel to Operation Dubber Trout.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.240
20 Saskatchewan.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.200
Again, you're back in On Town, Trav.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.040
I need you to get off whatever Rhyme Zone page you're on, because it's not treating

40:40.040 --> 40:41.040
you well.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.040
It's just Rhyme Zone.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.040
It's the page I'm on.

40:43.040 --> 40:48.240
It's not 2020 none, but in you in, and then it's like, cloister up.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.240
Cloister up.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.800
I do like cloister up.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.280
Yeah, that's what we need right now.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.280
We should be in cloister.

40:54.280 --> 40:58.280
Well, now I feel like we're one year behind at that point, right?

40:58.280 --> 41:02.720
We would have seemed absolutely prophetic if we had been like, it's 20 quarantine.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.720
What do we know?

41:03.720 --> 41:07.600
Fuck it.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.440
Let's review where we're at right now and see if any of them are strong enough, because

41:10.440 --> 41:11.800
I feel like there's two.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.440
For me, there's two right now.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.440
Okay.

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
And it's 20 on a bun.

41:15.440 --> 41:20.360
No, it's 20 on the run, let's lay low, and 20 Chase the Sun solar powers.

41:20.360 --> 41:25.080
Now, you're not willing to give 20 on a bun even the third spot there, just for-

41:25.080 --> 41:26.080
I hate 20 on a bun.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.080
You do!

41:27.080 --> 41:28.080
Oh, okay.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.640
No, I would take any F of ever 20 on a bun.

41:29.640 --> 41:33.440
Now, 20 on a bun, this is going to be down to business, where people are going to be

41:33.440 --> 41:34.440
like, I can't believe-

41:34.440 --> 41:35.440
It's not!

41:35.440 --> 41:36.440
No, we're never doing that again.

41:36.440 --> 41:37.440
I can't believe you didn't do 20 on a bun.

41:37.440 --> 41:42.160
I want to walk you through my next pitch, because I am looking at Rhyme Zone, and one

41:42.160 --> 41:46.600
of the rhymes on Rhyme Zone is home run, but how do you make that fit in with the right

41:46.600 --> 41:47.900
number of syllables?

41:47.900 --> 41:57.420
And what my mind immediately jumped to was 20 big home run, 20 big home run, knock it

41:57.420 --> 41:58.420
out the park.

41:58.420 --> 41:59.960
20 big home run.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.960
This one's for the game.

42:01.960 --> 42:09.360
20 big home- Slam it.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.360
Grand salami.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.680
Angels in the outfield.

42:12.680 --> 42:18.340
There's a lot of baseball stuff that's inspiring to the layman, somebody who doesn't really

42:18.340 --> 42:21.880
care about sports or baseball in particular.

42:21.880 --> 42:25.920
There's a lot of stuff that I do know, just through osmosis, about baseball.

42:25.920 --> 42:30.640
We've just messed this up so badly every year, I just want to do it right.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.960
Yeah, like 20 on a bun, where it's really actionable.

42:32.960 --> 42:37.000
How is 20 big home run doing it wrong, Justin?

42:37.000 --> 42:41.840
I'm genuinely asking because I feel like you're poo-pooing what is my current favorite idea.

42:41.840 --> 42:47.440
It's not that, it's that like, imagine we get to July, right?

42:47.440 --> 42:57.080
And the bug king is like, so you thought this year would be a home run, fascinating.

42:57.080 --> 43:00.560
Tell me more about podcasts.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.840
I mean, but that's hope, isn't it?

43:02.840 --> 43:04.960
There's no such thing as false hope, huh?

43:04.960 --> 43:11.680
I could have a great year and not get a home run, you know?

43:11.680 --> 43:16.820
I just think it would be cool if all of our fans were all of a sudden wearing baseball

43:16.820 --> 43:21.440
merchandise and then people would be like, what the fuck?

43:21.440 --> 43:28.240
We could have some fun with that nasty, scary, ugly baseball man on the big- oh fuck, what

43:28.240 --> 43:29.240
are those movies?

43:29.240 --> 43:32.800
They made like a million of them, it's like nasty baseball humor.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
Major League.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
Major League, thank you, Travis.

43:34.800 --> 43:35.800
Yeah.

43:35.800 --> 43:36.960
You know what I'm talking about?

43:36.960 --> 43:41.200
We could have our own little Mr. Baseball guy and that's fun.

43:41.200 --> 43:45.760
Well, over here in Cincinnati, his name is Mr. Redlegs.

43:45.760 --> 43:51.440
Yeah, we don't have a mascot and we could have like a big baseball guy mascot for 20

43:51.440 --> 43:53.800
big home run.

43:53.800 --> 43:59.280
I think, okay, I'm on the hook for big home run, 20 big home run.

43:59.280 --> 44:03.920
Now, Griffin, I need you to reel me in with that just killer tagline.

44:03.920 --> 44:05.440
Subtitle, yeah.

44:05.440 --> 44:08.640
That's where we're struggling, huh?

44:08.640 --> 44:13.160
What about 20 big home run, no, bring them home, has home in it again.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.480
Yeah, you can't have home in it twice, I think.

44:15.480 --> 44:19.000
Oh, 20 big home run, round and third.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Like we're-

44:20.000 --> 44:22.680
We're almost there.

44:22.680 --> 44:23.680
That feels Christian.

44:23.680 --> 44:27.240
Yeah, that actually feels more Christian than 20 Chase the Sun.

44:27.240 --> 44:28.240
Okay.

44:28.240 --> 44:29.240
20 big home run.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.240
Doesn't it feel really Christian?

44:30.240 --> 44:31.240
A little bit.

44:31.240 --> 44:35.360
20 big home run for all the marbles.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.280
But they don't really do marbles in baseball.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.800
No, they don't, do they?

44:39.800 --> 44:42.200
Is there a way to incorporate angels in the outfield?

44:42.200 --> 44:48.560
20 big home run, thanks, angels.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.440
Thank an angel today.

44:50.440 --> 44:57.560
Guys, I don't feel like you're going to shake me off 20 Chase the Sun.

44:57.560 --> 45:01.400
I feel like it's so powerful.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.800
Can I try this?

45:02.800 --> 45:03.800
I'm just going to put this-

45:03.800 --> 45:05.120
You can try anything, it's a podcast.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.600
Okay, I'm just going to try this.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.080
Try everything.

45:08.080 --> 45:15.640
I don't know if we brought up Zozo last year as a thing because of the two and zero, right?

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
Yeah, no, I get it.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.680
Can we do Zozi?

45:18.680 --> 45:19.680
Zozi.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.920
Okay, but what does that mean?

45:21.920 --> 45:28.080
I don't know, man, but it's a cool little word there, isn't it?

45:28.080 --> 45:29.080
Zozi is-

45:29.080 --> 45:30.080
Zozi.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.080
Zozi.

45:31.080 --> 45:37.600
It could be something that you say in the dark a few times, I don't know.

45:37.600 --> 45:42.120
It's perhaps the least merchable thing you've said so far.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.120
Are you kidding?

45:43.120 --> 45:45.240
I mean, Z-O-Z-I, that would be like-

45:45.240 --> 45:46.240
What is that?

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
Who is that?

45:47.240 --> 45:48.240
I must date them.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
You see that on my shirt.

45:49.240 --> 45:56.560
Let's do an ARG where we slowly reveal what Zozi is over the course of the year.

45:56.560 --> 45:57.560
It's 2021.

45:57.560 --> 46:02.400
Yeah, but I mean, is it a luxury lifestyle brand?

46:02.400 --> 46:04.240
What are we doing with it?

46:04.240 --> 46:07.040
Let me see what URLs we could get.

46:07.040 --> 46:11.880
On 2025, I also went to Sosi, right?

46:11.880 --> 46:16.880
Because it could kind of be that, and then I thought about how 2024 could just be Sosa,

46:16.880 --> 46:23.440
and then we could do 20 big home run, something something Sammy Sosa.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.640
So we have 2024, set that one aside.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.000
Put that one in the time capsule.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.840
Yeah, Sosa's locked up.

46:29.840 --> 46:33.720
20 big home run, 7-th inning stretch.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.880
It doesn't mean anything, it's just very baseball.

46:36.880 --> 46:37.880
Yeah.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.200
20 big home run, bases loaded.

46:40.200 --> 46:43.680
You know what I like about that?

46:43.680 --> 46:53.080
What I like about that is it's saying everything is in position for you to blast off, and maybe

46:53.080 --> 46:54.200
you won't, maybe you don't.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.800
It leaves room for failure.

46:55.800 --> 46:56.800
There's plenty of time.

46:56.800 --> 47:00.800
Base is loaded, and baseball doesn't always mean a good thing because it's a lot of pressure.

47:00.800 --> 47:03.440
But you did just say big home run right before it, didn't you?

47:03.440 --> 47:04.440
I mean, you did just say it.

47:04.440 --> 47:09.800
Well, I mean, I think that that implies that the chances of success are high, but the rest

47:09.800 --> 47:13.080
of that could be, this could be a big home run.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.840
It's almost backwards, right?

47:15.840 --> 47:17.840
It is actually explicitly backwards.

47:17.840 --> 47:21.360
You would want it to be bases loaded before you start thinking about the big home run

47:21.360 --> 47:22.400
you're about to score.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.400
But you're stepping up to the plate here, right?

47:24.400 --> 47:27.440
And here's the thing, everybody believes in you, right?

47:27.440 --> 47:29.840
Because they're like, this could be a big home run.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.720
No one's saying, oh no, I wish it wasn't them at the plate.

47:32.720 --> 47:33.720
Right.

47:33.720 --> 47:37.600
What about 20 big home run, we all believe in you.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.400
We're all behind you.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.360
We're all behind you.

47:41.360 --> 47:51.600
We, whoa, whoa, whoa, 20 big home run, be your own angel.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.960
You're at the plate.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.500
The bases are loaded.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.920
You look in the set.

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
Who's that with the wings?

47:56.920 --> 47:57.920
It's you.

47:57.920 --> 47:58.920
It's you.

47:58.920 --> 48:00.840
You're looking at you saying you got this.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.200
You're also Joe Sukhoi and Levitt.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.880
You're your own angel.

48:04.880 --> 48:08.520
Be your own angel, 20 big home run.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.360
If I could just trunk it- 20 big home run.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.640
We're all angels now.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.420
No, let's see that's- No, just 20 big home run.

48:17.420 --> 48:18.880
Be the angel.

48:18.880 --> 48:23.400
20 big home run, be the angel, because that means that you don't have to get the home

48:23.400 --> 48:24.400
run, do you?

48:24.400 --> 48:29.920
You just have to see a big home run, be able to recognize it, and maybe you're the one

48:29.920 --> 48:30.920
flapping now.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.000
You're the one flapping.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
You can flap your- You're flapping a big home run.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.280
You're flapping now.

48:37.280 --> 48:41.560
It's almost a weird parallel to 20 Frankenstein team.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.560
Become the monster.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.560
Yeah.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.560
20 big home run.

48:44.560 --> 48:45.560
Be the angel.

48:45.560 --> 48:46.560
I like this.

48:46.560 --> 48:49.220
Because people think maybe you're supporting yourself, maybe you're supporting someone

48:49.220 --> 48:50.280
else who needs it.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.280
It's disarming.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.840
If somebody sees that on a shirt, they would be like, oh, that's nice.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.560
But it's like, no, you don't understand.

48:55.560 --> 48:59.840
I mean an angel in the context of cheating at sports to slam one right out of the fucking

48:59.840 --> 49:00.840
park.

49:00.840 --> 49:04.400
This isn't about protecting someone just out on the street or whatever.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.760
My dad, I'm trying to get my dad's love back.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.120
That's the only way I could do that.

49:08.120 --> 49:11.440
Or I'm defending my thesis today, and I'm going to be the angel.

49:11.440 --> 49:15.680
I'm not going to be the one up there hoping that somebody comes and helps me.

49:15.680 --> 49:18.800
I'm the angel in this one.

49:18.800 --> 49:24.520
I'm a being of celestial might, and I'm going to get up there, I'm going to win the roller

49:24.520 --> 49:25.520
derby.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.160
Now, is it too late to think more about 20 Bunny Fun?

49:28.160 --> 49:32.360
20 Bunny Fun feels like the one we're going to pivot to in August when we realized that

49:32.360 --> 49:34.640
no one was their own angel.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.640
No one's their own angel.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.700
We didn't chase the sun.

49:36.700 --> 49:37.700
Nobody ate a hot dog.

49:37.700 --> 49:43.660
Because the thing is that this, the one weakness of 20 Big Home Run, be the angel, is that

49:43.660 --> 49:47.320
it is contingent on you having seen the film Angels in the Outfield.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.320
Yeah, yeah.

49:48.320 --> 49:50.960
It does require homework, doesn't it?

49:50.960 --> 49:52.720
It does.

49:52.720 --> 49:57.520
I feel like our listeners are of an age where they've definitely not seen that.

49:57.520 --> 50:01.280
You started that sentence thinking it was going to go one way, and then it decided to

50:01.280 --> 50:02.280
go another way.

50:02.280 --> 50:04.160
Well, we have a wide swath.

50:04.160 --> 50:07.700
Some people have probably seen and enjoyed Angels in the Outfield.

50:07.700 --> 50:08.920
Some people have probably not seen it.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.720
I refuse to believe that some people have seen it and not enjoyed it.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.720
That group does not exist.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.720
No, no, no, no.

50:14.720 --> 50:18.680
20 Big Home Run.

50:18.680 --> 50:26.760
Just someone say it, and I want to message it to our on-staff artists immediately.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.760
Okay.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.480
Well, I need this to be settled.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.280
It's the tagline that's because-

50:31.280 --> 50:34.280
Yeah, Big Home Run is really getting me.

50:34.280 --> 50:35.320
20 Big Home Run is it.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.640
I think we can agree on that, at least.

50:38.640 --> 50:42.300
But what's the most powerful thing?

50:42.300 --> 50:47.380
It could be be the angel, or be your own angel, I think is more explicit, and I like that,

50:47.380 --> 50:48.380
but it's a little-

50:48.380 --> 50:50.580
Let's think about Big Home Run terminology.

50:50.580 --> 50:54.280
It's out of here.

50:54.280 --> 50:58.260
Big Home Run, flamma jamma, you know?

50:58.260 --> 51:02.160
Big Home Run- Knock the skin off the dang thing.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.240
Knock the skin off that greasy cheddar.

51:05.240 --> 51:09.760
Big Home Run, sliding into fur- No, Big Home Run-

51:09.760 --> 51:10.760
Eye on the ball.

51:10.760 --> 51:13.000
Eye on the ball.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Eye on the ball.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Shoot the moon.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.600
No.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.280
Big Home Run, call your shot.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.920
Ooh, I like that.

51:20.920 --> 51:23.920
Call your shot is good.

51:23.920 --> 51:28.240
It sounds like we are saying, ooh, ooh, Justin.

51:28.240 --> 51:31.200
I kind of got chills a little bit.

51:31.200 --> 51:32.200
Did you get chills?

51:32.200 --> 51:33.200
A little bit of chills from that.

51:33.200 --> 51:34.880
20 Big Home Run, call your shot.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.480
Ooh, I like that.

51:36.480 --> 51:40.000
There's a level of confidence, a little bit of swagger to that that I love.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.040
Yes, but also you're the one determining the boundaries of your own success, aren't you?

51:44.040 --> 51:47.440
Yeah, you could call a very close shot if you wanted to.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.640
Call whatever shot you want.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.640
This isn't about Judgement.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.640
I'm hitting it over there.

51:50.640 --> 51:51.880
It's like 10 feet.

51:51.880 --> 51:53.080
I know.

51:53.080 --> 51:57.240
It's a few inches behind shoot your shot, which is a thing I feel like people said a

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
lot this year.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.400
Just like, yeah, send a, you're in love with this Instagram model.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.400
Send them a message.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.400
That's how I met my wife.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.400
Shoot your shot.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.400
But this one's like-

52:05.400 --> 52:06.400
Works for everybody.

52:06.400 --> 52:13.160
This one's like, if you can think about messaging the Instagram model that you want to marry,

52:13.160 --> 52:16.000
but you don't actually have to do it, just call it.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Call your shot.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Just call the shot.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
I would like to do that.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
You don't even have to do it at that point.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
See, that's the thing.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.560
Everybody talks about that one time when Babe Ruth did it and nailed it.

52:24.560 --> 52:28.160
Nobody talks about the hundreds of thousands of other times that people point at a stand

52:28.160 --> 52:29.160
and they don't.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.160
Every time he pointed.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.160
Like, come on.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.160
Sometimes he would start kind of waving generally.

52:33.160 --> 52:38.160
He would just point, pass himself into the catcher's mitt.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.160
Yeah.

52:39.160 --> 52:43.600
That's the gold shot.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.600
It's going right there.

52:44.600 --> 52:48.920
It's going to be a great pitch from my friend Doug, who just because he's on the other team

52:48.920 --> 52:49.920
is still my friend.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.000
I still love him.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.800
We still hang out.

52:52.800 --> 53:00.080
There's an intentionality to this that I feel like will be genuinely helpful as we transition

53:00.080 --> 53:06.160
out of quarantine times to just set some goal.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.900
That's all you got to do.

53:07.900 --> 53:12.680
It's going to be a weird transition no matter what, but if you have, if you call your shot,

53:12.680 --> 53:15.120
you might just get that big home run.

53:15.120 --> 53:21.060
It does, again, boys, give us access to the powerful iconography of a big, ugly baseball

53:21.060 --> 53:23.560
head man to use on merchandise.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.080
I do like that idea.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.120
We're already human bobble heads.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.120
Why not bring it home?

53:28.120 --> 53:29.120
Yeah, let's have our own.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.640
I'm talking about partnerships with Big League Chew.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.640
I'm talking about baseball caps.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.640
Hello.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.720
I'm talking about sponsoring little league teams all over the country.

53:35.720 --> 53:40.440
Man, if we sold out, guys, these slogans used to be about the people.

53:40.440 --> 53:41.440
No, no, no.

53:41.440 --> 53:44.480
I just got excited about actually sponsoring little league teams.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.480
Or I guess-

53:45.480 --> 53:46.480
Oh, no.

53:46.480 --> 53:47.480
That's very good.

53:47.480 --> 53:48.480
That's really actually super good.

53:48.480 --> 53:51.480
It's possible to sponsor people's work softball teams.

53:51.480 --> 53:55.460
Now, I realize they're probably already sponsored by the business that they work for.

53:55.460 --> 54:01.720
But if I could pay to have my name above that business, Travis's Subway Warriors or something,

54:01.720 --> 54:03.720
that would be very exciting to me.

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
That's cool.

54:04.720 --> 54:05.720
Okay.

54:05.720 --> 54:06.720
Now, in terms of URLs-

54:06.720 --> 54:08.760
Oh, they would be the Subway Home Run Artists.

54:08.760 --> 54:09.760
Excuse me.

54:09.760 --> 54:10.760
I can get bighome.run.

54:10.760 --> 54:11.760
Ooh.

54:11.760 --> 54:12.760
You can't get bighomerun.com?

54:12.760 --> 54:15.760
Of course not.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.880
I can get bighomerun.art.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.280
I like that.

54:20.280 --> 54:24.040
I can get bighomerun.me, bighomerun.click.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.320
Bighomerun.org is just right there.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.320
What about bighomerun.gov?

54:27.320 --> 54:28.320
No.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.320
Bighomerun.biz.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.320
Bighomerun.biz is available.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
Okay.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.320
What about bighomerun.geocities.com?

54:32.320 --> 54:33.320
I'm not going to spend $18 on bighomerun.biz.

54:33.320 --> 54:34.320
I like bighomerun.run.

54:34.320 --> 54:47.120
Bighomerun.run, but that's what breaks the flow.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
That feels good to say.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.120
Bighomerun.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.000
It feels like it changes it a little bit.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.340
Oh, this bighomerun.run.

54:52.340 --> 54:53.340
It almost sounds like that.

54:53.340 --> 54:54.340
Yeah.

54:54.340 --> 54:55.340
All right.

54:55.340 --> 54:56.340
I'll get bighomerun.run.

54:56.340 --> 54:57.340
All right.

54:57.340 --> 54:59.640
Is it too late to change it to bigdogrun?

54:59.640 --> 55:00.640
Bigdogrun.

55:00.640 --> 55:01.640
Run, dog, run.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.640
20 rundogrun.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.640
20 rundogrun.

55:03.640 --> 55:04.640
20 bighomerun.

55:04.640 --> 55:05.640
Be the big dog.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.640
Bigdogrun.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
20 bigdogrun.

55:07.640 --> 55:08.640
No bones about it.

55:08.640 --> 55:09.640
We've lost the plot in a pretty major way.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.640
I think...

55:10.640 --> 55:11.640
Oh, man.

55:11.640 --> 55:12.640
Bigdogrun.

55:12.640 --> 55:13.640
No bones about it, though.

55:13.640 --> 55:14.640
It's very good.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.640
We always do this to ourselves.

55:15.640 --> 55:16.640
We can't do...

55:16.640 --> 55:35.640
20 bigdogrun.

55:35.640 --> 55:36.640
It's meaningless.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.640
20 bigdogrun.

55:37.640 --> 55:38.640
No bones about it.

55:38.640 --> 55:39.640
It's right there.

55:39.640 --> 55:40.640
That's what I don't understand.

55:40.640 --> 55:47.640
Have you guys ever seen the movie Sliding Doors?

55:47.640 --> 56:00.640
It's the two paths have diverged through the once-in-a-lifetime.

56:00.640 --> 56:11.640
You cannot, we cannot go wrong with a year called 20 bigdog.

56:11.640 --> 56:18.640
Because it is strictly defies reason.

56:18.640 --> 56:22.640
20 bigdogrun will definitely achieve this year.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.640
No bones about it.

56:23.640 --> 56:25.640
No bones about it.

56:25.640 --> 56:38.640
20 bigdogrun.

56:38.640 --> 56:42.640
What's great is we can save 20 big homerun for 2031 if we need to.

56:42.640 --> 56:43.640
That's right.

56:43.640 --> 56:44.640
Yeah.

56:44.640 --> 56:45.640
That's true.

56:45.640 --> 56:46.640
That's true.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.640
What does bigdogrun mean?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.640
Does it...

56:50.640 --> 56:55.640
Bigdogrun, it sounds fucking great to say it.

56:55.640 --> 56:56.640
Yeah.

56:56.640 --> 56:59.640
I already paid for big homerun.

56:59.640 --> 57:00.640
Well, cool.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.640
Redirect that to bigdog.run.

57:02.640 --> 57:05.640
Bigdogrun.

57:05.640 --> 57:12.640
It's like saying, yeah, I was a little nervous about asking for a raise at work, but bigdog's

57:12.640 --> 57:13.640
got to run.

57:13.640 --> 57:14.640
But bigdogrun.

57:14.640 --> 57:15.640
No bones about it.

57:15.640 --> 57:16.640
Yeah.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
Bigdogrun.

57:17.640 --> 57:20.640
Okay, so I could get bigdog.run.

57:20.640 --> 57:21.640
Yeah.

57:21.640 --> 57:22.640
Now, are we going to get in trouble?

57:22.640 --> 57:25.640
Is the big dogs brand active?

57:25.640 --> 57:27.640
I can get bigdogrun.com.

57:27.640 --> 57:31.640
Yes.

57:31.640 --> 57:34.640
I think bigdog is DAWG.

57:34.640 --> 57:36.640
No.

57:36.640 --> 57:37.640
I don't think so.

57:37.640 --> 57:38.640
No.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.640
No.

57:39.640 --> 57:42.640
If you can get big DOG, bigdogrun.

57:42.640 --> 57:44.640
Bigdogrun.com?

57:44.640 --> 57:45.640
Yeah, bigdogrun.com.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.640
Or bigdog.run.

57:48.640 --> 57:50.640
Can we get both and redirect to each other?

57:50.640 --> 57:51.640
Yeah, I'll get both.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.640
Just an infinite sort of loop.

57:53.640 --> 57:54.640
Yeah.

57:54.640 --> 57:55.640
20 bigdogrun.

57:55.640 --> 57:58.640
No bones about it.

57:58.640 --> 57:59.640
I mean, I think that that's-

57:59.640 --> 58:00.640
That's it.

58:00.640 --> 58:01.640
I'll tell you, you can't mess it up.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.640
You can't mess that year up.

58:03.640 --> 58:12.640
If we can generate at least one prescriptive, okay, if this is a mantra, which is, I think,

58:12.640 --> 58:17.640
ultimately what these year names are, when would one deploy it?

58:17.640 --> 58:19.640
I think you nailed it, right?

58:19.640 --> 58:23.640
You know, I wasn't going to do it, but then I remember, bigdogrun, right?

58:23.640 --> 58:25.640
If you're going to run, you're a big dog.

58:25.640 --> 58:30.640
And if you get nervous about actually running, then you have the subtitle there that swings

58:30.640 --> 58:33.640
in to tell you, no bones about it.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.640
Yeah, bigdogrun.

58:35.640 --> 58:41.640
But again, I do have to, very important, ask if the big dog brand is going to be upset

58:41.640 --> 58:42.640
with us.

58:42.640 --> 58:47.640
I don't think that they can claim the idea of large canines is all theirs.

58:47.640 --> 58:49.640
Listen, okay.

58:49.640 --> 58:50.640
I'm going to head out.

58:50.640 --> 58:52.640
Let me head over to the trademark office.

58:52.640 --> 58:54.640
Okay.

58:54.640 --> 58:58.640
We've never done this on our website, on our podcast before, so let me just check.

58:58.640 --> 59:01.640
It would be, it would, we would-

59:01.640 --> 59:03.640
Just let me look at the trademark database.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.640
Big dog holdings, big dog cat.

59:05.640 --> 59:08.640
I mean, like, there's so many big dog things.

59:08.640 --> 59:10.640
I don't know that they can really get it.

59:10.640 --> 59:13.640
Yeah, I think we stand by it.

59:13.640 --> 59:14.640
And you know what, Griffin?

59:14.640 --> 59:16.640
Maybe this is the year we get sued by big dog.

59:16.640 --> 59:21.640
I feel like this is the year where we maybe tempt fate with big dog a little bit.

59:21.640 --> 59:24.640
What if we did get big dog to sue?

59:24.640 --> 59:27.640
I mean, if we could get sued by big dog, that would be like-

59:27.640 --> 59:33.640
Would there be a better ending of this podcast than us being sued out of business by big dog?

59:33.640 --> 59:37.640
What it will be is we'll have to become like indentured advertisers for them where it's

59:37.640 --> 59:40.640
just like every episode brought to you by big dog.

59:40.640 --> 59:42.640
That is the best case scenario, Travis.

59:42.640 --> 59:46.640
That is the best, that would be a great max fund drive push for us.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.640
We no longer make ad revenue.

59:48.640 --> 59:52.640
We work for big dog, unpaid.

59:52.640 --> 59:57.640
We are still digging out of that big dog hole, and there's no bones about that.

59:57.640 --> 59:59.640
No bones about it.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640
This is it.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.640
Okay, this is it, folks.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640
This is the year-

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.640
We got to make sure we say 20 in there.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640
20 big dog run.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.640
I almost feel like 20 is unnecessary at this point.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.640
20 big dog run.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640
No bones about it.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640
No bones about it.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.640
It's so bad.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.640
Okay, I'm looking at our trademark search.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.640
I think we're good.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.640
There is one here for big dog.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.640
There's a company called Big Dog Licensing that has the trademark on big dog as it refers

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640
to hot dog sandwiches.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640
Oh, we're fine.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.640
We're fine.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.640
We're fine.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.640
Thank you, folks, for listening to our program.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.640
We hope you're satisfied with the theme of this year.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:43.640
I hope you can bring the spirit and energy of 20 big dog run, no bones about it, into your life.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.640
I'm sure we'll have merchandise available soon, which is secondary to the thematic statement of-

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.640
Can we still at least have one piece of merchandise?

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.640
And it will say 20 big dog run, but it will have the ugly, nasty baseball head man in it.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.640
Yeah.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640
Okay, cool.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640
Yeah.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640
Yeah, we can do that for you.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.640
It's no problem.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.640
You're our brother, for crying out loud, you know?

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.640
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.640
Trav, do you have anything that you would like to mention?

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640
I sure do.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.640
If you would like to learn how to make your own podcast, which will determine the fate of the year,

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.640
well then, my friends, have we got a book for you and a free book event.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:25.640
Our how-to podcast book called Everybody Has a Podcast Except You,

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.640
we're doing that live book event January 26th at 9pm Eastern Time.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.640
We partner with six independent bookstores.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.640
If you pre-order from them, you'll get an exclusively designed book plate signed by one of us with your copy.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.640
While supplies last, just go to bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event for bookstore links and more event info.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:52.640
And in perhaps the most serendipitous occurrence, the January pin of the month is a Cerebus pin with the three of our faces on it.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.640
It is literally a big dog.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.640
Which is a big dog.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.640
It is a big dog, my friends.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:06.640
And that's going to be benefiting the NARAL, which fights for access to abortion care, birth control, paid parental leave, and protections from pregnancy discrimination.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.640
So get that pin of the month, show your big dog lifestyle, and support the NARAL.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.640
Travis, we have to say big dog run lifestyle every time.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640
Big dog run lifestyle.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.640
We can't give them ammunition to use against us.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640
You're right.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:25.640
We've also got a Knights Templar II Wacky Wizards sticker to show that you belong to a secret society.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:32.640
And that Candlelight's merch, if you're listening to this on the 4th, Candlelight's merch posters and stuff still available with proceeds going to Harmony House.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.640
So go get those.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:34.640
McElroymerch.com.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.640
The Sawbones book is out in paperback now.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.640
It's newly revised and updated for 2020.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.640
Bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.640
Get that book.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:53.640
They got, Justin and Sydney got totally boned and hosed and screwed when the book first came out with a series of uh-ohs and whoopsies that were heartbreaking.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.640
But now you can fix it by getting this new, better version of the Sawbones book.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.640
Yeah, please do that.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.640
Thank you.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.640
I really appreciate it.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.640
Bit.ly slash Sawbones paperback.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.640
And then, you know, you can go to bookshop.org or wherever you get books.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.640
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:14.640
You want to talk about some big dogs run and that's that network, the Maximum Fun network that we've been in.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.640
That's where the big dogs really run.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.640
I don't have any yahoos.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.640
I haven't even found any yahoos.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.640
I could just like make up a yahoo.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:30.640
No, no, no, let me, I'm going to go to the absolute first thing on yahoo dancers and we'll just cackle at it like buffoons.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.640
Oh, Justin, do you want to hit us with the final yahoo?

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.640
This one is from anonymous.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:44.640
Does Fireball's brain shake around in her skull like a shell?

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.640
Wait, wait, there's another one here.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.640
Atheists, what do you think about the discovery of a fossilized cage around a group of velociraptor bones?

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.640
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.640
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.640
The evidence is piling up on the atheists.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.640
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.640
Okay, that was the show.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.640
Hope you had some fun.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.640
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.640
Go back into the world.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.640
Face the day ahead.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:45.640
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
