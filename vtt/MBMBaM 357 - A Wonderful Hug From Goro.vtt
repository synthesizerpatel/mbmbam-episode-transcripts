00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.480
Tell everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.560
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.480
And I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.160
Listen, boys, here's the thing. I don't want to do My Brother, My Brother anymore.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.720
I want to just talk about Twin Peaks, and I have a pretty big, listen,

01:05.520 --> 01:09.840
but I have a bold theory that I would like to pitch to you guys.

01:09.840 --> 01:15.760
Welcome to our Twin Peaks theory cast, Twin... Three Peaks, no?

01:15.760 --> 01:17.040
Garman Bosia Boys.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.480
The Red Room Boys.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.200
The Red Room Boys.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.080
Red Room Boys.

01:20.080 --> 01:20.880
The Fun Lodge.

01:21.760 --> 01:22.240
Gum Boys.

01:22.240 --> 01:22.560
Gum you like.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.120
Peepums.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.280
Gum, the gum.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.160
The Bookhouse Boys.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.840
The Bookhouse Boys, done, cut, sold it.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.520
Got it, Bookhouse Boys.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.920
So, here's the thing. I've been watching Twin Peaks, The Return,

01:36.960 --> 01:39.360
and I realized it might have a connection.

01:39.360 --> 01:44.000
Did you guys know that there was a similarly named show that came out in the 90s?

01:44.960 --> 01:45.280
Okay.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.960
And I think the two might be connected.

01:48.960 --> 01:55.200
All right, so the theory is that Twin Peaks, The Return has a connection to another tele...

01:55.200 --> 01:58.400
Was the other television show David Lynch run as well?

01:58.400 --> 02:00.880
Because I know he likes to sort of weave his universes together.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.880
I haven't checked IMDb.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.200
I know Kyle McLaughlin is in both.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.000
Whoa, okay.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.600
Yeah, right?

02:07.600 --> 02:09.600
It's not Porlandi, is it?

02:09.600 --> 02:10.640
Because if that's the connection,

02:10.640 --> 02:13.360
then you've just named two things that Kyle McLaughlin's been in.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.520
No, it's Showgirls.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.120
No, wait, sorry.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.960
No, that's something different.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.640
But that is connected because those both take place in Nevada.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.840
2017 Twin Peaks takes place in Nevada.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.640
I'm talking about there's a 1990 show called Twin Peaks.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.360
What the fuck?

02:31.920 --> 02:32.400
I know.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.120
How did Showtime even get away with making this damn thing then?

02:37.120 --> 02:39.120
Well, the 90s were the Wild West.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.600
Nobody even has records of that shit anymore.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.080
But I found it buried deep on Netflix.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.600
And I was like, wait, what is this show?

02:46.640 --> 02:47.040
Yeah.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.920
Now, I think I remember this show that you're talking about from the 90s

02:49.920 --> 02:53.760
because it was on ABC, the America's broadcasting channel.

02:53.760 --> 02:57.840
And it came on right after TGIF.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.400
It was like, thank God it's Friday.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.440
And then at like 10, 30 PM, it's like, where's your God now?

03:04.880 --> 03:10.400
Because the show is, if I remember, kind of spooky and kind of fun and a little sexy.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.880
And so, what's the connection?

03:14.880 --> 03:17.680
Is it just the name or is there other stuff too?

03:17.680 --> 03:23.200
Griffin, listen, the list of connections is downright fucking spooky, right?

03:23.200 --> 03:23.760
Okay.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.640
So, I've been watching this 90s one.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.880
There's a woman with a log, right?

03:29.680 --> 03:30.000
Okay.

03:30.000 --> 03:38.320
In the new one, woman with a log, there's references to coffee in the 90s one.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.400
Hello?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.600
They talk about coffee in the 2017 one.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.200
That's about it.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.880
That's as far as the list goes, actually.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.000
Okay.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.280
That and Kyle McLaughlin.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.040
And break.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.960
Okay, so pretty fun bit.

03:52.960 --> 04:00.000
One of the things that I think would make it funnier is if you literally did not just

04:00.000 --> 04:03.040
list all the connective tissue between old Twin Peaks and new Twin Peaks.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.680
If the two Twin Peaks were in any way similar other than the ways you just listed, then

04:07.680 --> 04:09.680
it probably would have landed a little better.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.080
But it is, in fact, basically a completely different show.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.600
I'd like to, let's talk, can I try a different sort of Twin Peaks we're on?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.080
Sure.

04:16.080 --> 04:16.400
Oh, sure.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.360
And we're back in.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.360
Do you guys ever think that David Lynch just wants to fuck a big cup of coffee?

04:21.360 --> 04:25.280
Just watch any shows and stick with me.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.360
There's a lot of stuff that I think David Lynch is really horny for that I think we

04:29.360 --> 04:32.160
would consider avant-garde.

04:32.880 --> 04:33.120
Sure.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.920
That's a really flattering way of thinking about it.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.920
It's just like sometimes you watch things and you get a really close up picture of like

04:40.400 --> 04:45.200
some pie that like a woman wearing some 1950s clothes puts down on a counter.

04:45.200 --> 04:51.040
And it's like David Lynch wants to fuck all this, this old aesthetic.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.200
I think he's probably, I don't want to, he's a very talented man, but I think he's probably

04:55.200 --> 04:58.560
made love to a big like redwood tree at some point.

04:58.560 --> 05:04.240
So we are going to have two episodes in a row where we talk about fucking pies, right?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.840
So this is our second one.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.560
Okay, okay.

05:06.560 --> 05:06.800
Sequentially.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.360
Well, I'm not saying, I'm not saying, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.720
I'm not saying he has fucked a pie.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.400
I'm saying he wants to very, very badly.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.600
No, you're not saying he's fucked a pie.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.680
No, you're not saying he's fucked a redwood.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.200
He did fuck a tree.

05:17.200 --> 05:17.440
Yes.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.440
That's that one's true.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.600
Why would the pie gentleman not take the pie to his room?

05:23.600 --> 05:25.360
This has bothered me for a long time.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.800
Oh, from the pie gentleman movies?

05:29.360 --> 05:32.800
He knows he shares the space with Eugene Levy, his father.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.280
Yeah.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.600
Why would he do the thing in his kitchen?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.360
He knows he shares that.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.080
Why would he do that there, Justin, that he is hoping to get caught?

05:44.080 --> 05:44.640
Interesting.

05:45.360 --> 05:50.320
An underlying guilt that he wants to be punished for this action, which he knows is wrong.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.440
That's just it.

05:51.440 --> 05:56.160
When Shermanator tells him about this pie thing, he says the guilt is what makes it so sexy,

05:56.160 --> 05:57.040
Jason Biggs.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.400
So, and it does.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.120
It does.

06:01.120 --> 06:01.600
It does.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.560
I just asked David.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.720
Like, it feels great to-

06:04.720 --> 06:10.560
Is it bad that I would rather talk about Twin Peaks for an hour than do jokes?

06:10.560 --> 06:12.480
Is that a normal impulse to have?

06:13.280 --> 06:16.480
Only in that it would be poisonous to our show.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.600
To our show, yeah.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.280
Yeah, because Twin Peaks isn't at all hot right now, Griffin.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.560
People aren't just looking for that sweet Twin Peaks content.

06:25.120 --> 06:31.280
I mean, I watched Twin Peaks The Return, and there's part of me where when I see Kyle

06:31.280 --> 06:36.240
McLaughlin barfing up a gallon of creamed corn, I think like, I'm probably one of 50

06:36.240 --> 06:37.760
people that enjoy this, right?

06:37.760 --> 06:38.800
There can't possibly be more than 50.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.360
I am enjoying this, but I have to be in the migraine.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.520
There can't be any more than, oh, 50.

06:43.520 --> 06:48.560
I have to be a member of an elite group who enjoy watching Kyle McLaughlin vomit up a

06:48.560 --> 06:50.960
hysterical amount of creamed corn, right?

06:50.960 --> 06:52.400
I'm the only one.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.160
Spoilers, by the way, spoilers for Twin Peaks The Return.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.520
Kyle McLaughlin just expunges a ludicrous amount.

07:01.520 --> 07:07.120
Tub's full, but Max and Irma's ice cream bathtub full of Garmin Bosia.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.320
This week, sponsored by Max and Irma's.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.080
Get that bowl of Garmin Bosia here at Max and Irma's and everything.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.040
Should we do advice?

07:16.160 --> 07:18.000
Griffin, can I say, I would love that.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.000
I'd rather talk about Twin Peaks.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.480
I'm gonna work Twin Peaks into a couple of my answers.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.240
See if you can spot when I do.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.480
This will be a fun game.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.800
Last night, I had a dream.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.600
Well, this is an easy one.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.160
The owls.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.680
Last night, I had a dream that I filled up my tank and while giving me change, the attendant

07:39.680 --> 07:42.240
called my eye and slips an extra 50 in my change.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.840
He leaned in and whispered, this is a test, before telling me to have a good day.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.440
What does this mean?

07:49.440 --> 07:53.760
Okay, y'all, we have expanded beyond the scope of advice.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.480
This is secretly our Twin Peaks episode.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.960
This is the caliber of episodes if we're getting into dream interpretation.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.000
Can we just pretend?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.600
Let's remove a few words from this question.

08:04.160 --> 08:08.320
Let's remove I had and A and dream.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.120
So just last night, I filled up my tank and while giving me change, the attendant caught

08:11.120 --> 08:11.440
my eye.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.480
That would make this a much more palatable sort of request.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.360
Yeah, let's just try that.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.120
But also, a much more fireable offense for this gas station attendant.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.160
Well, it's a test, Trav.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.160
So he's not necessarily experience or not.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.120
Yeah, not necessarily given them a 50 bucks.

08:27.120 --> 08:31.600
One time, Daryl, your kill is $350 short again.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.640
Well, they must be tested.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.760
This is like what Morpheus did when he woke up.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.160
We woke Neo up from the Matrix dream.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.280
And he said, this is a test.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.840
He said, this is a test.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.840
There's a good way and a bad way to do it.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.280
Are you a robot?

08:49.280 --> 08:50.560
Matrix movie one.

08:50.560 --> 08:55.360
Have you guys ever thought about how different that movie would be if Neo had taken the other

08:55.360 --> 08:55.680
pill?

08:57.120 --> 08:57.600
Wow.

08:58.480 --> 08:58.720
Right?

09:00.080 --> 09:01.840
Where's that fan film?

09:01.840 --> 09:06.320
It would just be him waking up the next morning, going to Subway, eating a Subway.

09:06.320 --> 09:11.120
It would basically just be The Office starring Neo.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.120
Oh shit, Justin, you just opened my whole fucking thing.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.080
Holy shit, yeah.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.600
When Jim looks at the camera, it's like, I should have taken the other pill.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.960
Get me out of here.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.920
Get me out of here.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.320
This Dwight robot is a real pill.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.680
It doesn't mean anything.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.520
You just ate like some weird food during the day.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.360
That's what dreams are.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.640
And that's what I believe.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.120
A lot of people say it's like a collection of your experiences that all get garbled up

09:39.120 --> 09:44.640
in there and then they get barfed back up like so much Garbongoda by Kyle McLaughlin.

09:44.640 --> 09:50.400
But I think it's just you ate like a weird, you ate too many cinnamon rolls during the day.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.880
It's an undigested bit of beef, a lot of mustard, a cup of cheese.

09:54.880 --> 10:00.960
It's some chili you ate that got up in your brain somehow and then it was like,

10:00.960 --> 10:04.320
all right, let's do $50 gas station test.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.680
Here we go, hit it, roll it, roll that beautiful bean footage.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.920
You know, guys, I've been thinking a lot about Tibet and-

10:11.920 --> 10:13.920
Okay, okay, here we go.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.120
Oh, okay, here it is.

10:15.120 --> 10:15.520
What?

10:15.520 --> 10:19.040
And that's about as far as my joke went though, so.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.920
God, this coffee I'm drinking is so sexy.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.040
These pretzels are making me thirsty.

10:32.640 --> 10:39.280
You know, we went back to my place, bada bing, bada boom, you know, from Twin Peaks.

10:39.280 --> 10:45.600
You know the part in Twin Peaks where the woman, the fiance dies because she licked too many envelopes?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.960
Could I be any more possessed?

10:48.960 --> 10:51.520
Yeah, I know, that's my favorite part of the show.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.920
Smelly Cat, remember the Smelly Cat song from Twin Peaks?

10:58.560 --> 11:01.680
That if they could just decipher, they'd figure out who killed Laura Palmer

11:01.680 --> 11:03.360
and also why the cat was so smelly.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.640
Yeah, good.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.600
I love playing arcade games, but as a childless 30-year-old man,

11:09.600 --> 11:13.760
I feel weird going to the local putt-putt slash arcade by myself.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.120
We live in a small town in Georgia, so the closest grown-up arcade,

11:17.120 --> 11:20.240
a la Dave and Buster's, is almost 90 minutes away.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.400
How can I satiate my desire to play childish games without actually having a child?

11:24.400 --> 11:26.640
That's from too old for this shit in Leesburg.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.000
Leesburg's pretty country, they got a great mall.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.560
Oh, you know.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.480
Used to work out there.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.680
Wait, what?

11:33.680 --> 11:36.000
Yeah, for a couple summers, Leesburg, Virginia.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.040
I was working at that children's theater.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.000
This is Georgia.

11:38.000 --> 11:38.960
This is Georgia, buddy.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.360
Yeah, it's a pretty country up there.

11:41.360 --> 11:41.840
Okay.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.920
My name is Lee, and I'm claiming this one too.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.800
Lee, you can't, not again.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.000
You already got one, Lee.

11:50.000 --> 11:50.960
You already got one.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.200
Well, I like this one also.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.680
If you had to buy, you know my hangout with buying them has always been,

11:57.680 --> 12:03.840
if it breaks, that just became a very expensive place to put dust under.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.360
Like, that's a very expensive-

12:06.800 --> 12:08.240
That's a good point, J-Man.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.080
I was trying to come up with something.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.280
There's literally at that point-

12:11.280 --> 12:12.720
There's nothing you like in it.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.800
Like, I was gonna make a joke like paperweight.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.520
Absolutely not.

12:15.520 --> 12:15.920
No.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.240
No, I don't think I will lift that up to put paper underneath it.

12:18.240 --> 12:18.800
It's a lot like-

12:18.800 --> 12:19.440
It's nothing.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.880
It reminds me of the episode of Twin Peaks where they bought the Frogger machine.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.120
Yes.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.360
Yes, and the problem too with the arcade machine and it breaking down is,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.160
I don't think they're making new ones.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.520
I don't think anyone's made an arcade machine since 1998.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.160
So like, you're wrong.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.120
So like-

12:39.120 --> 12:40.960
Okay, I don't need those tweets.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.480
Just real quick, I'm gonna pop in there.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.560
I'm speaking hyperbolically.

12:44.560 --> 12:44.800
Okay.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.760
They're not as popular as they used to be.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.640
So there's probably not as many new ones being made.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.080
What arcade machine would you get?

12:52.080 --> 12:54.400
This is the problem, isn't it?

12:54.400 --> 13:01.280
Because like, anything you get, fucking somebody comes into your den or whatever and is like,

13:01.280 --> 13:04.640
whoa, you must really like Smash TV.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.960
Like, yeah, I guess I do.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.320
Is it your favorite game is all you do play Smash TV?

13:10.320 --> 13:14.560
Because all your other games are little CDs and they go in your box and you play them.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.520
And this is the only one you have that's the size of a coffin.

13:17.520 --> 13:22.080
So you must really like Smash TV for it to occupy this much square footage in your house.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.800
Yeah, I guess it's a pretty good game.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.920
I used to be, I used to like it.

13:28.960 --> 13:29.600
Yeah.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.800
Oh, you better like it.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.400
Man, you must play a lot of Smash TV.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.600
Not so much anymore.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.400
It is Smash-

13:34.400 --> 13:40.080
It's a hundred years old and I did pay like $2,000 for this and it's the size of a coffin

13:40.080 --> 13:43.920
and it's in my den and it's taking up a lot of square footage, but it is still Smash TV

13:43.920 --> 13:46.000
and I've beaten it quite a few times.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.080
And like, I just finished Prey on PS4 as a great little RPG shooter.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.840
I don't want it to be the size of a coffin in my office forever.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.840
And it's just going to be there for a while until one of its pieces breaks

13:59.840 --> 14:02.480
and then I never touch it again.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.840
Boy, you like Prey a lot, huh?

14:03.840 --> 14:05.680
To have this big box of it.

14:05.680 --> 14:11.120
What I might do is, what you could do is do one of the, like a cocktail.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.520
Now that I can get-

14:13.520 --> 14:13.760
Yeah.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.080
Because then that, when it breaks-

14:16.080 --> 14:16.560
It's a table.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.440
Now you got a table.

14:17.440 --> 14:17.760
Yeah.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.200
You got a table where it's a very heavy table.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.320
You could do like one of those emulator things where like within the cabinet is a computer

14:22.320 --> 14:24.080
that has like a thousand games, but-

14:24.080 --> 14:25.440
Well, I mean, you pay for it.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.560
But it's not, I don't think that has in the street cred.

14:28.560 --> 14:32.000
There are three arcade games that I would own in a heartbeat.

14:32.000 --> 14:32.960
Here we go.

14:32.960 --> 14:37.840
Joust, Burger Time, and Tapper.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.920
I fucking love Tapper so much.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.680
Oh, yes.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.160
Tapper.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.520
That's my third.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.160
DDR would at least, I would get some good exercise out of it.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.960
And the Deal or No Deal machine, it would just be nice to have like Howie Mandel's voice

14:52.960 --> 14:56.080
booming from my garage every like minute and a half.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.160
You know what I mean?

14:58.160 --> 15:02.400
Like I'm just in the living room watching Twin Peaks and just like having a really great

15:02.400 --> 15:03.280
time with my kids.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.360
And then Howie's in attract mode.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.600
And he's in attract mode like, come on, Donna, open these fucking briefcases.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.240
Like, whoa.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.040
I don't know why.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.000
You just lost a million dollars, fuckface.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.200
Okay, Howie.

15:17.200 --> 15:17.440
Whoa.

15:18.240 --> 15:23.120
If you did buy like a machine like that, you do really have two options, right?

15:23.120 --> 15:31.120
Like your choice is to have this like stupid malfunction, like pointless box of glass and

15:31.120 --> 15:36.080
steel, or you can have Howie Mandel shouting at you 24 hours a day.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.040
That's really not a good option for your Deal or No Deal machine.

15:39.040 --> 15:45.920
What if you just got like a licensed and like connected to the system video gambling machine

15:45.920 --> 15:50.400
just like right in your house that was like fully like you could put money in it.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.360
You could win money.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.360
So I'm like really, really porny.

15:58.320 --> 16:02.800
It would be good too because someone would be like, well, Justin, your gambling's out

16:02.800 --> 16:03.280
of control.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.080
You've got to stop.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.600
And he's like, I don't think that's a wise investment.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.920
I don't think I got my money back out of it.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.160
Justin, you got to stop playing so much video poker.

16:12.160 --> 16:12.960
The house always wins.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.720
Like motherfucker, I am the house.

16:15.920 --> 16:16.800
It's in my house.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.280
I win.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.280
I can't get rid of, I can't quit gambling because this investment is either going to

16:23.280 --> 16:28.880
pay for itself or not like very much, but it might, you never know.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.040
I'm having a lot of bad beats today.

16:31.040 --> 16:35.440
I'm having a bad day at poker, but the cards are so sexy, so horny and sexy.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.480
It's just fun.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.680
It's kind of fun and flirty to play it because you know, you shouldn't be here.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.840
I want to read this Yahoo cause it's a good transition.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.200
It's from a level 9,000.

16:43.200 --> 16:43.360
Yeah.

16:43.360 --> 16:43.920
Drew, Drew, Drew.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.320
Java port.

16:44.320 --> 16:44.560
Thank you.

16:44.560 --> 16:44.720
True.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.920
It's from your answers user.

16:45.920 --> 16:46.160
Sorry.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.120
Something's gone wrong.

16:48.080 --> 16:54.000
We'll say Dougie asks, what do you think it would feel like to get crushed or killed

16:54.000 --> 16:55.680
by Goro from Mortal Kombat?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.400
Probably not good.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.200
Like not good.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.520
Well, maybe it's like a hug.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.400
A hug that's like one degree too much.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.840
Yeah, it's like two hugs.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.160
So Goro does have that happening.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.200
Goro is a big, a big man from Mortal Kombat.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.440
He's got four arms, I think, or does he have six?

17:15.440 --> 17:15.840
Not six.

17:15.840 --> 17:16.880
Six is too many.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.360
I feel like at first it might be-

17:17.360 --> 17:20.800
I think he's got the four arms and the two legs, which are kind of like arms, but with

17:20.800 --> 17:21.840
feet at the end.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.480
You're right.

17:22.480 --> 17:22.880
Okay.

17:22.880 --> 17:27.760
So six sort of stick out, stick out body parts, whatever those are called.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.920
I feel like at first it might be, it might be kind of nice.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.160
Okay.

17:30.160 --> 17:30.640
You know what I mean?

17:30.640 --> 17:35.120
Like until you died from it, at first you might be like, man, four arm hug.

17:35.120 --> 17:35.440
Yeah.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.640
Nobody gets these.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.160
But you are getting it, you know?

17:38.160 --> 17:41.120
So it's good, good, good, good, good, very bad.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.240
Ruh-roh.

17:42.240 --> 17:42.720
Yeah.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.720
That's about, that's the trajectory of it.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.360
Good, good, good, good, good, good, nothing.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.440
So I guess what I'm saying is like, as a way to go, not bad.

17:54.160 --> 17:54.480
Right?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.960
Because it would be like, oh, this is so nice.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.320
I'm getting tired.

17:58.320 --> 17:58.640
Done.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.400
Like that's it.

18:00.400 --> 18:06.320
The scorpion is just like, oh no, he got me with his big grappling hook thing.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.120
Oh, it's in me.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.400
He's pulling me towards me.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.280
He took off his mask.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
There's just a dang skull under there.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.640
This is all very scary.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.920
Oh, he burned me up.

18:13.920 --> 18:18.880
Every part of that, from the grappling hook to the skull to the burning, was scary.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.240
Goro's just like, hey, do get over here.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.280
Get on in here.

18:25.280 --> 18:25.600
Get on in here.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.040
That was actually his catchphrase.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.320
Get on in here.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.200
Get up into this.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.080
Get up into this.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.520
And pop.

18:34.160 --> 18:39.760
The scorpion is irritating because you would definitely have a good 15 seconds where

18:40.560 --> 18:41.680
the thing is in your chest.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.800
You're like, oh man.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.280
Oh man.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.080
Why would you?

18:46.080 --> 18:49.680
Sub-zero freeze you and you're like, oh, I'm frozen.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.240
If he punched me now, I'll break all over.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.400
And oh, I'm watching him because I'm froze.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.080
I can't, I can't not watch him and I got to face right and he's walking over.

19:00.080 --> 19:00.880
He's going to punch me.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.160
I just thought he would break.

19:02.160 --> 19:02.960
He broke me.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.520
I'm done.

19:04.160 --> 19:09.520
It is doubly irritating because he said get over here and he didn't even give me a chance.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.560
Like you said it.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.680
Give me a chance, especially the second time that you've done it.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.920
I clearly know the stakes, right?

19:15.920 --> 19:17.200
I'm going to get over there.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.840
If you just ask, you don't need the hook again.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.840
I don't understand this carrot and stick approach.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.040
Just like, just ask me to come over there and I will for sure.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.840
It's just, there's no, there's no other fighter.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.960
Kung Lao, you see the razor brimmed hat before you even start fighting.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.760
You're like, he's going to cut me very bad with that.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.440
And now I'm just anticipating it.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.520
Can we not do this, please?

19:37.520 --> 19:41.200
You know, here's the, okay, I would like to take a second to talk about who I think is

19:41.200 --> 19:45.200
the most insulting character in the Immortal Kombat universe.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.800
And that's Johnny Cage because here's the thing, you look around, you got a scorpion.

19:48.800 --> 19:53.280
He shoots out a thing or you talk about your sub-zero, he can freeze you.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.000
Gora, he's got fucking forearms.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.360
Johnny Cage is just a human.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.600
And when he kills you, he gives you a signed headshot of himself.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.040
That's so insulting to the person he's just killed.

20:05.040 --> 20:05.280
What?

20:05.280 --> 20:06.560
He's a, he's a prick.

20:07.600 --> 20:14.320
Yeah, it's like, hey, I killed you and you can shoot out ice and chains and have forearms.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.040
And I killed you with my simple human strength.

20:17.040 --> 20:17.280
Yeah.

20:18.160 --> 20:22.560
You know, and also the other thing is if you kill Johnny Cage, like as you're killing him,

20:22.560 --> 20:23.680
he's like, well, I'm a human.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.240
Good job.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.160
Yeah, yeah, I'm a real, I'm a real person, Justin.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.360
Does it feel good?

20:29.360 --> 20:33.440
This is your first, this is your first taste of, it's your first taste of it.

20:33.440 --> 20:33.840
Great.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.240
I think that Johnny Cage should never be able to win a fight in Mortal Kombat.

20:38.240 --> 20:38.960
And here's why.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.080
He's fighting up against a seven foot dude with like four arms.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.320
I don't think he wins that fight.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.680
Obviously he did in the Mortal Kombat movie because he used a little bit of trickery.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.440
But like he's fighting against a guy who could do ice magic.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.040
I don't, I wouldn't win that fight.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.560
I don't see why Johnny Cage gets to.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.400
What do you think it'd be like to be kissed by Goro from Mortal Kombat on the mouth?

21:01.120 --> 21:07.600
So Griffin, you got a yahoo or Justin, you want to read another question?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.480
Not tender.

21:08.480 --> 21:08.960
I think he has his good-

21:08.960 --> 21:10.400
Wait, how the fuck do you know?

21:11.440 --> 21:15.200
Do you think just because he's a big strong person with four arms who can crush

21:15.200 --> 21:19.280
you that he can't also tenderly kiss a person?

21:19.280 --> 21:21.840
I think Goro would be an excellent kisser and let's move on.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.320
And with that said, I go to the same coffee-

21:26.320 --> 21:30.480
I think Goro fucks like a leaf, like falling off of the most beautiful tree.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.240
So is there a nude Goro online that I can-

21:39.760 --> 21:41.440
I mean, probably.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.000
Can you generate a nude Goro?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.520
Hey everybody, this is your pal Griffin.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.320
Just want to let you know.

21:46.320 --> 21:50.240
No, those eight characters I just typed into the Google search bar,

21:50.800 --> 21:54.000
I think I may have found the worst eight characters you could type into Google.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.360
Oh, I gotta get a quick one.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.680
Oh no, he did it.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.760
I will say there's a lot of just sort of regular old pornography here in the mix too,

22:03.760 --> 22:06.880
as if Google was like, I'm not going to give you that,

22:06.880 --> 22:10.720
but I can tell what you're trying to get to.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.600
You probably meant to just type nude, right?

22:13.600 --> 22:16.320
The Goro is a typo.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.680
I go to the same coffee place every single morning.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.480
Sorry?

22:20.480 --> 22:21.760
Uh, damn good coffees.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.880
Damn good coffee, got it.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.440
Yeah, got it.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.520
The same guy, Daniel, always makes my same vanilla iced coffee every day.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.640
Everything was normal and fine, but for the last two weeks,

22:30.640 --> 22:33.920
he's been pestering me about getting something else and saying things like,

22:33.920 --> 22:36.320
don't you want to try the new brownie espresso flavor?

22:36.320 --> 22:39.920
Or we've got something new for you, a fruity drink,

22:39.920 --> 22:43.280
and gets visibly disappointed slash annoyed whenever I politely decline

22:43.280 --> 22:45.760
and just ask for my same vanilla iced coffee.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.040
It's been making me feel pretty uncomfortable slash pressured.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.000
Is there any way I can ask him to please quit pressuring me

22:52.000 --> 22:53.440
and just make boring drink?

22:53.440 --> 22:56.640
Or do I have to find another Dunkin to dunk in?

22:56.640 --> 22:58.560
That's from the girl with the Dunkin tattoo.

22:58.560 --> 23:03.760
Okay, listen, I don't know how to break this to you, but he may be,

23:03.760 --> 23:08.720
shh, take a seat, he may be doing that to everyone

23:08.720 --> 23:11.280
because he works at a business.

23:11.280 --> 23:16.080
So I'm not sure, but he may just have to ask you about the new drink

23:16.080 --> 23:18.080
that they've got and see if you want one.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.720
Because you know how it happens at every store like that?

23:20.720 --> 23:22.080
Maybe what's going on here.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.160
Now, I can understand your confusion because he's obviously very, very bad at his job.

23:26.160 --> 23:31.120
If he's throwing up fucking solid gold Shark Tank pitches like,

23:31.120 --> 23:34.800
we got something new in stock, fruity drink.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.840
What does that even mean?

23:36.960 --> 23:37.440
You know.

23:37.440 --> 23:41.760
I have to imagine this question asker has not actually been paying that close attention

23:41.760 --> 23:42.720
to the pitches.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.320
Maybe Daniel didn't throw up this rock.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.400
Maybe they just heard, you know, mango,

23:49.760 --> 23:52.080
strawberry, and then that's all they heard.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.360
Now, I guess this is a fruity drink.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.000
I don't know.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.160
He's just a, he's just a chittering automaton that makes my vanilla iced coffee for me.

24:00.160 --> 24:05.200
Unless, unless I'm going to deliver this in a tone of voice.

24:05.200 --> 24:09.280
And it's possible, just possible that this is how Daniel said it.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.680
Don't, don't you want to try the new brownie espresso flavor?

24:15.680 --> 24:16.720
Oh, I see.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.120
This is, this is implied, please.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.920
This, this, you mean Travis, this is him.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.320
The man, the myth, the legend, Daniel Duncan.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.000
I worked so hard to make this.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.720
It's a drink of fruity flavors instead of vanilla.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.800
I thought you would, Samantha, I thought you'd really like this.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.360
It's got mango time in it.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.120
You don't want, I made it for you, I made it for you.

24:40.160 --> 24:45.920
My dad, Carl Donuts, said that nobody would like this and I didn't believe him.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.560
He said, people just want the coffee.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.840
But yeah, I didn't believe him.

24:49.840 --> 24:52.320
He sounds like that and I didn't believe him.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.520
And I guess I should have listened.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.920
I guess nobody does want a fruity drink.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.120
We've got all this mango back here.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.160
It's starting to stink.

25:00.160 --> 25:04.560
Go buy a fruity drink next time and throw it to the floor as hard as you possibly can.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.040
So it splashes all over the store and yourself.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.960
And then while you're still sort of dripping with the kiwi stuff, just say like, now,

25:10.960 --> 25:12.800
what did we learn, Daniel Duncan?

25:12.800 --> 25:14.000
I'll have the regular.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.680
Call him that to his face, Daniel Duncan.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.960
Call him that to his face.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.920
Say, Daniel Duncan.

25:17.920 --> 25:22.000
And he'll say, you know, I, you don't have to be a member of the Duncan family to work here.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.480
I'll say, I know how this, I know how this whole cabal works.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.560
Or you'll call him Daniel Duncan, he'll fly off on a giant spoon

25:28.560 --> 25:31.920
and you'll solve the mystery.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.520
He's like the Baba Yaga.

25:33.520 --> 25:37.440
If you say his true name, he has to leave and go to torment another village.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.600
Yeah, I'd love to try the fruity drink.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.000
Can you just say your name backwards?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.640
If you could just say that out loud, I'd be happy.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.280
Here's what you do.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.400
You get the fruity drink, you upturn it on his head and say,

25:48.400 --> 25:52.480
either you just want a major sporting event or I want you to fucking listen to me next time.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.400
And I guarantee you will never have this issue again.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.040
You just won the Super Bowl.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.040
I don't pay you to think, Daniel.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.520
You just won the Super Bowl of not giving me the drink I want.

26:01.120 --> 26:01.920
Well done, coach.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.720
Gonna definitely take him that big brass ring for this year.

26:06.720 --> 26:10.720
Uh, I, if we're gonna buy our own vanilla iced coffees, I don't know.

26:10.720 --> 26:11.440
I got nothing.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.040
It's time to go to Muddy's own.

26:13.040 --> 26:27.040
What do you think it's like to be crushed and killed by Daniel from Ducks?

26:27.040 --> 26:30.800
Father's Day is just around the corner and dads can be impossible to shop for.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.520
Difficult to find something that feels special he'll actually use.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.440
Always waiting in the last minute, etc.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.000
You know, this is a common copy point that we get.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.560
Hey, everybody's impossible to shop for.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.120
Nobody, it's impossible to buy gifts for anybody.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.800
Uh, except for babies.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.640
It's really easy to get stuff for babies.

26:46.640 --> 26:50.000
If it crinkles, if it shakes, you're good.

26:50.960 --> 26:54.560
You can buy things that are too grown up for babies and just say like,

26:54.560 --> 26:56.640
it's too big for him now, but just wait for it.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.200
And then you never have to fucking find out if they liked it or not.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.920
It's delayed, delayed reaction.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.480
It's perfect.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.640
Since I became a dad, actually, it's weird.

27:04.640 --> 27:10.800
I've turned into just a really unsatisfiable picky piece of shit.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.240
So I get it.

27:12.240 --> 27:12.720
Yeah.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.120
Well, here's a great solution for that, Griffin.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.600
Harry's, it's all about a great shave at a fair price.

27:17.600 --> 27:24.960
You get five German crafted blades, flex hinge, lubricating strip, 100% quality guarantee.

27:24.960 --> 27:29.520
There's a full refund if you're not happy and they just cost $2 a blade or less,

27:29.520 --> 27:35.600
which is half the price, being generous, of the leading five razor brand.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.760
And the shave sets from Harry's, they start off at just $15.

27:39.760 --> 27:44.720
And you get $5 off when you go to harrys.com slash my brother.

27:44.720 --> 27:50.080
You'll get a razor handle, moisturizing shave gel, and three of Harry's-

27:50.080 --> 27:51.680
That gum you like is going-

27:51.680 --> 27:53.920
Yeah, I was going to say, is this a Twin Peaks reference?

27:53.920 --> 27:54.240
Your-

27:54.240 --> 28:01.840
That, and it's got a flex hinge, so sometimes the blades bend back.

28:02.640 --> 28:08.480
And interesting fact, that $15 set is named Harry Truman after the sheriff from Twin Peaks.

28:09.520 --> 28:14.640
Harry's limited edition Father's Day Shave Set comes with a storm gray razor handle,

28:14.640 --> 28:17.600
chrome razor stick, because that's all dads could love anymore.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.200
Dads don't want color, guys.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.240
This is what dads could handle.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.560
If it's not the color of a battleship, dads aren't interested.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.360
Three relation blades and a travel cover.

28:25.360 --> 28:31.920
And it comes in a sleek, giftable box with the option to add custom engraving

28:31.920 --> 28:33.280
and a personalized card for free.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.800
Don't try to get your own box.

28:34.800 --> 28:34.960
No, no, no.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.920
Don't try to get your own box.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.960
It may not be giftable.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.120
Your dad may throw it back at your face, and that's dangerous.

28:39.120 --> 28:39.760
It's full of razor.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.720
Full of razor blades.

28:40.720 --> 28:45.680
You might actually find that you're unable to keep it, that you try to retain it,

28:45.680 --> 28:49.200
but it continues to escape and present itself to someone you love.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.520
Unlike that dumb box that you have, you give it to your dad or uncle or whatever,

28:53.520 --> 28:56.720
and then the next day it's sitting on your couch like the mask,

28:56.720 --> 28:58.560
because you can't gift it, dummy.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.480
So that address again, harrys.com slash my brother.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.360
That's harrys.com slash my brother.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.280
We did a good job of that commercial.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.640
Five dollars off a shave set.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.120
Hell yeah.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.080
Go, go, go down.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.640
I need to look at this one, because there's a lot of red text on this one.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.760
There are not a lot of things.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.320
Well, that's because this one's a serious business.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.520
That's what I'm going to say about Betterment.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.280
It's a serious business.

29:19.280 --> 29:26.480
And they have lots of things that we just can't say because of laws.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.920
But it's the largest independent online financial advisor.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.760
That ain't no law against that.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.720
And they help improve customers' long-term returns

29:34.720 --> 29:38.160
and lower taxes for retirement planning, building wealth, and other financial goals.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.000
That was all a legal sentence.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.520
A legal sentence, I just said.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.560
So we're good so far.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.480
You know how you listen to our show hoping to get some financial advice?

29:46.480 --> 29:47.680
Oh, God, no.

29:48.240 --> 29:48.880
Don't do that.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.080
Betterment.com slash n-b-n-b-a-m.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.360
It says, I have to tell you that investing involves risk.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.320
So that's done.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.080
That's out of the way.

29:58.080 --> 30:01.600
And this one also, their tagline, Betterment.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.960
Rethink what your money can do.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.840
I don't know how many of our listeners want to get investing.

30:05.840 --> 30:10.640
So I think the best thing we can do is offer us really bad investing advice.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.040
And then they'll be like, well, this is obviously not right.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.000
Let's go to Betterment.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.840
So for instance, if I said, y'all, it's time to double down on cans.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.720
You want to get as much money in cans as you possibly can.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.160
See?

30:24.160 --> 30:26.320
And we can do something fun with that, too.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.120
Cans are popping off.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.960
It's everybody's favorite way to store things.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.160
Investing involves risk, guys.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.600
Oh, it's risky shit.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.720
It's risky.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.280
You need professionals like those at Betterment.com.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.600
Man, I hope this is all legal to say.

30:39.600 --> 30:44.800
So find out how you can get up to six months managed for free by going to Betterment.com

30:44.800 --> 30:46.800
slash M-B-M-B-A-M.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.960
Betterment.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.240
Rethink what your money can do.

30:50.800 --> 30:55.840
I'm rethinking because I put my fucking shirt into cans, y'all.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.080
My baby's retirement fund that I was saving up for him.

31:00.080 --> 31:00.800
Is it a shirt?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.720
I put it in cans.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.440
It was a shirt.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.560
I was going to sell my shirt so my baby can go to good college.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.880
Is it a good shirt?

31:08.880 --> 31:10.320
Love that O'Henry story.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.280
This shirt cost $250,000.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.280
Here's a message for Peter Owen.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.400
It's a Jumbotron message.

31:18.400 --> 31:22.080
If you want to get a Jumbotron on the show, too bad we sold out.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.920
Here's a message, and it's for Peter Owen, and it's from Nicole Rupp, who says,

31:25.920 --> 31:30.320
my dearest love, happy first anniversary from your favorite brothers and your favorite wife.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.560
Aren't you glad I made you listen to that first time?

31:32.560 --> 31:34.400
Aren't you glad I made you listen that first time?

31:34.400 --> 31:37.920
I hope this message makes up for some of the times I left the lid off or something.

31:37.920 --> 31:38.800
I love you, Cole.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.080
Wait, Cole?

31:40.800 --> 31:41.360
Cole?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.160
Wait, wait.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.920
This is, oh, Nicole.

31:43.920 --> 31:44.800
OK, OK, OK, OK.

31:44.800 --> 31:45.520
It's short for, yeah.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.440
Oh.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.400
And let me tell you something.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.880
Let me tell you guys something.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.000
Everybody listening.

31:52.000 --> 31:52.720
Cans?

31:52.720 --> 31:53.840
No lid to leave off.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.400
There, it's a one time deal.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.160
Please buy these fucking cans.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.360
My house is full of cans.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.720
My house is full completely with cans.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.800
Happy anniversary, Nicole and Peter.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.080
My caniversary.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.600
All right.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.640
That's good, Travis.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.840
I'm just trying to do some branding for you.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.560
Can I bring you on as a marketing media manager or whatever?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.480
Because I got to move these cans, Travis.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.160
I'm sitting on 10 cans right now.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.520
There's a slogan for you, Griffin.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.800
Nobody hates these cans.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.960
That could help, too.

32:20.960 --> 32:21.520
From Twin Peaks?

32:21.520 --> 32:23.680
I want to tell you guys about the Nisei Garage.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.680
It's a monthly music show.

32:25.680 --> 32:29.520
Well, it may be Nisei, it may be nice garage.

32:29.520 --> 32:34.960
A monthly music showcase hosted out of Ripe Art Gallery in Huntington, New York.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.440
You get three acts per show with different bands every time.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.000
Now, you want to hear some new music?

32:42.000 --> 32:47.120
Go to NiseiGarageMusic.com and you get an archive of every show

32:47.120 --> 32:50.320
spanning over two years and 50 plus acts.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.960
And if you're local to Long Island, you can check out Nisei Garage on Facebook

32:54.960 --> 32:56.240
for show info and updates.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.840
They got new recordings and videos to those pages once a week.

32:59.840 --> 33:03.520
So there's bound to be something for everybody.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.040
Don't be fooled.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.200
Don't go to ShittyGarage.com.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.800
That's completely different.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.000
Okay, let me see this garage.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.240
Whoa, yeah.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.480
They shouldn't call this a garage.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.120
When I hear garage, I think of like my old paint cans

33:17.680 --> 33:21.040
and my classic cars that I have.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.000
My sort of Jay Leno-esque collection of classic cars.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.120
Covered in paint cans.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.480
Covered in paint cans.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.400
This looks like a nice garage.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.360
One where you can keep like a big freezer full of jerky or something.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.840
And or like musicians.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.520
All right.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.880
Freezer full of musicians.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.360
What's Ben Affleck and or Drake up to?

33:42.000 --> 33:44.320
What show should I be watching right now?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.920
Should the rock run for president?

33:45.920 --> 33:46.880
How about Oprah?

33:46.880 --> 33:49.680
What's a great French film about lady cannibals?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.240
Who's stronger, Luke Cage or Iron Fist?

33:53.520 --> 33:57.200
For answers to these questions and so much more, come on over to Pop Rocket,

33:57.200 --> 34:00.960

34:05.680 --> 34:08.160
or wherever you decide to get your podcasts.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.040
I'm not going to judge.

34:12.640 --> 34:15.600
This was sent in by Brulee, who says...

34:15.600 --> 34:16.240
Thank you, Brulee.

34:16.240 --> 34:18.160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ella, who says,

34:19.280 --> 34:22.160
who are the real emos?

34:23.360 --> 34:27.040
Who do you think are the real emos in our society today?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.280
We have many people dressing like them,

34:29.280 --> 34:31.200
but who are the real ones?

34:31.200 --> 34:33.520
I think it's hard to tell because there are people who try to look cool,

34:33.520 --> 34:34.720
and so they dress like an emo.

34:34.720 --> 34:38.000
Then there are real people who suffer and are truly emotional.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.640
Who agrees slash disagrees with...

34:40.640 --> 34:43.600
How do you agree or disagree with who are the real emos?

34:44.960 --> 34:46.720
Who are the real emos?

34:46.720 --> 34:48.560
Because you see somebody and they have that

34:50.400 --> 34:53.680
wild hair that I see on kids at the mall.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.440
And it's like, are you all?

34:55.440 --> 34:58.400
But you can't say it, but it's like, are you all?

34:58.400 --> 34:59.840
But really, you think about it,

34:59.840 --> 35:04.880
and maybe the real emos is like Tom Bergeron.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.800
See, okay, Griffin, here's the question.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.680
Is it a subversion thing where it's like you look at someone and you're like,

35:12.320 --> 35:13.760
they look emo, but they're not real,

35:13.760 --> 35:16.160
and that person doesn't look emo and they really are?

35:16.160 --> 35:21.440
Or is it that within the population of the emo-looking population,

35:21.440 --> 35:24.880
there are actual emos in there?

35:24.880 --> 35:29.920
It's so much deeper than your just wild mall hair

35:30.640 --> 35:33.920
or your just sort of the clothes that they all have.

35:34.800 --> 35:41.040
For me, it is the music, but you can never ever tell.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.480
Jill Biden loves Panic at the Disco, and you wouldn't know that,

35:46.480 --> 35:47.760
but she's real emo.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.720
Do you guys remember Balloon Boy?

35:50.720 --> 35:51.680
Yes.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.720
Do you remember Balloon Boy?

35:52.720 --> 35:55.760
He went up in the balloon or he didn't and his parents were trying to get on TV.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.040
He was real emo.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.960
He was one.

36:00.960 --> 36:01.520
That's one.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.120
So that's at least one.

36:03.840 --> 36:04.400
Yeah.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.120
Chris Carrabba, the lead singer for Dashboard Confessional?

36:07.120 --> 36:08.640
Not, not really.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.360
Weird.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.720
Just cashing in on it.

36:11.520 --> 36:15.040
The Heaney family, you know they're emo

36:15.040 --> 36:18.400
because Richard Heaney made an invention called Bear Scratch

36:18.400 --> 36:24.160
that is a long log that you nail to a corner of your home

36:24.160 --> 36:25.680
and then you rub your back on it.

36:27.040 --> 36:31.440
It's a long stick that you adhere to your wall

36:32.160 --> 36:33.600
and then you scratch your back with it.

36:33.600 --> 36:34.480
It's called the Bear Scratch.

36:35.280 --> 36:39.360
If you had to pick one, who would you say is more emo?

36:39.360 --> 36:41.680
Joe Montana or Joe Montagna?

36:41.680 --> 36:46.080
Yeah, probably.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.040
Well, Joe Montana used to throw footballs for money

36:49.600 --> 36:50.960
and they don't let him anymore.

36:50.960 --> 36:51.440
That's it.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.800
He's probably not happy.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.000
He's probably not feeling great.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.520
He's probably got like weird swollen shoulders with like football bone spurs

36:59.520 --> 37:02.480
and that would make that I think he I think he definitely

37:02.480 --> 37:03.440
listens to Taking Back Sunday.

37:03.440 --> 37:07.360
I thought he had swollen shoulders from not being able to throw footballs.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.880
I have to get the throws out.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.200
I'm saying they're building up in there.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.640
He owns a lot of Sunny Day real estate albums, all of them.

37:15.280 --> 37:19.280
On the flip side, though, Joe Montagna constantly has to remind people

37:19.280 --> 37:21.200
that he's not Chaz Palmentieri.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.920
So that may be something that he's kind of sad about.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.040
And Joe Montana.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.600
No, no, you've misunderstood.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.320
Man, God.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.160
Hey, Joe, as long as we got you here, can we chuck the pigskin around?

37:32.160 --> 37:32.880
I mean, I guess.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.480
Yeah, right.

37:34.480 --> 37:34.880
I guess.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.440
You know I'm not Joe Montana.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.320
Oh, no, I know.

37:38.320 --> 37:41.360
I've just always wanted to play football with you, Joe Montagna.

37:41.360 --> 37:41.680
OK.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.720
Did you guys ever play on Genesis?

37:44.720 --> 37:48.960
Joe Montagna's football went away.

37:48.960 --> 37:53.360
It was good because the quarterback was Joe Montagna, the actor,

37:53.920 --> 37:57.920
and he would he did not throw the football well or accurately.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.440
So it was really a running game.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.080
Very focused on the running game and Joe Montagna's football.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.800
Have you guys ever wondered if maybe they were switched at birth

38:04.800 --> 38:07.440
and Joe Montagna was supposed to be a football star

38:07.440 --> 38:09.600
and Joe Montana was supposed to be an actor?

38:10.640 --> 38:14.960
If your name is Joe Montana, there's no reality in which

38:14.960 --> 38:16.640
you're not a football quarterback.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.400
Like you have to be with that name.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.960
Well, but Justin, if Joe Montagna had gone to the right family,

38:20.960 --> 38:22.480
he would have been Joe Montana.

38:22.480 --> 38:25.200
The last name doesn't travel with the baby wherever it goes.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.720
That's the outliers, people.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.120
That's that's what Malcolm Gladwell was talking about.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.720
Yeah, the whole chapter about Montagna versus Montana

38:32.720 --> 38:35.360
and how a last name affects a child's football performance

38:35.360 --> 38:36.720
is one of the more esoteric.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.360
But I think enjoyable chapters of the outliers.

38:40.480 --> 38:45.440
You cannot go to an all time low concert

38:45.440 --> 38:47.600
without seeing John Madden there.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.760
He's he's truly I think that's about as deep as it gets.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.320
He as long as we're talking about football gentlemen, deep,

38:54.320 --> 38:56.880
yeah, deep, deep roots in the emo community.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.720
I'm just saying you never you don't look at somebody

38:58.720 --> 39:00.240
with their wild hair and say you're an emo

39:00.240 --> 39:02.640
because you don't know that John Madden is deeply,

39:02.640 --> 39:04.000
deeply into the scene.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.760
That's actually really hard for him, too,

39:05.760 --> 39:07.440
because he refuses to fly.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.160
So he's got to get on that big bus every time

39:10.160 --> 39:12.480
and just follow all time low around.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.440
He'll just travel with them.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.360
He'll like be in the bus with them and just be like,

39:15.360 --> 39:17.120
great set last night.

39:17.120 --> 39:17.620
Boom.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.920
He makes his buzz pull over at the same rest stops they do.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.680
Like literally every time they use the bathroom,

39:25.680 --> 39:27.680
they hear echoing in the men's room.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.320
I can't believe I'm taking a dump with all time low.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.000
Yeah, it's my dream.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.680
This is my dream.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.360
Yeah, we did it yesterday, John.

39:37.360 --> 39:38.080
Now get back in.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.520
We need to practice the new songs.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.200
Justin's doing a Paramore song.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.160
This is my favorite track.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.320
I want a much.

39:46.320 --> 39:46.880
Squad.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.360
Squad.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.280
I want too much.

39:51.280 --> 39:51.840
Squad.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.340
Squad.

39:54.080 --> 39:54.720
Good news.

39:54.720 --> 39:58.800
I just found out this week that Carl's Jr. and Hardee's

39:59.840 --> 40:01.680
have a site for press releases.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.600
And I'm pretty excited about that.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.720
Because they up to some shit always.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.440
They're into the business.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.600
This may, I've read a lot of these.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.360
This may be the most buck wild opening.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.040
It's a real up and down.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.720
So hold on for the ride of your life.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.840
After welcoming back fictional founder, Carl Hardee Sr.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.200
Wait, what?

40:28.720 --> 40:30.000
Tire screech.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.400
What?

40:30.400 --> 40:34.480
And purging their past live on the internet last weekend.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.240
So I guess.

40:40.800 --> 40:45.120
They're on some McElroy level of metafiction right now

40:45.120 --> 40:46.720
that I am kind of deeply into.

40:47.280 --> 40:50.880
So here's the wild thing about this.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.120
This is an advertising campaign where they had an old man

40:55.120 --> 40:58.800
pretend to be Carl Hardee Sr.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.720
And the reason the place has been garbage for so long

41:02.720 --> 41:06.080
is that his son, Carl Hardee Jr.

41:06.080 --> 41:09.360
was running the place and that's why they've been garbage for so long.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.440
That's the advertising campaign that they were trying for.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.200
So now Carl Hardee Sr.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.400
That's one way to do it.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.240
When Domino's did this, Domino's were like,

41:18.240 --> 41:19.120
yeah, our pizza's trash.

41:19.120 --> 41:19.920
We're gonna fix it.

41:19.920 --> 41:20.560
And then they fix it.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.240
It was like, it's okay.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.120
It's better now.

41:23.120 --> 41:26.320
Their thing is like, it's my dumb ass millennial son.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.840
He's the reason burgers stink.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.040
So now we're back.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.320
And sorry about all the commercials with all the objectified women.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.280
That was my son.

41:33.280 --> 41:38.480
My son's just so wildly just horny all the time.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.960
Just profoundly, so emo.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.880
Sorry about my emo, horny son.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.840
He's horny for burgers the way that David Lynch is horny

41:45.840 --> 41:48.000
for coffee and pies in the 1950s.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.560
And they made sure to clarify fictional founder

41:52.560 --> 41:54.880
because that's fun for your campaign.

41:54.880 --> 41:59.440
Okay, the chains today announced their next

41:59.440 --> 42:01.920
and most epic food innovation.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.920
The baby back rib burger.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.440
God, with bones and everything, bones and all.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.160
It's the first ever QSR.

42:10.160 --> 42:10.880
Quick, who's got it?

42:10.880 --> 42:11.440
QSR?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.320
I can't think of a Q word.

42:16.320 --> 42:21.200
Quick service restaurant burger to feature real boneless baby back ribs.

42:21.200 --> 42:25.040
If only there was another word for a quick service restaurant.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.360
Not one that doesn't have all the baggage.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.600
They fired fast food junior

42:31.600 --> 42:33.440
and brought back the original founder,

42:33.440 --> 42:34.960
quick service restaurant senior.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.360
They are reclaiming.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.920
Okay, it serves as the ultimate expression

42:39.920 --> 42:42.320
of the brand's recently reclaimed identity

42:42.320 --> 42:45.200
as pioneers of the great American burger.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.000
Christ.

42:46.000 --> 42:46.500
Wow.

42:46.500 --> 42:52.900
It's a fucking burger that you put more non burger meat atop.

42:52.900 --> 42:58.100
It is, this is not the signing of the civil rights act.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.700
Hardys, Carl.

42:59.700 --> 43:03.780
Griffin has sort of guessed the twist here

43:04.500 --> 43:08.580
and they lay it out and say it features real boneless baby back ribs

43:08.580 --> 43:11.060
that are charbroiled and dipped in sweet and smoky cattleman's

43:11.060 --> 43:12.660
original BBQ sauce.

43:12.660 --> 43:14.580
The ribs are then stacked on one of the chain's

43:14.580 --> 43:16.660
famous charbroiled beef patties.

43:16.660 --> 43:20.420
And it's like, you can't just say that.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.180
You're doing something terrible.

43:22.740 --> 43:24.180
You're doing a sin.

43:24.180 --> 43:26.420
You can't just say the sin with a straight face

43:26.420 --> 43:28.260
and not expect us to know you're sinning.

43:28.260 --> 43:29.220
Can I say something?

43:30.100 --> 43:31.700
I don't want to shop here anymore.

43:32.260 --> 43:34.260
I always take my family here every Sunday

43:34.260 --> 43:38.500
and go have a great time with their very tall burgers.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.540
But like, if you're not going to stand up for your fucking son

43:41.540 --> 43:42.740
when he makes a mistake,

43:42.740 --> 43:45.620
that's an element of this we haven't really discussed.

43:45.620 --> 43:49.700
It's just like, my dumb shithead son fucked up our company,

43:49.700 --> 43:50.980
so fuck him, he's out.

43:50.980 --> 43:52.740
Anyway, here's a rib burger.

43:52.740 --> 43:53.460
All better.

43:54.100 --> 43:54.820
Sorry it was so bad.

43:54.820 --> 43:55.620
My son sucks.

43:56.260 --> 43:58.660
So Carl, we're looking over your resume

43:58.660 --> 44:00.740
and we're so happy you want to join us at Twitter.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.740
What sort of job experience have you had?

44:03.460 --> 44:04.740
I ruined Hardys.

44:04.740 --> 44:07.780
Yeah, my dad let me go and he hates me now

44:07.780 --> 44:10.180
because I made too many sex commercials.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.620
Wow, he didn't stand up for you?

44:11.620 --> 44:14.100
No, not even for like a fucking second.

44:14.100 --> 44:15.780
Those sex commercials were pretty bogus.

44:15.780 --> 44:16.740
Yeah, I know.

44:16.740 --> 44:17.860
But he's nerve-fucked.

44:17.860 --> 44:19.060
Anyway, my dad fired me.

44:20.020 --> 44:20.740
I got a new commercial for you.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.020
No second chances, he said.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.180
Here's the new commercial, okay?

44:26.900 --> 44:27.620
Kate Upton-

44:27.620 --> 44:28.900
Stop, Carl, stop.

44:28.900 --> 44:29.940
No, listen, it's good.

44:30.660 --> 44:34.500
Kate Upton loads up Twitter on her phone

44:34.500 --> 44:36.980
and then she is in a bikini notch

44:36.980 --> 44:40.340
and she unhinges her jaw and swallows her phone whole.

44:40.340 --> 44:43.220
You just really see her just jam the whole phone in there

44:43.220 --> 44:44.980
while Twitter's there and it's like,

44:44.980 --> 44:47.940
what do you have to say today on Twitter?

44:47.940 --> 44:50.660
She should be on there and she'll get a mean tweet

44:50.660 --> 44:53.380
from somebody and then a big water balloon

44:53.380 --> 44:55.780
full of hot nacho cheese falls on her.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.220
What the fuck, man?

44:57.220 --> 44:58.420
When do I start?

44:58.420 --> 44:59.380
When do I start?

44:59.380 --> 45:02.180
Today, because we're Twitter and we're fucking bad too.

45:05.460 --> 45:08.260
Justin, I would like to make a Munch Squad called shot.

45:09.060 --> 45:09.620
Okay.

45:09.620 --> 45:12.180
But by the end of 2017,

45:13.140 --> 45:16.900
someone will come out with a sandwich

45:17.460 --> 45:22.500
that is a hamburger with a fried chicken patty on it

45:22.500 --> 45:24.260
or vice versa.

45:24.260 --> 45:25.380
Okay, I would love that.

45:25.380 --> 45:28.100
And the fact that this doesn't already exist

45:28.100 --> 45:29.860
is baffling to me.

45:29.860 --> 45:34.020
Yeah, so I haven't even gotten to the quotes yet.

45:34.900 --> 45:38.020
Brad Haley, chief marketing officer for Carl Jr. and Hardee's.

45:38.020 --> 45:38.740
What does he have to say?

45:38.740 --> 45:39.460
Yeah.

45:39.460 --> 45:42.180
Recently, we set out to reclaim our rightful status

45:42.180 --> 45:44.820
as pioneers of the great American burger.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.580
Is this the second time that that sentence appears

45:46.580 --> 45:48.100
in this one press release?

45:48.100 --> 45:49.860
It's in quotes, so it's their thing.

45:49.860 --> 45:51.700
So we had to show the world that we're back

45:51.700 --> 45:54.660
with a burger that truly earned a place on that mantle.

45:55.540 --> 45:58.020
And really spin the face of McDonald's.

45:58.020 --> 46:02.180
Yes, and God, because we put two animals together.

46:02.180 --> 46:05.220
That really horrified both man and God.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.980
That everyone is terrified.

46:06.980 --> 46:09.620
Yeah, the tagline of this burger is, and it's kosher,

46:09.620 --> 46:12.740
and they don't know what the word means,

46:12.740 --> 46:15.860
that we've pioneered many iconic burgers over the years,

46:15.860 --> 46:17.860
but no other chain has ever before

46:17.860 --> 46:21.540
put real bowless baby back ribs on a charbroiled burger

46:21.540 --> 46:23.940
and with some crispy onion strings,

46:23.940 --> 46:25.940
pickles, and barbecue sauce on it.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.580
That sentence kind of got away from you, huh?

46:29.140 --> 46:30.820
Also, just because nobody's done it before

46:30.820 --> 46:32.020
doesn't mean it's a good thing.

46:32.020 --> 46:34.020
Nobody's ever served their burgers

46:34.020 --> 46:38.100
in a functioning $2,100 electric Japanese toilet.

46:38.100 --> 46:42.500
Well, no, but we're pioneers of a true American experience.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.300
Enjoy it.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.380
You can have the toilet taken home with you, please.

46:46.100 --> 46:47.780
As you can imagine, it's not easy

46:47.780 --> 46:49.540
to get real boneless baby back ribs,

46:49.540 --> 46:51.220
but our friends at Shark Tank help us out

46:51.220 --> 46:53.700
by investing in a startup company that did just that.

46:53.700 --> 46:54.420
Wait, what?

46:54.420 --> 46:57.140
Yes, we're putting back another layer.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.780
What is this Shark Tank and Vision?

46:59.780 --> 47:01.220
We did the bone ripper.

47:01.700 --> 47:03.860
You put the cows right in it, ribs just pop right out.

47:03.860 --> 47:04.660
No bones or anything.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.580
We've made what we call soft cows.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.700
No, it's Bubba Q's boneless ribs.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.940
Bubba Q is boneless ribs.

47:12.660 --> 47:16.260
He was on Shark Tank in 2013 and Damon John invested.

47:17.300 --> 47:18.260
So here is his quote.

47:19.460 --> 47:21.540
When I first started Bubba Q's,

47:21.540 --> 47:24.580
I never thought I'd become the official rib supplier

47:24.580 --> 47:27.380
for two of America's most well-known fast food chains.

47:27.380 --> 47:30.100
And then they shocked him with a cattle prod

47:30.100 --> 47:31.140
because he said fast food.

47:31.140 --> 47:33.620
He said, I mean, quick service restaurant.

47:36.180 --> 47:38.740
Back in the day, I was just happy to be bringing great ribs

47:38.740 --> 47:40.500
to the people of Avon, Ohio.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.100
And it goes on like that.

47:42.100 --> 47:42.660
Here's my invention.

47:42.660 --> 47:45.540
I was raising my wobble cows and then-

47:45.540 --> 47:49.460
I'm looking for $100,000 for 30% in wobble cows.

47:50.500 --> 47:51.620
Here's the premise.

47:51.620 --> 47:54.740
When I saw these cows with an easily removed exoskeleton

47:54.740 --> 47:57.620
of bones leaving just nothing but delicious meat afterwards,

47:57.620 --> 47:59.540
I said, I must have it.

47:59.540 --> 48:01.620
They've also credited the actors in here

48:01.620 --> 48:05.540
playing Carl Hardy Senior and Carl Hardy Junior.

48:05.540 --> 48:08.660
It's Kyle McLaughlin and Kyle McLaughlin.

48:08.660 --> 48:09.940
Yeah, he plays both of them.

48:11.940 --> 48:12.980
I hate my shitty kid.

48:12.980 --> 48:15.860
I'm sorry you ruined my fast food company, but he's out.

48:15.860 --> 48:16.740
Your son?

48:16.740 --> 48:17.540
Yeah, he's done.

48:17.540 --> 48:18.500
Your child?

48:19.300 --> 48:20.500
Where did you go?

48:20.500 --> 48:23.940
You know they're gonna come back at us in like six months

48:23.940 --> 48:28.740
and be like, the prodigal son returns and kills his father

48:28.740 --> 48:30.820
and is like, sorry about the rib burger.

48:30.820 --> 48:31.940
We fucked up again.

48:31.940 --> 48:35.060
But anyway, I learned a lot during my time

48:35.940 --> 48:39.860
living in the monastery and we're back at it.

48:39.860 --> 48:44.420
This time, it's just one big fried ham bone.

48:44.420 --> 48:45.860
And then he's gonna come back and be like,

48:45.860 --> 48:46.820
oh, I had a kid.

48:47.620 --> 48:49.780
It's gonna be like, sorry about the fried ham bone.

48:49.780 --> 48:50.660
I killed my dad.

48:50.660 --> 48:52.500
I'm 10, but I'm in charge now.

48:52.500 --> 48:53.540
Let's try this.

48:53.540 --> 48:54.580
I'm the boy king.

48:55.460 --> 48:56.740
I'm Harold Cardys.

48:56.740 --> 48:58.340
I'm the lost brother.

48:58.340 --> 49:00.020
And from now on, plain bread.

49:00.980 --> 49:01.460
Plain bread.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.220
I'm from the bizarro dimension.

49:03.220 --> 49:04.580
I fell through a time slip.

49:05.060 --> 49:06.180
Now I run the joint.

49:07.380 --> 49:08.340
In a hundred years.

49:08.340 --> 49:10.580
Uncooked potatoes and plain bread.

49:12.740 --> 49:15.380
In a hundred years, the commercial for Hardee's

49:15.380 --> 49:18.340
is just gonna be a slow zoom starting from far away

49:18.340 --> 49:21.700
and it's Carl Jr. Jr. Jr. sitting on a throne

49:21.700 --> 49:24.260
with his family members' heads on a spike.

49:24.260 --> 49:27.940
And it closes in on his face and he just says,

49:29.940 --> 49:31.700
a new era has begun.

49:32.420 --> 49:34.420
When you play the game of burgers,

49:34.420 --> 49:35.700
you get diarrhea.

49:35.700 --> 49:38.180
Pretty much, there's not a win or lose state.

49:38.180 --> 49:40.340
It's pretty much just the diarrhea every time.

49:40.340 --> 49:44.420
He holds up a steaming bowl of burger soup

49:44.420 --> 49:46.500
and is immediately killed by his son.

49:47.860 --> 49:48.420
A baby.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.660
It seems enclosed on that son's mouth

49:50.660 --> 49:53.220
and he just whispers, chocolate dipped burgers.

49:53.220 --> 49:56.100
How long did Carl, okay.

49:56.100 --> 49:57.220
Carl Hardee Sr.

49:57.220 --> 49:58.580
I have a bone to pick with you.

49:58.580 --> 50:01.780
When you saw the first commercial of Jenny McCarthy

50:02.420 --> 50:05.300
hiding mustard in her bra or what the fuck ever,

50:05.300 --> 50:07.540
how were you like, well, let's see where this goes.

50:09.300 --> 50:09.940
He's new.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.700
He's still getting his sea legs.

50:11.700 --> 50:12.980
Let's see how it goes.

50:12.980 --> 50:15.060
How many did it take, Carl?

50:15.060 --> 50:16.500
I mean, Justin, what happened was

50:16.500 --> 50:18.260
he was actually out in the wilderness.

50:18.260 --> 50:19.940
He was living in a cab and he wasn't seeing it

50:19.940 --> 50:25.620
and John Hammond landed his helicopter nearby

50:25.620 --> 50:27.700
and he's like, I need you to come back, Carl.

50:27.700 --> 50:29.060
He's like, no, I'm out of the game.

50:29.620 --> 50:30.980
We got one last mission for you.

50:30.980 --> 50:32.340
I can't, I told you, I'm out.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.700
Your son's making super Randy Hardee commercials.

50:35.700 --> 50:35.940
What?

50:36.580 --> 50:37.540
Not with my brand.

50:38.260 --> 50:39.620
Wait, let's see.

50:39.620 --> 50:40.580
My boy?

50:40.580 --> 50:41.300
My boys.

50:41.940 --> 50:43.940
Well, let's see these bad things.

50:43.940 --> 50:45.060
Wow, they are.

50:45.060 --> 50:46.420
These are bad things.

50:46.420 --> 50:47.220
I gotta get back.

50:47.220 --> 50:48.740
I gotta get back.

50:48.740 --> 50:49.460
Do you think that we could get-

50:49.460 --> 50:52.340
Andy put potato chips and a hot dog on a burger?

50:52.340 --> 50:53.380
No, fuck this.

50:53.380 --> 50:54.580
Ribs on a burger.

50:54.580 --> 50:55.700
Wait, what?

50:55.700 --> 50:56.820
Nevermind, don't worry about it.

50:56.820 --> 50:57.700
Just get me back there.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.580
Do you think we could get Charles Esten

51:00.580 --> 51:04.900
from TV's Nashville, the actor who portrays Carl Hardee Senior

51:04.900 --> 51:06.980
to come on the show as a guest spurt in character

51:07.540 --> 51:10.020
as Carl Hardee Senior?

51:10.020 --> 51:10.980
You think that's possible?

51:12.100 --> 51:16.740
Hey guys, by the way, can you just name him one thing now?

51:16.740 --> 51:19.460
Like, you're pretty much, like, we all know,

51:19.460 --> 51:23.620
and the jig's obviously up because all your cups and stuff

51:23.620 --> 51:24.900
have both the names on it.

51:24.900 --> 51:27.220
Can you just call them all Hardees, please?

51:27.860 --> 51:29.940
And not Carl's Junior, by the way, please?

51:29.940 --> 51:32.500
Hey, Rally's Checkers, you're on fucking Blast 2.

51:34.420 --> 51:35.940
And as long as we're making a request,

51:35.940 --> 51:37.860
can we bring back the California Raisins?

51:38.500 --> 51:39.700
Hey, as long as we're saying stuff,

51:39.700 --> 51:43.060
California Raisins, it's time for your time in the sun to come back.

51:43.060 --> 51:46.100
There was a time when Hardees had, like,

51:46.100 --> 51:48.420
raisin cinnamon rolls that were really good,

51:48.420 --> 51:52.420
and they were represented by California Raisins.

51:52.420 --> 51:54.420
Hey, and while we're at it, Arby's,

51:54.420 --> 51:57.140
my favorite sandwich ever was when you put roast beef

51:57.140 --> 51:58.260
on a croissant.

51:58.260 --> 51:59.460
Can you do that again?

52:00.340 --> 52:04.420
And hey, as long as we're at it, I miss tastations, man.

52:05.700 --> 52:08.020
These little guys, you suck on them for a long time

52:08.020 --> 52:09.860
and they taste like butterscotch or chocolate

52:09.860 --> 52:10.820
or whatever the fuck.

52:10.820 --> 52:13.620
So what's up, Hershey's?

52:13.620 --> 52:14.900
As long as we're at it,

52:15.620 --> 52:18.420
McDonald's bratwurst weren't anything to fuck with.

52:18.420 --> 52:20.740
How about it?

52:20.740 --> 52:23.300
These are good, tasty Polish sausages

52:23.300 --> 52:24.580
that you served at McDonald's.

52:24.580 --> 52:25.780
Don't know where the hell they came from,

52:25.780 --> 52:26.900
Johnsonville or something.

52:26.900 --> 52:27.540
Bring them back.

52:29.300 --> 52:31.540
Hey, Applebeast, remember when you used to just bring

52:31.540 --> 52:33.460
a plate of a bowl of bread to the table

52:33.460 --> 52:35.620
and I was used to wondering, man, I love this bread,

52:35.620 --> 52:37.060
and you could just buy it at the store?

52:37.060 --> 52:38.420
Can you just put it back in your restaurant?

52:38.420 --> 52:40.180
Because I always forget to buy it at the store.

52:40.180 --> 52:42.100
But I would totally get it if it was Applebeast again.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.060
So you know what else?

52:44.020 --> 52:48.820
As long as we're at it, what happened to the mole on ABC?

52:50.100 --> 52:52.420
Celebrity mole, where did it go?

52:53.860 --> 52:55.060
How about it, ABC?

52:59.300 --> 53:00.580
Come on, what's going on?

53:04.260 --> 53:04.820
Anything else?

53:05.460 --> 53:07.460
This has been our show, my brother, my brother, and me.

53:07.460 --> 53:12.580
We hope you've enjoyed yourself on our program.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.660
If there's other things you want to bring back,

53:14.660 --> 53:16.820
go ahead and just tweet at Travis about it.

53:17.540 --> 53:18.820
And he'll read all those.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.580
Travis didn't really play in that space as much.

53:22.580 --> 53:25.540
I think Travis is just like, I like everything how it is today.

53:25.540 --> 53:26.980
And I look in the past and I'm like,

53:26.980 --> 53:29.860
it was way better because we had two stations.

53:29.860 --> 53:30.980
This is his punishment.

53:32.020 --> 53:32.980
Thank you for listening.

53:32.980 --> 53:34.980
Thank you for supporting our show.

53:34.980 --> 53:36.260
We have a big announcement.

53:36.260 --> 53:37.460
It's huge.

53:37.460 --> 53:38.900
It's so exciting and huge.

53:39.860 --> 53:41.300
We've got a new podcast.

53:42.020 --> 53:45.300
If you follow this feed, you've heard one episode of it.

53:45.300 --> 53:47.940
It is the McElroy brothers will be in Trolls 2.

53:48.740 --> 53:50.100
It is now on iTunes.

53:50.100 --> 53:52.580
There are two episodes, the one you already heard

53:52.580 --> 53:55.140
and then another new one featuring our agent Joel Begleiter.

53:55.780 --> 53:56.660
This is happening.

53:56.660 --> 53:57.620
We are doing this.

53:57.620 --> 54:01.700
This is a story, is a nonfiction serialized prestige podcast

54:01.700 --> 54:04.660
about how we got into Trolls 2, which will happen.

54:04.660 --> 54:06.740
And it will serve as a historical document

54:06.740 --> 54:09.380
of how that all came together.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.140
There are two exciting episodes now.

54:11.140 --> 54:14.420
Please go rate and review and subscribe to that.

54:14.420 --> 54:16.020
We'd love to get it up on the charts

54:16.020 --> 54:18.340
so people find out about it, especially Dreamworks.

54:18.340 --> 54:19.220
If we can go to them and say,

54:19.220 --> 54:21.220
hey, we have the number one comedy podcast

54:22.260 --> 54:25.460
and it's about this, they'll say, well, you're in, I guess.

54:25.460 --> 54:28.500
So please be able, you can have a part in this.

54:28.500 --> 54:30.180
So what is what I'm saying?

54:30.180 --> 54:33.460
You can be part of what helped us get into Trolls 2

54:33.460 --> 54:36.580
by rating and reviewing and subscribing to that podcast

54:36.580 --> 54:38.580
and helping it to climb the heat chart.

54:38.580 --> 54:40.100
So please do that immediately.

54:41.140 --> 54:43.300
Actually, two more announcements too.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.700
One, in case you missed it,

54:45.700 --> 54:50.020
we put up a audio commentary for episode one

54:50.020 --> 54:52.180
of the My Brother, My Brother, and Me TV show,

54:52.180 --> 54:56.020
which has been available on CISO.com since February,

54:56.020 --> 55:01.780
but it's also now available on iTunes in the UK, Canada,

55:01.780 --> 55:05.620
Australia, and probably some other places.

55:05.620 --> 55:09.700
So we've put up the episode one commentary in this feed

55:09.700 --> 55:11.060
in the My Brother, My Brother, and Me feed.

55:11.700 --> 55:14.740
And we've also recorded an episode two commentary

55:14.740 --> 55:15.780
that should be out later.

55:15.780 --> 55:18.260
I'm trying to figure out where to put that.

55:18.260 --> 55:21.140
But definitely one and two are already in existence.

55:21.780 --> 55:22.980
So you can check those out.

55:24.100 --> 55:26.180
Also, wanted to let everyone know.

55:26.180 --> 55:27.860
So in, I have been working,

55:27.860 --> 55:31.460
we have been working with the guys from Welcome to Night Vale

55:31.460 --> 55:34.260
and Hank Green and John Green

55:34.260 --> 55:39.300
to create a podcast convention in Seattle in December,

55:39.300 --> 55:40.900
December 9th and 10th.

55:41.700 --> 55:43.300
And we are currently in the middle

55:43.300 --> 55:45.940
of our crowdfunding campaign to help us finance that

55:45.940 --> 55:49.940
so we can put together just a really kick-ass thing.

55:49.940 --> 55:51.780
There will be a My Brother, My Brother, and Me

55:51.780 --> 55:56.100
performance there, Alice in Dead performance there,

55:56.100 --> 55:57.460
lots of performances there.

55:57.460 --> 55:59.140
Tons of cool people are gonna be there.

55:59.140 --> 56:01.700
It's already shaping up to be a pretty amazing event.

56:01.700 --> 56:04.580
And you can help us fund it and go ahead

56:04.580 --> 56:08.340
and get your ticket to it, whether in person

56:08.340 --> 56:11.300
or we also have the ability to view it remotely.

56:12.020 --> 56:13.780
Even if you're not able to make it out to Seattle,

56:13.780 --> 56:19.220
you can go to podcon.com, P-O-D-C-O-N.com to check it out.

56:19.220 --> 56:21.300
And there's a bunch of other rewards and tiers

56:21.300 --> 56:24.900
to help us fund the project at, but go check that out.

56:24.900 --> 56:26.420
P-O-D-C-O-N.com.

56:26.420 --> 56:28.260
I want to thank John Rodgick from The Long Winters

56:28.260 --> 56:29.540
for you to start this song.

56:29.540 --> 56:31.620
It's a departure off of the album,

56:31.620 --> 56:33.140
Putting the Days to Bed.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.460
It's a really good album that you should definitely

56:35.460 --> 56:38.100
go buy and or rent.

56:38.100 --> 56:39.780
Do people are people renting out?

56:39.780 --> 56:41.300
I don't know, but go listen to it

56:41.300 --> 56:43.060
because it's really very good.

56:43.060 --> 56:46.020
I also want to say thank you to David Lynch and Mark Frost

56:46.020 --> 56:47.300
for writing this episode.

56:48.260 --> 56:50.100
I think it turned out really, really well.

56:50.660 --> 56:51.460
So thank you.

56:51.460 --> 56:53.460
It got a little weird there in the middle.

56:53.460 --> 56:57.140
And went on like it, we weren't talking very quickly.

56:57.140 --> 56:58.660
And it was a very long winded episode.

56:58.660 --> 57:00.180
Hey, that's just how we do it.

57:00.180 --> 57:01.940
It builds tension and fear.

57:02.740 --> 57:04.500
So Mark Frost used to follow me on Twitter.

57:05.060 --> 57:05.540
What happened?

57:05.540 --> 57:06.340
What did you do?

57:06.340 --> 57:07.220
I don't know.

57:07.220 --> 57:08.660
I don't know why he started following me,

57:08.660 --> 57:09.940
but he doesn't anymore.

57:09.940 --> 57:10.980
Oh, used to though.

57:10.980 --> 57:11.540
Well, shoot.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.100
Well, maybe we'll bring him back in the fold

57:14.100 --> 57:16.500
with all of this cool Twin Peaks talk.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.820
Yeah, this really cool episode that we did

57:18.820 --> 57:20.020
about Twin Peaks mostly.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.700
So that's going to do it for us.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.140
Griffin, do you have one last Yahoo?

57:23.140 --> 57:25.620
Yeah, this final Yahoo was sent in by like nine people.

57:25.620 --> 57:26.660
Thank you, nine people.

57:26.660 --> 57:29.380
It's from Yahoo Answers user Ali asks,

57:31.620 --> 57:34.260
how to get silly putty out of bedsheets?

57:34.820 --> 57:36.580
I have made a terrible mistake.

57:40.580 --> 57:42.260
My name is Justin McElroy.

57:42.260 --> 57:43.540
I'm Travis McElroy.

57:43.540 --> 57:44.660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

57:44.660 --> 57:45.940
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

57:45.940 --> 57:46.820
Kiss your dad's square.

57:46.820 --> 57:48.580
I'm not gonna kiss your dad's square.

57:48.580 --> 57:50.100
This has been my brother and me.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.700
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

57:51.700 --> 58:07.700
Hey, good girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?

58:07.700 --> 58:09.620
