00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.480 --> 00:46.880
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me,

00:46.880 --> 00:50.960
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.640
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. Are you ready for some football?

00:54.640 --> 00:59.680
Hey guys, it's me, it's us. Football bobcat Goldthwait?

00:59.680 --> 01:05.760
No, mine, it's me, it's Bosephus. Hank Williams, uh, Hank Williams Jr.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.480
Hank Williams Jr. It's me, Hank Williams Jr.

01:08.480 --> 01:13.440
Hank Williams, quote, Bosephus Jr. Bosephus, Henry to my friends.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.760
Are you ready for some football? How many names do you have?

01:17.760 --> 01:22.560
I'm very worried about you, Mr. Williams. You sound like you're coming down with something.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.440
Have you been inhaling sulfur? I am coming down with something.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.080
I'm coming down with football fever. Are you ready for some football?

01:30.080 --> 01:32.160
It's gonna be a party. Mr. Williams,

01:32.160 --> 01:35.840
could you explain to Justin that he still has to record an hour-long show after this?

01:35.840 --> 01:38.880
He shouldn't fry his voice. If you were doing anything.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.760
Listen, it's Super Bowl Sunday, let me sing my fucking song.

01:42.400 --> 01:48.880
Are you ready for some football? Bosephus, to put this in terms that you can-

01:48.880 --> 01:51.520
Just once, can I get through the fucking song?

01:51.520 --> 01:55.120
I just want to warn you that just in football, like, terminology,

01:55.840 --> 01:58.960
this is just like the the beginning of the first inning,

01:58.960 --> 02:01.280
and you don't want to, you don't want to blow out your treasure.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.400
Yeah, no, that's a great point. Are you ready for some football?

02:05.280 --> 02:06.560
Why do you sound like Anibal?

02:07.520 --> 02:12.160
You know, I can stop doing the fucking voice a lot quicker if you let me get through my

02:12.160 --> 02:17.600
goddamn song. Once. Just once. Once. Once. Once.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.560
Once. Will you get him next time, Gadget?

02:21.760 --> 02:25.680
Are you ready for some football? It's gonna be a party.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.840
Gotta toss the great iron around, make sure everybody touches it.

02:32.400 --> 02:38.240
Because if all of your players don't touch the ball, then you're never gonna win the game.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.400
Yeah, everybody get it. What are we doing for this play, Peyton Manning?

02:42.400 --> 02:45.520
Well, I think we're just gonna sort of pass the ball around and just sort of

02:45.520 --> 02:49.680
hand, make sure everybody gets a hand on it, or else the score, the score won't count.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.000
That would be, I would say that would be an awesome trick play if they all just formed

02:54.000 --> 02:57.920
around the ball, right? Everybody had a hand on it, and it was just like a wheel,

02:57.920 --> 03:01.120
you know, extending out from the ball. And as people tried to dive, they're just like

03:01.120 --> 03:04.480
bouncing off the backs of all the players, like, we can't even get to the ball.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.280
What's Peyton doing? Like, this is genius.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.920
Listen, you guys are having a lot of fun, but I got an embarrassing confession.

03:11.920 --> 03:16.640
I do not, even on a surface level, understand the rules.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.280
So the answer to, are you ready for some football, is because I am not.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.000
It's categorical now.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.320
Because I am not prepared for football whatsoever. You know, here's a fun fact,

03:28.320 --> 03:29.360
can I tell you a fun fact?

03:29.360 --> 03:29.680
Please.

03:29.680 --> 03:35.760
For about a week, while I was writing it, that song had a reference to hitting the net.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.800
So my banjo player was having some fun with me. His name was Dan Joe.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.240
Dan Joe.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.400
Dan Joe the banjo player.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.320
Dan Joe player was his name.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.840
Was the net in reference attached to the-

03:49.840 --> 03:52.240
Good man! He was a good man, though.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.800
When the kicker warms up, I guess he kicks into a net. Is that what it was in reference to?

03:56.800 --> 04:00.560
I had to let Dan Joe go in the mid-2000s. He got the arthritis.

04:01.360 --> 04:01.920
Yeah, you can't have-

04:01.920 --> 04:06.240
Sorry, what was the question? What was your question about touchdown?

04:06.240 --> 04:09.840
Uh, I was just wondering how one passes the gridiron route.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.680
Well, you just, uh, you know, the laces out.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.160
Yeah, okay.

04:15.040 --> 04:15.760
Bocevis.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.720
What's up, Brian? Are you ready?

04:18.720 --> 04:22.560
Yeah, man, I wish you had been here last week when we decided that that was going to be our

04:22.560 --> 04:27.520
football episode, and that next week we'd have to come up with something clever and original, but-

04:27.520 --> 04:30.880
Well, my agent was supposed to get me on that one.

04:30.880 --> 04:31.360
Yeah.

04:31.360 --> 04:36.080
And he dropped the ball so bad. My agent is Dan Joe player.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.480
I had to find a place for him in the organization after the arthritis.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.800
Did he drop the ball because of the arthritis?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.040
He can't top an email worth a goddamn.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.600
Man, arthritis has really sort of ravaged your life, huh?

04:47.600 --> 04:50.720
Yes, it has. Well, it is.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.480
That ugly disease has really sort of turned your whole career around.

04:54.480 --> 04:59.200
Well, Dan Joe's career, and by extension mine, he's such a key player, you know?

04:59.200 --> 05:04.400
Hank, Hank, be honest with me, is Dan Joe player your Chris Gaines?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.320
Please, Henry, we're friends.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.480
Wait, you want a more formal name because we're friends?

05:10.480 --> 05:13.520
Please, my nickname is for business acquaintances.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.880
It's Henronicus, please.

05:16.320 --> 05:20.400
Henronicus Bocevis Williams Jr., the junior, the third.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.560
Bocevis, thanks for stopping by the show. Sorry that your life is so miserable.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.160
Absolutely fine, man.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.880
This is the highlight of my week. I can't believe we're done already.

05:30.880 --> 05:36.800
I just don't think you deserve the plight, the hand you've been dealt,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.600
but, you know, sometimes that's just how it goes.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.240
You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them, right?

05:42.240 --> 05:43.280
Right, Bocevis?

05:43.280 --> 05:47.280
Is that a football reference? I don't understand. Is there folding?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.200
Yes.

05:49.200 --> 05:49.920
Can you fold?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.480
If you're hit hard enough.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.400
If you're hit hard enough, you almost certainly will.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.760
Well, listen, guys, this has been Real Treat.

05:57.760 --> 06:05.520
Want to ask everybody to get out to iTunes and get my new CD, Hank on Hank.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.520
It's a spoken word album, I believe.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.080
It's a spoken word album where I just recount, it's just stories from the road,

06:15.040 --> 06:17.600
set to music, my music.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.800
Arthritic stories, essentially, is what we're dealing with.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.440
Listen, I gotta roll, but you guys have been so awesome.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.800
Country Boy can survive. South's gonna rise again.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.280
Okay, you're fading away, it sounds like a little bit.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.360
Listen, it's been a great run, everybody.

06:33.360 --> 06:33.680
Okay.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.520
Thank you so much.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.000
Thank you.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.800
Are you ready for some football?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.360
Feel better.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.240
Monday night party!

06:42.240 --> 06:43.280
And there he goes off into the sunset.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.360
He does know the Super Bowl's on Sunday, right?

06:45.920 --> 06:50.640
Yeah, Travis, will you text Justin and just make sure that he can stop by for any party?

06:50.640 --> 06:53.520
I'm really afraid that Hank Williams killed Justin.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.040
Sorry, guys.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.280
Hank Williams had me locked up in his rock and roll trunk, is what he called it.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.640
What else was in there?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.160
Oh, in there?

07:02.160 --> 07:02.800
Yeah.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.760
Okay, this is gonna sound weird, but there was a corpse of a man who looked like an

07:07.760 --> 07:11.600
arthritic banjo player, which sounds weird to me.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.600
I don't know how I knew that.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.960
Well, maybe I'll tell you all about it when you're older.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.280
Okay, I'll be happy to do that.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.200
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm the oldest brother.

07:21.200 --> 07:21.840
Hi.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.320
Did you say it's a show about the modern era and all that stuff?

07:24.320 --> 07:25.760
Yeah, I did that shit at the very beginning.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.120
Are you ready to start recording?

07:27.120 --> 07:31.600
Yeah, let's do the count to sync up and we'll just sort of roll from there.

07:31.600 --> 07:31.920
Okay.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.160
Hey, everybody, it's Justin McElroy.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.280
It's my brother, my brother, and me.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.280
Let's skip the introductions this week.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.280
I feel froggy.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.880
Let's jump right into the advice.

07:40.880 --> 07:45.280
Do you feel froggy because you just spoke like fucking Yoda for like six minutes?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.520
Oh, you mean Hank Williams Jr.?

07:47.520 --> 07:51.040
No, I'm a different person from him, but how's your object permanent?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.000
It's not good.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.800
It's bad, yeah.

07:52.800 --> 07:57.440
I closed the webcam window in Skype and then suddenly the two of you didn't exist anymore.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.280
I slipped and fell in the ice a few weeks ago and hurt my wrist.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.840
Ever since then, it hurts to shake hands with people.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.680
My banjo career is over.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.040
Also, I'm a corpse.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.080
I'm a corpse in a box.

08:10.080 --> 08:10.400
Help.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.880
Do you have any recommendations for ways I can avoid shaking hands until it gets better

08:14.880 --> 08:16.880
without having to tell them the whole story?

08:16.880 --> 08:19.040
That's from Shaken Up in Philadelphia.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.480
Why are you afraid to tell people that story?

08:22.480 --> 08:23.680
That's not an embarrassing story.

08:23.680 --> 08:28.400
I mean, if people saw it, it's embarrassing, but that's not like you didn't slip and fall

08:28.400 --> 08:31.680
in the ice because you were distracted because you were jerking it, I'm assuming.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.040
It wasn't like you hurt your wrist because you wiped your butt at a weird angle.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.840
That would actually be a very embarrassing story.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.800
What if you did that?

08:40.800 --> 08:43.840
What if you were wiping and just snapped?

08:43.840 --> 08:46.080
No, not like this.

08:46.080 --> 08:46.880
Not again.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.560
What do you even do?

08:48.560 --> 08:49.760
You can't use the other hand.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.640
Could you put on an air cast and wear that everywhere so people go to shake your hand

08:54.640 --> 08:59.600
just kind of, ugh, this thing, and then point to it with your head like, ugh, this.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.760
Can't shake.

09:01.760 --> 09:02.880
This, ugh.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.600
You know how it goes.

09:03.600 --> 09:09.360
This is one of many, many social problems that could be fixed if we Americans would

09:09.360 --> 09:14.400
just sort of adopt the beautiful practice of face kissing upon greeting.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.200
Mm-hmm.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.800
Or just a light bow.

09:18.160 --> 09:18.640
Yeah, sure.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.480
It's 2015.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.560
It's time to start doing things in the Japanese style.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.760
You know, that's my jam.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.840
So I think maybe it's time to fold them when you meet somebody.

09:29.840 --> 09:30.560
No need to tie them.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.840
Oh, you got to know when to hold them, and you got to know when to fold them.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.280
You got to know when to hold a hand.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.880
There's a Japanese tradition that you learn if you're in the games industry that when

09:40.880 --> 09:44.480
someone hands you a business card or a card of any sort, you should accept with two hands,

09:44.480 --> 09:46.560
and it's a very big deal.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.000
And I know this.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.440
You spend 15 minutes reading it and admiring the lettering.

09:52.240 --> 10:01.200
And then last week, I was purchasing a carryout order at a local Japanese establishment,

10:01.200 --> 10:07.760
and the woman behind the counter took my card with both hands, and I felt so angry that

10:07.760 --> 10:13.760
I was not able to put my one area of cultural literacy to practice.

10:13.760 --> 10:18.720
Can you imagine how fucking impressed she would have been if I'd handed it to her with two

10:18.720 --> 10:19.040
hands?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.080
She would have been like, wow.

10:21.040 --> 10:21.600
Wow.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.160
What did you do?

10:22.160 --> 10:25.840
You just sort of like fucking slid it across the table and fucking gambit?

10:25.840 --> 10:26.880
I flipped it at her head.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.840
No, I just kind of, you know how you do.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.360
Almost embarrassed that you don't have cash here, this.

10:33.360 --> 10:33.920
I'm sorry.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.240
I'm the worst.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.360
I'm the worst.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.480
Yeah, bow, I think.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.480
Or salute.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.400
Yeah, there's all kinds of options.

10:42.400 --> 10:46.720
Don't feel like your hands are tied, because that would probably hurt too.

10:46.720 --> 10:51.520
I gotta say, if someone reaches their extensor, hands for a handshake, and then you salute,

10:52.240 --> 10:53.520
they are going to have you in prison.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.800
What if you do all of them?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
Could you just say something like, I've been sick.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.760
I shouldn't.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.920
Like, then you don't have to tell the whole story.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.680
You don't just shake their hand.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.560
Let me hit you with this.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.960
They hold out your hand, their hand.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.400
They hold out their hand.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.600
And you salute.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.200
Then they hold out your hand.

11:09.200 --> 11:09.760
Nope.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.240
You salute, and you bow, and while you're down there, you kiss their hand.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.400
That's an option.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.200
Listen, America's a melting pot.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.760
Not in the regal sense, where you take it, and you kiss the ring or whatever.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.200
You just sort of kiss the top of their extended palm.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.440
The problem here is the conversation that follows.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.440
I would shake, but I fell and hurt my hand, and it really hurts to shake.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.240
So you broke it?

11:36.880 --> 11:38.880
No, I'm just over here.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.560
I just kind of ouchied it.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.840
I kind of ouchied it.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.640
I stoved it, to use that colloquialism.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.600
I stoved it.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.360
Kind of an ouchie, and now I can't.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.160
Oh, when they reach out, they'll say like, no, I shouldn't.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.840
I just farted on my hand.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.480
No, well, that would be like a hundred times worse.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.320
Way worse.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.600
I think you'd just be up front and just say that you made a boo-boo nanny

11:59.600 --> 12:00.880
while you were walking on the street.

12:01.920 --> 12:02.400
It's fucking-

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
I made a whoopsie daisy.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.840
It's February.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.040
Shit's slick out there.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
People be making boo-boo nannies all the time.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.480
24-7 boo-boo nannies.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.520
I made a boom-boom on the street across from here.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.080
That's a different thing.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.440
Again, another bad thing.

12:16.160 --> 12:16.640
Boo-boo nannies.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.000
Is a boom-boom bad?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.760
Boom-boom means he pooped on the street.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.520
It means he pooped on the street.

12:21.520 --> 12:26.000
Why aren't you guys helping me get boo-boo nannies started?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.200
Because it sounds like a terrible TLC reality show.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.800
I'm trying to fucking pollinate our listeners' brain fields

12:34.800 --> 12:36.880
with boo-boo nanny to try and get it going

12:36.880 --> 12:38.560
for when people make a whoopsie daisy.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.080
I was distracted because I was actually filing the trademark paperwork

12:42.080 --> 12:44.240
on a boo-boo nanny to make sure-

12:44.240 --> 12:45.760
I was pitching it into it.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.880
I was pitching it to E.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.040
It's a good word.

12:49.040 --> 12:49.920
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

12:50.880 --> 12:53.440
I need to check boo-boo nanny.com super quick though.

12:53.440 --> 12:53.680
Okay.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.360
How are you spelling it?

12:55.360 --> 12:56.000
Like phonetic?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.920
B-O-O-N-A-N-Y.

12:58.480 --> 12:58.720
Okay.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.280
Imagine this.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.560
Honey boo-boo, right?

13:00.560 --> 13:02.160
She needs a babysitter.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.120
You get a super rich woman who's a little bit like

13:05.120 --> 13:06.720
she's been tossed out by her parents.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.680
So she needs the money because she's never had to get a job before.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.120
So she's the boo-boo nanny.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.200
That young woman's television career is over.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.320
Do you guys want to Yahoo though?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.320
Yeah, absolutely.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.000
Can you do me one favor really quick and just take your game

13:22.000 --> 13:24.320
and then recognize this game from Rachel Sperling.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.600
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.040
Oh, I know that game.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Steve, who asks,

13:31.200 --> 13:36.160
if you had the chance to go to bedrock and live in a cartoon world

13:36.160 --> 13:39.280
but could not come back, would you do it?

13:41.520 --> 13:41.920
Update.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.720
And of course you would be an animated cartoon character as well.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.880
Maybe a friend of the Flintstones and maybe not.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.120
Well.

13:47.920 --> 13:48.720
Oh, hold on.

13:50.160 --> 13:50.720
All right.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.040
What kind of world are you pitching where basically you have to live

13:53.040 --> 13:56.480
in a cartoon caveman era and also you don't know the Flintstones.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.000
So you're not really on the show.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.320
It just strikes me that there's so many bitter

14:03.120 --> 14:05.920
like animated worlds to want to be a part of.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.360
Like that's why I proposed this question.

14:10.080 --> 14:15.280
I mean, let's respect the source material with bedrock.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.880
Would I leave my entire life?

14:16.880 --> 14:20.720
Would I leave my wife behind and my house and my cat

14:20.720 --> 14:26.480
and my group of friends here in Austin to go live in fucking bedrock?

14:26.480 --> 14:26.640
No.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.760
To what end?

14:29.760 --> 14:33.520
I will say whenever I see the intro and he gets that like giant ass

14:33.520 --> 14:36.080
rack of dinosaur ribs to watch the drive-in movie,

14:36.080 --> 14:38.880
I always think like I would actually I would,

14:38.880 --> 14:40.640
oh my God, I would fuck those ribs up.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.800
But I don't think that I would love those ribs

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
the way that I love my, you know, my wife.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
I think we can all agree that those giant ribs

14:49.600 --> 14:51.920
are the only plus of living in bedrock.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.560
Other than that, you have animals running your sink,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.480
your vacuum cleaner, your lamps.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.240
Oh, and also one thing that you forgot, Travis,

14:58.240 --> 15:01.440
is that there's fucking dinosaurs everywhere.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.360
Including in your home.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.800
In your home.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.520
You've got to push your car around with your fucking feet.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.640
And even if they don't bite you, the smell probably isn't great.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.000
That's something that people don't like think about

15:12.000 --> 15:14.160
when we watch the new Jurassic World trailer.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.160
It's like, oh, Chris Pratt, I love that guy.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.680
Oh, and he's running with some velociraptors.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.320
I bet that's fun.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.120
Yeah, but think about it.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.560
Those things probably smell like shit.

15:21.360 --> 15:21.840
Yeah.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.320
T-Rex, T-Rex with those arms, he's not cleaning himself.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.360
He does not have a good clean.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.840
His, from the tail to his tummy,

15:27.840 --> 15:30.720
that whole region is gonna stink horrifically.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.840
Have you guys thought about the fact

15:31.840 --> 15:34.080
that like their cars are made out of fucking rocks?

15:34.080 --> 15:38.160
And so if you put like four like adults into that car,

15:38.160 --> 15:40.640
that car probably weighs like five tons

15:40.640 --> 15:42.480
and you're pushing it with your feet.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.840
That's the worst.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.480
Yeah, I know.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.280
You might as well walk at that point.

15:47.280 --> 15:47.520
Yeah.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.480
Yeah.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.400
Like, forget about the dinosaurs.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.320
Can you talk about the fact that you're giving up

15:52.320 --> 15:55.120
your entire life to a world where like,

15:55.120 --> 15:56.960
they can't even treat disease.

15:56.960 --> 15:57.680
Yeah, they can't.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.880
It's like, yabba-dabba, I have chicken pox, I'm gonna die.

16:00.880 --> 16:01.360
Goodbye.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.000
That's it.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.520
And now we all have chicken pox.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.240
Later.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.840
PS, we all have chicken pox.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.240
What's never made explicitly clear is that on the show,

16:08.240 --> 16:10.080
by the way, Christ hasn't come to earth yet,

16:10.080 --> 16:11.200
so I'm going to go to hell.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.160
Where are the scenes where Fred's sacrificing something

16:14.160 --> 16:15.760
to their pagan god, Bale?

16:15.760 --> 16:16.720
You know what I mean?

16:16.720 --> 16:17.440
Yeah, right.

16:17.440 --> 16:17.680
Right.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.360
And what they don't show is that on the show,

16:19.360 --> 16:21.760
Fred and Wilma and Barney, all of them are 12,

16:21.760 --> 16:23.920
because the life expectancy is like 15.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.400
Quick question before we-

16:26.400 --> 16:27.600
This is not applicable.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.160
Quick question.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.320
Is the world of Bedrock,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.320
does anybody know where I'm going with this already?

16:37.360 --> 16:37.600
No.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.320
Is it part of the extended universe

16:40.320 --> 16:42.400
of the dinosaurs television show?

16:42.400 --> 16:46.320
No, I cannot imagine that dinosaurs and humans

16:46.320 --> 16:50.720
were coexisting in either, like in the dinosaurs fiction,

16:50.720 --> 16:53.680
where they'd become sentient and flannel wearing.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.600
I cannot imagine humans were also in the mix.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.680
I'm going to throw something else into the mix.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.880
You ready for this?

17:00.880 --> 17:01.520
Yeah, sure.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.800
This is canon, because this is from the theme song.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.720
What if there was an episode, a deleted lost episode,

17:08.720 --> 17:11.200
where Fred climbed out of the valley that they lived in

17:11.200 --> 17:14.080
to discover it was like the year 1998?

17:14.080 --> 17:15.520
Because here's the thing, you guys.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.800
They're a modern Stone Age family.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.480
A modern Stone Age family.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.080
So they're living in this valley of lost time, right?

17:26.080 --> 17:27.040
Oh, shit.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.200
Now, that's how they have record players,

17:30.240 --> 17:32.320
because they didn't have record players back then.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.120
The only way that would work is if that was modern day,

17:35.120 --> 17:39.040
they were just all living a fucking village lifestyle,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.440
where they were all with dinosaurs and everything.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.400
Think about it.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.280
Are you saying that if you zoomed out of the Flintstones,

17:45.280 --> 17:47.920
you would see the modern world surrounding it?

17:47.920 --> 17:49.520
They've been in the bubble this whole time?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.600
Yeah, they're like in the middle of like Utah,

17:51.600 --> 17:54.320
like a Utahian desert.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.240
Occasionally, people with modern technology

17:56.240 --> 17:58.640
like hover within range of the bubble,

17:58.640 --> 18:01.120
and they'd see it and try to replicate it out of stone.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.000
And then they'd get like, what you don't see in every scene

18:04.000 --> 18:06.320
of the Flintstones, like for the record player,

18:06.320 --> 18:08.480
they use it and then they get furious,

18:08.480 --> 18:09.680
because it doesn't work,

18:09.680 --> 18:11.440
because it might as well be made out of Play-Doh,

18:11.440 --> 18:14.480
because it's rocks, and they smash it on the ground furious.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.560
Oh, what they don't show is it's like a Truman show

18:16.560 --> 18:17.680
like thing, right?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.600
Where they've been given this and it's like,

18:19.600 --> 18:22.240
almost like when they make enclosures for like gorillas,

18:22.240 --> 18:23.440
and they're like, we're gonna try to replicate

18:23.440 --> 18:25.120
what their real lives would have been like.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.880
But like, these people don't know

18:26.880 --> 18:28.080
what ancient times would have been like.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.000
So they're like, they would have like stone record players.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.040
That'd be crazy, right?

18:31.040 --> 18:33.600
No, it wouldn't work.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.000
Bam Bam goes to the corner store to buy some rolling papers

18:36.000 --> 18:37.600
and hands the cashier some clams,

18:37.600 --> 18:38.640
and the cashier's like, thanks.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.400
And then Bam Bam leaves, and the cashier's like,

18:40.400 --> 18:42.160
wait, these are clams.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.680
Why is this our currency?

18:43.680 --> 18:46.240
Like, why have we attached any value to clams?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.040
What the fuck?

18:47.040 --> 18:47.440
We eat these.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.880
But then he's dragged away.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.800
He's dragged away by the producers.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.640
And there's a finite amount of water in the bubble,

18:54.640 --> 18:56.320
of course, obviously.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.720
So they all know they have about five years.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.320
Oh, fuck, Utopia 2, Flintstones, Utopia 2.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.440
What if they could do Utopia,

19:03.440 --> 19:05.360
but the people in Utopia don't know they're in Utopia?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.040
Yeah, fuck.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.000
Ugh.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.680
Fox, we could have saved that shit.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.880
So that's a definite no.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.480
Would not leave life behind.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.360
Four bedrock.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.480
Sorry, Wilma.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.280
Sorry, Fred.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.040
Will say, though, if I get the opportunity

19:17.040 --> 19:19.280
to pop into Pokemon Town, bye.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.720
Bye, life.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.000
See you, Earth.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.920
Where did Griffin go?

19:23.920 --> 19:24.400
I miss him.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.120
He's my husband.

19:25.120 --> 19:25.680
Where did he go?

19:25.680 --> 19:27.440
He's been Poke-raptured.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.160
Let's turn on WB at 9 a.m. on Saturday.

19:30.160 --> 19:30.640
Wait a minute.

19:30.640 --> 19:31.360
There he is.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.520
Kicking it with Charizard.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.000
Kicking it with Blastoise.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.320
The happiest he's ever been.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.160
What a cruel joke.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.160
Bet you can't.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.120
I can't.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.080
I love you.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.760
I love the two of you very dearly.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.320
You're my brothers, and I love this podcast we do together.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.520
I think we're helping a lot of people

19:49.520 --> 19:50.480
and changing a lot of lives,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.160
and it's brought a tremendous amount of joy in my life.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.240
I would leave it forever to spend.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.040
In a second.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.000
I would do it.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.920
I would jump into Pokemon World

19:57.920 --> 20:01.200
if by jumping into Pokemon World,

20:01.200 --> 20:07.040
my human, like, fleshy body could only survive for a month.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.840
I would trade the rest of my life

20:09.840 --> 20:12.480
and all that entails here on Earth

20:12.480 --> 20:14.880
for one sweet month in Pallet Town.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.720
Goodbye, you fucks.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.560
You go skydiving.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.120
You went Rocky Mountain climbing.

20:23.120 --> 20:27.440
You went 2.7 seconds on a Hitmonchan.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.840
Oh man, I would do it.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.960
Because I could knock out that.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.960
I could become the very best,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.440
like, no one ever was in a month, I think.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.560
And then I would, you know.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.520
Fade away.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.240
You're not gonna fade away.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.040
You're gonna burn bright.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.240
Climb the stage.

20:40.240 --> 20:40.480
Yeah.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.600
I'll never forget when the mysterious fleshy stranger

20:43.600 --> 20:44.880
rolled into town.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.640
He was only with us for a month, but.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.920
He's three-dimensional.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.760
His team was so well-balanced, though.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.600
He was all squidgy and pinchable.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.160
Fingernails.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.760
And then he died, which was a whole new concept for us.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.440
And we were like, how do we bury this?

20:59.440 --> 21:00.720
What do we do with this now?

21:00.720 --> 21:02.800
We're gonna have to form some sort of religion now,

21:02.800 --> 21:04.240
just to deal with death.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.680
No one's ever died before.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.360
Is he gonna turn into a ghostly?

21:09.440 --> 21:10.320
Alright, we're done.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.440
Griffin's fallen asleep.

21:12.240 --> 21:12.800
Revive.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.160
Revive.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.240
Revive.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.080
Let me take this kid to the Pokemon Center.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.360
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

21:19.360 --> 21:19.760
I don't know.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.280
We don't have human doctors.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.120
What if in Pokemon World.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.480
Oh boy, this is the episode now.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.200
Medical care for Pokemon is free,

21:27.200 --> 21:28.720
but humans pay out the notes.

21:28.720 --> 21:29.680
Oh my God, it's crazy.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.480
Yeah, Obamacare only extends to Pokemon.

21:34.640 --> 21:35.120
Okay.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.320
No, I think we got a good four and a half hours out of that.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.920
Brothers, how do I shake an acquaintance

21:41.920 --> 21:44.800
who wants to escalate things to the friendship level?

21:45.440 --> 21:48.000
It's a girl at my gym who often asks me to hang out.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.960
I'm a friendly gal, but I find her a little odd.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.280
And I'm just not interested in being friends, IRL.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.040
I've always made excuses and declined her invitations,

21:57.040 --> 21:58.640
but she keeps asking.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
Okay, I run into her a few times a week

22:00.640 --> 22:02.080
and I'm running out of pretend stuff to do.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.440
Is there any way to give her a more permanent brush off

22:05.440 --> 22:06.560
with minimal awkwardness?

22:07.680 --> 22:08.720
I can't.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.160
I've got a thing in Portland.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.400
Oh man, that's tricky, isn't it?

22:12.400 --> 22:13.120
This is tough.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.560
Okay, I will say that this situation

22:18.560 --> 22:21.120
that this person's in has not happened to me

22:21.680 --> 22:23.440
for like five years.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.920
So somewhere locked inside the codex that is my existence

22:27.920 --> 22:29.760
is the answer to this question.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.280
And we just have to, we just have to clue sew it out.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.200
Let me see if I can crack the code.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.880
Is it because you just stay in your house

22:36.880 --> 22:39.120
and play Destiny all day and you never have, yeah?

22:39.120 --> 22:41.120
I mean, that's one of the things that helps.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.800
I think that this is one of those frustrating things

22:44.800 --> 22:48.480
about everybody wants to think that they'll get the hint.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.800
And by saying like, oh, you know, I can't.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.560
Oh, I gotta do this thing.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.880
And you do that like 10 times, it's like, surely.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.360
Surely they know that if I wanted to,

22:57.360 --> 22:58.640
I would have made this thing.

22:58.640 --> 23:02.400
Except that like people who ask you 10 times

23:02.400 --> 23:05.040
and you keep making excuses aren't those people.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.480
Aren't the people who get the hint.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.960
And so one of two ways, you either need to say like,

23:10.960 --> 23:12.640
listen, my schedule is just really busy

23:12.640 --> 23:15.360
and I don't think that like I'm gonna have any free time

23:15.360 --> 23:18.160
in it like I'm working on this new project or whatever

23:18.160 --> 23:20.560
and I'm just gonna be booked up for like ever.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.960
Or stop going to the gym.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.760
Can I bounce this idea off you guys

23:25.760 --> 23:26.880
and just see how it sticks?

23:26.880 --> 23:32.960
Like the older I get, the more I come to realize

23:32.960 --> 23:35.280
that one of the most important characteristics

23:35.280 --> 23:36.080
of a good friend,

23:36.640 --> 23:38.880
not the most important characteristic, right?

23:38.880 --> 23:42.800
You have to like get along on that special level

23:42.800 --> 23:46.960
and be genuinely interested in and care about each other.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.400
That's the most important thing.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.960
But the older I get, like the more important it becomes

23:51.520 --> 23:54.320
a trait for like a friend of mine to have

23:54.320 --> 23:57.040
is to just not be a complete fucking flake.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.640
Is to actually like want to do stuff,

24:00.640 --> 24:03.280
want to spend time with me, want to like,

24:03.840 --> 24:05.920
and when we make plans like stick with them,

24:06.960 --> 24:09.600
like a fair sort of trade off between who comes up

24:09.600 --> 24:11.840
with the plans but like both of you getting excited

24:11.840 --> 24:12.960
about it and doing it.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.920
Like all of the friends that I have now are like that.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.080
They're really, really good about that actually.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.600
But I've definitely like shed some friends

24:21.600 --> 24:24.000
that didn't do that because it's, I don't know,

24:24.000 --> 24:25.520
it's like the, it's the worst.

24:25.520 --> 24:29.440
So, I mean, this person wanting to spend time with you,

24:30.640 --> 24:31.200
I don't know.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.920
I think that seems like actually a pretty dope trait.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.480
And if you're uncomfortable about it,

24:36.480 --> 24:38.240
maybe you just need to get to know them better.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.840
This could be your, we could have like a Kirsten Coe

24:41.840 --> 24:43.440
and Julie Cooper situation on our hands

24:43.440 --> 24:44.560
where you don't know that you're supposed

24:44.560 --> 24:45.600
to be best friends forever.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.680
But then four seasons later, there you are.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.880
But if I can counterpoint that, Griffin,

24:50.880 --> 24:53.120
like I would say that what's funny about this

24:53.120 --> 24:54.800
is if you put it in a different context

24:54.800 --> 24:56.640
and put it in like a dating context

24:56.640 --> 24:58.640
and you went on like four or five dates with someone

24:58.640 --> 24:59.920
and like you just weren't interested

24:59.920 --> 25:00.880
in taking it to the next level,

25:00.880 --> 25:03.360
or somebody was asking you out that you knew,

25:03.360 --> 25:04.960
it's way easier to say like,

25:04.960 --> 25:07.040
oh no, I don't wanna go out with this person

25:07.040 --> 25:08.480
because I'm not interested in them.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.440
But this has, this has,

25:09.440 --> 25:11.920
this situation has none of the baggage associated

25:11.920 --> 25:13.120
with what you just described.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.240
It's literally a person that you have had,

25:16.240 --> 25:18.720
you know, moderate exposure to saying,

25:18.720 --> 25:20.080
hey, you seem like a cool person.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.920
I'm gonna come up with plans for stuff if you wanna,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.560
like, I don't know, I would go get a drink with this person.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.720
But if you're not friend-tracted to them,

25:26.720 --> 25:27.600
like why do it?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.240
Why like give them that false sense of like,

25:30.240 --> 25:31.680
oh yeah, now we're buddies.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.200
Friend-tracted is not a fucking thing.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.160
Like I have friends, like dear, dear friends

25:36.160 --> 25:37.040
that I didn't like,

25:38.240 --> 25:40.080
like the first few times that we hung out,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.320
like I just didn't like get to know them.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.000
And I have really good friends

25:44.000 --> 25:46.480
that I sort of thought I was sort of

25:48.080 --> 25:50.480
like characteristically opposed to

25:50.480 --> 25:52.560
because they're so different from the people

25:52.560 --> 25:53.680
I typically hang out with.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.560
And then, you know, I hung out with them a few times

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
and not only did like we become very dear friends,

25:58.560 --> 25:59.360
but I changed.

25:59.360 --> 26:04.080
Like my perception of what people I dig on,

26:04.080 --> 26:06.240
like the people that I like to associate with

26:06.240 --> 26:08.560
completely changed because this person changed it.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.600
Like I think the more you can sort of expose yourself

26:11.600 --> 26:12.240
to people like that,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.560
the better your life is gonna be.

26:14.560 --> 26:15.760
Well, okay, so I'll say this.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.800
I think that going out for like a drink with this person

26:18.800 --> 26:21.280
benefits you in two ways.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.880
One, maybe Griffin's right.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.800
Maybe you do end up like, oh, you know what?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.720
We'd only ever talked in like a gym setting

26:26.720 --> 26:28.640
in this weird like public setting.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.440
Yeah, it turns out that like I actually do like this

26:31.440 --> 26:33.440
or it puts you in the position

26:33.440 --> 26:35.440
that since you at least gave it a shot,

26:36.080 --> 26:38.640
it's way easier, especially on your conscious

26:38.640 --> 26:40.880
and conscience to then say like, okay,

26:42.640 --> 26:44.880
you know, I'm really busy, I can't.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.640
And you don't have to come up with elaborate things

26:46.640 --> 26:48.960
because you already gave it a shot and it wasn't great.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.560
You didn't like it, then like.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.320
Yeah, why don't you just try it?

26:52.320 --> 26:52.880
Just try it.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.760
You're not, you're not.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.280
Unless she's a serial killer.

26:58.080 --> 26:58.880
You're probably gonna be fine.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.360
Obviously, like if it's like a danger situation

27:01.360 --> 27:03.200
and you know what you're doing,

27:03.200 --> 27:04.240
but like, I don't know.

27:04.240 --> 27:08.400
I can't imagine myself ever being in a position

27:08.400 --> 27:13.200
where like I don't wanna make any more friends.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.200
And I don't know, I don't wanna come off

27:15.200 --> 27:16.880
like on my high horse saying,

27:16.880 --> 27:18.240
you should be friends with everyone.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.000
But I definitely think it's like,

27:20.640 --> 27:22.960
I think everybody's, you know, worth a shot.

27:22.960 --> 27:23.840
You should have a kid.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
Once you have a kid, you will be shocked

27:26.400 --> 27:28.960
at how quickly that mode switches to just like

27:29.520 --> 27:31.360
the plane is going down

27:31.360 --> 27:34.480
and you're throwing friends off like weighty cargo,

27:34.480 --> 27:37.280
just trying to keep some semblance of a social life afloat.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.760
You will be surprised how quickly that changes.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.680
Well, okay.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.640
Oh, there you go.

27:42.640 --> 27:42.880
Trust me.

27:42.880 --> 27:43.520
Give it a shot.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.200
Give it a shot.

27:45.200 --> 27:45.920
What could it hurt?

27:46.560 --> 27:47.600
Y'all wanna know Yahoo?

27:48.880 --> 27:50.640
Sure, sure.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.240
I'll make it a quick one.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.840
I'll make it a quick one so we can get to that money zone.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.280
My favorite part of the show.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.000
The money part of it.

27:58.000 --> 27:58.960
Tasty, tasty money zone.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.800
This one was sent in by,

28:00.800 --> 28:03.040
oh, game recognize that goddamn game again,

28:03.040 --> 28:03.760
Rachel Sperling.

28:03.760 --> 28:04.080
Thank you.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.680
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Snuggly Duckling, who asks,

28:08.800 --> 28:11.040
if you could recolor an animal,

28:11.040 --> 28:13.520
what would you recolor and to what color?

28:17.520 --> 28:18.400
Okay, hold on.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.880
Okay, give me one more time.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.000
If you could recolor an animal,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.440
and what would you recolor and to what color?

28:27.440 --> 28:29.520
Let me hit you guys just because I know you're percolating.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.040
I've had some time to percolate already.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.720
I would probably-

28:34.720 --> 28:38.640
By the way, a quick bit of my brother and my brother made trivia.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.040
Okay.

28:39.040 --> 28:42.800
When one of us says, can you read it again just so I can try to,

28:42.800 --> 28:44.080
that means we weren't listening.

28:44.080 --> 28:44.560
Correct.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.160
I was checking my Facebook messages.

28:48.160 --> 28:48.960
Oh, terrific.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.040
At least it was something important,

28:53.040 --> 28:55.120
yeah, and not something completely menial.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.000
That shit wouldn't wait.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.720
And meaningless.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.160
I would do alligators, I think,

29:00.160 --> 29:03.040
because I've never seen an alligator and been like, perfect.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.640
You know what I mean?

29:04.640 --> 29:05.600
Every time I see an alligator,

29:05.600 --> 29:07.520
it's like your shit looks kind of modeled

29:07.520 --> 29:10.160
and I'm not super crazy about it.

29:10.720 --> 29:14.560
And that goes for the stark white ones with the red eyes.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.080
Fuck those guys.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.120
What would you change it to?

29:20.640 --> 29:22.880
What about bright cherry red, like a hot flaming red?

29:22.880 --> 29:23.440
Okay, extinct.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.320
They're extinct.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.520
Just like that, they're extinct.

29:25.520 --> 29:25.680
Why?

29:25.680 --> 29:27.040
They've lost their natural camouflage

29:27.040 --> 29:28.400
that they use in the swamps to hunt.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.680
They're bright and obvious.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.200
You just killed all the alligators.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.240
Of what's killing alligators?

29:32.240 --> 29:33.440
Hey, can I ask a question?

29:33.440 --> 29:35.760
Other than hippos, which as we all know,

29:35.760 --> 29:36.960
can swallow alligators whole,

29:36.960 --> 29:37.920
what's killing alligators?

29:37.920 --> 29:38.480
They die of starvation.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.840
They're fucking starving, Griffin,

29:39.840 --> 29:42.400
because everything's like, oh, hey,

29:42.400 --> 29:44.480
there's a fucking bright red alligator over there.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.320
I'm just going to move over here.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.200
It's just going to have to work.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.440
Oh, it's just going to have to work a little bit harder on it.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.120
And honestly, guys, if we're being honest,

29:51.120 --> 29:55.760
I think that reducing the population of alligators,

29:57.840 --> 29:59.920
I think it's time that somebody took them down a peg.

29:59.920 --> 30:04.720
Just to be clear, you want to thin the alligator herd

30:04.720 --> 30:09.440
to a smaller, more refined crop of bright red super hunters.

30:09.440 --> 30:14.160
That's what you want, like the Corvette of murderers.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.640
You're out on the golf course in the Keys, right?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.680
And you see an alligator and your day's fucking ruined, right?

30:21.200 --> 30:25.760
My solution is to reduce the alligator population by about 90%.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.520
So you're going to have way less of those encounters.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.560
But when you do encounter an alligator, you're dead.

30:30.560 --> 30:34.000
Oh, that's one of Griffin's bright red super killer alligators.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.400
They're perfect hunters, and they will eat fucking anything.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.080
Okay, and for those people, I'm sorry.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.040
Yeah, I fucked you.

30:41.040 --> 30:41.920
I fucked you real good.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.160
I fucked you right in that gator's mouth is what I did.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.920
But for the millions of lives that I helped

30:47.920 --> 30:49.920
by reducing the number of alligator sightings

30:49.920 --> 30:51.440
on the golf courses in the Keys,

30:51.440 --> 30:53.760
those people paid a lot of money for tea time.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.840
They are going to have themselves a really great day

30:55.840 --> 30:57.760
drinking their shandy out on the holes.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.080
And then maybe one of them gets eaten by a super gator.

31:00.080 --> 31:06.960
But for those other people, a clean, very calm golfing session.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.080
And that's my gift to the world.

31:08.080 --> 31:08.960
You're welcome.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.160
You know what mine would be?

31:10.160 --> 31:10.560
What's that?

31:11.520 --> 31:15.440
I would make all spiders really bright glow in the dark.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.560
Okay, so sort of the same principle a little bit?

31:18.560 --> 31:20.240
Yeah, because I fucking hate spiders,

31:20.240 --> 31:23.920
and I'd really like to know if they were on me in the dark.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.080
See, for me, ignorance is bliss vis-a-vis spiders.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.600
I know they're everywhere.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.640
I live in Texas.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.080
There are fucking scorpions here,

31:30.080 --> 31:31.680
and them and the spiders are just fighting

31:31.680 --> 31:33.680
constantly a secret war in my yard.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.960
I just, I would kind of not.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.440
I feel like if that happened, Travis,

31:37.440 --> 31:39.040
your room would be iridescent

31:39.040 --> 31:40.640
because there's spiders like secretly everywhere.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.760
Well, don't tell me that, Griffin,

31:41.760 --> 31:43.440
because I need to sleep again or I'll die.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.680
If you don't sleep, you will die.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.480
Yeah, sure.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.520
I'm just saying that it would also make it hard to sleep

31:49.520 --> 31:52.480
if, you know, glowing spiders everywhere would.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.560
But they wouldn't be everywhere

31:54.560 --> 31:56.800
because I would spend three days,

31:56.800 --> 31:59.280
three sleepless days murdering them.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.040
Yeah, all of them in the world

32:01.040 --> 32:02.080
or just sort of in your house?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.760
If that's what it took.

32:03.760 --> 32:04.260
Okay.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.920
Justin, you got any ideas?

32:05.920 --> 32:07.200
I'm not gonna sit here and play God.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.560
Oh, okay.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.840
You just think God got it in one.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.480
Absolutely.

32:12.480 --> 32:13.840
I mean, like, over time,

32:14.640 --> 32:16.400
we've evolved a very fragile ecosystem.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.000
I think man's done enough damage there

32:18.000 --> 32:20.880
without me fucking making pandas green, you know?

32:20.880 --> 32:24.800
Like, I think that it's just fine.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.280
No, I think we can all agree.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.960
I'm with Justin to a certain extent.

32:28.960 --> 32:32.080
I think God got it right for a lot of animals.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.920
Pandas wouldn't change a thing actually there.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.200
I think that that's optimal cuddliness.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.840
A capybara, perfect.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.880
I'm super into, like, the flavor that they're bringing.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.440
I'm just saying, like, let's have fun with it, Justin.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.120
We're in the imagisphere now.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.360
Okay, what about if you change the ball eagle?

32:49.920 --> 32:51.440
Because it's already America's symbol.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.160
Oh, I see.

32:52.160 --> 32:52.880
It's a little boring.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.200
What if you change it to, like, jet black

32:55.200 --> 32:57.360
with, like, red neon eyes?

32:57.360 --> 33:01.600
And maybe, like, some tracers, like, along the bottom.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.240
Like, some neon tracers.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.720
And a couple LEDs on its, like, around its...

33:04.720 --> 33:07.040
Well, what about on its under...

33:07.040 --> 33:08.880
A few woofers and tweeters.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.680
And on its belly, a bright yellow patch of feathers

33:11.680 --> 33:12.640
that looks like a dick.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.360
And when he flies over, it's like, ah, got you.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.280
And everybody salutes that dick.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.000
He saw it.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.520
That's America's dick.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.720
Man, Justin, I thought for sure

33:20.720 --> 33:22.000
you were gonna say red, white, and blue.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.200
Nah.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.440
That's like America's, like, whole color scheme.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.320
Yeah, that's like...

33:26.320 --> 33:29.280
No, instead it sounds like you made it German colors.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.720
Red, yellow, and black.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.640
If it's red, white, and blue, you get it in front of a flag,

33:32.640 --> 33:33.920
and it's like, where did it go?

33:33.920 --> 33:34.240
Yeah.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.080
Well, that's its natural camouflage.

33:36.080 --> 33:36.800
Yeah.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.360
Its camouflage is hiding in front of American flags.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.360
Yeah, and it eats NASCAR patrons.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.600
It's a sacrifice we gotta make to freedom.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.040
Listen, listen, Phil, I've told you once,

33:51.040 --> 33:52.080
I told you a thousand times,

33:52.080 --> 33:54.640
I'm not doing any more NASCAR races in Florida.

33:54.640 --> 33:58.320
Places infested by a camouflage...

33:58.320 --> 34:00.320
Super gators and dick eagles.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.800
Super gators and dick eagles everywhere.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.560
When was the last time you slept, Frank?

34:06.560 --> 34:08.000
I can't, the spiders...

34:08.000 --> 34:10.160
Yeah, there's glowing spiders everywhere.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.160
Okay, well, you're gonna take a short sabbatical, Frank.

34:14.160 --> 34:21.520
The super gators, the dick eagles, they're everywhere.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.720
They would, of course, be natural enemies, right?

34:25.840 --> 34:29.840
Super gator versus dick eagle, this Friday on the Sci-Fi channel.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.800
This is actually a funny coincidence,

34:32.800 --> 34:34.720
Justin Travis and I all went to Huntington High School,

34:34.720 --> 34:37.520
the mascot of which was the super gator.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.120
And our rivals in Cabo Midland,

34:39.120 --> 34:40.960
bunch of dick eagles over there is what they were.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.120
Bunch of dick eagles, that mascot was, of course.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.200
Not a lot of people liked going to those games.

34:58.960 --> 35:04.480
I got a text this morning from my dear friend, Tommy Red.

35:04.480 --> 35:11.040
We met the day before first grade started outside of his dad's house.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.760
And I got a text from Tommy this morning.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.400
My dear oldest friend in the world, Tommy Red.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.760
Well, not my oldest, because he...

35:17.760 --> 35:21.680
Anyway, I got a text from Tommy Red today that said,

35:22.960 --> 35:25.680
got back from Texas today to find my me undies arrived.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.280
These things are no joke.

35:27.280 --> 35:30.000
They have lived up to the hype and make my junk look amazing.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.200
And he's a big man.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.800
He's a big man.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.920
He's 12 and a half feet tall.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.880
And girth wise, he's got a giant penis.

35:36.880 --> 35:37.520
He's huge.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.920
Tommy Red says that me undies are no joke.

35:41.920 --> 35:45.920
And I'm here to tell you that they are super, super great.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.880
The best underwear you will ever wear are me undies.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.240
That's all they do.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.360
That's what they're dedicated to.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.200
They want comfortable underwear that fit great.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.880
Don't ride up on you and literally pull moisture away from your skin.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.320
So you're cool all day long.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.800
This morning I woke up, all my me undies were dirty.

36:02.800 --> 36:06.880
I put on some, let's just call them off brand underwear.

36:07.520 --> 36:13.040
The first thing I did as soon as I hoisted the waistband up around my navel,

36:13.040 --> 36:17.600
I vomited onto the ground because I hated the sensations.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.200
It was so displeasurable to me.

36:19.200 --> 36:19.760
Yeah, sure.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.480
Miserable, miserable.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.960
You know, I'm gonna say this.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.000
I think they would make excellent Valentine's Day presents.

36:28.000 --> 36:28.960
Oh, for sure.

36:28.960 --> 36:29.760
Oh my God, yeah.

36:29.760 --> 36:36.720
Yeah, I guess it's tantamount to sort of like getting somebody lingerie

36:36.720 --> 36:39.120
that you yourself is going to wear.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.160
You get some me undies.

36:40.160 --> 36:45.040
This is functional, practical lingerie, all day lingerie

36:45.040 --> 36:48.240
for whatever genitals you're bringing to the table.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.800
It's the lingerie that says, this is actually for you.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.120
This isn't like for me to enjoy on you.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.080
This is for you.

36:54.080 --> 36:54.880
You're welcome.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.880
Well, it's for both of you because you're gonna look better.

36:56.880 --> 36:57.920
This is for you and your genitals.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.960
You're gonna feel better.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.160
You're gonna smell better.

37:00.160 --> 37:04.560
I don't wanna get blue, but there's an odor problem.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.480
If you were to buy underwear of this quality,

37:06.480 --> 37:08.560
normally they would cost you twice as much

37:08.560 --> 37:09.840
as they cost you at me undies,

37:09.840 --> 37:10.800
but they're not gonna do that.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.080
They've got no middleman, so that's more savings for you.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.680
But get this, they're gonna get even cheaper, okay?

37:17.680 --> 37:20.400
Go to meundies.com slash my brother

37:20.400 --> 37:25.280
and you're gonna get 20% off your first order and free shipping.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.760
And you can save even more when you buy a pack of them.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.080
So there.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.520
I recently went through my underwear drawer

37:31.520 --> 37:33.920
and there was a great reckoning, mostly socks related,

37:33.920 --> 37:36.960
because my sock game, guys, not on point.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.000
I had socks that I've had since college and they're not...

37:40.800 --> 37:44.640
That's a true mark of maturity when you look at a grimy,

37:44.640 --> 37:48.400
whole plagued sock and you think, I don't have to wear this.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.880
These were socks in name only.

37:50.880 --> 37:56.000
They were more like craft materials at this point.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.560
And there was a reckoning, there was a purge.

37:58.560 --> 38:02.160
And now I have freed up more space to fill with beautiful,

38:02.160 --> 38:06.080
functional, practical, dare I say sexy, me undies.

38:06.080 --> 38:06.880
Say it.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.080
They're sexy, sexy.

38:08.960 --> 38:09.760
Sexy.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.360
20% off, go to meundies.com slash my brother.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.920
Listen, folks, Valentine's Day is next week

38:15.920 --> 38:17.920
and that means one thing.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.440
Or if you're listening to this in March,

38:19.440 --> 38:21.520
Valentine's Day was three weeks ago and you missed it.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.080
Yeah, or if you're listening to this in 2028.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.960
Valentine's Day was a fixed point in time.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.600
Okay, at some point coming up soon now as you record this,

38:31.600 --> 38:35.760
and that means one thing, it's time to bulk up the fiction

38:35.760 --> 38:38.640
of your secret Canadian girlfriend or boyfriend.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.440
Okay.

38:39.440 --> 38:43.200
Pete, you've been telling them about this man or woman

38:43.200 --> 38:44.720
for quite some time.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.720
All your coworkers don't believe they exist.

38:46.720 --> 38:52.480
Well, now's the time to really support it with some evidence.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.840
Have you listened to Serial?

38:53.840 --> 38:54.640
Mm-hmm.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.600
That's what this is about, right?

38:57.600 --> 38:59.760
So listen, how are you gonna do that?

38:59.760 --> 39:02.880
Well, you're gonna get 100 blooms of love

39:02.880 --> 39:07.520
with a free glass vase for just $19.99.

39:07.520 --> 39:11.200
You can help bulk up the fiction of your secret Canadian

39:11.200 --> 39:12.240
boyfriend or girlfriend.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.360
Oh, Mike Swear exists.

39:13.360 --> 39:14.240
Mike Myers got me those.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.120
We're dating.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.800
Mike Myers got me those, we're dating.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.160
Oh, Mike, yeah.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.000
These are from Colby Smulders.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.600
Did you even see Love Guru?

39:22.400 --> 39:24.480
Because that man in that movie got me these flowers.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.240
Dude, do you even guru?

39:26.240 --> 39:28.880
Dude, do you guru at all?

39:28.880 --> 39:31.040
That movie was great.

39:31.040 --> 39:34.400
You can add gourmet chocolates and a stuffed bear

39:34.400 --> 39:36.320
for just $9.99.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.560
Do you realize what a deal, I mean, in all seriousness,

39:38.560 --> 39:39.360
that's a deal.

39:40.320 --> 39:44.160
Listen, the flowers definitely, the stuffed bear, great.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.280
When you get home to that cold, lonely apartment

39:47.280 --> 39:48.960
and the fiction dissolves around you

39:48.960 --> 39:50.400
like so much cotton candy.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.640
A fiction that even you bought into is so convincing.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.160
A fiction that you yourself bought into.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.680
Yeah, Mike Myers would love me.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.040
You're gonna need those chocolates.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.680
You're gonna say $9.99 well spent.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.440
And then you'll realize that Mike Myers

40:03.440 --> 40:05.040
doesn't love you or anyone.

40:05.920 --> 40:09.840
As you watch Shrek 3 and jerk off into a hat.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.720
You're Mike Myers hat that folds up the brim

40:12.720 --> 40:15.440
and it's like a fold up pop out of Wayne's world.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.920
How's our advertisement?

40:22.960 --> 40:25.200
These are some weird bullet points.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.040
Finally, we're reading what's written here.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.120
This is just like word for word.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.840
Jerk, let me see, let me see.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.080
Imaginary Canadian boyfriend, yeah, jerk off into a hat.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.120
Yeah, guys, we're good.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.400
Do you want me to read it?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.720
Guys, we're good, do you want to move on?

40:40.720 --> 40:42.320
Yeah, we're so good.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.520
Here's how you get it though.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.760
Listen, you're gonna go to proflowers.com

40:45.760 --> 40:48.160
and you're gonna use the code MYBROTHER.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.520
There's a blue microphone when you go to proflowers.com.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.520
There's a blue microphone in the top right corner.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.400
You're gonna click on that and type in MYBROTHER.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.600
We guarantee you're gonna feel like an all star

40:59.600 --> 41:10.800
as you look at these flowers and jerk off into your Shrek hat.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.800
They arrive fresh and they are guaranteed

41:12.800 --> 41:15.040
the last seven days or more and they do.

41:15.040 --> 41:15.680
They're amazing.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.240
They do.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.800
All joking aside, we actually have some in our house now

41:18.800 --> 41:21.200
from Pro Flowers and it's like, I don't know.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.920
It's the most beautiful flowers I've ever had

41:23.920 --> 41:25.360
in a home that I owned.

41:25.360 --> 41:30.560
I mean, even if you don't want to do it as a romantic gesture,

41:30.560 --> 41:32.560
they are just sort of nice to have around.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.240
I didn't think I was a plants guy,

41:34.240 --> 41:38.240
but I am genuinely enjoying this flora.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.480
Go to proflowers.com, click on the blue microphone

41:40.480 --> 41:41.840
and type in MYBROTHER.

41:41.840 --> 41:45.040
Have you guys heard about commingle.io?

41:46.160 --> 41:48.640
Let's assume that I have not and you tell me about it

41:48.640 --> 41:50.240
because that's what they paid for.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.680
Let me tell you about it, Travis.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.800
Holy shit.

41:52.800 --> 41:57.760
Wait, I want to tell you about their flagship product,

41:57.760 --> 41:58.720
the mod.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.040
Okay.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.800
The mod is...

42:01.840 --> 42:03.120
Is it like a video game?

42:03.120 --> 42:04.720
I feel so lucky.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.360
I feel like I need to refund these people's money

42:07.360 --> 42:09.360
and pay them more money.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.480
They have given us the gift of these wonderful words

42:12.480 --> 42:13.520
you're about to hear.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.480
I'm just going to read this for bucking vadum.

42:17.040 --> 42:17.280
Okay.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.760
Did you say ver-bucking babe?

42:19.760 --> 42:23.680
Ver-ver-ver-ver-ver.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.320
Yeah, we got it.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.760
Oh man.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.080
Okay.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.120
Ver-bate.

42:27.120 --> 42:27.680
Okay.

42:27.680 --> 42:27.920
Listen.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.200
Can someone reset Justin?

42:30.480 --> 42:31.840
The mod is a...

42:31.840 --> 42:33.040
Let me get both Sivas in here.

42:33.040 --> 42:33.600
He can handle this.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.240
No, no.

42:34.240 --> 42:34.640
I don't want to hear both Sivas.

42:34.640 --> 42:39.840
The mod is a multi vibrating open source dildo platform.

42:40.720 --> 42:45.440
It's powerful, pure body, safe silicone, gender neutral,

42:45.440 --> 42:48.880
and you can control it with any kind of sensor you want.

42:48.880 --> 42:53.360
For instance, squeezing, thrusting motions, music,

42:53.360 --> 42:56.960
cameras, paddles, Geiger counters, head massagers,

42:56.960 --> 42:58.640
breathing, and your pulse.

42:58.640 --> 43:02.800
I would suggest an EMF ghost detector.

43:04.000 --> 43:04.400
Right?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.360
A great idea.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.800
I'm actually going to stick with the inputs.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.240
I'm going to stick with the Geiger counter

43:10.240 --> 43:13.360
just because I just want to make sure everything's real safe up there.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.840
Can you set it like an alarm to wake you up in the morning?

43:15.840 --> 43:20.480
So that you can let your toy react to a sexy situation with you or your partner.

43:20.480 --> 43:24.640
What about that talk boy that you bought when Home Alone 2 came out

43:24.640 --> 43:26.240
and now it controls a dildo?

43:26.880 --> 43:31.200
Can you set it that like it reacts to everybody loves Raymond in some way?

43:31.760 --> 43:32.400
Yes.

43:32.400 --> 43:32.880
Bop it.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.160
Twist it.

43:34.880 --> 43:35.760
Ram jam it.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.120
Right up in it.

43:37.680 --> 43:38.480
Now twist it.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.880
Is the pizza here yet?

43:40.880 --> 43:42.000
Oh, there's the doorbell.

43:42.000 --> 43:42.640
It's here.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.120
Whoa.

43:43.120 --> 43:43.440
Hold on.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.240
I got my dominoes.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.840
I didn't hear anything.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.520
No, it's probably here.

43:47.520 --> 43:51.120
Got my dominoes pizza tracker synced up with my dildo.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.960
Just waiting for it to go to quality check.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.480
Thank you, Derek.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.320
Thank you, Mike Myers.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.920
When that garage door opens, so do I.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.560
Yeah.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.360
Oh man.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.280
What a wonderful product, the mod.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.920
What a fucking the best product ever.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.840
At commingle.io.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.400
So go visit commingle.io

44:12.400 --> 44:14.640
and you can contribute to their Indiegogo campaign

44:14.640 --> 44:18.160
and purchase your own mod dildo while supplies last.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.520
Now it says mod dildo,

44:19.520 --> 44:22.480
but that's a multi-vibrating open source dildo dildo.

44:22.480 --> 44:26.800
And I don't think that's what the mod is the name of the dildo.

44:26.800 --> 44:27.280
The mod.

44:27.280 --> 44:27.440
Yeah.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.360
Whenever anybody says the word mod from now on,

44:29.360 --> 44:33.120
I'll just think it's a open source dildo platform.

44:33.120 --> 44:36.240
I got a message for Corey and it's from Andrew.

44:36.240 --> 44:40.000
Is it Corey or cause it's they phonetically spelled it Corey.

44:40.000 --> 44:40.500
Corey.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.780
Corey.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.100
Okay.

44:42.100 --> 44:45.220
I got a message for Corey from Andrew.

44:45.220 --> 44:46.500
There's an exclamation point at the end.

44:47.220 --> 44:48.020
Hi and hello.

44:48.020 --> 44:49.220
It's me, Andrew.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.460
It's been a delightful year getting to know you

44:51.460 --> 44:53.060
and young Cooper over whiskey, tea,

44:53.620 --> 44:55.620
sleepy music and cat puzzles.

44:55.620 --> 44:58.660
Here's to another like real humans smooches.

44:59.220 --> 45:00.340
I love you a whole bunch.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.220
Happy anniversary from this lightning horse

45:03.220 --> 45:05.860
and the three brothers to the sweetest cloud banger

45:05.860 --> 45:07.460
he could ask for pear syrup.

45:07.460 --> 45:08.260
Guys.

45:08.260 --> 45:10.980
Guys, stop with the coded messages.

45:10.980 --> 45:13.540
Just whatever happened to, to.

45:13.540 --> 45:14.420
Predictability.

45:14.980 --> 45:15.380
I know.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.620
The milk man, the paper boy.

45:17.620 --> 45:17.860
Yeah.

45:18.340 --> 45:18.820
Yeah.

45:18.820 --> 45:20.740
I loved step by step.

45:21.300 --> 45:23.540
Are cat puzzles when cats are wrapped around each other

45:23.540 --> 45:26.340
and you have to figure out a way to get them untangled.

45:26.340 --> 45:27.940
Yeah, I love doing those at Cracker Barrel

45:27.940 --> 45:29.380
when you're waiting for your table to open up.

45:29.380 --> 45:30.740
And if you're left with three cats,

45:30.740 --> 45:31.940
you're an egg new Ray moose.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.580
I think it's when a cat traps you.

45:34.580 --> 45:38.260
I think egg new Ray Meowth.

45:38.260 --> 45:41.380
I think it's when the cat traps you in a deadly game

45:41.380 --> 45:43.620
and you have to like prove how,

45:43.620 --> 45:48.020
how much you want to be alive by grievously injuring yourself.

45:48.020 --> 45:48.260
Yeah.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.860
Like Dr. Claw used to do to Inspector Gadget.

45:51.860 --> 45:53.460
It has a fucked up show.

45:53.460 --> 45:54.340
It was a fucked up show.

45:54.340 --> 45:55.620
He was a giant cat, right?

45:55.620 --> 45:55.860
Yeah.

45:55.860 --> 45:57.300
Happy anniversary.

45:57.300 --> 45:57.940
Yeah.

45:57.940 --> 45:59.380
Happy anniversary.

45:59.380 --> 46:02.500
I always thought that Dr. Claw was like just a bunch of cats

46:02.500 --> 46:04.580
in a person suit.

46:04.580 --> 46:05.860
Oh, we can talk about it off mic.

Jimmy Buffett, pranks, The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,

46:43.380 --> 46:45.620
Mountain Dew, theme park safety, dinner parties, butterflies,

46:45.620 --> 46:46.820
raccoons, pasta shapes, and Bob Dylan.

46:46.820 --> 46:47.780
Join us every other Monday.

46:47.780 --> 46:48.280
Yay.

46:50.820 --> 46:52.740
My girlfriend's cat is getting old.

46:52.740 --> 46:53.860
That's really the next question.

46:53.860 --> 46:54.740
So here it is.

46:54.740 --> 46:56.100
My girlfriend's cat is getting old.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.500
And recently she's decided to make my girlfriend's bed

46:58.500 --> 46:59.300
her home.

46:59.300 --> 47:01.700
This has greatly impacted our lovemaking.

47:01.700 --> 47:02.500
Oh, great.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.500
The cat does not enjoy being moved from her bed,

47:04.500 --> 47:06.660
and she scratches at the door if we do.

47:06.660 --> 47:10.100
This is distracting during the act and damaging the door.

47:10.100 --> 47:12.660
Should we accept that we will have an audience going forward,

47:12.660 --> 47:13.860
or is there another solution?

47:13.860 --> 47:14.660
This is from Joey.

47:15.380 --> 47:15.940
Joey.

47:15.940 --> 47:16.660
Joey.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.160
Nice.

47:18.100 --> 47:18.820
Shut up, cat.

47:20.260 --> 47:20.900
Nice.

47:20.900 --> 47:21.860
Joey, you're doing great.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.220
Joey, I'm just sitting over here really appreciating

47:25.220 --> 47:25.860
what you're doing.

47:25.860 --> 47:26.980
Cat, please stop.

47:26.980 --> 47:29.140
Cat, would you please just be cool?

47:29.140 --> 47:29.860
Hey, socks.

47:29.860 --> 47:32.020
Would you mind keeping it down for like a minute?

47:32.020 --> 47:34.020
No, I'm just saying that you're doing great.

47:34.020 --> 47:34.980
You're doing great.

47:34.980 --> 47:38.260
I don't know how humans do it, but you seem to be crushing it.

47:38.260 --> 47:39.860
Good moves, Joey.

47:41.140 --> 47:42.980
She seems to be enjoying it as well.

47:43.620 --> 47:48.100
This is like an amazing rarity for our show.

47:48.100 --> 47:49.540
I actually have-

47:49.540 --> 47:52.820
Oh, I don't want to hear like your sex stories.

47:52.820 --> 47:54.020
No, no, not a sex thing.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.220
Another Justin sexcapade.

47:57.220 --> 48:01.380
I have so many to tell about, but this is not one of those.

48:02.340 --> 48:06.180
We had a problem where the cats would always want to get into our room while we're asleep,

48:06.180 --> 48:10.820
but I don't like them rolling around in there because I'm a very light sleeper.

48:10.820 --> 48:14.500
So here is the actual solution that we have been using for years,

48:14.500 --> 48:15.700
and it actually works like a charm.

48:16.260 --> 48:19.940
I bought a baby gate, and I lean it up against the door.

48:20.740 --> 48:24.500
When we go to sleep, I put the baby gate in front of the door in our bedroom,

48:24.500 --> 48:25.700
and they can't claw out the door.

48:25.700 --> 48:29.540
It's amazing, and it's a brilliant solution to your problem.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.140
Congratulations, it's been fixed.

48:31.140 --> 48:35.780
If, assuming your cat weighs 65 pounds and can't negotiate a baby gate.

48:35.780 --> 48:36.820
No, it doesn't work out.

48:36.820 --> 48:38.740
Amelia doesn't do it either.

48:39.540 --> 48:40.820
We're in the clear.

48:40.820 --> 48:42.660
You put the baby gate up, the cat's not going to scratch the door.

48:42.660 --> 48:43.380
You can sleep.

48:43.380 --> 48:44.340
Don't sleep.

48:44.340 --> 48:48.100
I mean, make love, and then when you get older, sleep no matter what you want to do in the bedroom.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.300
Oh my God, make love, make love, make love.

48:49.300 --> 48:52.980
You have to do it as much as you can right now, because pretty soon,

48:52.980 --> 48:56.820
pretty soon, yeah, Cecil won't do that.

48:56.820 --> 48:58.260
Cecil learned how to scream.

48:58.260 --> 49:00.260
Motherfucker don't meow anymore, he just yells.

49:00.260 --> 49:03.380
Hey, that's him outside the door.

49:03.380 --> 49:03.880
Hey.

49:06.100 --> 49:07.620
I want to watch your lovemaking.

49:07.620 --> 49:08.900
Hey, wait, hey, hey.

49:09.460 --> 49:13.460
I hate, I hate, I love him, but boy howdy.

49:16.100 --> 49:17.060
But boo-boo nanny.

49:17.700 --> 49:20.580
He makes a boo-boo nanny like all the time scratching at the door,

49:20.580 --> 49:24.420
and I'm trying to make nanny boo-boo in the bedroom.

49:24.420 --> 49:25.460
Don't get those twisted.

49:26.020 --> 49:27.140
Oh my God, no.

49:27.140 --> 49:29.620
I mean, sometimes you can make a boo-boo nanny while you're making a nanny boo-boo.

49:29.620 --> 49:33.140
But do not make nanny boo-boo while you're making a boo-boo nanny.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.420
No, holy shit.

49:34.420 --> 49:35.780
How would you even do that?

49:35.780 --> 49:36.820
I don't even know.

49:36.820 --> 49:39.940
So are you slipping and falling and having an accident on the street?

49:39.940 --> 49:41.060
Whoa, we're sexing.

49:43.140 --> 49:43.940
Do you guys know Yahoo?

49:44.500 --> 49:45.380
Sure, yeah.

49:45.380 --> 49:49.940
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 5000 Yajushaman, Drew Davenport.

49:49.940 --> 49:50.420
Thank you, Drew.

49:50.420 --> 49:57.860
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Charissa Lozano, who asks,

49:59.540 --> 50:02.180
is it weird that I'm attracted to Transformers?

50:03.060 --> 50:03.380
Yes.

50:04.420 --> 50:10.900
Okay, I recently watched Transformers 4, and I started to notice that I find Prime,

50:11.620 --> 50:16.420
the enemy, I don't know what he's called, and especially Bumblebee attractive,

50:16.420 --> 50:23.060
even though they are like machines and not ever real, but I just find them sexy.

50:23.060 --> 50:25.780
I feel like it's weird, but I can't help it.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.140
Bumblebee is hot to me.

50:28.100 --> 50:30.820
Bumblebee is hot to me.

50:34.980 --> 50:37.140
Listen, I like to be cool with a lot of stuff.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.460
And this is no exception.

50:39.460 --> 50:40.100
Thank you, Travis.

50:40.100 --> 50:40.420
You're right.

50:40.420 --> 50:42.260
This is no exception, correct, Travis.

50:42.260 --> 50:44.340
You know, here's my question.

50:44.340 --> 50:47.140
It's not objective sexuality if they can move around and talk and shit.

50:47.140 --> 50:47.780
Is that what you're gonna ask?

50:47.780 --> 50:48.820
Okay, that's what, well, okay.

50:48.820 --> 50:49.220
It's not.

50:49.220 --> 50:50.980
Are you attracted to them when they're in car form?

50:50.980 --> 50:52.980
Because that's object sexuality.

50:52.980 --> 50:56.100
If you're attracted to them in robot form, that's a whole other thing.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.140
I don't know that.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.660
I don't know that that's accurate, Justin, because-

50:58.660 --> 51:00.500
No, because they're sentient.

51:00.500 --> 51:04.020
Who is the car boy who, when he eats spicy food, he turns into a car?

51:04.020 --> 51:04.500
Hot Rod.

51:05.060 --> 51:05.620
Hot Rod.

51:05.620 --> 51:06.020
Hot Rod.

51:06.020 --> 51:09.060
If you fuck Hot Rod's Hot Rod while he's a hot rod,

51:09.060 --> 51:11.380
is that objective sexuality, or are you having sex with the-

51:11.380 --> 51:12.820
I think it's a man in the car.

51:12.820 --> 51:15.380
It was not Hot Rod, it was Turbo Teen, Travis.

51:15.380 --> 51:16.180
Turbo Teen, asshole.

51:16.180 --> 51:16.980
I don't know.

51:16.980 --> 51:18.340
You're the one who knows about the show.

51:18.340 --> 51:19.220
I just answered first.

51:19.220 --> 51:21.700
Then why did you answer wrongly for him?

51:21.700 --> 51:23.940
Because I like to buzz in, Griffin.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.220
I know you do.

51:25.220 --> 51:28.500
That's why you have negative 86,000 Jeopardy dollars.

51:28.500 --> 51:29.460
But I'll get that.

51:29.460 --> 51:32.980
I've been keeping a running total for as long as we've been doing the show.

51:32.980 --> 51:34.900
Turbo Teen, you fuck him in car form.

51:34.900 --> 51:36.260
I think you just had man sex.

51:38.020 --> 51:41.780
This whole question would be way less weird to me if, okay.

51:41.780 --> 51:44.660
Imagine we lived in a world in which there really were transformers

51:44.660 --> 51:46.340
and people were attracted to them,

51:46.340 --> 51:49.220
and they were like a real life thing that you could walk out on the street and see.

51:50.020 --> 51:52.580
Okay, but they're CGI in a movie.

51:52.580 --> 51:53.460
That's weird.

51:53.460 --> 51:54.500
That's weird to me.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.540
Bumblebee can't even-

51:55.540 --> 51:57.060
Bumblebee's the one that doesn't talk, right?

51:57.780 --> 51:59.380
Yeah, Bumblebee has a radio.

52:00.020 --> 52:01.220
Bumblebee just has a radio, right?

52:01.220 --> 52:01.940
He doesn't talk.

52:01.940 --> 52:07.300
So the one that you want to fuck the most is the one that is still a special magic robot

52:07.300 --> 52:09.860
that can transform into a big robot or into a car,

52:09.860 --> 52:13.300
but doesn't have the fucking personality of like a sentient thing.

52:13.300 --> 52:17.220
It's just, you're fucking Spotify at that point.

52:17.220 --> 52:18.820
You're fucking robo Spotify.

52:19.380 --> 52:25.300
Fellow MaxFun podcast, The Flop House, just did Transformers Age of Extinction,

52:25.300 --> 52:26.900
which is an excellent episode.

52:26.900 --> 52:30.180
And in it, they make an excellent point, which is that there are robots,

52:30.180 --> 52:33.860
there are transformers that like have weird chain beards and are like,

52:33.860 --> 52:35.300
and it's like, wait, hold on.

52:35.300 --> 52:37.540
You can choose whatever form you turn into.

52:37.540 --> 52:40.340
Like this is- I don't think that's a hundred percent true though.

52:40.340 --> 52:41.140
You don't think so?

52:42.420 --> 52:43.460
Like that they can't like,

52:44.180 --> 52:47.620
because they choose what vehicle they're going to turn into.

52:48.180 --> 52:48.420
Right.

52:49.140 --> 52:50.100
I don't know that they're,

52:50.100 --> 52:53.460
I think it's just whatever vehicle is closest when they reach earth

52:53.460 --> 52:55.140
and interact with the AllSpark, right?

52:55.140 --> 52:55.700
Oh God.

52:56.740 --> 53:00.420
Immediately after arriving in a new world, in its transition form,

53:00.980 --> 53:07.140
a transformer begins trans scanning to choose and generate a new exostructure slash disguise,

53:07.140 --> 53:12.020
appropriate to both its size slash body mass and its new locale.

53:12.020 --> 53:13.700
That's fucked up though.

53:13.700 --> 53:17.300
So a transition form of a transformer is really basically,

53:18.260 --> 53:19.620
it's almost like a comet.

53:19.620 --> 53:24.340
It's like a protoform stage transformer that is engineered for travel.

53:24.340 --> 53:26.500
So once it lands on earth,

53:26.500 --> 53:29.620
it finds a new exostructure slash disguise appropriate

53:30.340 --> 53:33.300
to both its size slash body mass and its new locale.

53:33.300 --> 53:35.940
I don't know why if you could choose to be,

53:35.940 --> 53:40.500
like when you land on earth, if you could choose to be like a Pontiac or maybe an Eagle.

53:40.500 --> 53:43.300
Or a fucking 1970 AMC Gremlin.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.620
Like fuck, now I'm a Gremlin?

53:45.620 --> 53:47.300
I'm a fucking Hugo?

53:47.300 --> 53:47.800
Awesome.

53:48.980 --> 53:50.420
I don't think you get hung up on like,

53:51.060 --> 53:53.620
I think you have bigger fish to fry than gender roles.

53:53.620 --> 53:55.220
Like I don't think you need to worry about it.

53:55.220 --> 53:55.940
I'm sorry, Justin.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.980
I hate to throw a wrench into the works, if you will,

53:58.980 --> 54:02.580
but Bumblebee does change his car shape in the first movie

54:02.580 --> 54:06.900
because he's an old beat up car and it's like, oh, there's a nicer car.

54:06.900 --> 54:08.420
These are not canonical though.

54:08.420 --> 54:12.020
There is a lot of evidence to suggest that they're quickly able to adopt new forms.

54:12.020 --> 54:15.140
So how permanent a trans scan's alternate form becomes,

54:15.140 --> 54:17.300
as well as how easily a transformer can scan and adopt a new one.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.460
Like why is Barry still a fucking debate?

54:19.460 --> 54:21.700
Why is Barry still a fucking dodge dart?

54:22.660 --> 54:26.020
Okay, now I do have to say if you want to get into the novels,

54:26.020 --> 54:27.860
like if you get a prequel novel like yesterday,

54:27.860 --> 54:30.900
Bumblebee transforms like really fast.

54:30.900 --> 54:35.380
But is anybody, is any human's fucking Bumblebee is the question.

54:35.380 --> 54:39.300
We have gotten so wildly spun out into this whole universe.

54:39.300 --> 54:43.780
On The Flop House, they also theorize, and I really enjoyed,

54:43.780 --> 54:48.100
that when a human is driving one of the cars, the transformers in car form,

54:48.100 --> 54:50.420
since they are self-propelled and do not need a person,

54:50.420 --> 54:52.980
that they're basically, the steering wheel is like, they're clitoris.

54:53.780 --> 54:56.580
And they get huge sexual pleasure out of it.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.660
You know what guys, just go listen to that one.

54:58.660 --> 55:01.620
It's way better than us.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.420
I think I would want to fuck Vibrato.

55:05.940 --> 55:08.500
Vibrato, the modular dildo bot.

55:08.500 --> 55:08.900
Uh-huh.

55:09.540 --> 55:09.860
Well, that's weird.

55:09.860 --> 55:12.740
He doesn't do a lot as far as like fighting evil, but.

55:12.740 --> 55:15.060
Yeah, the rest of us turn into cars, Vibrato,

55:15.060 --> 55:19.860
and you turn into a modular top of the line, fully modern, fully Wi-Fi dildo.

55:19.860 --> 55:20.740
Gender neutral.

55:21.460 --> 55:25.540
You turn into a gender neutral, body safe silicone Wi-Fi dildo.

55:25.540 --> 55:26.980
How did you, I didn't even know we could do that.

55:26.980 --> 55:29.060
Yeah, I just believed in myself, I guess.

55:29.060 --> 55:32.260
I came down and I landed next to a top of the line, modern space.

55:32.260 --> 55:34.660
I guess I just had faith in myself and I knew I could do it.

55:34.660 --> 55:37.380
I landed next to a modern space dildo while I was in my transition phase.

55:37.380 --> 55:39.700
I trans scanned it and said, that looks pretty tight.

55:39.700 --> 55:41.460
So yeah, now I turn into a dildo.

55:41.460 --> 55:43.220
But like, you're way bigger than the dildo.

55:43.220 --> 55:45.700
So like, when you transform, like a lot of your stuff shrinks down.

55:45.700 --> 55:46.820
I had to cut off my arms.

55:46.820 --> 55:49.460
I'm telling you, I don't understand the technology of it.

55:49.460 --> 55:53.860
I just sort of compact down and I become this new space age super dildo.

55:53.860 --> 55:54.260
And it's-

55:54.260 --> 55:56.020
Autobot, roll out.

55:56.020 --> 55:56.900
Wait, hold on.

55:56.900 --> 55:58.580
Has anyone seen Vibrato?

55:58.580 --> 55:59.540
He hasn't been around.

55:59.540 --> 56:02.180
Like, has he transformed back in a while?

56:02.180 --> 56:04.980
I love this modular dildo I just bought, but God damn,

56:04.980 --> 56:08.100
I wish I could turn into a two story tall robot while I have it

56:08.740 --> 56:10.660
plugged deep in my ass.

56:10.660 --> 56:12.180
Oh God, here it comes.

56:12.180 --> 56:13.380
I'm dead now, of course.

56:13.380 --> 56:14.580
And here I do too.

56:14.580 --> 56:15.140
I'm dead.

56:15.140 --> 56:16.100
I'm dead now, of course.

56:16.100 --> 56:17.860
But wow, that was the ultimate orgasm.

56:20.020 --> 56:23.780
My body was torn asunder, but as it rained down, it was orgasming.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.740
So listen, guys, I just want to make something real clear.

56:26.740 --> 56:30.900
I'm not going to get into the whole war with the Decepticons and the whatever.

56:30.900 --> 56:32.180
I'm not choosing Psy.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.460
Autobots, roll out.

56:35.060 --> 56:36.100
I can't really roll.

56:36.100 --> 56:38.340
I guess if you put me on like a steep enough hill

56:38.340 --> 56:43.300
and I'm in the proper modular phase, I will roll.

56:43.300 --> 56:45.780
Yo, just turning back into a robot Vibrato.

56:47.140 --> 56:49.140
I'm actually kind of cool as it is.

56:49.140 --> 56:50.820
I'm kind of getting like ram jammed on the reg.

56:50.820 --> 56:52.980
So like, I'm actually pretty cool with it.

56:52.980 --> 56:55.620
But thank you, good luck being a fire truck and stuff

56:55.620 --> 56:57.540
or whatever it is you guys do out there.

56:58.100 --> 56:59.700
And there is a scene in the first movie

56:59.700 --> 57:02.580
where Bumblebee pees onto John Turturro.

57:02.580 --> 57:06.820
So that would indicate that they do have some kind of genitalia set up.

57:06.820 --> 57:09.300
John Turturro robot water sports.

57:09.860 --> 57:13.380
That's the best Google search string I think I've ever conceived.

57:15.220 --> 57:16.660
That's somebody's fetish.

57:16.660 --> 57:18.020
You see that and it turns you on.

57:18.020 --> 57:18.740
You're like, oh no.

57:18.740 --> 57:23.540
I can only finish when a two story robot urinates on John Turturro

57:23.540 --> 57:25.620
and it's got to be different every time.

57:26.500 --> 57:27.540
There is not going to be.

57:27.540 --> 57:29.700
And then you get on the internet like, oh, thank goodness.

57:29.700 --> 57:32.820
There's literally infinite web pages devoted to exactly this.

57:32.820 --> 57:34.500
You go to his IRDB page.

57:34.500 --> 57:37.780
Does a robot piss on John Turturro in Barton Fink?

57:37.780 --> 57:38.420
No, God.

57:38.420 --> 57:40.660
You might like Barton Fink.

57:40.660 --> 57:41.300
You might like.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.940
And then it just lists the 10 other John Turturro movies

57:43.940 --> 57:46.180
in which he gets urinated by a two story robot.

57:46.180 --> 57:48.660
What, Fading Gigolo?

57:49.300 --> 57:49.780
Maybe.

57:49.780 --> 57:50.580
Mr. Deeds.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.420
He definitely urinated on Mr. Deeds,

57:54.420 --> 57:56.820
but it's more of like a metaphysical urination.

57:56.820 --> 57:59.780
I think in Adam Sandler's like movie making contract,

57:59.780 --> 58:03.060
it's a law that a robot has to pee on someone.

58:03.060 --> 58:05.300
And if a robot's going to pee on someone in your movie,

58:05.300 --> 58:06.580
you might as well get the best.

58:10.740 --> 58:12.100
Folks, this has been our podcast.

58:12.100 --> 58:13.300
We went an hour and I was like,

58:13.300 --> 58:15.300
we're not going to get a title for this episode.

58:15.300 --> 58:17.940
And then John Turturro Robot Watersports popped up

58:17.940 --> 58:20.740
and it was like, hey, everything's going to be all right.

58:20.740 --> 58:21.460
I'm here.

58:21.460 --> 58:22.100
I'm here now.

58:23.700 --> 58:25.220
Thanks for listening to our show.

58:26.980 --> 58:30.180
So we still, in case you missed this news,

58:31.540 --> 58:35.300
we have expanded the venue for our upcoming live show

58:35.300 --> 58:37.380
in Chicago on April 5th, right?

58:37.380 --> 58:38.100
April 5th, yeah.

58:38.900 --> 58:42.420
On April 5th, we are in the Athenium Theater.

58:42.420 --> 58:45.700
There are some tickets still available for that.

58:45.700 --> 58:46.900
We sold a ton.

58:46.900 --> 58:47.700
Thank you, Chicago.

58:47.700 --> 58:50.340
It's already going to be our biggest show ever.

58:50.340 --> 58:51.780
So thank you so much.

58:51.780 --> 58:53.540
I'm thinking about now and I'm going to barf.

58:53.540 --> 58:53.780
Yeah.

58:54.500 --> 58:55.140
So thank you.

58:55.140 --> 58:56.500
If you want to get tickets to that,

58:56.500 --> 58:59.300
it's bit.ly forward slash n-b-n-b-a-m Chicago.

59:00.500 --> 59:03.620
And we have tickets to our Milwaukee show too.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.420
That's selling out fast.

59:04.420 --> 59:05.620
I think it's about 80% gone.

59:05.620 --> 59:07.140
So if you've been waiting to get tickets,

59:07.140 --> 59:08.340
make sure you get them real quick.

59:09.060 --> 59:10.020
That's what is that, Trav?

59:10.020 --> 59:10.500
What's the address?

59:10.500 --> 59:15.380
I want to say that that's bit.ly forward slash n-b-n-b-a-m-m-i-l.

59:15.940 --> 59:16.420
That's right.

59:17.140 --> 59:17.700
Okay, cool.

59:18.340 --> 59:20.100
We have live shows coming up.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.940
We have two live shows this weekend.

59:21.940 --> 59:25.380
One in L.A., one in San Francisco.

59:25.380 --> 59:29.940
We're very, very excited to see all of our California buddies again.

59:29.940 --> 59:32.340
Send in your questions, please, and send in your yahoos.

59:33.620 --> 59:36.100
We're getting a lot because we're doing two shows back to back.

59:36.100 --> 59:38.580
If I could take, can I take a minute, you guys?

59:38.580 --> 59:39.080
Sure.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.900
Do you mind if I have a minute here?

59:41.460 --> 59:44.820
Because it's time for the the annual my bim bam.

59:46.020 --> 59:50.180
Maybe, maybe check those yahoos before you send them in announcement.

59:50.180 --> 59:55.540
The courtesy announcement in which I annually just ask people to keep those yahoos

59:56.900 --> 59:58.340
civil a little bit.

59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.660
That maybe if you have like a really great one about like incest,

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.060
maybe you go ahead and keep that one.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.060
Go ahead and keep that one in the garbage where it belongs.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:13.780
Maybe if you have one about like tricking somebody into eating period blood,

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.820
maybe you just put that one right back in the garbage

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.740
and then you burn that garbage forever.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.740
It was a pretty, it was a pretty rowdy week in the inbox.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:29.620
A lot of really upsetting stuff that I was exposed to and am now a different

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.820
and one would say worse person just sort of across the board.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.420
Thank you all for sending in those yahoos.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.780
I know it takes time to dig for them, but just like if while you're digging,

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.740
you hit an incest turd, don't touch it.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:45.860
Leave it there or tell like a waste management professional about it.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.260
I also want you to know I'm just gonna real quick.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:54.340
I'm putting a moratorium for the time being on how do I deal with terrible co-worker questions

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.900
because we have done a ton of those and we get a ton of them a lot.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:02.980
I understand that co-workers are terrible, but just know that if you submit those questions,

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.140
it's probably gonna be a while before one of them makes it on the show.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.660
If you've listened to the show in like previous episodes

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.700
and you hear a question similar to the question you wanna ask

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.340
within like the last 40 episodes,

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.300
chances are it'll probably not make it on the show.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.100
We love really unique and like specific questions to your situation.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.500
So those kinds of things usually have a better shot.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.740
We've been in this fucking game for like 12 years now.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.620
So there's not a lot of ground we haven't uncovered.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.860
And that's not us chastising, by the way.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.540
I mean, it's no skin off our nose.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:39.140
We just wanna get as many people to get questions on the show as humanly possible.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.780
I wanna thank MeUndies for supporting our podcast.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.220
Go to meundies.com slash my brother

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.780
and you're gonna get 20% off your first order.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.460
And right now you get free shipping.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.500
So that's a deal.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.740
Oh, and one more thing about sending questions.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.380
It's probably none of you, but sending questions to mbnbam at gmail.com

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.700
is like the worst way to get a hold of Jesse Thorn.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.060
We get a lot of questions that are like,

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.660
hey, Jesse, we don't like, he doesn't check those.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.620
He doesn't work for us.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.900
And you should also send those to mbnbam at maximumfun.org.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.220
What's maximumfun.org, you ask?

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.820
Well, that's a podcast family with a lot of great shows.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.260
We talked about the Flophouse this week.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.820
We've got our D&D family fantasy adventure epic with our dad,

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.940
The Adventure Zone medical history podcast called Sawbones

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.940
that I do with my wife, Sydney, who's a physician.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.860
And then Travis does a show called Bunker Buddies with his buddy Andy,

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.300
and they talk about disaster scenarios and how you can survive them.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.860
There's a lot of non-macro related programming there too,

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.060
like Jordan, Jesse, Go and Bullseye,

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.140
a great pop culture show you should be listening to.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.220
John Hodgman with our friend-

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.540
John Hodgman.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:47.940
John Hodgman.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.460
It's kind of like right there.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:52.180
And a lot of people wonder how do you get to the maximum,

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.100
how do you get to maximumfun.org?

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.380
Well, you just go to booboo nanny.com.

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.180
Did you fucking-

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:58.660
And that's gonna lead you to-

01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.300
You are going-

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.420
You have a child that you have to support financially.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.220
You have to stop spending all your goddamn money on

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.140
Jokey Joke web domains that redirect to maximum to Mabim Bam,

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.980
but don't stop doing it because I love it.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.740
And it's my favorite thing about you.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.540
Just, okay.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.860
I just want to make sure that you do in fact love it.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.340
You can also access that through fartpatrol.com

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.940
or mysmoothface.com.

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.460
Oh my God, you did booboo nanny.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.740
Wait, I want to go.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.540
Can I tell you something though?

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.860
Is it b-o-o-b-o-o-nanny.com?

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.740
And by registering booboo nanny, Justin, can I say something?

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.140
What?

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.340
That was not a booboo nanny.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.460
Yeah, thanks.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.500
That was a sound decision.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.420
Once that phrase has fully seeded this earth,

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:46.660
I can't wait to hear like how it is translated into different languages.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.820
That's going to be very exciting for me as its progenitor.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.940
I think that that web domain is just going to sort of skyrocket.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.180
You can also follow us on Twitter at mbnbam.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.780
At the zone cast is our adventure zone.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.460
Twitter at Travis McElroy, at Griffin McElroy, at Justin McElroy.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.020
Subscribe to our videos on YouTube.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.820
We put up along with like easily shareable,

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.940
just little two to five minute video clips.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.340
We also put up some really, really great animated shorts by Tyler Crowley

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.460
that are just amazing.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.980
And then you can also rate and review us on iTunes.

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.020
It helps bump us up the iTunes charts and kind of gets us

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:28.180
just a little bit more attention from people who only listen to the top 10.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.300
You know who you are.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.340
If you get a second, it would be huge if you could just this one last favor.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.860
I know that we've been gone for a while,

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:39.700
but please go to podcastawards.com and vote for us in the comedy category,

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.620
Sawbones in the health category, Bunker Buddies in the education category,

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.620
and the adventure zone in the gaming category.

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:51.540
And then vote for, God, you could put in tons of other great shows.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.420
Throwing Shade for GLBT, it should win.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.620
Like, don't be silly.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.340
Pop Rocket or Bullseye for culture and arts.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.780
There's lots of places they could fit.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.820
You could throw in Flophouse for entertainment.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.460
Yeah, there's a really important one.
