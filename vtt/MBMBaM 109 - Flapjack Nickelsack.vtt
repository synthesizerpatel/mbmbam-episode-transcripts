00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.480
Hello, and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.240
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.240 --> 00:58.720
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. It's dad's day, obviously, and I thought we could

00:58.720 --> 01:08.240
start off by remembering some of our dad's best zingers. I'll start to give you guys

01:08.240 --> 01:17.760
time to think about it. We were in a parking lot, and someone, this guy was walking across

01:17.760 --> 01:25.120
the parking lot and blocking my dad's progress to our dad's progress to a parking space,

01:25.120 --> 01:32.720
and this gentleman was walking slowly in front of dad and not in any way expediting his travel.

01:32.720 --> 01:40.800
And he yelled at the guy in the car with the windows rolled up because we're Baptists,

01:40.800 --> 01:46.640
he yelled at the guy, hey, this hat-wearing geek-a-boy needs to get out of the way.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.400
And the gentleman was not wearing a hat, so I don't know why.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.760
She had to be wearing a hat.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.880
I'm not sure why hat-wearing geek-a-boy was the fucking zinger that dad decided

01:58.880 --> 02:04.960
to apply to this gentleman. Maybe he had a hat. Time has etched away so much of this memory.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.560
It's hard to say.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.640
But I think my favorite is the time that we were all sitting in the back seat,

02:10.640 --> 02:15.680
and we were having a spat, as young brothers are like to do, smacking one another and

02:16.640 --> 02:21.440
hitting each other. And dad turns around from the driver's seat and says,

02:21.440 --> 02:26.240
you guys stop fiddly farting around back there. And all three of us stopped.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.520
And we're like, excuse me?

02:27.520 --> 02:33.360
That story gives some, that story applies to our dad as a sort of Flandersian charm.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.320
My favorite is the time that he was up in the attic arranging his comic book collection,

02:40.960 --> 02:44.960
and he took the screen out of the window because it was so hot,

02:44.960 --> 02:49.040
and then he bent down to pick up a box of comics and cut his butt wide open

02:49.040 --> 02:54.160
on the edge of the screen. And then we didn't have any bandages big enough to go on his new,

02:54.160 --> 02:59.360
his butt gash. And so he, he duct taped a maxi pad to his butt.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.640
Oh, do we want to go through just the list of times dad's injured himself?

03:04.640 --> 03:08.000
Cause there was a time he dumped bleach and kitty litter down the sink without

03:08.000 --> 03:12.560
seeing a problem with it and passed out in the basement for several hours.

03:12.560 --> 03:19.200
His fellow DJ, when explaining why he was not on the show the next morning said,

03:19.200 --> 03:23.040
announced to Huntington, West Virginia that our dad was free basing kitty litter.

03:25.760 --> 03:32.880
Probably the saddest injury that he got was he was, if I had seen, okay,

03:33.440 --> 03:41.600
he was bringing a tray of cold cuts to a little league game and a van drove past him

03:41.600 --> 03:47.360
and the rear view mirror, like the side view mirror was so close that it blasted him in the

03:47.360 --> 03:54.160
chest sending cold cuts flying. If I had seen this happen, I would fucking still be laughing

03:54.160 --> 03:56.720
about it. No question. Like a scene from The Godfather just

03:56.720 --> 04:04.480
Bastromi and Rose B floating through the air. Cup of cold, everywhere. I would, oh man,

04:04.480 --> 04:10.000
I would give anything. A slow opera music played and you just saw like the tray flipping over and

04:10.000 --> 04:17.040
over in the air. And I remember we were all in the car to the ER, and he was not that badly hurt,

04:17.040 --> 04:23.440
so you can laugh at home. It's fine. We were all in the car to the ER and a lady that worked with

04:23.440 --> 04:29.040
dad was praying over him and just, oh Lord, we just ask that you watch over brother Clint

04:29.040 --> 04:33.280
and just help to protect him as we take him into the hands of the doctors. And I know

04:33.280 --> 04:37.200
you are going to work through those doctor's hands. And in my head I'm thinking,

04:37.200 --> 04:41.200
that was carrying cold cuts. He got blasted by a side view mirror. Let's not bother God

04:41.200 --> 04:46.560
about this one. That's so false. That got hit by a car that was like driving at him.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.400
Let's not bother God with this one. I think this one's pretty squarely on my dad's shoulders.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.720
He just couldn't ditch the cold cuts. He didn't want to sacrifice the cold cuts for his own

04:58.720 --> 05:00.560
safety. He's a martyr really. Yeah.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.320
Right. What a big dumb animal.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.120
Hey, love you dad. Love you daddy.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.560
You big stupid Yeti.

05:08.560 --> 05:14.160
That's me. And like, you know what's weird is I'll watch a, we have a bunch of home movies

05:14.160 --> 05:18.560
from those days. There was a weird window for those of you who are too young to remember it.

05:18.560 --> 05:26.400
There was a weird window when tapes, VHS recorders that you could put on your shoulder came into

05:26.400 --> 05:32.560
Vogue. And the idea of being able to record events was so novel that you would just record everything.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.520
Like everything.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.520
Like everything. And it's great.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.400
And look, they're sitting outside. I better film it.

05:38.400 --> 05:44.640
Yeah, right. So we have DVDs full of this stuff. And I realized that the DVDs we have

05:44.640 --> 05:54.480
start when I was five years old, meaning that dad would have been, dad was 25 when I was married.

05:54.480 --> 05:59.680
So he would have been 31 in these videos. And that's how old I am. I have, we have reached

05:59.680 --> 06:04.320
the singularity. Like all, I have full documentation of how it's going to go.

06:04.320 --> 06:08.080
From here on out, you can chart your progress.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.160
Exactly. Like I know exactly where I'm headed.

06:11.440 --> 06:16.640
Anyway, thank you for indulging us as we reminisce about our papa. I'm sure you have

06:16.640 --> 06:24.240
a story that you can share aloud as you talk over us, but we're going to move on to some advice.

06:24.240 --> 06:31.840
A first question. I've been told recently that I will be getting my braces taken off on the 20th

06:31.840 --> 06:40.320
of June. The solstice. I remember that Griffin said that's the best day to get them off.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.560
I read that in poor Richard's Almanac.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.240
Oh, because you get 12 hours of sunshine on your teeth and 12 hours of darkness.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.880
Exactly. You can stand an egg on your teeth.

06:48.880 --> 06:54.480
Is exactly. I remember that Griffin said he had braces. My question to you is this,

06:54.480 --> 07:00.640
will it be painful on a scale of one to 10, one being a tickled 10 being forced to listen to

07:00.640 --> 07:06.880
Justin Bieber? How painful is it? That's soon to be not brace face in Ireland.

07:06.880 --> 07:12.320
There's a lot of unfair misconceptions in this question. I think the first being that Justin

07:12.320 --> 07:15.440
Bieber get over it guys.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.760
Yeah. Come on people. It's not his fault.

07:17.760 --> 07:23.680
Just kidding. No, I mean, he, he writes solid music. You're, you're coming at this all wrong

07:23.680 --> 07:29.360
because you're asking this apparatus that has been like dragging my teeth around my mouth

07:29.360 --> 07:34.640
for however many years that sucks so bad. I'm getting it removed from my face so it

07:34.640 --> 07:38.320
can't do that to me anymore. Is that going to hurt? No, it's the opposite of that.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.200
It's it's been, it's been hurting you for so, so long and you don't even realize it.

07:43.200 --> 07:48.000
Well, you probably like the dental equivalent of that scene in Forrest Gump where he runs so hard

07:48.000 --> 07:54.320
that the braces fly off his legs. That's pretty much it. You just start chewing and she's like,

07:54.320 --> 08:01.600
chew for his chew. Yeah. No, they just make you smile like really hard. They make you pop off.

08:02.480 --> 08:08.640
Um, no. Wow. Medical science sure has come a long way. It's unpleasant. I'm glad this is all true.

08:08.640 --> 08:14.240
It's unpleasant in the way that like when people apply force to your teeth. Oh God. Is there anything

08:14.240 --> 08:18.800
worse than that? I don't care if you're like, I don't care what they're doing in there. I just

08:18.800 --> 08:23.440
don't want anybody to apply any amount of force to my teeth. I don't even like chewing hard foods

08:23.440 --> 08:29.040
for this very reason. Um, but, but no, it doesn't, it doesn't hurt. It's pretty much the best thing

08:29.040 --> 08:34.560
ever. There's a market, a market difference in my life. The day I got my first thing you ate

08:34.560 --> 08:39.280
when you got your braces. Oh yeah. What was the first thing you ate? Um, well, I mean, they were

08:39.280 --> 08:45.760
a little delicate. So, so probably some sort of porridge. Um, okay. What was the first contraband

08:45.760 --> 08:52.640
food? Do you fucking really think that I was the kind of kid who like would stay with, would shy

08:52.640 --> 08:59.680
from Doritos? No way. No way. That does explain a lot about how your teeth ended up. I would rock.

08:59.680 --> 09:04.880
Oh, you fuck off. I here's the, here's the lie that you're not going to be ready for.

09:04.880 --> 09:11.840
Ms. Mr. Mrs. soon to be braced face in Ireland. Um, when you get your braces off, your teeth are

09:11.840 --> 09:16.720
going to fucking move. They're going to move again. I wore my retainers. No joke. Every day

09:16.720 --> 09:22.480
for six months and every night for two years. My shit's all jacked up. My grill is all jacked up

09:22.480 --> 09:28.080
again. Nothing you can do about it. Um, I like your grill though. Yeah. Yeah. It's got a,

09:28.080 --> 09:32.800
it's got like a Kirsten Dunst charm. And I think that that's important. Your teeth are like the

09:32.800 --> 09:38.240
inglorious bastard. It splits the, no, it splits the uprights between Dunst and Buscemi. And I

09:38.240 --> 09:44.400
think that's important. Um, but, but I've got large gaps in my teeth, but mom and dad, I don't know.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.720
The times must've been tight. It must've been tighter. Oh no. You know that. No, at that point,

09:48.720 --> 09:52.880
no, David, David Letterman was really popular and they were just hoping that you could cash in on

09:52.880 --> 10:00.400
that. No. You know who's big right now? Warren Bacall. Justin's going to catch that fever. Um,

10:00.400 --> 10:04.880
we don't want to argue about whose grill was more jacked. Um, and during our childhood,

10:04.880 --> 10:10.400
because Oh fuck it was mine. Look like a fence built by a drunk person for a plate of biscuits,

10:10.400 --> 10:16.800
for a plate of biscuits. It's, it was, it was rough stuff in there. My mouth looked like the fucking

10:16.800 --> 10:23.120
Sarlacc pit. Um, I always had really great teeth and then one day my gum started spontaneously

10:23.120 --> 10:27.520
bleeding. So I don't know who wins and who loses. Cause you gotta brush them you silly goose.

10:28.480 --> 10:33.840
You gotta brush up there. Um, but it's, it, I mean it may suck, but holy shit, it's going to be the

10:33.840 --> 10:41.280
best day of your entire life. Um, so yeah, enjoy. I'm happy for you. Everyone get braces. How come

10:41.280 --> 10:47.200
adults don't get braces anymore? Um, I don't know. I always, when I see an adult with braces,

10:47.200 --> 10:52.000
I always imagine someone trying to recapture their youth, which there are many better ways.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.920
You know who looked good? Bill Macy and Magnolia. Oh man. Didn't he look great with those,

10:57.920 --> 11:04.320
that shining, shining plate mail up on his mouth? Did that look great up there? Didn't see Magnolia.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.040
What about, I'm sure. So Travis, did you see it? I don't know which one that is. You

11:11.040 --> 11:18.240
uncultured Fox. Sorry, Griffin. Hey, how about you? How about you class this joint up a bit though?

11:18.240 --> 11:23.520
Oh, with a Yahoo answer? What's the classiest of Yahoo answers? Whatever the classiest one you got

11:23.520 --> 11:30.960
is. Um, how about this one? It was sent in by Nick Claus or Klaus. Nick, Nick Claus. Thank you,

11:30.960 --> 11:42.000
Nick. It's by Yahoo answers user Yahoo mystery who asks guitar or bow and arrows. I have $100.

11:43.840 --> 11:48.960
I'm a 14 year old male. I've been wanting a guitar for a couple of years and I've wanted a bow

11:48.960 --> 11:55.440
ever since I saw teen Wolf last summer. I got interested in the guitar from YouTube videos.

11:55.440 --> 11:59.040
And because I got interested in music a couple of years ago when I was in fifth grade, I'm pretty

11:59.040 --> 12:04.080
sure I just want to know which one I should get. I don't have anything to do in the summer. I have

12:04.080 --> 12:11.520
some reading I can do, but I don't know if I'm in the class yet. Thanks. Okay. So happy. This is

12:11.520 --> 12:18.320
like reading a, uh, uh, this is like, this is like watching that, um, the summer version of Christmas

12:18.320 --> 12:25.280
story. You know that reading a nostalgic Jean Shepherd novel, uh, in one Yahoo answer. I love

12:25.280 --> 12:30.400
it because it's kind of like a rest of the story kind of set up. Like you can see the two paths

12:30.400 --> 12:36.160
diverge in one. He gets the guitar and becomes like the next Jimi Hendrix and the other, he gets

12:36.160 --> 12:41.280
a bow and arrow and shoots his little brother in the face. I thought you were going to say he

12:41.280 --> 12:46.000
becomes the Jimi Hendrix of archery because we didn't know any archers. He's doing a wicked

12:46.560 --> 12:53.440
bow and arrow solo. So riddle me this real quick teen Wolf. The film doesn't have a bow and arrow.

12:53.440 --> 12:59.360
No, it has to be like the TV show teen Wolf, which I, to this day, I'm unsure if it's a spin-off of

12:59.360 --> 13:04.720
the movie or not, but I don't believe it. Yeah. There's like a 50 year old styles who

13:05.440 --> 13:13.520
the comic book shop and sells people bows and arrows. It's cannon. Is this just somebody who

13:13.520 --> 13:20.560
saw hunger games and it's like, God, I get down on that. That's a good look. That's practical.

13:20.560 --> 13:25.840
Cool. Right. You got to know, have some sort of skill by the time when Quetzalcoatl comes.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.080
This is someone who saw the hit film weather man with Nicolas Cage. And he's like, yeah,

13:30.080 --> 13:36.560
bow and arrow. I could do that. Go home. Go, go away. What? You don't like that film?

13:37.680 --> 13:42.720
It's, I mean, it's not Jermaine. It's from like 1981. That movie was released. It's basically

13:42.720 --> 13:47.520
like the same as hunger games. Like hunger games and weather man are based on the same level.

13:47.520 --> 13:53.760
And how other man's a cool movie. Yeah. Way cooler than hunger games. Welcome to our movie

13:53.760 --> 13:58.240
review castle where you compare two utterly disparate movies and make one be the best.

13:58.880 --> 14:06.640
I have this question may as an elderly gentleman. This question makes me so nostalgic for a time

14:06.640 --> 14:14.320
when I have $100. I can buy one of two things. Those two things are a guitar or a bow and arrow.

14:14.320 --> 14:21.040
Like that's the only time money was cool. Now money is symbolic. Like I see money and it's like,

14:21.600 --> 14:26.960
thank you for the gas in my house. Like, thank you for the lights are on. This kid's like,

14:26.960 --> 14:32.320
I have a hundred dollar bill. I'm going to buy a fucking guitar or maybe a weapon.

14:32.320 --> 14:39.600
I, uh, I still get this way. I still, I came into $500 recently that I was not expecting to get.

14:39.600 --> 14:46.400
And it was almost like the hunt was fucking on. It was like, what can I put this on? What can I

14:46.400 --> 14:50.800
make mine with this money? It's not real money because it's not, you know, it's not.

14:51.360 --> 14:56.080
Yeah. Like I recently got paid and I was like, yeah, I'm going to get my brakes fixed. So I

14:56.080 --> 15:03.120
don't die. No, no, no, no, no. I payment, payment and compensation for work. That's that is money.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.680
That's money that you have that you need. I sold a computer that I didn't think I was going to sell.

15:07.680 --> 15:12.640
Yeah. And I was like, I have this money now and it's not real money. Cause it's, it's,

15:12.640 --> 15:17.040
it's surprise money. And I bought it. I should have done bought an iPad. Cause that's what I

15:17.040 --> 15:23.920
did do. No, you should have bought your computer back from the person. They're finding your power.

15:23.920 --> 15:30.000
I could have bought five bows and arrows and then my friends and I could have hawk eyed

15:30.000 --> 15:35.360
all around Austin writing wrongs and shooting people and tires.

15:35.360 --> 15:42.800
Um, I don't know. Is this what things cost now are both bows. I'm just saying go with bow and arrow

15:42.800 --> 15:49.360
for show because $100 is going to buy you a really shitty guitar. It's going to buy you a first act

15:49.360 --> 15:54.880
toy. Oh, I bet you I could buy you an okay bow though. At least like a recurve compound,

15:54.880 --> 15:58.880
like the gears and police. There's no way you're getting a compound. Yeah.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.400
Guys. Have you guys ever, let me ask you a serious question. I hate to

16:02.400 --> 16:06.960
serious this up, but have you guys ever seriously considered buying a bow and arrow?

16:06.960 --> 16:07.280
Yes. Yes.

16:08.000 --> 16:15.920
Well, okay. Arrows. Let's, let's, let's, let's go hog wild by multiple arrows.

16:15.920 --> 16:20.880
So in high school, there are many options as to what kind of gym class you could take.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.520
And I opted to take individual dual sports, which was like nerd sports.

16:25.520 --> 16:31.120
And so it was sports like ping pong. Yeah. Yeah. And one of them was archery.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.440
I was on that same track, I think. I think backgammon was part of it.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.320
It was literally like they looked at the rest of my schedule and said,

16:38.320 --> 16:41.600
taking a lot of theater classes, huh? Have we got the gym class for you?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.040
How do you feel about tumbling?

16:45.840 --> 16:48.080
If we have a spinning class, you'd be doing that.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.720
What about crocanol? Are you down?

16:51.920 --> 16:56.800
So we did archery for like two days and that shit is dope. It's awesome.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.280
Well, it's not, when you're using a translatable skill,

17:01.280 --> 17:04.800
when you're using what is tantamount to a first act, a bow and arrow,

17:05.360 --> 17:10.160
it's pretty awesome. But if you ever try to shoot a real bow and arrow,

17:10.160 --> 17:14.480
unless you possess tremendous amounts of upper body strength,

17:14.480 --> 17:19.040
you shake like you are experiencing an earthquake that only you can feel.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.640
And it's humiliating.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.360
I want to point out that we were going to school in West Virginia.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.840
A kid brought in his compound bow.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.920
Well, a compound bow has has tools built into it to help you pull it back.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.840
But if you ever try to fire like a real ass,

17:32.400 --> 17:34.880
you're talking like a long bow, like a gentleman's old ass archer.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.480
Like a gentleman's bow.

17:36.480 --> 17:42.320
For, yeah, right. A manly, like something for killing.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.000
Yeah, like an adult bow and an adult caveman bow.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.280
Hey, one of my friends insists on going swimming every time.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.440
What is the demo of our fucking show?

17:55.440 --> 17:58.240
We talk about fucking girls with Garfield heads.

17:58.240 --> 18:03.200
Where are these teens who are like, listen, my favorite flavor of pixie stick got canceled.

18:05.680 --> 18:10.400
Guys, I got cheeto dust all over my hands and there's a big line to hop in the pool.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.120
What should I do?

18:12.320 --> 18:13.760
I'm just glad everybody's out there having a killer fun.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.960
Just read through this question. It takes an interesting turn.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.800
OK, one of my friends insists on going swimming every time he comes to visit.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.880
He always brings his trunks and shows up with the expectation of going swimming,

18:24.880 --> 18:28.480
which wouldn't be annoying, except that the pool belongs to my neighbors.

18:28.480 --> 18:32.080
I very much enjoy swimming and my neighbors are good people,

18:32.080 --> 18:35.120
but that doesn't mean I'm free to swim there whenever I want.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.040
For whatever reason, my friend fails to understand that this is not my pool

18:39.040 --> 18:41.280
and I do not want to abuse my neighbor's kindness.

18:41.280 --> 18:45.360
How can I remedy this situation without coming off as a jerk?

18:45.920 --> 18:47.760
That's from drowning in Des Moines.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.040
It's easy. Tell your friend to stop being a moron.

18:51.040 --> 18:51.920
It's not your pool.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.600
And say, hey, hey, it's not my pool.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.920
No, that's too easy.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.040
No, yeah.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.240
We should have something harder.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.160
That pool? It's infested.

19:02.160 --> 19:02.640
I mean, you just...

19:02.640 --> 19:07.760
It's us, so we should have a more complex solution with a higher probability of arrest.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.080
You gotta come up with a system for warning your neighbors.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.200
Like, hey, Bryce, Bryce is a coming. You know what that means.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.120
Time to cover the pool.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.520
Just leave the gate open. We'll see you at eight.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.020
Eight.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.880
Have some burgers ready.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.440
We're gonna be hungry.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.400
Get some burgers ready.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.000
My tie's at nine.

19:26.000 --> 19:26.480
Let's roll.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.640
You and your wife can totally join us.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.120
Wet teacher contest at 10 PM.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.400
Will you and Mrs. Robinson be there?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.000
I sure hope so.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.440
I'm sorry, what was her last name?

19:40.560 --> 19:42.000
Well, can you repeat that?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.560
Let me take the wall down for you.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.120
I was gonna say Mrs. Robinson,

19:47.120 --> 19:51.040
and then I realized that that has some context outside of my goof

19:51.040 --> 19:52.880
that may not make the goof pan out,

19:52.880 --> 19:56.640
because then it would be like, oh, she's sexy and she's down with younger men.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.920
That's not what I was going for.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.840
So instead you went with a Klingon word.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.360
I went with Romakhov.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.120
We are engaging in the battle of Romakhov.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.760
Your friend is a fucking idiot.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.320
How does he not get...

20:10.320 --> 20:12.000
How does he not get, like...

20:12.880 --> 20:14.960
Oh man, this makes me so angry.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.880
This makes me angry, like how we had a basketball court in our backyard

20:18.880 --> 20:21.840
and our neighbors would just be like, what's up, hoop dreams?

20:21.840 --> 20:24.160
And I'm like, hey, if you don't mind,

20:25.360 --> 20:29.280
if you don't mind, it's midnight and I'm watching a movie in here

20:29.280 --> 20:30.880
trying to get my swerve on maybe.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.720
If you could like cut the hoop dreams for a second.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.640
Make them like hoop daydreams.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.520
If you're gonna have hoop when I'm at school dreams, that would be good.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.160
That's fine.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.320
That's fine.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.880
And just to make sure we're all on the same page,

20:46.880 --> 20:50.000
we picture this friend rolling up ringing the doorbell when you open the door.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.840
He's got a towel slung over his shoulder.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.800
He's in trunks.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.000
Water wings.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.320
Okay.

20:54.320 --> 20:54.640
Yeah.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.120
He's got...

20:55.120 --> 20:55.680
I got those...

20:57.200 --> 21:00.080
What are those things that make your feet like a fish?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.480
Flippers?

21:02.480 --> 21:03.280
Thank you.

21:03.280 --> 21:03.840
What the fuck?

21:03.840 --> 21:05.040
Yeah, I think flippers.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.120
Is that what it is?

21:07.120 --> 21:08.400
Did you have a piece?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.560
He's just wearing a full on mermaid tail.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.840
Let's do this.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.800
I know flippers are what you put in to make your toddler's teeth not look so wack.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.200
So I didn't know if that was the same thing.

21:19.200 --> 21:19.760
Same word.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.680
I think here's the solution.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.520
You need to cut yourself out as the middleman.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.040
You need to go next door, introduce your friend to the neighbors and be like,

21:31.040 --> 21:32.000
it's up to you now.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.040
Like this is all on you.

21:33.680 --> 21:34.560
Now you guys are friends.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.080
I ain't got no dog in this race.

21:36.080 --> 21:36.400
This is...

21:36.400 --> 21:38.080
Bryce is gonna be staying with you for the weekend.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.200
This is Bryce.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.640
He loves tacos.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.680
Take good care of him.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.120
And also swimming.

21:43.120 --> 21:43.920
He's my old buddy.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.040
What was that?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.320
That's me blowing my nose.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.280
Don't address it.

21:49.280 --> 21:49.600
Fuck.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.360
It sounded like a ghost going through a tunnel.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.000
I know, that was horrifying.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.920
It was terrifying.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.200
I thought that for a second our podcast would become possessed.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.760
It sounded like when the Grim Reaper slips past your ear.

22:03.760 --> 22:04.640
Like he just barely went dying.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.080
Oh no, someone has literally walked over my grave and then dug it up

22:08.080 --> 22:09.920
and started punching my corpse.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.920
And blowing in my ear, gross.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.120
Stop it, I'm getting a boner.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.360
How does he not know?

22:17.360 --> 22:21.440
Like one house is your house and there is not a pool behind it.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.640
I'm gonna go out on a limb.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.120
Maybe that's how he's getting to the pool.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.520
I'm gonna guess that you feel that you've clearly expressed to your friend

22:31.520 --> 22:34.320
that it is not okay and it's not a good deal,

22:34.320 --> 22:38.240
but I'm betting that you've maybe been a little too subtle

22:38.240 --> 22:40.400
and said something along the lines of like,

22:40.400 --> 22:43.840
I don't know, they're busy or how about you need to say like,

22:43.840 --> 22:45.040
listen, dude, it's not cool.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.040
I don't feel comfortable going over there.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.080
It's not my pool.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.280
We did it that one time and it was awesome because they invited us over.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.760
We don't have free reign over it.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.600
You can always just throw it on them.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.520
Just say like they said we couldn't go anymore.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.760
It's a tough break, huh?

22:59.760 --> 23:01.440
Well, win some, you lose some.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.560
Let's play Atari.

23:02.560 --> 23:06.160
Mr. Raghman Shah died in that pool.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.280
And now he's got a pool.

23:09.280 --> 23:12.160
Listen, Mr. Rachmaninoff does not appreciate us

23:12.160 --> 23:14.320
swimming in his pool and listening to his classical music.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.560
Listen, there's the ghost of Mr. Raghman Shah.

23:18.560 --> 23:24.880
It's gonna haunt that pool like in that one episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?

23:24.880 --> 23:25.920
And we all know how that happened.

23:25.920 --> 23:26.880
Oh, shit.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.000
It's the scariest one too.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.200
It's the fucking scariest one.

23:29.200 --> 23:29.760
No, it's not.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.360
The girl in the mirror is the scariest one.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.560
Don't start.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.680
A dead body.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.920
Can you find a dead body or maybe even like roadkill and just throw it in the pool?

23:37.920 --> 23:39.840
Because that was going to solve your problems.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.760
Or just put a big sign outside that says haunted.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.440
I can visualize that.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.240
Oh, shit.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.400
Haunted pool.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.000
Don't swim at your own risk.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.080
And then there's a picture of Patrick Swayze.

23:56.080 --> 24:03.760
Are you saying Patrick Swayze is in the movie Ghost or because Patrick Swayze is dead?

24:03.760 --> 24:04.880
Yeah, let's clarify.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.720
No, Patrick Swayze from the movie Ghost.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.360
Not just...

24:07.360 --> 24:11.680
By the way, they started a Ghost musical on Broadway and I think it's kind of fucked up

24:11.680 --> 24:12.960
they didn't get Patrick Swayze.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.120
I mean, he's right there.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.280
All around you.

24:17.280 --> 24:17.920
Just.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.160
Like...

24:18.800 --> 24:19.840
Are you saying that...

24:19.840 --> 24:20.080
Okay.

24:20.640 --> 24:25.280
Are you saying that Patrick Swayze, now that he's dead, he occupies all the space?

24:25.280 --> 24:26.400
All of Broadway?

24:26.400 --> 24:28.560
No, I'm saying he's a ghost now.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.760
So, like, he's even better.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.160
Oh, so they could have cut back on the special effects.

24:32.160 --> 24:32.720
Exactly.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.480
He could just manifest himself.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.200
He's an even better fit for the role than he was before.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.920
If such a thing is even possible.

24:39.920 --> 24:40.800
He nailed it.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.440
He nailed it.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.200
I miss him.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.200
I feel bad about this goof.

24:45.200 --> 24:50.640
When he was dying, do you think he was like, don't worry guys, I got this?

24:50.640 --> 24:57.600
It was just like, super cool.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.360
Like, way over the top.

25:01.360 --> 25:01.920
This is not...

25:01.920 --> 25:03.280
I've been preparing for this my whole life.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.120
This is not my first time at the rodeo.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.120
So, don't shed a tear.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.920
I'll see you later at pottery class.

25:12.800 --> 25:19.840
Like, don't even trip because I know my friend Vincent Chevelle is gonna come and teach me

25:19.840 --> 25:20.880
all the tricks that I...

25:20.880 --> 25:23.600
They may be different tricks, but he had my back before.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.280
I have no reason to think that he won't again have my back.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.480
You know who has really freaked out while all that was going on?

25:30.480 --> 25:30.880
Who's that?

25:30.880 --> 25:32.240
Whoopi Goldberg.

25:32.240 --> 25:32.480
Yeah.

25:34.480 --> 25:35.680
But for different reasons.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.400
She's got a lot of her own shit going on.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.160
Yeah, Whoopi's got a lot on her plate.

25:40.160 --> 25:40.560
I don't know.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.920
She's got the view and...

25:44.720 --> 25:46.320
She's got her talk show, doesn't she?

25:46.320 --> 25:49.600
Doesn't she have a drive time Whoopi in the morning?

25:49.600 --> 25:51.120
Isn't that a thing that she has?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.960
Let's make Whoopi a radio show in the morning.

25:54.960 --> 25:55.600
Make it Whoopi.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.960
No, actually making Whoopi is a sci-fi channel show about cloning Whoopi Goldberg.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.680
And that I wish we could...

26:04.240 --> 26:09.280
Man, my dream woman is color purple arrow Whoopi Goldberg times six.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.080
Times six.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.520
We're at science three.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.440
What are we doing?

26:13.440 --> 26:19.520
I wonder if the six Whoopi Goldberg was really stupid like Doug in Multiplicity.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.560
I like in Multiplicity.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.160
Remember like five minutes before we started recording, we're like,

26:26.160 --> 26:29.760
all right, guys, we're going to make this show, this particular episode,

26:29.760 --> 26:37.040
a lot more welcoming to newcomers by not talking about weird dumb shit for 10 minutes at a time.

26:37.040 --> 26:37.840
Okay, you're right.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.880
Let's rein it in.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.680
Let's be a little more practical.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.240
Okay.

26:42.240 --> 26:47.040
I've recently started my first job out of university or college, if you prefer.

26:47.040 --> 26:47.600
And I do.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.960
And I'm finding it difficult to stay awake during meetings.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.840
In any meeting that goes on for more than a half hour,

26:53.840 --> 26:58.240
I find it difficult to focus and often start to nod off unless I'm constantly involved.

26:59.040 --> 27:03.440
Do you have any advice for me before someone notices and I get fired?

27:03.440 --> 27:07.360
As I have at least one meeting a day and they often contain important information for my work,

27:07.360 --> 27:08.880
this is becoming a real problem.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.040
That's from Lethargic in London.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.960
And I have a solution.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.840
Oh, no.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.800
I think it's a home run.

27:15.360 --> 27:15.840
Oh, God.

27:16.640 --> 27:19.200
Keep in your office or cubicle or whatever.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.320
This is going to be stupid.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.880
No, a pair of really uncomfortable shoes.

27:23.920 --> 27:28.000
And before the meeting, change into these shoes that are either too tight

27:28.000 --> 27:31.200
or they're just uncomfortable in some way.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.600
And they will stop you from falling asleep during the meeting.

27:35.360 --> 27:35.760
I can't.

27:35.760 --> 27:42.480
That's not- is it- is it almost a- I don't know if it's like a bad idea.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.000
No, it's brilliant, you guys.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.520
I think it's an okay idea.

27:45.520 --> 27:49.280
I would suggest, first off, try that.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.840
I guess it's not as plausible as anything.

27:52.640 --> 27:53.920
Are you getting enough sleep?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.720
Are you getting like your seven to eight hours?

27:56.720 --> 27:58.240
Because that's really key.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.640
Also, I see lots of ads for five hour energy drinks.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.760
People replacing their coffee with them, which grosses me out, but-

28:06.480 --> 28:08.240
And you should get the five hour energy drink

28:08.240 --> 28:11.520
because it keeps you awake for five hours because your stomach wants to die.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.440
Yeah, it'll make you nauseous.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.040
Are you not a five hour energy drink fan?

28:17.920 --> 28:21.040
No, I had one at Max Fun Con and it made me want to kill myself.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.360
That's- you're probably- you're probably-

28:23.360 --> 28:26.960
Well, I also have like the constitution of like a two year old, so.

28:26.960 --> 28:27.280
Yeah.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.120
Yeah, you got that- all those tummy issues.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.680
Can I- can I put forth one possible solution?

28:34.480 --> 28:35.040
What's that?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.200
Just fucking go to sleep during the meeting.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.200
Just slip on some shades and kick back.

28:41.200 --> 28:45.360
If they can't- if they can't fucking turn their PowerPoint presentations

28:45.360 --> 28:49.120
and do a rock you like a hurricane roller coaster,

28:49.760 --> 28:51.600
then that's their fucking problem.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.560
Like if they're putting you to sleep, then they need to know about it.

28:55.520 --> 28:55.760
Right.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.240
You know, a while back, do you remember we got that question where somebody was like,

28:58.240 --> 29:01.920
how do I like gain an affect- an affectation at work?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.320
Maybe you're the sleepy guy.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.560
Oh, that's just sleepy Jim.

29:07.760 --> 29:08.560
That's what he does.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.400
People always say that, like this presentation we're doing is boring.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.400
I'm worried we're going to put people to sleep.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.960
Like you are creating actual metric.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.440
Like-

29:17.440 --> 29:19.280
You're the canary in the coal mine.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.960
Exactly, in the boring coal mine.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.320
I'm- I'm asleep.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.040
Spice it up.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.200
Maybe that'll make people work harder.

29:25.200 --> 29:25.680
Like they want to-

29:25.680 --> 29:27.040
Maybe they start yelling that out.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.560
Like this is boring.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.360
Spice it up.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.240
I'm going to sleep over here.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.560
Do lights and- do lights and smoke and shit.

29:35.120 --> 29:35.680
That's it.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.160
No.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.680
Tell a funny story about me.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.560
You don't need to tell them to do that to their presentations.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.920
You can do that for them.

29:41.920 --> 29:46.640
You can be the guy who like shows up to each presentation with a fucking boombox

29:46.640 --> 29:52.480
and just start blasting Crazy Train as they're talking about, you know, their- their gross earnings.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.040
Is that it?

29:53.040 --> 29:54.960
And then start spinning some glow sticks around.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.840
The- the other thing you might try that's a little easier,

29:57.840 --> 30:00.000
that goes in line with Travis's shoe advice.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.840
Maybe try like taking notes the whole time.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.920
Like engaging yourself that way.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.920
Just because wouldn't- that way you're not passive.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.440
And you- and you're- you're engaged even if it's not like you're not adding to it.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.880
The other- the other option is you say you stay awake when you add to it.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.960
Maybe just start adding to it a lot more.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.080
I agree.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.720
Maybe just dip in every 20 seconds or so.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.240
Yeah, this is a great point.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.520
That's what I was gonna say.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.800
I was gonna say that earlier.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.120
You could-

30:27.120 --> 30:28.000
I agree with you.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.480
You can be like-

30:28.480 --> 30:29.200
Well said.

30:29.200 --> 30:34.640
Like a founding father in the- the first- the first congressional congress.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.160
Is that what- is that what it was called when they-

30:36.160 --> 30:37.360
Yeah, Continental Congress.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.800
First Continental Congress where they-

30:40.800 --> 30:43.520
No, I think it was the first congressional congress.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.560
It was the first- the first congress of congressional-

30:44.560 --> 30:46.400
The first senatorial senate.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.400
And just like have a-

30:48.400 --> 30:50.320
And the second presidential president.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.480
Of gubernatorial goobers meeting.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.320
You gotta have like a cane that you can like bang on the table when somebody says something.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.880
And yell like, here, here.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.200
Just like, someone open up a window.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.280
Harump, harump, harump.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.960
Sit down, Dan.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.160
Sit down, Dan.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.240
I'm trying to do my PowerPoint.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.720
Oh man, I hope-

31:12.720 --> 31:14.080
And also Ben Franklin is there.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.880
Yeah, also be- just be- just be Ben Franklin.

31:19.280 --> 31:19.440
No.

31:19.440 --> 31:23.120
No, there's nothing actionable in that thing I just said.

31:23.120 --> 31:23.360
No.

31:23.920 --> 31:27.920
I just kind of wanted a picture of Ben Franklin in a room going, play Crazy Train.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.560
Yeah.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.040
Do it.

31:30.640 --> 31:35.360
The problem is that we really can't address questions this boring anymore.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.040
You're making us bored with your boring shit.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.400
There's a reason none of us work in offices, and it's this very reason.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.440
Yeah, right.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.360
30 seconds or less, I'd be asleep.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.960
Here's the solution I went with.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.680
Don't go back.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.180
Yeah.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.320
Stop going to work.

31:50.320 --> 31:50.880
Stop going.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.000
You know what?

31:52.000 --> 31:52.880
Live like you're dying.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.240
Just fucking go to sleep.

31:54.800 --> 31:55.440
So what?

31:55.440 --> 31:56.720
Office space, this is hell.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.600
Don't even hide it.

31:57.600 --> 32:03.760
Pull a pillow out of your briefcase, fluff it, put it on the table, spin around three times,

32:03.760 --> 32:05.360
and go take a snooze.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.840
I wonder if there's a whole generation of people who saw office space and just said,

32:09.840 --> 32:10.720
eh, fuck it.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.480
And that's why we have such a high unemployment rate.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.920
Hmm, but then there's also a generation of people who watch the office and it's like,

32:17.920 --> 32:19.200
but these people are my best friends.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.320
I'm going to find true love here.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.400
This is going to be so zany.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.000
You're not though, and it's not.

32:26.000 --> 32:26.800
It's going to be boring.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.120
It's not.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.960
You're just going to fucking sleep all the time.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.200
God, work is awful.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.360
Go work on the internet.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.640
I sleep at home all the time.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.280
Nobody knows.

32:35.280 --> 32:44.160
You know, you know, if you want to work on the internet, then you got to make money in the money zone.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.480
What the fuck are you doing?

32:56.480 --> 32:57.360
Was that good?

32:57.360 --> 33:00.240
I just, I saw, I saw an opening and I took it.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.760
The fuck do you think you're doing?

33:01.760 --> 33:03.680
I'm angling for your job, McRoy.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.680
Hey guys, here's some sad libs for you.

33:05.680 --> 33:06.720
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.600
No Griffin, no.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.280
Fart giraffes.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.160
Wait, fart giraffes.

33:12.160 --> 33:12.640
I like this.

33:12.640 --> 33:13.840
I like this vein.

33:13.840 --> 33:14.720
Let's tap into it.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.440
This message is for Russell and Laura from Nathan.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.800
Congrats to Russell and Laura on getting hitched this weekend.

33:23.520 --> 33:27.360
Russ is a rad photographer and Laura is just flat out rad.

33:27.360 --> 33:32.640
And they're both going out and getting it in 20 does like champions.

33:32.640 --> 33:37.840
They are getting, well actually they would have gotten married last weekend, I guess.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.920
So congratulations to you guys.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.000
Congratulation on your first week of rad marriage.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.440
I hope you're still together.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.840
Do you think they came down the aisle on like skateboards or like maybe he was on a razor

33:49.840 --> 33:54.160
scooter and maybe they like got up to the creature and they just like flipped him off

33:54.160 --> 33:55.040
and they're like, fuck you.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.400
We don't need your institution.

33:57.840 --> 34:01.680
And then they kissed like real deep.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.120
And gross, right?

34:03.120 --> 34:05.600
Gross, you know, and he's like, sorry, granny.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.400
And then they're like spray painted on somebody in the front row.

34:08.400 --> 34:08.960
Yeah.

34:08.960 --> 34:14.320
And and then and then they signed the marriage papers.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.080
No, that's not rad.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.760
But what if the no, but they signed it with like a big dildo shaped pen.

34:19.760 --> 34:28.480
OK, what if they they cut into their wedding pizza and she fed him a slice, hot slice of

34:28.480 --> 34:29.520
wedding pizza?

34:29.520 --> 34:34.000
Because that's and then smashed it on his face and then burned him because the oil was

34:34.000 --> 34:34.320
really.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.520
Yeah, yeah.

34:35.520 --> 34:39.040
Guys, this podcast is supported by Microsoft's being a new way to search.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.720
Use being to search the web and your own social media networks with the new social search

34:42.720 --> 34:46.720
sidebar, allowing you to ask your friends as well as the experts tried online at Bing

34:46.720 --> 34:47.520
Dotcom.

34:48.160 --> 34:50.400
Bing is for doing like experts like us.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.440
No, like actual real experts.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.480
There are real experts.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.840
Why do people keep asking us questions?

34:55.840 --> 35:00.960
We have to be experts in something by this point, don't we?

35:00.960 --> 35:04.400
Like accidentally even how to get fired.

35:04.400 --> 35:09.840
I think we we probably have more diverse and illegal methods of getting fire than anybody.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.280
How to make your dad cringe.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.680
OK, how to make your nanny cry.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.000
If that's a category of expertise, that's easy, though, like pussy.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.600
Well, now everyone's uncomfortable.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.400
Let's do Yahoo.

35:24.400 --> 35:29.600
This this one was sent in by Lisa Holofield and like four other people.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.520
I got this from a lot of sources, so it promises to be pretty good.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.800
It's by Yahoo Answers user unerring pair who asks.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.560
If I shave my golden retriever like a lion, will the other dogs respect him more?

35:44.320 --> 35:46.400
Because he's kind of the neighborhood loser.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.880
Oh, no, that's it.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.200
It went from being kind of funny to kind of.

35:53.200 --> 35:57.600
How you're superimposing a lot of hierarchy on the dogs.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.640
Yeah, first of all, lion is king of the cats.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.240
Totally different, totally different thing.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.520
Like their archenemy, basically.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.480
Yeah, that's like saying I'm going to dress him up like Mumra.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.640
So so he can hang with his buddies.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.440
The Thunder Cat's like, no, that's going to make him really sad.

36:18.000 --> 36:18.880
They're going to hate it.

36:18.880 --> 36:23.600
I'm going to dress them up like Rufio saying hang out with all Hook's Pirates.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.320
Oh, God.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.040
It's like saying.

36:25.040 --> 36:25.920
Anybody else?

36:25.920 --> 36:26.960
Yeah, yeah.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.640
What do you got, Griffin?

36:28.640 --> 36:29.520
You got something?

36:29.520 --> 36:30.160
I'm trying to think.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.120
Let me think of two.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.880
I went to I went to Nazis like instantly and there's nothing there that's going to be.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.160
Churchill?

36:36.160 --> 36:38.480
Yeah, that it's like dressing up like Churchill.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.680
And then he used to hang out with the Nazis.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.240
I would love to see a dog dressed up like Churchill.

36:44.240 --> 36:44.960
Oh, my God.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.160
Photos, please.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.080
Please somebody dress up your fat ass dog like Winston Churchill.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.200
I bet you anything.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.920
I am Googling right now.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.680
Dog dressed like be Winston.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.080
Dog dressed like be be dogs.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.520
OK, Google, Google be dogs.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.640
I'm not Googling be dog.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.040
Oh, yes.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.040
I see a dog with glasses who looks like Churchill.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.480
Everybody, I'm sorry.

37:14.480 --> 37:15.920
A picture of a bulldog.

37:15.920 --> 37:16.960
You know it's a bulldog.

37:17.760 --> 37:23.520
Everybody, if you can send make more pictures of your dog dressed like Churchill.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.680
I I do insist on historical accuracy.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.200
I'll try to put the picture I found in the form.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.920
It also looks like Kathy Bates in that new lawyer show.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.280
It's adorable.

37:39.280 --> 37:43.840
Do you mean the new adventures of old Christine?

37:45.280 --> 37:47.520
I also would like to point out that in dog,

37:47.520 --> 37:49.680
like there is a certain amount like the dominance,

37:49.680 --> 37:51.600
you know, alpha male kind of thing,

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
but it doesn't rank down.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.000
It's like I'm alpha male.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.680
So you're second and you're third.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.000
Yeah, you're the epsilon male.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.200
Get out of here, pussy.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.120
It's not really how it works.

38:03.120 --> 38:07.200
There's mostly just like with the one guy on top and then everybody else.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.560
Also, I don't think I mean a lion looks like a lion

38:10.560 --> 38:12.960
because he's got the frame to support that main.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.880
Does your frame support your main?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.640
That's the that's the real question,

38:16.640 --> 38:18.080
because this golden retriever,

38:18.080 --> 38:20.080
I think if you slap a lion on him,

38:20.080 --> 38:22.240
I think he's going to look pretty goddamn goofy.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.480
He's going to look like a shaved dog with a giant poof on his head

38:26.480 --> 38:29.520
and he's going to probably get murdered by the other.

38:29.520 --> 38:31.840
Yeah, it's going to look like he's wearing mink

38:31.840 --> 38:34.080
and it's not going to be a good look for him, respect wise.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.880
Why are you getting so hung up on your dog's appearance?

38:36.880 --> 38:41.120
I don't know if you've read T.L. Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People,

38:41.120 --> 38:45.520
but the key thing is for your dog to get interested in the other dogs.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.360
Is he sniffing their butts?

38:47.360 --> 38:48.720
Is he sniffing their butts enough?

38:48.720 --> 38:51.840
He's got to get interested in the smell of their butts.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.280
What's his hump game like?

38:53.280 --> 38:58.080
Is he is he letting himself be humped more than he's trying to hump the other dog?

38:58.080 --> 38:59.280
That's a great question, Justin.

38:59.280 --> 39:03.040
That's so key in society.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.320
Also, maybe your dog's just boring.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.160
Maybe your dog just fucking sucks.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.480
Some dog has to suck.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.800
There has to be a most boring dog in any pack.

39:12.800 --> 39:13.840
Is he wearing glasses?

39:13.840 --> 39:14.240
Asshole.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.240
Nice glasses, dipshit.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.440
Nice glasses, Churchill.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.960
Nice glasses, Churchill.

39:18.960 --> 39:19.840
Get your kettle.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.160
Why do all the other dogs always pick on Churchill?

39:24.800 --> 39:27.440
You know, we bought him really nice Randy Jackson frames.

39:29.040 --> 39:29.600
I don't know.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.160
I'm just as sweet as doggy pipe.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.600
He's got a great doggy pipe.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.880
Was that a negative comment about my glasses?

39:37.600 --> 39:38.160
No.

39:38.160 --> 39:38.800
No.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.400
I just think your glasses are super stylish.

39:42.400 --> 39:46.960
I am just constantly entertained by the fact that they were handcrafted by Randy Jackson.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.880
By the artisanal Randy Jackson.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.840
Yo, dog.

39:49.840 --> 39:56.080
I'm making you some artisanal glasses frames in my day off from working with Gloria Estefan.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.520
Working on her new CD.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.880
That's going to drop next week.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.760
And then the week after that, I'm going to drop Griffin's glasses off.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.560
And then I have to fix them because I dropped them.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.480
And then I'm going to fix them because I dropped them.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.560
Recently, the Just for Laughs festival came to Chicago.

40:11.120 --> 40:15.920
And with it brought basically all my favorite comedians from big names to lesser known

40:15.920 --> 40:17.920
slash soon to be big names.

40:17.920 --> 40:21.440
Saw them all over the place, waiting across the street, walking around Walgreens.

40:22.400 --> 40:27.040
So my question is, what is the proper etiquette for meeting comedians or celebrities?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.800
And that's from our buddy Justin Russo.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.840
Justin, before I answer your question, I was hoping you could provide me with some more

40:31.840 --> 40:33.120
things that people do in a city.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.520
Riding the bus.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.560
Reading a book.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.760
Reading a book.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.560
Sitting on benches.

40:38.560 --> 40:38.960
Eating.

40:38.960 --> 40:39.760
Getting mugged.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.480
Paying bills.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.760
I saw Bobcat Goldthwait getting mugged.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.040
Picking up prescriptions.

40:45.040 --> 40:45.920
Using a bathroom.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.000
Crying quietly on a bench.

40:51.040 --> 40:52.560
Wondering where they all went wrong.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.160
Wondering when their big break is coming.

40:54.160 --> 40:59.760
There are several schools of thought here.

41:00.560 --> 41:05.200
Let's give our, let's each give our own person.

41:05.200 --> 41:09.440
Normally we, I think we try to come to a consensus.

41:09.440 --> 41:14.240
I say on this question, we divide and conquer and each give our own personal strategies.

41:14.240 --> 41:14.960
I'll start.

41:14.960 --> 41:15.200
Okay.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.120
Don't.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.000
Just don't.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.240
Don't acknowledge them.

41:22.240 --> 41:28.240
Pretend you're a stranger and they're a stranger because that's the arrangement and never introduce

41:28.240 --> 41:30.480
yourself to them ever because that's what I do.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.600
That's my jam.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.080
That's now let me counterpoint with this.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.440
Do.

41:35.440 --> 41:35.840
Okay.

41:36.640 --> 41:37.520
Because.

41:37.520 --> 41:40.800
Well, but you have to give, you can't just say, just do this thing.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.520
You have to, you have to give it some sort of action.

41:43.520 --> 41:49.920
I think that, okay, so this might be my way of looking at it and I might be a little over optimistic

41:49.920 --> 41:54.640
here, but these people, you know, you get famous, you get popular because people like you.

41:54.640 --> 41:58.400
So you're supported by your fans and they want to know, you know, that people like them.

41:58.400 --> 42:03.600
That's what I always tell myself to justify going out to them and saying like, Hey, Gallagher,

42:03.600 --> 42:04.640
I'm a huge fan.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.800
Thank you so much for all the laughs and walking away.

42:06.800 --> 42:10.880
What you don't want to do is totally geek out and think that you in some way are going

42:10.880 --> 42:14.480
to make a lasting impression and become best friends with this person.

42:14.480 --> 42:18.320
This is your chance to like bump into them, say, Hey, thanks so much for doing all the

42:18.320 --> 42:21.120
great work, shaking their hand and getting away.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.400
See, I thought you were going to go a different direction and say that like these people live

42:24.400 --> 42:31.120
such crazy superficial lives that they just, they really want that human contact.

42:31.120 --> 42:34.000
And you've got it, you've got it to give to them.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.920
You know, I used to tell myself that all these people want is for somebody to come up and

42:37.920 --> 42:40.640
be cool and not super nerdy and geeky out.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.280
And they'll be like, Hey, Travis, you're actually real cool.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.800
Let's hang out back at my palatial comedian estate.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.040
Yeah, but that is not how it works.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.640
They, they're, they want to be left alone.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.360
They don't know you.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.360
So say like, Hey, thank you so much.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.560
Take the opportunity.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.080
Like that's what I say.

42:56.080 --> 42:59.680
When's the chance that you're going to see these people again, you know, take the opportunity

42:59.680 --> 43:01.200
to say, Hey, I'm a big fan.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.320
Thank you so much.

43:02.320 --> 43:09.520
I am as someone who is occasionally recognized in extremely limited and specific.

43:09.520 --> 43:19.280
When you go to conventions, right near or around a sign that has my name on it.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.120
I am occasionally recognized and I can tell you it always makes me feel good.

43:26.480 --> 43:30.560
So if you have that, like as sort of your, now you would think that that would convince

43:30.560 --> 43:35.760
me that maybe people who are actually famous, that maybe they feel the same way.

43:35.760 --> 43:41.200
Hey, but I, I, I just can't, I don't know what to say.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.040
You know, it's, I don't know what to do.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.040
I will say this is Griffin.

43:45.040 --> 43:45.520
What do you do?

43:46.080 --> 43:46.720
Oh, thanks.

43:47.840 --> 43:52.800
What I like to do is I will stand near them.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.360
That's really just stand near them and you don't really have to.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.560
And like, wait for them to recognize you.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.760
No, they don't even need to.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.840
I don't, I don't require that recognition.

44:05.840 --> 44:10.320
I'm just saying, if you stand close enough to somebody, they got to talk to you eventually.

44:10.320 --> 44:14.320
Like, even if they have to, even if they're not a celeb, even if you're just like at the

44:14.320 --> 44:17.520
bus stop, someone's going to that, that will also applies to celebs.

44:17.520 --> 44:22.960
So then you, you put the ball in their court, they start talking to you and then you insult

44:22.960 --> 44:23.680
them a little bit.

44:25.520 --> 44:30.880
Just like insult them a little bit, but then give them and then you give them some attention.

44:30.880 --> 44:35.280
And then before you know it, you're in your fucking Bobcat.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.320
I, I can't.

44:39.440 --> 44:43.120
I'm saying, I'm saying you don't settle for just meeting a celebrity.

44:44.320 --> 44:44.640
Right.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.360
Make a connection.

44:45.360 --> 44:45.840
Fuck them.

44:46.800 --> 44:47.600
Fuck them.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.880
What's a better story?

44:48.880 --> 44:53.200
I was at the Costco and I ran into Bobcat Coldthwaite.

44:53.200 --> 45:06.400
And I ran into, into corn cob gold bars and at the Costco in the, in the chicken, in the

45:06.400 --> 45:07.600
chicken trough.

45:07.600 --> 45:11.280
And before you knew it, we were back at my bungalow.

45:11.280 --> 45:15.120
Fucking, I fucked corn cob gold gong.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.520
And it turned out he was just a homeless man.

45:17.520 --> 45:19.200
I'm corn cob gold gong.

45:19.200 --> 45:26.240
I was at the Zappa's distribution center and I ran into Flapjack Nicholsack and we made

45:26.240 --> 45:28.480
love, we made love all night long.

45:28.480 --> 45:31.360
And I don't know who he is, but he acted like he was somebody.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.480
So I figured he must've been.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.840
Oh man.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.320
And he kept insisting I take pictures with him.

45:36.960 --> 45:42.480
The one thing I have to ask you, and though I have been occasionally, as I said, recognized,

45:44.480 --> 45:47.920
I've also been around legitimately famous people when this has happened.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.320
And I have to beg of you, don't let it happen to you.

45:51.040 --> 45:55.760
Please, if you're going to introduce yourself to someone, please know who the fuck they

45:55.760 --> 45:56.480
are.

45:56.480 --> 46:02.080
Don't just have a vague awareness that they are someone and try to suss it out.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.120
Aren't you somebody?

46:03.120 --> 46:04.720
What have I seen you in?

46:04.720 --> 46:09.280
A lot of times people will call me Travis or Griffin, which must be mortifying for them.

46:09.280 --> 46:13.920
But I, I pretty, after like 20 years with you guys, I'm pretty used to it from like

46:13.920 --> 46:15.120
our parents, friends and stuff.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.640
So it didn't really bother me.

46:16.640 --> 46:21.600
But like, please, if you're going to introduce yourself to an actual celebrity, know who

46:21.600 --> 46:22.240
they are.

46:22.240 --> 46:27.760
Cause that, cause that's pretty brutal that like, you know, you have some relevance to

46:27.760 --> 46:31.280
society, but people can't even like, it's not even like solidifying.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.320
You have fame.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.400
Let me wheeze your juice for a second.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.360
Let me stand near you.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.480
Are you a fame person?

46:36.480 --> 46:39.200
Yeah, you're, you're rare and exotic.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.120
You look like somebody.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.360
Can I touch your hand and tell all my friends about it?

46:43.360 --> 46:46.800
Let's, and then go home and Google you and try to figure out who you are.

46:46.800 --> 46:54.000
When we were at, when we were at max fun con, I had a lot of, uh, post panic attacks where

46:54.000 --> 46:58.080
I would be talking to someone whose work I know, but I don't necessarily know their

46:58.080 --> 47:06.480
visage and like right after the conversation or interaction had ended, um, uh, I would

47:06.480 --> 47:10.080
realize, or someone would tell me like, Hey, that's this person that did this thing that

47:10.080 --> 47:13.920
did this thing that is great that you like and lots of people like, and I would kind

47:13.920 --> 47:16.000
of hyperventilate a little bit, but then you know what?

47:16.960 --> 47:21.600
I would just get angry because where do they get off acting like a regular person?

47:21.600 --> 47:22.320
Yeah.

47:22.320 --> 47:25.440
Why do they not introduce themselves and say, no, don't freak out.

47:25.440 --> 47:29.360
If that right now, listen, don't panic, but I'm going to put my shades on.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.000
Features so bright.

47:34.800 --> 47:38.960
Like if someone's not, I don't think you're famous unless you put on giant sunglasses

47:38.960 --> 47:44.560
and go, Oh yeah, is that important?

47:44.560 --> 47:48.320
So basically you're saying like the only famous person, he was Matthew Rod, right?

47:48.320 --> 47:48.560
Right.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.920
He's the only famous person.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.600
You have a really specific metric.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.360
He's not aging well.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.560
I saw him on the Tony's and he looked terrified.

47:56.560 --> 47:58.480
He looks, he always looks so scared.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.680
What am I doing up here?

48:02.480 --> 48:02.720
Yeah.

48:02.720 --> 48:04.640
I don't mean to say he's not aging well.

48:04.640 --> 48:08.880
I just think like the boyish thing is just like, I don't know.

48:08.880 --> 48:13.360
You expect you to like, Oh, he looks like it's hard for me to shake that image of him

48:13.360 --> 48:14.080
as boyish.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.000
I guess it's hard for him to shake that too.

48:16.000 --> 48:16.240
Right?

48:16.240 --> 48:20.000
Like he's got the story of Bradley Whitford's got the same thing going a little bit where

48:20.000 --> 48:23.760
he still looks like a little boy, but he looks like an old boy.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.480
He looks like a kind of like an old boy.

48:26.480 --> 48:30.160
He looks like a boy who is like a super, like a 70 year old boy.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.480
It's not great.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.360
It's not great for him.

48:34.160 --> 48:34.880
I love his work.

48:34.880 --> 48:35.760
Love his work though.

48:35.760 --> 48:36.080
Oh wait.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.280
Are we talking about if you see, if you see your Matthew Broderick or Bradley Whitford,

48:39.280 --> 48:42.480
please do not tell them that we said these terrible things about him.

48:42.480 --> 48:45.920
I loved Matthew Broderick in old boy, the Japanese horror movie.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.280
I love Bradley Whitford in old dogs.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.680
I, I would give in.

48:51.680 --> 48:52.640
Was he in that?

48:52.640 --> 48:53.600
Cause I could buy that.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.560
No, but he, well, I love the man.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.040
He, he, he, he will dip into some bad things.

48:59.600 --> 49:03.280
I love Bradley Whitford when I saw him in the premiere of old dogs.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.880
He was just watching the movie, but he was.

49:04.880 --> 49:10.160
Did I ever tell you guys, did I ever tell you guys about the time that I fucked Matthew Broderick?

49:12.080 --> 49:14.240
No, no.

49:15.040 --> 49:16.480
Somebody just made that their ringtone.

49:20.160 --> 49:24.880
And look on the iTunes Apple store for ringtones for my brother, my brother and me.

49:24.880 --> 49:30.080
If you, if your phone doesn't ring with my brother, my brother and me, then don't.

49:30.080 --> 49:32.720
Not if people know you want to fuck Matthew Broderick.

49:32.720 --> 49:36.480
You can either shake Matthew Broderick's hand and tell him you love Godzilla 2000.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.560
Or you can fuck him like Godzilla.

49:43.920 --> 49:44.880
Oh my God.

49:45.920 --> 49:49.680
The one person I don't want to piss off is Sarah Jessica Parker though.

49:49.680 --> 49:56.720
She will come at you and she'll break all this, the SITC girls and they will fuck you up.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.720
Throw you in a cauldron, turn you into soup.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.480
On a completely different note.

50:00.480 --> 50:04.320
I want to tell you guys a story that I was reminded of the other day being 14

50:04.960 --> 50:08.240
and seeing on TV that a show called Sex and the City was coming on.

50:08.240 --> 50:08.800
Yeah.

50:08.800 --> 50:09.920
Getting so excited.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.640
Here we go.

50:10.640 --> 50:11.360
Yeah.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.280
I'm going to sneak and watch this.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.320
Watch like 10 minutes.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.920
I was like, this is bullshit.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.000
Get ready to turn into a boner penis.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.920
To emerge butterfly like.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.840
Prepare autobots roll out.

50:25.840 --> 50:29.040
Roll out, time to transform.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.320
Voltron connect.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.480
Wonder Twins activate.

50:34.480 --> 50:35.520
Form a boner.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.920
GI Joe, get them.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.560
I don't remember what they said.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.040
I used to get that way for suddenly Susan.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.080
I used to, hold on, let me, can I try that joke?

50:50.080 --> 50:51.840
Can I do another take on that riff?

50:51.840 --> 50:52.720
Do another take on that joke.

50:52.720 --> 50:58.880
I used to get that way for designing women.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.720
That was the original title for Weird Science.

51:00.720 --> 51:01.360
Did you know that?

51:03.360 --> 51:06.800
It's just called why oh why do I get boners for designing women?

51:09.520 --> 51:10.720
Starring Vanessa Angel.

51:10.720 --> 51:11.280
Stop.

51:11.280 --> 51:14.160
I used to get that way for golden girls, but I'm fucking gross.

51:14.160 --> 51:14.320
Yeah.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.640
Hey, I need some advice.

51:17.280 --> 51:21.760
I've been seeing an amazing girl for a few weeks and it's been going really well.

51:21.760 --> 51:26.800
But I saw the inside of her house for the first time yet, and she's a hoarder.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.400
It's not as bad as the people on television yet, but the entire floor and every surface

51:32.400 --> 51:35.360
were completely covered with books, papers, and other random junk.

51:36.320 --> 51:40.400
Should I break up with her because of the hoarding or keep seeing her and hope it gets better?

51:41.680 --> 51:42.480
Oh my God.

51:43.760 --> 51:45.440
That's a tough question.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.640
This is like a real one.

51:46.640 --> 51:48.320
I'm not even sure we should answer this.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.520
Well, I'm going to say this.

51:49.520 --> 51:53.600
I know this from my brief foray into psychological studies.

51:53.600 --> 51:55.120
It doesn't just get better.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.640
She's not going to sit there one day and be like, oh, my shit's messy.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.760
Well, it's messy in here.

51:59.760 --> 52:00.160
I'm going to clean up.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.560
Isn't that what the whole hook of the TV show Hoarders is?

52:02.560 --> 52:03.840
They take hoarders and they fix them?

52:04.720 --> 52:07.280
They fix them, but it's not a spontaneous thing.

52:07.920 --> 52:08.560
You know what?

52:08.560 --> 52:09.920
I should pick up around here.

52:10.720 --> 52:11.040
No.

52:11.040 --> 52:16.960
And they, but they, and it's all most of the time, it's like a, it's a short term fix.

52:16.960 --> 52:20.000
They clean up and then they're like, we visited three weeks later

52:20.000 --> 52:21.760
and Phillip is still a dirty fuck.

52:24.080 --> 52:27.360
They're still just dry ramen noodles everywhere.

52:27.360 --> 52:30.880
I've never seen Hoarders, but I assume it primarily is about ramen noodles.

52:30.880 --> 52:34.720
Guys, I understand that that is a real psychological disorder.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.760
I get it.

52:35.760 --> 52:42.080
It is just so hard for me to watch and not just scream like just clean, just clean up.

52:42.080 --> 52:42.800
I love to clean.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.760
I'll clean for you.

52:43.760 --> 52:44.880
Let me clean your house.

52:44.880 --> 52:46.320
I'm a pretty messy person.

52:46.320 --> 52:52.400
But the idea of like not being able to see from one side of my house to the other,

52:52.400 --> 52:57.520
like not being able to walk across the floor without like stepping over piles of newspaper

52:57.520 --> 53:00.160
and stuff, it just skews me how, yeah.

53:00.160 --> 53:02.240
In a legitimate answer to your question,

53:05.440 --> 53:12.080
you have to decide that this girl is, whether or not the possibility of this relationship

53:12.080 --> 53:12.640
is worth it.

53:12.640 --> 53:13.040
Yeah.

53:13.040 --> 53:19.280
Like you, there is every chance that maybe you could help her with this problem.

53:19.280 --> 53:25.040
Like maybe that's all she needs is somebody to emotionally support her and help prop her

53:25.040 --> 53:26.560
up and help get her through it.

53:26.560 --> 53:35.120
But if you go into this with eyes open, you are accepting the possibility that it might

53:35.120 --> 53:35.840
never get better.

53:35.840 --> 53:39.600
It might get wicked worse and you may be committing to a life this way.

53:39.600 --> 53:46.800
And I think that honestly, you are completely within your rights ethically and emotionally

53:46.800 --> 53:54.960
and everything to say like, I can't pursue this with you because that's not what I want

53:54.960 --> 53:55.520
for my life.

53:55.520 --> 53:59.680
Like I think you are completely within your rights to do that.

53:59.680 --> 54:03.040
I mean, everybody's got their stuff that they're dealing with.

54:03.040 --> 54:08.640
But if this isn't the kind of stuff that you can handle, I think you can walk away and

54:08.640 --> 54:09.600
not-

54:09.600 --> 54:14.000
I think it's a microcosm of what you go into every time you start a relationship with someone

54:14.000 --> 54:18.640
where you find out like, oh, they snore or they're really bad with money or, you know,

54:18.640 --> 54:19.040
it's a kind of-

54:19.040 --> 54:21.280
They pee in jars and then they save the jars.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.320
But like you find out these things about them and then you have to make the decision.

54:26.320 --> 54:30.160
Like, is this a thing that's going to bug me for the rest of my life?

54:30.160 --> 54:34.560
Or is this an idiosyncrasy of this person that I care about and I can look past?

54:34.560 --> 54:38.880
And so if this is a really big thing and it's a problem for you-

54:38.880 --> 54:40.240
It's the biggest thing.

54:41.360 --> 54:44.800
You're going to move in one day with this messy-bessy and then guess what happens?

54:44.800 --> 54:46.080
You're a hoarder too, dog.

54:46.800 --> 54:47.840
And suddenly you can't find your cat.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.040
Oops, you caught hoarder.

54:49.840 --> 54:53.920
Your cat just died in a pile of Hot Pockets boxes.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.480
Oops, I missed my cat.

54:56.480 --> 54:57.120
I missed my cat.

54:57.120 --> 54:57.760
Where is he?

54:57.760 --> 55:01.760
Son of the meatballs and stroganoff Hot Pockets boxes.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.680
Um, I can't-

55:05.840 --> 55:12.720
I can't say I would continue a relationship with someone in this situation,

55:12.720 --> 55:16.720
but I don't know how much you care about this girl.

55:16.720 --> 55:20.400
I mean like honestly, if I had started dating my wife and she had been a hoarder,

55:22.320 --> 55:26.080
she's already kind of messy, but not quite hoarder levels.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.960
I don't think I would have stopped-

55:28.960 --> 55:31.760
I mean I don't think I could have stopped our relationship for that.

55:31.760 --> 55:34.640
I probably would have just like tried to have been a good influence.

55:34.640 --> 55:37.600
Like honestly though, guys, let's be honest.

55:38.240 --> 55:43.360
Men out there, fellas, when you enter into any relationship,

55:43.360 --> 55:46.240
you are already basically an emotional hoarder.

55:46.240 --> 55:50.880
Like there are some things about you that are way more fucked up than a super messy house.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.640
Like way worse.

55:52.640 --> 55:52.960
There are-

55:52.960 --> 55:59.120
You have some deep recesses in there that any man or woman that dates you

55:59.120 --> 56:01.840
is committing to attempting to fix.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.720
This is just a very external version of that.

56:05.920 --> 56:11.760
If I were you, question asker, I would sit down with this person and be like,

56:11.760 --> 56:15.040
hey, listen, I don't know if I'm okay with this or not.

56:15.040 --> 56:18.720
I, you know, how committed are you to this whole hoarding thing?

56:19.920 --> 56:21.280
Do you think this is going somewhere?

56:21.280 --> 56:25.760
Do you think maybe you could like pick it up before I come over again?

56:26.480 --> 56:27.760
Can you just clean?

56:27.760 --> 56:29.280
Would you be willing to clean for me?

56:29.920 --> 56:33.840
I think you fucking yell 3000 out and you drop a smoke bomb

56:33.840 --> 56:36.480
and some cow trips and then through the window.

56:39.280 --> 56:39.840
Through the wall.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.600
Whatever you want to do.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.640
Kool-Aid, do it.

56:43.360 --> 56:43.760
Get out.

56:43.760 --> 56:47.440
You know, I'm just not sure if I'm ready for things to regress with Betsy,

56:47.440 --> 56:51.040
but you know, I gave her a key and she's got her own drawer in my house

56:51.040 --> 56:53.200
and she's filled it with newspaper and old floss.

56:56.720 --> 56:57.760
That's not funny.

57:00.560 --> 57:01.520
You're a monster.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.880
You're history's greatest monster.

57:04.880 --> 57:05.200
Yeah.

57:05.200 --> 57:05.680
Yahoo.

57:05.680 --> 57:06.320
They'll pick us up.

57:06.880 --> 57:07.280
Okay.

57:07.280 --> 57:07.520
Yeah.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.080
This Yahoo.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.120
I got a Yahoo answer.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.720
It was sent in by Emily Alinder.

57:12.720 --> 57:13.440
Thank you, Emily.

57:13.440 --> 57:16.240
It's by Yahoo answers user Miranda.

57:17.120 --> 57:17.600
Colon.

57:18.160 --> 57:18.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:18.800 --> 57:22.240
It's Miranda smiley face.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.160
Miranda smile asks,

57:25.040 --> 57:27.360
what are some good things to write on your knuckles?

57:28.720 --> 57:30.480
You know, like the tattoos on knuckles.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.080
How about knuckles?

57:32.080 --> 57:32.320
What?

57:33.120 --> 57:34.880
You know how people get tattoos on their knuckles?

57:36.080 --> 57:37.600
It's just like love and hate.

57:39.120 --> 57:41.760
Envy and love.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.120
Or like love and envy.

57:46.320 --> 57:47.520
Like envy and hate.

57:47.520 --> 57:51.520
Or like America exclamation point.

57:51.520 --> 57:55.280
Or like left and right, but right is like R-I-T-E.

57:55.280 --> 57:56.080
Yeah, like right aid.

57:56.960 --> 57:59.200
Like CBS and right aid.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.080
Or just like wall grit because you ran out of knuckles.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.120
Big Phil with two Gs.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.120
That one helps if your name is Phil.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.440
It's an important side note.

58:15.440 --> 58:17.680
Sidebar, your name should be Phil.

58:17.680 --> 58:23.280
I love the idea of getting something that is so recognizable,

58:23.280 --> 58:25.680
but truncated because you ran out of knuckles.

58:25.680 --> 58:28.320
Like get like Will Smith.

58:35.200 --> 58:35.840
McDonnell.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.600
Taco Bell would fit really nicely.

58:41.600 --> 58:45.440
That's not a truncated one, but I mean, Taco Bell.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.960
What do you want to eat for dinner tonight?

58:46.960 --> 58:50.400
On the instances where the answer is Taco Bell,

58:50.400 --> 58:51.440
it's a pretty boss answer.

58:51.440 --> 58:52.320
Just put your fists out.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.440
Like what do you think?

58:53.440 --> 58:54.160
I'm trying.

58:54.160 --> 58:58.000
I like the idea of having like a complete phrase like Taco Bell.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.840
And so when you see both hands together, it makes sense.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.880
But when you just see one, you're like Bell.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.440
Bell.

59:05.440 --> 59:06.880
But what does that mean?

59:06.880 --> 59:08.160
Why does your hand say Taco Bell?

59:09.120 --> 59:11.200
This hand is for eating tacos.

59:11.200 --> 59:12.720
This hand is for eating tacos.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.800
This hand is for ringing bells, obviously.

59:14.800 --> 59:15.680
Don't want to mix them up.

59:15.680 --> 59:16.240
Obviously.

59:18.480 --> 59:19.840
But according to my religion,

59:19.840 --> 59:21.760
if my taco hand touches my bell hand,

59:21.760 --> 59:23.040
then I have to cut them both off.

59:23.040 --> 59:24.320
Well, I'm really-

59:24.320 --> 59:25.520
My right hand says jerk.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.720
My left hand says food.

59:28.320 --> 59:28.800
Get it?

59:28.800 --> 59:29.680
Don't you understand?

59:29.680 --> 59:31.680
I must never confuse the two.

59:32.480 --> 59:32.720
No.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.360
If you wanted to put most F on there,

59:35.360 --> 59:36.640
would you just put three Fs?

59:38.880 --> 59:40.000
So we just say F?

59:40.000 --> 59:45.760
No, it would say M-O-S-D-E-F-F-F.

59:45.760 --> 59:49.280
So I like this idea of using your knuckles like a vanity plate.

59:49.280 --> 59:49.520
Right.

59:50.080 --> 59:51.280
Too hot for you.

59:52.560 --> 59:53.280
Pawn star.

59:54.400 --> 59:55.120
Hot rod.

59:56.640 --> 59:57.360
By the way, you guys,

59:57.360 --> 59:59.360
I watched like six episodes of Pawn Star

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.520
while waiting for my car to get fixed at Firestone.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.720
That show is so great.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:02.880
Yeah.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.320
What realizations did you come away with?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.200
I hate myself.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.400
No, okay.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.320
Well, what about thug life?

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.440
But then you have the option of putting your pinky up

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.560
and it says hug life.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.400
And then underside of your pinky is just a happy smiling man.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.200
What?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.600
I'm sorry.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.080
I just got distracted by looking at the tiny smiling man

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.840
I've drawn on the underside of my pinky.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.120
He's just there to help me get through the rough times.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.080
Yeah, like this.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.280
This would be a good example.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.640
I wish I had one.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.160
Well, at the end of the show,

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.000
I wish that I had had hello.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.160
Hello, little pinky man.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.360
I'm underneath your hand.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.520
Don't mind me.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.080
Hey, how about it Nickelodeon?

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.920
We're right here for all the voices you need.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.520
Man.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520
I'm Dylan, the new starfish in town.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:57.940
Kidding.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.960
I'm Winston Churchill.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.680
I'm a walrus.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.320
I'm Winston walrus.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.320
What are we doing?

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.280
Why does Winston walrus speak in dubstep?

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.280
I'm Winston walrus.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.440
Get ready for the drop.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.680
I have a dubstep speech impediment.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.240
My speech impediment is Skrillex.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.320
I'm dropping the base.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.800
It's floating back up to the surface.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.600
I love living underneath the sea with my friend,

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.880
the starfish Dylan.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.520
Hello, I'm Dylan the starfish.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.760
We live together with our friends in round square.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.040
How about it Nickelodeon?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.480
I'm right here, baby.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.480
$27 and a hot meal.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.440
Show me the money.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.280
Show me the money and the hot meal.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.440
That was actually my Cuba Gooding Jr. impression.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.160
You want to do that animated series Snow Dogs,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.280
but you can't afford Cuba?

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.360
Travis has you.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.800
Show me the monies.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.960
Whoa, it's like having him here on the show.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.480
I can do Cuba Gooding Jr. and senior.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.320
Yes, do show my son the money.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.400
That's the best celebrity impression I've ever heard.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.520
What about Doug Life?

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.680
Okay, we're done.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.960
This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother and me.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.560
It's an advice show, Obbs.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.920
I want to thank everybody for tweeting about the show

which we put the happy news on Twitter this week.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.400
which is pretty amazing.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.400
And it's all thanks to you all.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.560
So thank you to those tweeting.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:37.840
Bullseye.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.960

off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.560
It's the one album that you can come back to

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.120
in good times and bad.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.720
And hey, our friend Graham Clarke

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.920

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.040

And he has a fantastic beard.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.320
Just the best beard.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:12.640
Just the best beard.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.960
I want to thank everybody for helping me out on Friday,

I don't know.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.800

The people that do our t-shirt.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.560
How do you still not know how to say that fucking word?

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.280
Topotico?

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.880

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.920
t-shirt from them.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.840
And in the special comments, I put, I love you.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.200
Now don't let it get weird.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.080
And they drew a picture of Garfield saying,

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.400
well, it's too late for that.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.840
And it was like the best thing ever.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.880
So thank you guys so much.

We got a really nice email from him just saying,

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.600
hey, guys, I loved the goose.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.480
I love the episode.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.360
We've all been there.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.600
We've all had that thought at some point.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.800
It's not weird.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.880
And thank you, Jim, for the lovely fruit basket.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.240
Jim sent us a fruit basket.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.000
And he said, good goose, good goose.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:50.800
It's all in good fun.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.680
Don't worry about it.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.720
So thank you so much, Jim Davis.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.080
Thank you for being so cool.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080
Griffin, give me the last question.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.440
Yeah, sure.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.160
This one was sent in by question mark.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:08.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user me, who asks opinions

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.760
on the name gymnasium.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.240
That's J-I-M-nasium for a boy.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.400
Oh, Justin McElroy.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.600
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.920
It's been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.560
Kiss your dad.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:46.480
School wear on the lips.
