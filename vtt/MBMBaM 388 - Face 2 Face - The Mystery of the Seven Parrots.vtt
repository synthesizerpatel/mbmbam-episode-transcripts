WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.760
Hi everybody, it's the Sick Boys.

00:47.760 --> 00:54.560
It's all the sick, well it's two of the sick boys, and there's sick women also,

00:54.560 --> 00:58.160
sick women and children, and everyone's sick and it's a nightmare.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.800
Now, to be fair, I am not sick.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.600
Oh, how's that?

01:02.320 --> 01:06.800
Well, let me take that back. I would say I'm not physically ill,

01:06.800 --> 01:09.280
but in many ways, mentally, spiritually.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.400
Yeah, I've said that about you for a long time, is that your spirit itself is sick,

01:14.400 --> 01:18.080
like you're religiously sick.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.600
Yeah, for like seven-

01:19.600 --> 01:21.040
Travis, I've got great news.

01:22.160 --> 01:27.120
For like seven nights in a row, BB has been up from like 1 to 4 or 30 in the morning.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.920
Yeah, thank you all for waiting on this episode.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.440
It's been the case for all of us for like the better part of a week now,

01:35.440 --> 01:38.480
and it is tough to put together some laughs for you.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.720
But here we are, and we wanted to put out something this week,

01:42.720 --> 01:47.280
and so we have a live show for you, but little do you know,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.960
or maybe you do, depending on what I make the episode description,

01:50.960 --> 01:52.800
it's actually two live shows in one.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.320
I have combined some of the best bits from our two back-to-back Chicago shows that we did last year

01:58.320 --> 02:00.240
into one super episode.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.480
And Trav, I don't know how much you remember about the Chicago shows,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.600
but there's some fucking jammers up in there.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.520
Oh, okay. I'm excited to forget to listen to it.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.320
People are finally going to get to know why some of the Bim Bam fans

02:14.320 --> 02:17.520
who were in attendance that night are constantly talking about seven parrots,

02:18.400 --> 02:20.720
because this is when that sort of comes to a head.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.720
It's a fun episode, and we apologize for, you know,

02:24.720 --> 02:26.880
we like giving you a heads up that a live episode's coming out,

02:26.880 --> 02:28.960
but obviously that wasn't possible this week.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.840
But yeah, it's two live shows in one.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.680
I cut like a ton of stuff out of both of them

02:33.680 --> 02:36.880
just to put together one super episode.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.840
So here's that, and we'll talk to you when we get to the Money Zone.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.440
Hello, everybody, and welcome, my brother, my brother-in-law,

02:41.440 --> 02:42.720
and welcome to my show for the modern era.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

02:44.160 --> 02:50.720
Please, Auguste, save some for later.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.840
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.240
And I'm your sweet baby brother

03:00.240 --> 03:02.800
in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Griffin McElroy.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.380
We...

03:09.280 --> 03:11.520
We are dying.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.920
Well, technically, we all are for the moment.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.600
Have a fun show, everybody!

03:15.600 --> 03:16.880
Or I'm gonna start dying.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.420
We...

03:19.440 --> 03:20.880
...eated the deep dish.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.840
We have tasted...

03:21.840 --> 03:22.800
We have tasted...

03:23.520 --> 03:24.560
...your tall pizza.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.000
We have, as have so many tourists,

03:28.640 --> 03:31.600
fallen into the pizza trap that you have lured for them.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.440
Oh, no, you ate the deep dish.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.760
Oh, no, you're not supposed to eat the deep dish, obviously.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.280
This savory cake you call deep pizza.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.320
This savory cake you call deep pizza.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.480
You guys are probably tired of hearing about your pizza,

03:44.480 --> 03:48.400
but I'm tired of feeling your pizza in me.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.520
We're having fun, but...

03:50.720 --> 03:53.040
I feel like I was hit by a garbage truck.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.520
Here's the thing, it's delicious.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.960
It's a delicious garbage truck.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.040
It's delicious, but I feel like I was hit by a garbage truck

03:59.040 --> 04:00.320
and that some of it got into me.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.880
And that's not a knock on that,

04:02.880 --> 04:04.880
it's a knock on our garbage bodies.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.120
We haven't yet had that Van Morrison,

04:07.120 --> 04:08.640
like, well, Van partied too hard.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.960
He's going to need someone to walk him off stage tonight.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.840
There's no more con.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.680
He's going to do four songs and go home.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.720
But we were like perilously close backstage having a conversation.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.320
Justin was doing his TaeKwonDo,

04:18.320 --> 04:20.800
getting all of us sort of psyched out of our minds.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.720
I was doing it in a room alone,

04:22.720 --> 04:25.280
and then people entered while I was doing TaeKwonDo.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.840
And that seems to me like it should be treated

04:27.840 --> 04:29.200
like someone using the bathroom.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.880
It should be, if you see me-

04:30.880 --> 04:33.200
The noises you made were sort of synonymous.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
It's called a key up and it's a part of the formation.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.040
It's powerful.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.640
I don't want to forget that there's a key up with that spear hand.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.040
So it's just part of the formation.

04:43.040 --> 04:43.600
Yeah, I agree.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.920
I'm not doing it right if I'm not doing the key ups.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.440
I guess, 100%.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.160
Okay, thank you.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.360
Thank you all so much for coming.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.960
No, he's not going to do it now.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.560
It's not a performance.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.880
He just compared it to using the bathroom.

04:56.880 --> 04:57.920
You perverts.

04:57.920 --> 04:58.480
Yeah, you-

04:58.480 --> 05:00.320
Take a dump on stage.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.640
We're saving that for Milwaukee.

05:05.280 --> 05:05.520
Yeah.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.400
Yeah.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.720
Because they nasty.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.160
They nasty in Milwaukee.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.960
What an honor it is to be here with you all tonight.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.920
I'm so excited.

05:15.920 --> 05:16.160
Yeah.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.080
We might actually try tonight.

05:20.080 --> 05:24.080
Tonight, before we've always phoned it in for the 50 plus shows we've done before this.

05:24.080 --> 05:29.280
But tonight, we're bringing it for your beautiful, wonderful city that has made us feel so well.

05:29.280 --> 05:29.600
You know what?

05:29.600 --> 05:31.440
Tonight, we horny for this one.

05:31.440 --> 05:31.680
Yeah.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.600
God, we can say all we want, but I still feel like I'm going to die.

05:35.600 --> 05:40.160
Like, we're trying to talk ourselves into not dying, but it's just not going to happen.

05:40.160 --> 05:45.120
If the burp police were here tonight, backstage, we would have been sentenced to life.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.160
I actually feel great.

05:46.160 --> 05:46.720
Great.

05:47.200 --> 05:47.600
Open up.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.480
It's the fart BI.

05:48.480 --> 05:53.280
How do you all, are you all just sort of accustomed?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.680
Have your bodies become inoculated to the tall pizza?

05:55.680 --> 05:56.240
Is that what it is?

05:56.240 --> 05:56.880
I don't know.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.520
I don't know.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.080
I don't know.

05:58.080 --> 05:58.640
I don't know.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.200
I don't know.

05:59.200 --> 05:59.760
I don't know.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.720
Guys, should we get going?

06:04.720 --> 06:05.040
Yeah.

06:05.040 --> 06:10.720
So, this is like, it's an advice show, as you've certainly gleaned by this point.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.200
Kind of a do as we don't sort of situation.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.600
Don't eat at the pizza.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.640
Don't eat of your pizza.

06:16.640 --> 06:21.040
Unless you've got natural, I'm assuming you've developed some sort of digestive toxin.

06:22.960 --> 06:28.080
Or perhaps like a separate stomach chamber that allows you to regurgitate.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.640
We didn't turn the tall pizza into could the right way.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.000
But, so we take your questions and turn them out and be like into wisdom.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.560
That's the bit.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.360
You know what?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.720
Let's all take a nap.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.160
Just a tight 20.

06:45.440 --> 06:45.920
Okay.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.280
I'm gonna turn it around right now.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.760
Are you ready to turn it around with us through your energy and power?

06:53.040 --> 06:53.920
It's too much.

06:54.480 --> 06:54.800
Help.

06:54.800 --> 06:55.680
I'm too amped.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.280
All right.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.520
We don't normally do this, but you want to start with the Yahoo?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.640
I do want to start with the Yahoo.

07:00.640 --> 07:06.560
If you've never listened to our show before, we take questions and turn them alchemy-like

07:06.560 --> 07:07.680
into wisdom.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.840
And Griffin has extracted some questions from the Yahoo answer service.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.400
I have a team of people who extract it for me.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.680
I would never put on the suit required to go into the fucking upside down

07:20.320 --> 07:22.320
and tangle with these fucking monsters.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.520
Uh, this one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.240
Thank you, Seth.

07:27.600 --> 07:33.520
It's from Yahoo answers user Kaylee, who asks, what would happen if I shoot a Ouija board?

07:41.840 --> 07:44.720
I've been playing with that thing and now I want to get rid of it.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.480
What would happen if I shoot it multiple times with a real shotgun?

07:48.480 --> 07:52.720
First off, does this guy not know of other ways to get rid of things?

07:52.720 --> 07:52.960
Yeah.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.680
It's just like, that was a delicious Coke Zero.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.440
Oh, I got all my, would you do the Ouija board like, or is this sitting on the ground?

08:01.440 --> 08:05.200
I think if you think it has a demonic presence inside of it, you, there's no, you don't want

08:05.200 --> 08:06.160
to risk it.

08:06.160 --> 08:06.720
Right.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.000
This ain't no game.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm going to shoot this Ouija board on the ground.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.560
Thank you.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.520
I'm going to execute this Ouija board.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.240
This person thinks that the Ouija board would, would kill me.

08:16.240 --> 08:21.280
Sure, this person thinks that the Ouija board would withstand multiple direct shotgun blasts.

08:21.280 --> 08:21.760
Yeah.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.960
Like they think it is imbued with some sort of dark energy.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.000
No, no, no.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
They've never fired a shotgun before, in which case this could also be very hilarious.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.400
Oh yeah.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.520
One way or the other, film this.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.960
Yeah, please put it on video.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.280
We do.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.600
Cause you might release a demon or you might like lift yourself off the ground and go flying

08:39.600 --> 08:43.280
back cause you're six inches from a sidewalk firing a shotgun.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.080
It's going to go bad.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.320
I feel like Jumanji 2.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.400
Not the one that's already coming out, but a new one.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.800
That's really just an edit of the first one.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.200
Right.

08:55.200 --> 09:00.080
Where they, where one kid gets sucked into the game for 30 years, which is a huge bummer

09:00.080 --> 09:01.120
if you really.

09:01.120 --> 09:01.440
Yeah.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.880
How's your kid's movie?

09:02.880 --> 09:03.520
It's bad.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.520
But then the, one of the other kids is like, well, fuck this.

09:09.520 --> 09:09.840
Yeah.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.720
Just blows it all.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.840
Do you guys remember?

09:11.840 --> 09:15.840
Or David, David Allen Greer, like a rhino rams his car and he's like, I'm going to find

09:15.840 --> 09:16.880
that fucking game.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.440
Why didn't they just like shoot it?

09:19.440 --> 09:20.800
The first animal comes through.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.400
You shoot the board, you shoot.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.680
Or the animal.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.880
Everybody was very like.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.440
You can't do that.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.240
They're endangered.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.920
Oh, cause they're, there's not enough fantasy animals out there.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.440
And that's why we called you all here today.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.480
Hey, why didn't we use the Jumanji board to generate more endangered animals?

09:37.840 --> 09:39.760
We could fix the whole thing.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.680
Just like, oh, we're almost out of tigers.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.120
No, we're not Robin.

09:43.120 --> 09:43.680
Go ahead.

09:44.240 --> 09:44.960
Let them out.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.680
There it is.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.880
Tigers, tigers everywhere.

09:47.680 --> 09:47.920
Yeah.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.280
Do you guys remember?

09:49.280 --> 09:52.160
There was a cartoon version of Jumanji.

09:52.160 --> 09:52.400
No.

09:53.200 --> 09:53.360
Right.

09:53.360 --> 09:59.280
There's a cartoon series and it was set not of the whimsical board game playing part,

09:59.280 --> 10:00.000
but of.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.040
It wasn't whimsical, Travis.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.000
People died.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.560
But you know the part where little kid Robin Williams and we're the picture like a 10 year

10:06.560 --> 10:12.480
old in the jungle for by himself for 30 years is the world moves on without him and he becomes

10:12.480 --> 10:14.320
the animals he's afraid of.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.840
That's what the cartoon is.

10:18.720 --> 10:22.000
How fun to like bury his shit.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.680
My parents just died.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.880
That monkey just pooped.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.680
It's a cartoon.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.800
I don't know how electronics work.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.480
How fun.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.280
I just fought a wombat for the right to eat my own scat.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.560
Enjoy kids.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.720
To be fair, they also made a cartoon out of Beetlejuice where Beetlejuice is like a lovable

10:42.720 --> 10:43.280
rascal.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.800
Uh, he was a lovable rascal.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.720
Robin, that movie's unbelievable.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.720
Jumanji, the only thing that is unbelievable about it that keeps it from being like a documentary.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.200
The only thing.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.920
The only thing that when Robin Williams comes out, he just doesn't instantly snap that fucking

10:55.920 --> 10:56.640
board over his face.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.680
And flush it down the toilet.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.800
Flush it down the toilet.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.560
The first, like there should be 10 minutes of that movie where Robin Williams is peeing

11:02.560 --> 11:03.600
on the Jumanji board.

11:03.600 --> 11:03.600
Yeah.

11:04.160 --> 11:04.880
Fuck this.

11:04.880 --> 11:05.600
Fuck this.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.600
I recently bought a pair of designer Heelys.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.800
Show over.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.600
End of question.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.600
I recently bought a pair of designer Heelys because a teen told me they were cool.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.800
That is such a bad, that's such a bad like life strategy.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.760
Such a bad reason to do anything.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.260
Yeah.

11:27.120 --> 11:33.520
Uh, how do I learn to Heely without anybody seeing me fall down or stumble or get hurt?

11:33.520 --> 11:39.360
Heely without anybody seeing me fall down or stumble or otherwise make a fool of myself.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.840
I have a roommate, so practicing at home is out of the question.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.720
I'm assuming, I'm assuming your roommate's a shut-in.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.440
That's fine.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.840
Uh, I also live in a big city.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.320
We know.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.480
We're here too.

11:52.480 --> 11:52.960
Remember?

11:53.520 --> 11:55.280
We're all gonna be here in Chicago.

11:55.280 --> 11:55.920
It's pretty big.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.080
A lot of beautiful architecture too.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.200
Oh, so lovely.

11:59.200 --> 11:59.920
The art deco.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.240
Lovely.

12:00.240 --> 12:04.000
I can't stop talking about these gothic touches.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.040
I'm 37.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.280
So unless I'm practicing at 3 a.m. on weekdays, someone could see my shame.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.440
Also, it'd be dark and I'd probably fall.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.720
Please help me out so that I can be my best, raddest self.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.040
That's from Hesitant Heel Head from Chicago.

12:19.040 --> 12:19.680
Are you here?

12:21.520 --> 12:22.640
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.240
Hold on.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.840
All right, I need complete silence.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.200
I'm gonna ask again.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.400
Are you here?

12:30.400 --> 12:30.800
Okay.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.000
Okay, I heard a what?

12:32.000 --> 12:32.880
I heard a what?

12:33.760 --> 12:35.760
So, okay, thank you.

12:35.760 --> 12:36.560
Yes, you are here.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.440
Excellent.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.520
When you led out to this, how-

12:40.320 --> 12:43.360
You don't have to answer this because I'm gonna answer it myself because I saw the joke work.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.160
Please don't because you don't have a microphone and we do.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.280
When you're having this conversation with said teen,

12:49.920 --> 12:51.440
did you lead off by going,

12:51.440 --> 12:52.400
hey, what's cool?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.760
And the teen was like,

12:55.760 --> 12:58.640
designer Heelys and you're like, got it.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.000
Like ran out the door.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.720
Designer Heelys.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.160
Is there a postscript on the email that's like,

13:04.160 --> 13:05.760
I'm gonna, okay, I'm just gonna try it.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.880
My kneecaps, my kneecaps, they're gone.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.880
My legs are melting.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.240
They're just gone.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.040
My legs are coming off at the seams.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.040
Legs have seams.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.080
I've unraveled.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.320
I've unraveled like a flesh mummy.

13:22.320 --> 13:28.640
I firmly believe that-

13:28.640 --> 13:30.240
I'm 37 years old now, I mentioned.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.160
Jesus.

13:32.160 --> 13:32.960
I know.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.560
That's basically 40.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.680
All right, all right, all right, all right.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.480
Youngins.

13:38.480 --> 13:38.980
Yeah.

13:40.880 --> 13:41.920
Okay, all right.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.440
So anyway, where was I?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.080
Before I started-

13:44.080 --> 13:46.480
Oh, are you starting to forget what you were talking about?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.040
Oh no.

13:47.040 --> 13:52.800
Oh, before we decided to have a nice long ponder at my open grave.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.200
I'm 37 years old now and I've learned a lot in those 37 years.

13:59.200 --> 14:07.840
And one of the things that I have sort of become the most clear to me is that what matters in

14:07.840 --> 14:16.400
life is not the accumulation of wealth or stuff or prestige, but the important thing

14:16.400 --> 14:21.440
and the thing that you can really do for the world is what can you give to the people that

14:21.440 --> 14:22.080
you encounter?

14:22.080 --> 14:24.000
How can your life be a service to them?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.640
Because in the end, that's the only thing that matters.

14:26.640 --> 14:36.080
So I guess what I'm saying is, if I saw an adult fall the first time they ever used Healy's,

14:37.200 --> 14:43.760
it would be the greatest gift you could give me sort of personally in my day-to-day life.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.320
You would have to announce, this is my first time.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.280
First time.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.040
Hey everybody, gather around.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.280
I've decided to try Healy's today.

14:51.280 --> 14:51.920
Today.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.200
Now for you.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.120
I'm pretty nervous about it.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.040
I'm three days away from retirement.

14:57.680 --> 14:57.920
Right.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.840
If you would do that, that would be such a gift.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.960
What an amazing thing that would be sort of a facet in the jewel that is my life.

15:06.960 --> 15:12.800
One of the biggest facets would be that time I saw a grown adult try Healy's for the first

15:12.800 --> 15:14.560
time and beef it.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.600
Beef it so hard.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.240
Because the other option is that they say, I'm going to try Healy's for the first time,

15:18.240 --> 15:19.840
and it's glorious.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.600
And you're just like, a butterfly.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.160
They've done it.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.800
They've finally become what they were always meant to be.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.160
I'm sorry, what?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.200
What's everyone yelling?

15:30.640 --> 15:32.080
You're wearing them.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.440
You're wearing them.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.760
Excuse me, he's wearing them.

15:39.280 --> 15:45.120
Excuse me, I'm going to need house lights and I'm going to need you to come to center

15:45.120 --> 15:46.240
aisle now.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.280
Hold on.

15:49.280 --> 15:49.840
Hold on.

15:49.840 --> 15:50.240
Hold on.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.040
Serious question.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.720
Come on over here to the center aisle.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.840
Is this your first time?

15:53.840 --> 15:55.600
Because I'm actually kind of mixed on it.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.120
That's hysterical.

15:57.120 --> 16:02.080
But also, are we insured?

16:02.800 --> 16:03.840
How does that even work?

16:03.840 --> 16:04.240
Listen.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.360
Paul, can you give me a thumbs up or thumbs down?

16:07.360 --> 16:09.280
On encouraging an audience member to Healy's.

16:11.040 --> 16:11.920
Yeah, it's an iffy.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.200
Okay, iffy.

16:13.200 --> 16:13.920
I'll take that.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.320
They're going to be fine though.

16:16.320 --> 16:16.800
All right.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.120
Whatever you do, don't Healy.

16:20.000 --> 16:20.960
Wink.

16:20.960 --> 16:21.840
Don't say wink.

16:21.840 --> 16:22.800
There's a being in the recording.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.840
Don't say wink.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.240
We'll just wait.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.240
Now, come down to one more aisle over, please.

16:26.240 --> 16:26.720
Center.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.360
Center stage.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.520
Oh, you're going to go around.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.960
You haven't been drinking, have you?

16:30.960 --> 16:33.280
Because, okay.

16:33.280 --> 16:33.760
Can you?

16:33.760 --> 16:34.080
All right.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.280
And I need everybody to be quiet.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.080
Okay, we're going to count down.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.440
Can you yell your name, please?

16:37.440 --> 16:38.720
Sam.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.200
Sam.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.640
Sam.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.520
Sam.

16:41.520 --> 16:41.840
Sam.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.600
And what would you like on your theme song?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.400
Here we go.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.680
Wait, Sam, wait.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.600
What are you putting on?

16:52.400 --> 16:53.200
Just in case.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.240
No, I'm just going to film.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.120
Oh, I thought you were going to put on some Healy music.

16:57.120 --> 16:57.280
No, okay.

16:57.280 --> 17:02.640
Just going to put on the theme song to Yuri on Ice as you glide effortlessly down the...

17:02.640 --> 17:03.120
All right.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.720
Okay, and I'm ready.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.760
Go ahead, Sam.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.280
Healy on down to us.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.320
Please be careful.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.200
Please be careful.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.120
All right.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.400
You're doing it.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.600
All right, dab, dab.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.320
We got to dab.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.360
Keep going.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.880
Okay, and we'll stop right here.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.840
We'll stop right here.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.720
We'll stop right here.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.200
Perfect.

17:20.080 --> 17:20.880
Perfect.

17:20.880 --> 17:21.760
Okay.

17:21.760 --> 17:22.240
Thank you.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.120
Sam, everybody.

17:25.760 --> 17:30.880
And a special thanks to the security guard who stopped Sam from Healying too close to the stage.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.760
Sam, you now owe this man a life debt.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.240
Okay, thank you, Sam.

17:36.240 --> 17:36.320
Thank you, Sam.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.040
That was excellent.

17:37.040 --> 17:37.680
You did so good.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.120
And now you're great at Healying.

17:39.120 --> 17:44.400
We fixed one.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.440
Oh, how exciting.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.520
How about a Yahoo from the Yahoo Answer Service?

17:51.680 --> 17:53.200
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.720
Yeah, Drew Drew, Drew Davenport.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.520
Thank you, Drew.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.640
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, but we'll call them Bill-a-me.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.480
Bill-a-me asks,

18:04.480 --> 18:08.960
Cat won't come out of hiding after I got a vape pin?

18:16.240 --> 18:19.840
So today we actually thought our cat ran away because we couldn't find him,

18:19.840 --> 18:22.800
and he doesn't usually hide like that.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.240
I also got a new vape yesterday, and I wonder if this was the problem.

18:26.240 --> 18:26.640
Help!

18:29.440 --> 18:32.240
Jeremy, Jeremy, I'm not going to watch you do this to yourself.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.760
I care too much about you, Jeremy, to be a part of this.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.600
Jeremy, the science is inconclusive.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.400
I'll be under the couch.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.560
If you'll excuse me, I have to lick my asshole.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.800
Which is much like vaping, if you think about it.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.720
Don't get me wrong.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.640
It looks radical.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.280
It looks so cool.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.400
Sick as shit.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.240
But I care about you, Jeremy.

18:54.240 --> 18:57.760
Do you think that the cat was wondering like,

18:57.760 --> 18:59.440
could you do that the whole time?

18:59.440 --> 19:00.640
And you're just now?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.680
Are you a wizard?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.680
Are you a weather wizard?

19:03.680 --> 19:05.200
You make clouds?

19:05.200 --> 19:09.760
If I could blow cotton like that, I would be doing it 24 hours in the cod.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.880
If cats could vape,

19:12.720 --> 19:14.480
if cats could vape,

19:14.480 --> 19:18.400
you know they would be blowing cotton in your face 24 hours a day, right?

19:18.400 --> 19:22.560
You would wake up in like fucking London fog and it's like, what is this?

19:22.560 --> 19:23.200
Oh, that's right.

19:23.200 --> 19:29.360
My cat is fucking ripping some blueberry dream right into my eyeballs.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.840
Garfield would be fucking lighting John.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.520
You wouldn't see normal.

19:37.760 --> 19:44.560
There is probably not a Garfield strip that couldn't be accurately concluded with Garfield

19:44.560 --> 19:49.200
just, well, Garfield had a real rough day at the honest.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
And Garfield thinks, tell me about it, John.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.280
And John's like, ask the girl on date.

19:53.280 --> 19:53.920
She said, no.

19:53.920 --> 20:00.000
Every Garfield strip has just two.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.960
Just make sure two more frames like a pendant on of those.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.280
That's frame four.

20:06.240 --> 20:06.800
Frame five.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.040
You're such a fucking idiot, John.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.440
Jack Garfield would blow it right in John's face.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.240
Yeah, definitely.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.640
It's just a big cloud around John.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.440
Around John.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.640
Then the last strip is secondhand vape.

20:22.640 --> 20:23.760
Like, it's killed John.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.080
It's inconclusive.

20:26.080 --> 20:26.800
We don't know yet.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.880
The science is out on that one right now.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.880
Jim Davis definitely vapes, though.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.840
Do they make lasagna flavored vape?

20:34.640 --> 20:35.840
Oh, he would love that.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.520
He would love it.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.200
But you know when he wouldn't vape?

20:39.200 --> 20:40.400
Mondays.

20:40.400 --> 20:40.880
Are you kidding me?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.800
No, I think he would vape extra hard on Mondays.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.840
He would especially vape double on Mondays.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.600
It's the only thing getting him through.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.360
Yeah, ripping that Monday cotton.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.680
How about Yahoo?

20:49.680 --> 20:50.320
Yeah, please.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.600
Please.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.000
I don't want to oversell it.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.160
It might be the best Yahoo of all time.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.520
Well, at least you didn't oversell it.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.000
It was sent in by Ben Schultz.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.480
Thank you, Ben.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.280
It's Yahoo Answers user, Dean, who asked.

21:10.240 --> 21:10.640
Really?

21:11.360 --> 21:11.920
No, it's great.

21:11.920 --> 21:16.800
But I can't do the voice because I don't want to do anything to sully this beautiful-

21:16.800 --> 21:18.640
You could do your sully impression.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.560
Perfect.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.680
I'm a pilot.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.720
Yeah, what's up with that?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.800
Finally, someone put that guy on blast.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.080
Oh, I saved a bunch of people.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.360
What's his rap light with ducks?

21:33.360 --> 21:33.760
Probably not great.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.720
You ever think about that?

21:34.720 --> 21:35.440
Probably not good.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.320
No, he steered a plane into ducks.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.000
He's a monster.

21:43.440 --> 21:43.840
Anyway-

21:43.840 --> 21:45.120
Yeah, fuck sully.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.400
I'm sorry.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.440
Is he here tonight, actually?

21:47.440 --> 21:50.080
We're just having fun, sir.

21:50.080 --> 21:50.880
Thank you for your service.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.720
The best Yahoo of all time.

21:54.720 --> 22:17.680
Dean asks, if I legally bought the Mona Lisa, would anyone be able to stop me from eating it?

22:17.680 --> 22:25.840
Once in a generation, a Yahoo comes along that I don't even know how to joke about because,

22:27.200 --> 22:28.080
I don't know.

22:28.080 --> 22:32.240
It's like Ben came down from a mountain and handed this to me on a tablet.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.080
So, could they?

22:36.080 --> 22:36.560
Could they?

22:39.600 --> 22:40.880
I mean, it's your painting.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.080
Yeah, Indiana Jones is not going to kick in the door to your apartment and be like,

22:44.080 --> 22:45.360
it belongs in a museum.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.080
It does look good.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.200
I get it.

22:47.200 --> 22:47.920
It does look good.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.880
Belongs in a museum.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.080
It belongs in here, indeed.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.960
What if that's how Last Crusade ended?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.640
It's like, you have chosen wisely.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.040
Thank you.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.280
Yeah, you look like Willy Wonka to take a bite out of it.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.600
Now, you could eat a little.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.600
This is an example.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.040
Picture the Mona Lisa, right?

23:09.680 --> 23:10.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.480
That bottom inch could go.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.040
It could go.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.080
You could eat the bottom inch.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.280
No one would know.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.360
It's not as big as you think it is.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.720
So, like, have a side.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.640
There are bigger paintings you could eat.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.360
Okay.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.400
Nighthawks is a big one.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.760
You could eat a lot of Nighthawks.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.040
Jackson Pollock has some.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.040
Could you eat?

23:33.680 --> 23:34.400
Okay, Travis.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.600
If you're going to eat the Mona Lisa, would you start with the face?

23:39.600 --> 23:40.400
No, background.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.480
I'd start with the background.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.040
You can eat that.

23:43.040 --> 23:43.760
Here's what you do.

23:43.760 --> 23:47.280
You photocopy it.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.000
Okay.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.600
Then you eat the background.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.360
Then you just put it over the photocopy.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.320
Yeah, this is literally a Mr. Bean movie you've described.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.320
Oh, no.

24:00.480 --> 24:04.640
I can think a few Power Plays better than getting the Mona Lisa,

24:04.640 --> 24:08.160
making a perfect copy of the Mona Lisa, eating the original, and giving it back.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.560
And say, like, I changed my mind, and I want you all to have it.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.200
All right.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.760
And then when you see people enjoying it in a museum, you're like,

24:15.760 --> 24:17.440
oh, yeah, it's the real one.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.800
And you just rub your tummy.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.160
You rub your tummy.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.960
Do you think that this person would start getting kicked out of the art

24:24.960 --> 24:28.800
auctions because they're just like, 100 million and $1.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.280
That's a knife and fork in there.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.240
They've got a napkin, and it's part of the Mona Lisa.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.080
And they just tore up a Monet to do a little...

24:40.080 --> 24:43.040
That is good because I don't know that anyone, like, when they've died,

24:43.040 --> 24:46.080
have been able to donate their body to a museum before.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.200
I want to donate the Mona Lisa to you.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.080
It's in there.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.040
It's in there, trust me.

24:52.720 --> 24:55.200
Even if you wanted to eat the Mona Lisa,

24:55.200 --> 24:59.360
I suspect that you would probably get about a third of the way through it for like, ugh.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.240
Like, it's not going to be good.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.360
And you don't want to sully that experience with ketchup.

25:05.360 --> 25:05.600
Yeah.

25:06.720 --> 25:06.960
Right?

25:06.960 --> 25:11.680
You know what most people don't know? It's very deep.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.520
Yeah, raised sides and everything.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.160
I read the best news story ever the other day.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.720
And it was from some museum.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.600
They realized they had a Van Gogh piece from his, like,

25:21.600 --> 25:24.160
Olive Fields collection that he did.

25:24.160 --> 25:28.320
And what they discovered is that there was a grasshopper in the paint...

25:28.880 --> 25:30.080
Kansas City, what's up?

25:30.080 --> 25:32.320
Represent at a Kansas City museum.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.600
There was a grasshopper just in the painting.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.960
And I love that so much because Van Gogh must have just been like...

25:40.960 --> 25:41.840
Got you!

25:41.840 --> 25:43.040
Got you, you bastard!

25:43.040 --> 25:43.360
Yeah.

25:44.480 --> 25:46.480
And he still, like, sold it or whatever.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.000
Just like, yeah, you're gonna love it.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.480
Here it is.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.560
It's so realistic.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.400
Here it is.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.600
Grasshopper free.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.920
This painting's called something different.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.400
Oh, you're not going with the same Olive Fields naming commission?

26:02.400 --> 26:06.320
No, this one's called Trapped Idiot.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.600
Take that, fucker.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.080
It's called Take That, Fucker.

26:10.080 --> 26:10.640
Yeah.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.280
Yeah.

26:11.280 --> 26:11.920
Now, Griffin...

26:11.920 --> 26:12.880
It looks delicious.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.320
Was it called Olive Fields?

26:14.320 --> 26:17.200
Or are you just very carefully not calling it his Olive Garden period?

26:19.680 --> 26:20.400
Yeah, that's not...

26:20.960 --> 26:22.080
What I said was wrong.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.520
Thank you for bringing it up, Travis.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.200
You could do a tortilla.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.360
You could do a Mona Lisa with beef and cheese.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.840
That's probably the most appealing way of eating it.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.560
And that's good because you could probably get a couple out of that.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.800
Don't eat the Mona Lisa by yourself.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.000
There's only one to eat.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.840
You should share it with everybody.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.120
Is Jackson Pollock still with us?

26:43.120 --> 26:48.240
Because if he is, you give that dude some fucking Subway squeeze bottles of

26:48.800 --> 26:50.160
nacho cheese and guacamole.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.440
He's a sandwich artist.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.920
Whoa, you could eat the Mona Lisa and a Jackson Pollock at the same time.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.600
That's amazing.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.240
Now, I think the perfect crime...

27:00.240 --> 27:02.000
Why wouldn't it be more valuable?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.520
That's just double art.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.560
No, Jackson Pollock painted another painting over that painting.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.320
It's like double art at that point.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.160
Hey, I heard you like paintings.

27:10.160 --> 27:14.080
Yeah, I think if you're going to eat the Mona Lisa...

27:14.080 --> 27:14.880
And I am.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.880
Yeah, we have a sandwich.

27:16.880 --> 27:22.160
You then have to claim it's stolen because they're never going to find it.

27:22.160 --> 27:27.440
And I guarantee it would take the world's greatest detective to suspect.

27:27.440 --> 27:31.840
I bet he ate it.

27:31.840 --> 27:39.440
I thought you were going to say the world's greatest art restorer who would look at your...

27:39.440 --> 27:40.800
Give me a couple days.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.920
Well, this is it.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.960
My last job.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.760
I thought I was out.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.320
Give me that, Jimmy.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.680
I thought it was out.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.560
Let's do this.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.840
I think I see the nose.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.840
I'm going in.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.960
It's impossible.

27:54.960 --> 27:55.600
Not for me.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.760
Not for me, a patient pervert.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.840
What if Dr. Alan Grant had been digging in that big pile of dinosaur poop in Jurassic Park

28:03.840 --> 28:05.840
and he's been like, reach?

28:05.840 --> 28:08.080
Oh, God, the Mona Lisa.

28:09.920 --> 28:10.480
I'm sorry.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.920
Here is another question that I have for you, my brothers, on the iPad.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.680
That same one that I use for Munch Squad.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.400
And you might think, does he have difficulty getting back to the original

28:20.400 --> 28:21.840
app with the questions list on it?

28:21.840 --> 28:23.200
Does he ever have to vamp to cover it?

28:23.200 --> 28:27.360
And the answer is no.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.720
My fiance and I are...

28:28.720 --> 28:29.200
No, what?

28:30.000 --> 28:30.800
Okay.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.360
You sure?

28:31.360 --> 28:31.920
Yeah.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.480
Which one?

28:32.480 --> 28:33.840
No, do it because you already started it.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.640
Well, no, I don't have...

28:34.640 --> 28:35.040
Okay.

28:35.040 --> 28:35.920
Hey, everybody.

28:35.920 --> 28:36.800
Give us a second.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.440
Give us a second.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.440
My fiance and I are getting married on 420.

28:41.440 --> 28:41.940
Yeah!

28:44.480 --> 28:47.360
The debate was whether or not Griffin had earned this question.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.120
I've been real good.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.800
My fiance and I are getting married on 420.

28:50.800 --> 28:51.280
Yeah!

28:54.800 --> 28:55.600
All right.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.680
Whee day!

28:57.680 --> 28:58.720
Woo!

28:58.720 --> 28:59.520
My fiance...

28:59.520 --> 29:01.040
Yeah!

29:01.040 --> 29:03.920
My fiance and I are getting married on April 20th.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.960
But there's a problem.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.880
We don't partake in...

29:07.440 --> 29:08.640
It says here, magic cigarettes.

29:10.400 --> 29:15.600
How can we embrace this dankest of days by inserting subtle nods to that...

29:15.600 --> 29:20.720
Dope herb and help our guests ride high on the magic dragon?

29:20.720 --> 29:22.080
You've ruined 420.

29:24.080 --> 29:27.200
P.S. It says, I had to look up most of these euphemisms.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.040
I never would have guessed.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.560
It was so organic.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.600
That's from going green for our wedding in Chicago.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.160
Are you here?

29:35.360 --> 29:35.840
Okay.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.240
All right.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.200
That's eight people.

29:37.840 --> 29:38.340
Okay.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.120
I just need one person to answer and I need...

29:41.120 --> 29:44.160
I need them to say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.320
I need them to say, I am here.

29:47.360 --> 29:47.600
Okay.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.160
Perfect.

29:48.160 --> 29:48.720
All right.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.120
That was a really good Seussical kind of moment.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.000
That was very nice.

29:53.280 --> 29:59.600
What I need you to do for me is to yell out another name for marijuana that you know.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.000
The first...

30:00.720 --> 30:01.120
Quiet.

30:02.000 --> 30:02.240
Go.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.120
Weed.

30:05.120 --> 30:05.680
Weed.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.400
Yeah, that actually works.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.600
You're a narc!

30:07.600 --> 30:08.320
Get out of here!

30:08.320 --> 30:10.400
Get this narc out of here.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.040
Okay.

30:11.040 --> 30:15.760
Here's my question and you don't have to answer because we'll make jokes about it

30:15.760 --> 30:16.480
one way or the other.

30:18.240 --> 30:22.640
Did you accidentally plan your wedding for 420 or did like...

30:23.600 --> 30:28.480
Was it like, well, it's not weed, but maybe it is weed and like you stole it from somebody

30:28.480 --> 30:29.040
because that's the thing.

30:29.040 --> 30:33.600
There's probably somebody who's like, oh, I really want that venue for 420 because I love weed.

30:33.600 --> 30:37.280
You're keeping that venue from someone that was going to go hard on a weed wedding.

30:37.280 --> 30:37.760
Yeah.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.520
It was going to be like weed themed.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.120
I'm sorry.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.080
Was it your anniversary?

30:43.280 --> 30:43.600
Nice.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.960
Are you sure this is not a very important day for you?

30:48.960 --> 30:49.760
Because that's the thing.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.600
You will have to spend like the rest of your lives together married.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.880
Like when people are like, when are you marrying?

30:54.880 --> 30:57.840
You'll say 420 and even like the most boring...

30:57.840 --> 30:58.240
No, no, no.

30:58.240 --> 30:58.640
Stop.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.280
Stop.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.960
You won't say 420.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.080
Okay.

31:02.080 --> 31:05.120
That would be a wild response to what he's married.

31:05.120 --> 31:10.320
But even the most boring government employee will be like...

31:10.320 --> 31:11.920
And you'll have to say like, no.

31:12.960 --> 31:18.080
I think that even if you do not partake and you shouldn't feel pressured to, one of the...

31:18.080 --> 31:19.200
Is it legal here, by the way?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.360
We need to start finding that out before we go to...

31:21.360 --> 31:21.600
No.

31:21.600 --> 31:22.080
No.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.560
Then it's not okay.

31:25.440 --> 31:25.680
Paul.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.440
And I am against it.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.320
Paul, burn it.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.320
Paul, start flushing.

31:30.320 --> 31:30.720
Flush it.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.680
Toilet time, Paul.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.000
Flush it.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.200
I know we had established that if I yelled that you toilet time from the stage,

31:37.200 --> 31:39.360
it meant one thing, but it means something different.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.600
It's like double entendre.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.240
Even if you don't partake and you shouldn't feel pressured to,

31:45.120 --> 31:45.600
one of the...

31:46.160 --> 31:47.760
There are two great things about your wedding.

31:47.760 --> 31:51.120
And one is that it's a special day you'll remember for the rest of your life.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.160
It's a beautiful moment where two souls become one.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.400
And there's cool tax stuff that happens.

31:58.400 --> 32:03.520
But the best next thing is that you get to remember

32:04.800 --> 32:07.760
which of your friends got too fucked up at your wedding forever.

32:08.560 --> 32:08.960
It's a wonderful gift.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.680
Because I've got it.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.840
I've got that list in my mind right now.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.080
And they know, and we know, and everybody knows.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.120
I feel like at a 420 wedding, it's just like you're gonna have a whole...

32:17.840 --> 32:21.280
A whole table of people who just disappear for a while in the corner

32:21.280 --> 32:24.640
and watch fucking Happy Gilmore on one of their phones.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.600
And it's like, yeah, having a good time, guys?

32:27.600 --> 32:30.320
Well, Jim, if you think about it, it's way better.

32:30.320 --> 32:34.000
Wouldn't you rather have that than you got too drunk and you got in a fight?

32:34.000 --> 32:37.600
Like, I'd much rather have, like, no, there was no leftover cake because of Bob.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.880
That's a way better experience to have.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.120
Yeah, it turned out we didn't have to take any leftovers home.

32:43.120 --> 32:48.080
Probably the best thing you can do is don't go hard on the weed stuff.

32:48.080 --> 32:53.280
But do tell the person officiating the wedding that you are gonna go hard on the weed stuff.

32:53.280 --> 32:58.560
Because I want them to have a lot of, like, just like the buds emerge from the plant.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.000
As the seeds combine to make one...

33:03.040 --> 33:04.640
I've written here raunchy joint.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.360
I don't know what that is.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.440
So shall your love be dank.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.040
Your love, too, should be dank.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.320
I hope, yeah, so if the...

33:10.320 --> 33:13.040
Be kind to one another.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.080
If you know what I mean.

33:14.080 --> 33:14.880
Be like we...

33:17.360 --> 33:18.160
Oh, that's good, too.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.840
You can put, like, BYOB and BYOW with, like, a question mark.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.920
And, like, if they're cool, they'll know.

33:24.960 --> 33:28.640
Yeah, that's a really indecipherable code there, Dan Brown.

33:30.080 --> 33:35.600
I feel like you should, instead of the usual entrance music, the, you know, the...

33:37.360 --> 33:37.840
Fuck.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.360
Nope, that's the graduation one.

33:39.360 --> 33:39.860
Uh-oh.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.240
Do you mean the wedding march?

33:42.240 --> 33:42.740
Yeah.

33:45.040 --> 33:45.540
Anyway.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.520
420.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.600
I feel like you should make your entrance music police sirens.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.240
But quiet.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.000
So good.

33:56.000 --> 33:56.720
So good.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.360
Okay, wait.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.720
Continue on.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.080
Your dessert table?

34:00.080 --> 34:01.200
Brownies.

34:01.200 --> 34:01.920
But regular.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.720
But don't say that.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.680
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

34:09.680 --> 34:10.480
I'd love that, Griffin.

34:10.480 --> 34:11.360
Thank you so much.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.600
Uh, this one was sent in by Level 9000.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.520
YaDruDru at Drew Davenport.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.240
Thank you, Drew.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.280
It's an anonymous user, so I'm gonna call him YaDru.

34:21.280 --> 34:25.440
YaDru answers user Jerry, because there's an ad at the top of the screen with a guy

34:25.440 --> 34:26.320
named Jerry on it.

34:26.320 --> 34:26.800
Thank you.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.640
Not Jerry Seinfeld.

34:28.640 --> 34:29.200
The other one.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.040
Jerry asks, stiller.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.360
Jerry asks, soldiers in the Troy horse.

34:40.480 --> 34:41.520
I have been wondering.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.360
It's called a thing.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.720
Like, it's not called the Troy horse.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, the Trojan horse.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.520
It has a name.

34:49.520 --> 34:54.960
Anyway, I have been wondering, what if the soldiers in the Troy horse needed the washroom?

34:56.720 --> 35:00.480
This sounds like a pretty ridiculous question, but I am really curious about this.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.080
You could read that in a really kind of gross, like, I am

35:07.200 --> 35:08.960
really curious about this.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.480
They were hiding inside of the wooden horse for a whole day.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.480
Did they pee and drink and eat inside?

35:15.040 --> 35:16.400
Love, Jerry Stiller.

35:16.400 --> 35:21.760
Do you think, like, they all got in the horse, and they're like, okay, so now we gotta be here.

35:21.760 --> 35:22.800
Oh, man.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.320
Oh, no.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.760
Everybody used the bathroom before.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.320
Nobody used the bathroom before?

35:28.320 --> 35:31.920
I told, I said, but I didn't have to go then.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.600
Front left leg is the toilet.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.920
That's the first thing we're deciding.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.080
Front left leg is where everybody goes to the toilet.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.400
We're putting the foosball table in the rear right leg.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.800
So front left is the toilet.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.120
So front left is the toilet.

35:45.920 --> 35:50.080
And then the Troy horse, which is now what I'm going to call it, rolls up.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.240
It was wood.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.200
You know it wasn't Ziploc fresh, keeping all that.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.240
No way.

35:56.240 --> 35:56.720
No way.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.960
Can we let this big, stinky ass horse in?

35:58.960 --> 36:00.800
This horse stinks like piss.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.640
And also, I hear voices murmuring inside talking about, like, oh, no.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.960
Dylan used the front right leg.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.200
That was the sandwich leg.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.320
That's the sandwich leg.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.520
Good going, Dylan.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.800
You butthole.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.360
Oh, no.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.400
They hear us.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.600
Stab, stab, stab, stab.

36:15.600 --> 36:20.720
Could you make, speaking of buttholes, could you give the horse a butthole?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.000
That's a working out house.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.680
It's a modern model.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.080
I have a great horse for you.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.040
Check it out.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.160
It really poops.

36:29.040 --> 36:29.540
Whoa.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.160
Get that thing in here.

36:32.160 --> 36:39.200
Well, I mean, even without the real shit tech, why did they see this big horse room?

36:39.200 --> 36:40.560
Like, fuck, yeah.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.640
I've got to have that big horse.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.800
How often do you get the chance?

36:44.800 --> 36:47.360
It's like, listen, I know we have nowhere to put it.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.680
But how often do you see a giant horse?

36:49.680 --> 36:50.880
I know.

36:50.880 --> 36:55.840
If you got beat in that fight, you know, between the two people is between?

36:56.720 --> 36:57.520
If you got beat in the-

36:57.520 --> 36:59.520
Probably one of them, Troy.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.960
Probably some, like, Troy or the Trojans or whatever.

37:03.520 --> 37:09.920
If you got beat by the dudes in the horse, you got beat by, like, 100 guys

37:09.920 --> 37:14.000
that had been awake for 24 hours and shitting in a wooden horse's leg

37:14.000 --> 37:16.560
and marinating in their friend Jerry's farts.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.800
And then they got out and beat you in a sword fight?

37:21.760 --> 37:23.600
You were alerted to their presence, like, creak.

37:24.400 --> 37:24.640
Yeah.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.280
Oh, god.

37:25.280 --> 37:30.960
The fucking hatch on that open and just, like, the 100 of the most exhausted human beings.

37:30.960 --> 37:36.560
Just, like, 100 David Blaine post stunts should be, like, barely dragging their way out.

37:36.560 --> 37:44.560
Now, do you, speaking of the Troy hearse, do you think the cat who made it got to a point

37:44.560 --> 37:49.680
where he was, like, I could make this better, but it's a trick?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.120
I could make this look more like a horse, but it's just-

37:55.120 --> 37:58.880
How good does it gotta be before it's just a giant wood horse?

37:58.880 --> 37:59.200
Yeah.

37:59.200 --> 38:05.280
Speaking of this, building on this, if you had the people and the resources to do this,

38:06.000 --> 38:11.440
do you think that that guy maybe suggested, like, do you maybe want me to make you some weapons?

38:12.320 --> 38:14.320
I could just build you a ladder.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.840
I could build you a ladder.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.800
Just a big ladder.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.240
A cool staircase that you could use.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.520
You could shit wherever you like, up in the dark.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.040
You go up with a ladder.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.720
I could spend the next month making you wooden guns.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.000
What do you want?

38:30.000 --> 38:30.800
What do you want?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.160
Are you sure you want to do this?

38:32.160 --> 38:33.280
No, no, trust me.

38:33.280 --> 38:33.920
No, no, no.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.720
A horse.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.280
A toilet horse.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.040
I need, I need this.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.600
This is important to me.

38:41.600 --> 38:46.640
That is the thing that, like, the Troy horse is always referenced as, like, amazing, like,

38:46.640 --> 38:47.200
strategy.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.840
The people who let it in were just shitty at that.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.200
It wasn't a good plan.

38:51.200 --> 38:55.120
Yeah, that should be- that's because it was the first trap ever.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.120
It was the first ever trick.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.600
No one had ever tricked anybody before.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.000
Because, like, we didn't have the term Trojan horse.

39:02.000 --> 39:02.480
Yeah.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.280
So it's like-

39:03.280 --> 39:04.480
That's a big, good horse.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.400
They'd always wondered why it was called that.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.720
And then they're like, oh, okay, I get it.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.680
Because of this.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.720
Because of this with the trick with the guys who smelled like farts.

39:12.720 --> 39:26.080
Trap, I want to tell you all about- oh, hey, welcome to Money Zone.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.560
Trap, I want to tell you about movement watches.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.360
Okay.

39:29.360 --> 39:35.360
It's MVMT, but it's pronounced movement because it's hip and it's now and it's fashionable.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.680
And they couldn't afford vowels.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.360
The vowels are expensive.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.720
It's 2018.

39:40.720 --> 39:44.000
In 2019, it's probably just going to be MVT.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.440
I always wanted to see that on Wheel of Fortune when they're like, can I buy a vowel?

39:47.440 --> 39:48.960
And it's like, you can just have a vowel.

39:48.960 --> 39:49.680
Letters are free.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.440
Letters are free.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.440
Bust up the big banks.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.520
This is the call to arms.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.600
Anyway, I have a movement watch.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.920
I actually have a couple of them and they are so choice, so fashion forward.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.680
Love the way they look on my wrist.

40:04.560 --> 40:10.640
They got a nice, big, sort of proud, noble face on them that I get a lot of compliments

40:10.640 --> 40:12.320
on every time I wear my movement watch.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.040
I love it.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.760
And they start at just 95 bucks.

40:15.760 --> 40:20.560
And at a department store, you're looking at like 400 or 500 bucks to get a nice watch.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.600
But movement watches comes in so much under that.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.680
And by selling online, movement cuts out the middleman and retail markup and it provides

40:27.680 --> 40:29.120
you with the best possible price.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.400
They got over 1 million watches sold in over 160 countries.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
That's 160 million.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.440
No, I don't know if that that's not what that means.

40:37.440 --> 40:42.480
Anyway, you can get 15% off today and get free shipping and with free returns by going

40:42.480 --> 40:44.720
to movement.com slash brother.

40:44.720 --> 40:45.360
My brain.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.360
Yeah, I wasn't going to say anything.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.960
That's MVMT.com slash brother.

40:50.960 --> 40:56.080
It hurts to make thoughts, but the watch has a really clean design.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.120
It's seriously I've been getting compliments on it.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.680
And this is the best time to step up your watch game.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.480
This is the best time to step up your watch game.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.920
And you know what time it is because of the watch you'll know.

41:07.920 --> 41:08.800
Yeah, we got it.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.120
Yeah.

41:09.120 --> 41:16.080
OK, I also want to tell you all about MVMT.com slash brother and join the movement.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.160
Now break up the big banks.

41:18.160 --> 41:23.920
OK, so we've talked a lot about me on these in the past and I realized that we did we.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.520
Yes, it's a new year.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.480
Listen, it's a new year.

41:26.480 --> 41:29.040
And a lot of people when they think new year, they think new you.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.960
And they're like going through this laundry list of like, I'm going to do this for myself

41:32.960 --> 41:33.280
this year.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.640
Let me tell you something.

41:34.640 --> 41:40.000
You might not think about it, but I can't even begin to tell you the importance of investing

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
in some new underpinnings for yourself.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.040
Yeah.

41:43.040 --> 41:43.920
You know what I mean?

41:43.920 --> 41:45.200
Yeah, for your pizzeria.

41:45.200 --> 41:49.520
Well, because you got to think about it like it's like the foundation of your whole look,

41:49.520 --> 41:54.320
your whole external presentation of your outfit.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.680
You know, it's good.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.920
It feels good to put on fresh underpants.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.280
Got to bag it up.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.720
Got to bag it up.

42:00.720 --> 42:04.800
And listen, me on these is three times softer than cotton because it comes from sustainably

42:04.800 --> 42:05.040
sourced.

42:05.040 --> 42:05.680
Fuck cotton though.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.160
Fuck it.

42:06.160 --> 42:06.480
OK.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.280
Man, why?

42:09.200 --> 42:13.680
And with a subscription plan, you get new on these are socks delivered to your door

42:14.320 --> 42:16.400
and it's easy to switch memberships, cancel.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.200
What if I don't have what if I don't have a door because I live on a big boat?

42:19.200 --> 42:20.000
Oh, my goodness.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.400
It'll get delivered to your boat by underwear dolphins.

42:22.400 --> 42:22.640
Duh.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.400
Come on, Griffin.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.360

43:02.480 --> 43:04.000
It's a it's a stealth boat.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.600
I want to tell you one more.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.520
I want to tell you about Bull and Branch.

43:07.520 --> 43:07.920
Listen.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.720
Well, they they've said here the copy.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.880
You'll go to bed 365 times a year.

43:12.880 --> 43:18.000
That is probably statistically true, but I know I got some fellow insomniacs out there

43:18.000 --> 43:20.400
who that might not be inherently true.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.160
Yeah, our party animals like me.

43:22.160 --> 43:25.280
OK, you will go to bed at least once this year.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.400
And when you do, you sleep for 41 days.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.680
You will get ready for the rest of the party.

43:31.680 --> 43:35.600
You deserve to have your best night's sleep every night that you sleep on a brand new

43:35.600 --> 43:39.040
set of Bull and Branch sheets dedicated to making the most comfortable sheets in the

43:39.040 --> 43:39.440
world.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.040
And I can vouch for that.

43:41.040 --> 43:46.960
We have a couple sets of Bull and Branch sheets now and I got their Bull and Branch bath sheets.

43:46.960 --> 43:52.080
There's like a bath towel, but much larger and able to like wrap around my entire body

43:52.080 --> 43:52.960
It's so great.

43:52.960 --> 43:53.680
It's real nice.

43:53.680 --> 43:57.520
As you know, three U.S. presidents are sleeping better than ever on Bull and Branch and I

43:57.520 --> 43:58.800
hope it's the good ones.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.160
I say it's the good ones.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.760
The alternate reality ones.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.960
Try them yourself.

44:02.960 --> 44:03.600
Risk free.

44:03.600 --> 44:03.920
Wow.

44:04.880 --> 44:08.000

Got a couple Jumbotrons here.

44:26.480 --> 44:33.120
This one is for Katie and Dave and it's from Rodney who says, hold on.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.440
Zoom in the font.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.240
It's again, just the eyes.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.320
The eyes are sick also.

44:40.320 --> 44:40.880
Hi, Katie.

44:40.880 --> 44:41.760
Happy birthday.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.240
Maybe.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.040
Thank you for putting these three dorks into my life.

44:45.040 --> 44:48.960
Thanks so much for being a good, good friend for these like five or six years.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.600
I can't wait for the message you send after you hear this.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.640
Thank you, Dave, for bringing the three of us together.

44:54.640 --> 44:55.840
Thanks, Trashcan.

44:55.840 --> 44:56.960
I love you all.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.280
Since there is room, Teenage Mutant Ninja.

45:00.080 --> 45:00.960
No, read it.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.640
Tootin' Mean-Age Needle-Teedles.

45:04.640 --> 45:05.840
That's what it says.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.000
I like that.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.800
That's not my brain doing a bad job of it.

45:12.160 --> 45:17.120
Yeah, nothing else to say about that one except Tootin' Mean-Age Needle-Teedles.

45:17.120 --> 45:20.000
Tootin' Mean-Age Needle-Teedles.

45:20.720 --> 45:21.600
Tootin' Paddle.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.560
This next one is for Jamie and Brandon.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.000
It's from Tommy.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.160
Jamie, if you hear this, you are morally, if not legally obligated to watch the Entourage movie.

45:32.160 --> 45:32.960
Oh, no.

45:32.960 --> 45:33.440
I'm so-

45:34.800 --> 45:35.440
Listen, Jamie-

45:35.440 --> 45:36.080
That checks out.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.200
Legally, law, it works.

45:37.200 --> 45:37.920
It's true.

45:37.920 --> 45:38.800
Jamie, I'm sorry about that.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.960
But watch it, understanding that the Entourage movie is unstuck in time.

45:42.960 --> 45:43.200
Yeah.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.320
You can read all about it on the internet.

45:46.320 --> 45:51.040
Brandon, play this for Jamie and record his reaction, and I'll give you back your copy of Gex.

45:51.600 --> 45:52.320
Damn.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.360
You're both great friends, but these are my terms.

45:56.880 --> 46:00.160
Forgive the Good Brothers, for they know not the hell they have wrought.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.400
I am mad with power and growing stronger.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.160
All right.

46:04.160 --> 46:04.960
Okay, cool.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.240
Good use of Jumbotron.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.840
Sort of a demon, maybe.

46:07.840 --> 46:08.640
Okay.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.520
Some sort of demon with a captive Gex situation.

46:11.520 --> 46:15.120
Before we hop back into the episode, I wanted to plug just a couple things.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.480
One, and this is-

46:16.480 --> 46:17.520
Can I lie down?

46:17.520 --> 46:18.000
Yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.640
This is super timely, because you only have a couple days on this one.

46:20.640 --> 46:29.840
But me and Teresa are going to be at San Francisco Sketch Fest, Sunday the 14th, doing a Schmanners at 1pm Pacific time.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.280
And you can still get tickets to that.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.920

46:34.640 --> 46:43.920

46:43.920 --> 46:45.440
So you can come see those as well.

46:45.440 --> 46:49.040

46:56.720 --> 46:59.520
I just did an episode of Good Christian Fun.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.800
You did a great job on that.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.520
Thank you.

47:01.520 --> 47:02.800
It was super wonderful.

47:02.800 --> 47:05.120
I'm now listening to every episode.

47:05.120 --> 47:07.520
I'm a big fan, and everybody should check it out.

47:07.520 --> 47:14.160
I also just did a video with Gabbie Dunn on Gabbie's YouTube channel.

47:14.160 --> 47:18.960
I also just did an episode of Can I Pet Your Dog that just came out.

47:18.960 --> 47:22.400
And I think coming out later this week is an episode of Bunker Buddies.

47:22.400 --> 47:23.680
I was very busy this week.

47:23.680 --> 47:24.400
Yeah, I'll say.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.080
All right, that's it.

47:26.080 --> 47:26.880
Enjoy the rest of the episode.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.720
Thanks, Max Fun, for having us on the network.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.720
And thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters, which I think we do in the episode.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.240
But I still really mean it.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.080
But that's it.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.600
Yes, you can go back to bed now.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.480
I love you.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.200
I love you, too.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.200
I was talking to Justin.

47:41.200 --> 47:41.760
Oh, okay.

47:43.520 --> 47:44.880
He's here with me in the room.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.040
Good joke, Justin.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.720
Ooh, stinky fart.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.440
I like how you did one.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.000
Bye.

Bye.

48:27.600 --> 48:28.720
My name is Brad.

48:28.720 --> 48:29.280
Hi, Brad.

48:29.280 --> 48:29.780
Brad!

48:29.780 --> 48:30.280
Brad!

48:31.620 --> 48:32.180
Let's do it.

48:35.060 --> 48:36.580
So I work with...

48:36.580 --> 48:39.300
Okay, so it was a Borat impression and that's not your regular voice.

48:39.860 --> 48:42.180
So when I said Brad, it was like, he's doing a Borat impression,

48:42.180 --> 48:45.140
but then I was like, what if that's his regular voice and I kind of bailed?

48:45.140 --> 48:46.900
But now that I know it's a Borat impression...

48:47.780 --> 48:48.260
Go on.

48:48.260 --> 48:48.900
Go on, Brad.

48:48.900 --> 48:49.400
Sorry.

48:49.860 --> 48:51.940
So I work with high school kids.

48:51.940 --> 48:52.580
Okay.

48:52.580 --> 48:53.380
Marching band.

48:53.380 --> 48:54.500
So you know they freaks.

48:55.300 --> 48:56.260
Yeah, they're nasty.

48:56.260 --> 49:01.700
So the biggest problem I have with them is they have this tendency that they just don't stop dabbing.

49:01.700 --> 49:02.200
Mm-hmm.

49:03.940 --> 49:05.860
Wait, is that real, Brad?

49:05.860 --> 49:06.360
Brad.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.420
No, no, no, no, no, no, it's real, it's real, it's real.

49:08.420 --> 49:12.020
Also, it's not really a problem, but go ahead.

49:13.220 --> 49:13.940
No, it is.

49:13.940 --> 49:16.020
It's just constant dabbing.

49:16.020 --> 49:17.860
While they're trying to play instruments?

49:17.860 --> 49:21.620
They disrupt the rehearsal and they want the instructors to dab.

49:21.620 --> 49:24.180
They caught me dabbing, I'm sorry to say.

49:24.180 --> 49:29.140
I just need to know, what can I give them instead of dabbing, or how do I make the dabbing stop?

49:30.260 --> 49:34.260
What can I give them other than dabbing is like, how do I introduce the next thing?

49:34.260 --> 49:36.580
And maybe it's working really hard to be good at instruments.

49:38.340 --> 49:41.780
We tried that, so they're sort of into that, you know?

49:41.780 --> 49:42.500
That's good.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.300
I tried the knee dab, which is this.

49:46.100 --> 49:47.380
That's not better.

49:47.380 --> 49:48.580
I enjoyed it.

49:48.580 --> 49:52.020
But I think what Travis said, there's some heat there, where it's like,

49:52.020 --> 49:57.540
hey everybody, I'm Griffin, this is my new viral video, and all the teams are going to get really into it.

49:57.540 --> 50:00.500
This is the new thing, it's called, practicing your scales.

50:03.540 --> 50:08.500
Have you ever thought about, and listen, Brad, I instantly respect you and what you do.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.020
Except for the Borat impression.

50:10.020 --> 50:11.700
No, and you did the dab, you did.

50:12.660 --> 50:15.780
Have you ever thought about like, looking around the room and asking them like,

50:15.780 --> 50:18.260
how many of you are going to do this after this?

50:18.260 --> 50:24.580
How many of you are going to do this after this, and like, those people you encourage to rehearse or practice or whatever,

50:24.580 --> 50:26.580
and the other one's just like, dab away.

50:28.180 --> 50:30.100
Just like in Mr. Holland's opus.

50:31.220 --> 50:36.260
That would be way more, I played the trombone in middle school, and all I did was just like,

50:36.260 --> 50:43.060
hum through the trombone, never actually learned to play the trombone, and just convinced my parents like,

50:43.060 --> 50:46.500
just sign this, I'm not going to practice, and they're like, we don't want you to fail.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.140
You hear that, dad?

50:49.140 --> 50:51.700
Take that, dad.

50:51.700 --> 50:53.700
You're on blast, Clint.

50:53.700 --> 50:57.060
Um, oh man.

50:57.060 --> 50:58.500
Do you have any like, ringers?

50:58.500 --> 51:05.300
There's probably some instruments that have long enough rests in the sheet music where they could get some good dabs in there.

51:05.300 --> 51:06.340
And if that's the case,

51:06.340 --> 51:06.900
Gong.

51:06.900 --> 51:07.940
The gong, yes.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.700
Gong is the one, it's the right at the end.

51:09.700 --> 51:10.820
Super dab.

51:10.820 --> 51:17.060
Because if that's the thing, I see a way for you to really stand out during the competition.

51:17.060 --> 51:17.620
Yes.

51:17.620 --> 51:21.060
Does that help?

51:21.060 --> 51:23.060
It helps.

51:23.060 --> 51:24.100
Thank you, Brad.

51:24.100 --> 51:30.180
Hi there, okay, so I know you guys are from the great state of West Virginia.

51:30.180 --> 51:30.900
Hell yeah.

51:30.900 --> 51:32.900
So you're probably-

51:32.900 --> 51:34.900
You know, Abraham Lincoln made West Virginia a state.

51:34.900 --> 51:40.420
So you're probably pretty familiar with the urban legend of the Mothman?

51:40.420 --> 51:43.220
Yeah.

51:43.220 --> 51:45.060
Okay, I think some people know where this is going.

51:45.060 --> 51:55.300
So over the past couple of months, Chicago has been having this thing where people have been reporting sightings of a seven foot tall winged creature with red eyes.

51:55.300 --> 51:58.500
Fucking followed us here.

51:58.500 --> 51:59.300
That fucking asshole.

51:59.300 --> 52:00.580
Mothman, are you here?

52:00.580 --> 52:03.860
He wanted to go to the Jimmy Buffett show with you guys.

52:03.860 --> 52:06.660
Paul, Paul, I'm gonna need another drink.

52:06.660 --> 52:11.060
The Mothman's in Illinois.

52:11.060 --> 52:14.260
That was extremely fast.

52:14.260 --> 52:18.660
Paul heard Mothman, I was like, they're gonna need this.

52:18.660 --> 52:25.460
So it's even been on like the cover of the Chicago Reader and there's a lady who came and confessed that she summoned it through a-

52:25.460 --> 52:27.300
That's not how Mothman works.

52:27.300 --> 52:28.660
It's not.

52:28.660 --> 52:32.420
So my question to you is, do you think that maybe it is?

52:32.420 --> 52:34.340
And if so, what should we do as a city?

52:34.340 --> 52:35.860
Stay off bridges.

52:35.860 --> 52:39.060
That's ghoulish.

52:39.060 --> 52:42.260
It's that dude's whole line of business.

52:42.260 --> 52:44.340
He's a bridge warner.

52:44.340 --> 52:46.420
That is true.

52:46.420 --> 52:47.220
Hold on, wait.

52:47.220 --> 52:49.460
I think we're gonna go with the Mothman one this time.

52:49.460 --> 52:51.860
Thank you so much.

52:51.860 --> 52:52.500
Thank you.

52:52.500 --> 52:53.220
Thank you very much.

52:53.220 --> 53:02.740
Somebody did ask me, I can't remember who I was having the conversation with, and they're like, hey, so we were talking about like, Crypto Zoology and like, Local Legends, and they're like, and what's the Mothman's deal?

53:02.740 --> 53:07.140
And I'm like, well, some people saw him, and then a bridge collapsed.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.980
And then they made a movie.

53:08.980 --> 53:10.260
It goes way deeper.

53:10.260 --> 53:13.220
So has Enric Cole been spotted anywhere?

53:13.220 --> 53:14.180
Oh, yeah.

53:14.180 --> 53:14.660
No?

53:14.660 --> 53:15.140
No.

53:15.140 --> 53:16.100
Okay.

53:16.100 --> 53:20.580
So we're probably okay from a safety perspective, because if Cole's not chasing the Moth-

53:20.580 --> 53:21.460
You know Cole?

53:21.460 --> 53:25.780
Cole was the one who arrived before the Mothman.

53:25.780 --> 53:27.700
Wait, there was a pre-Moth?

53:27.700 --> 53:33.220
If you don't know, the Mothman rolls up, and he's like, oh, the bridge, the bridge, and then the bridge collapses. That's the Mothman's whole deal.

53:33.220 --> 53:35.860
He doesn't fly around or shoot spores all over.

53:35.860 --> 53:39.220
But to have a pre-Mothman, it's like, uh-oh, the Mothman's gonna come.

53:39.220 --> 53:44.660
But a guy named Enric Cole showed up before, like, hunting the Mothman.

53:44.660 --> 53:49.460
So he was like, so the Mothman's like an intergalactic convict who's escaped from space.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.660
This is real.

53:50.660 --> 53:52.100
This is 100%.

53:52.100 --> 53:53.060
Well, I mean, it's not like-

53:53.060 --> 53:53.860
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

53:53.860 --> 53:56.580
It's not real.

53:56.580 --> 54:00.660
I'm just telling you, like, don't get it twisted. It's not, like, real.

54:00.660 --> 54:04.580
Just West Virginia has, like, one crypto dude.

54:04.580 --> 54:06.820
Can we just keep him? Just the one?

54:06.820 --> 54:12.420
And he's not even that good. He doesn't shoot spores out of his wings to put Pokemon to sleep or whatever.

54:12.420 --> 54:16.020
Like all he does, he warns you about faulty infrastructure.

54:16.020 --> 54:19.780
Oh, there's a pothole that's gonna fuck up your Jetta.

54:19.780 --> 54:20.980
Thanks, Mothman.

54:20.980 --> 54:24.580
Can we get the chupacabra in here to at least, like, kill a goat or something?

54:24.580 --> 54:29.380
You know, like, 50 people died, right? It wasn't, like, a pothole. It was, like, a whole bridge collapse.

54:29.380 --> 54:30.340
It was a tragedy.

54:30.340 --> 54:32.180
So he did that one. He's like, I'm done.

54:32.180 --> 54:34.340
He didn't even do it. He didn't even do it.

54:34.340 --> 54:36.820
He was just walking back going, I don't know about that bridge.

54:36.820 --> 54:46.020
No, okay. If you're saying that the Mothman should have conducted a more thorough, effective advertising campaign about the dangers of the silver bridge, yes, I agree.

54:46.020 --> 54:47.860
The Mothman was not very effective as a harbinger of-

54:47.860 --> 54:50.980
The city hall recognizes the giant Mothman.

54:50.980 --> 54:51.940
Thank you so much.

54:51.940 --> 54:52.340
Thank you.

54:52.340 --> 54:54.980
He was just walking by that bridge. It does not look safe.

54:54.980 --> 54:58.980
Uh, actually, let me back up, because Neil Carnegie says I should use praise first.

54:58.980 --> 55:02.420
Debbie, the harvest festival this year was fucking kick-ass.

55:02.420 --> 55:04.180
Anyway-

55:04.180 --> 55:07.060
I want to put my engineering degree to good use.

55:07.060 --> 55:07.780
Finally.

55:07.780 --> 55:10.900
Um, Kit, please don't steal our Mothman.

55:10.900 --> 55:12.420
It might be another Mothman.

55:12.420 --> 55:13.380
Could-

55:13.380 --> 55:14.340
There's one in Iowa.

55:14.340 --> 55:16.100
There's one in Iowa. That's what I'm saying.

55:16.100 --> 55:16.900
There's not.

55:16.900 --> 55:17.780
It's Iowa.

55:17.780 --> 55:23.620
I don't- like, fucking Art Bell is not going to walk out on stage and be like, it's true, there are.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.860
Um, there's not.

55:25.860 --> 55:33.300
But do you think West Virginia Mothman, like, sees in, like, he gets the Chicago paper, and he opens it, and he's like, that's not me.

55:33.300 --> 55:43.540
This is the problem, though. We're all playing Calvin Ball with cryptozoology. If you start saying that the Mothman's in Illinois, he will be, because, you know.

55:43.540 --> 55:45.220
So, like, let's just-

55:45.220 --> 55:46.740
Uh, because he's created by thought.

55:46.740 --> 55:48.100
You are absolutely correct, Justin.

55:48.100 --> 55:48.740
And belief in-

55:48.740 --> 55:52.660
As the Mothman is a manifestation, it's actually short for Mothmanifestation.

55:52.660 --> 55:58.500
As Neil Gaiman dictates in his book, American Gods, Kit, please don't steal our Man Moth.

55:58.500 --> 55:58.980
Thank you.

55:58.980 --> 56:00.340
No, Man Moth is a different one.

56:00.340 --> 56:03.700
Okay, you can have Man Moth.

56:03.700 --> 56:10.740
Alright, so, um, about a year ago, uh, my family got a, uh, parrot from a pet store.

56:10.740 --> 56:16.740
And it was, like, really fun, because, like, it's, like, a cool pet that I can, like, show my friends, like, we have a parrot. Um-

56:16.740 --> 56:18.900
As opposed to a shitty dog.

56:18.900 --> 56:19.860
Yeah, I mean-

56:19.860 --> 56:20.980
Ugh.

56:20.980 --> 56:25.540
Ew, I get it. I've seen dogs.

56:25.540 --> 56:28.900
Anyways, uh, boys, now we have seven parrots, and I don't know what to do.

56:28.900 --> 56:31.940
Wait, what?

56:31.940 --> 56:32.980
Hold on.

56:32.980 --> 56:37.860
Alright, alright, save it. Um, oh, good luck.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.220
I'm afraid to ask my question.

56:39.220 --> 56:44.020
No, you go ahead and hit us with this. Maybe you have eight parrots. Go on.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.540
We don't know. What's your name?

56:45.540 --> 56:46.820
Uh, my name is Benny.

56:46.820 --> 56:47.300
Hi, Benny.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.420
Like, the man of the Jets.

56:48.420 --> 56:48.900
Okay, cool.

56:48.900 --> 56:50.180
Fantastic.

56:50.180 --> 57:01.860
And my question is, I have been living with my partner for about a month now, and we have kind of a problem in that he will show me media, like, I've watched Death Note and Breaking Bad and a bunch of other anime-

57:01.860 --> 57:03.460
Anime or live action?

57:03.460 --> 57:04.740
Uh, the anime. The anime.

57:04.740 --> 57:05.300
Oh, okay.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.980
Oh, phew.

57:06.980 --> 57:08.260
I don't know. Is that good or bad?

57:08.260 --> 57:09.780
No, stop talking, Travis.

57:09.780 --> 57:11.140
Subs or dubs, go.

57:11.140 --> 57:13.220
Okay, so, alright.

57:13.220 --> 57:14.740
Send us the media.

57:14.740 --> 57:24.100
The problem is, is that he won't watch anything that I like. Like, I tried to get him to listen to a few podcasts. You might have heard of them, like The Adventure Zone and My Brother, My Brother and Me.

57:24.100 --> 57:24.900
Sure, sure, sure.

57:24.900 --> 57:29.460
And he just won't do it. How do I fix him?

57:29.460 --> 57:30.020
Okay.

57:30.020 --> 57:31.460
I actually, can we answer both of these?

57:31.460 --> 57:37.300
Play this. Play this clip of 3,000 people booing.

57:37.300 --> 57:40.020
I kind of want to answer both.

57:40.020 --> 57:42.340
I mean, that's against the spirit of the thing.

57:42.340 --> 57:44.020
Okay, can I answer this one real quick?

57:44.020 --> 57:44.500
Yeah.

57:44.500 --> 57:46.100
Okay, Benny, here's the thing.

57:46.100 --> 57:46.580
Yes, sir.

57:46.580 --> 57:53.300
You have to pick the right time to play a podcast for someone, because it's not just sitting around in your house, because there's a bunch of other better shit to do.

57:53.300 --> 57:53.940
That's true.

57:53.940 --> 57:59.700
It has to be in a car. That's the only time you can trick someone into listening to a podcast.

57:59.700 --> 58:04.980
They should, the tagline for podcast should be, podcast, when your hands are busy doing other things.

58:04.980 --> 58:11.380
Right, because there's literally, or your eyes too, is eyes, hands, but your ears are free.

58:11.380 --> 58:12.180
Podcast?

58:12.180 --> 58:12.500
Podcast.

58:12.500 --> 58:13.540
Like, that's it.

58:13.540 --> 58:16.260
Podcast. It's six hours to Phoenix, motherfucker.

58:16.260 --> 58:17.300
I guess things happen.

58:17.300 --> 58:25.700
Right. Because that's the thing. I love podcasting. I would rather play video games, watch TV, read a book.

58:25.700 --> 58:27.300
Anything is better than podcasts.

58:27.300 --> 58:29.380
Nap, anything.

58:29.380 --> 58:36.260
We are the mustard condiment that you put on the meat of the good thing you're actually excited about doing.

58:36.260 --> 58:36.900
Does that-

58:36.900 --> 58:39.220
So maybe watch our TV show.

58:39.220 --> 58:43.700
Yeah, the TV show's a good egg.

58:43.700 --> 58:45.220
VRV.CO.

58:45.220 --> 58:46.020
VRV.

58:46.020 --> 58:48.340
All six episodes streaming live.

58:48.340 --> 58:49.940
He actually really does like your TV show.

58:49.940 --> 58:51.860
Fuck yeah, he does. That's a good egg.

58:51.860 --> 58:53.300
Thank you, Benny. Thank you so much.

58:53.300 --> 58:54.180
Thank you, brothers.

58:54.180 --> 58:55.300
Seven parents?

58:55.300 --> 58:57.140
How did you get to seven?

58:57.140 --> 59:00.340
I mean, you said it like, I got one and then I sneezed and there were seven.

59:00.340 --> 59:04.900
You had to have gotten to six and been like, this is fucking ridiculous.

59:04.900 --> 59:08.340
Can I ask you, I want to ask you a serious question and I promise we'll let you answer.

59:08.340 --> 59:09.140
Yeah, no, go ahead.

59:09.140 --> 59:19.940
What was it about having six parents that you were like, this is good, but there's a hole in our hearts for something else?

59:19.940 --> 59:22.020
There's just, it's missing.

59:22.020 --> 59:26.660
We're missing something and it's, I think it's another parent.

59:26.660 --> 59:29.300
How after six parents do you not think, turtle?

59:29.300 --> 59:31.540
Maybe like, maybe that's what we don't have.

59:31.540 --> 59:35.940
Were you trying to start a parrot acapella group and you needed a deep parent?

59:35.940 --> 59:39.940
I really wish we were, but all of them are completely untalented.

59:39.940 --> 59:40.820
Awesome.

59:40.820 --> 59:42.180
Was that what you were trying to do?

59:42.180 --> 59:44.900
Was each parent, maybe this one will be cool?

59:44.900 --> 59:50.660
Please don't use our podcast as a bludgeon to lay waste to your parents.

59:50.660 --> 59:52.980
Hey, shout out to you, mom.

59:52.980 --> 59:53.780
She's catching up.

59:53.780 --> 59:57.220
Your parrot's named mom?

59:57.220 --> 59:58.260
Are you okay?

59:58.260 --> 01:00:05.380
Tell me what the sort of sonic experience of crossing the threshold of the house is like.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.940
How well can you imagine about 12 hours of screaming every day?

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.020
Pretty well, I have a baby.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.820
The conversion rate is one baby to seven.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.140
Yeah, it's about that.

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.860
Do the parrots all hang out in the same room or is it like,

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.340
There's parrots in the living room.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.980
Okay, so we have our living room.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.980
There's like a wall of cages, right?

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.340
Okay.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:35.380
And how many of those are parrots and how many are humans?

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.940
Okay, we have this fun little thing where-

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.700
That should have been an easy answer.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.780
You shouldn't need a fucking like,

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.660
hold on, I want to answer your question about human cages,

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:50.420
but I'm going to need to cushion this a little bit.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.100
Okay, I can't just come out and say I have three humans in cages.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.740
Let me preface.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.740
Kind of a 50-50 deal.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.180
Now I'm not sure.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:08.900
You can't lie to us right now because you just said you have seven parrots.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.060
So you don't want us to start questioning everything.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.740
Especially that half a person.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.380
Why did you?

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.500
I'm just going to ask you a question and I want you to answer me.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.300
And I'm tired of the lies.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.580
I'm tired of the runaround, okay?

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.580
Why did you buy a seventh parrot?

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.180
Okay, all right.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.580
We did not buy each parrot separately.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.580
So you steal parrots from people.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.540
That's disgusting.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.380
Wait, do you wake in the morning and a new parrot is there?

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.460
I mean, that does happen sometimes.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.100
But not that quick a turnaround.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.780
I promise, we'll let you finish this time.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.940
Why did you buy a seventh parrot?

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.220
It all started when...

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.260
No, I'm locked in.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.220
Go ahead.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.020
You got me.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.580
It was a dark and stormy night.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:02:00.100
Fucking, can we just do in media res and you're kind of like about to buy the parrot?

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:00.820
Yeah.

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.100
So you can help.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.540
We got two parrots as the final sixth and seventh parrot.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.060
Okay, let me rephrase my question.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.020
Why did you buy a sixth and seventh parrot?

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:12.500
You know what?

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.860
I'll track it back.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.820
Second.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.700
Second.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.900
No, fifth and seventh.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.500
Your sixth and seventh parrot.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.580
What made you sort of...

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:25.060
Was it you needed one for Saturday and Sunday?

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:32.020
Well, and this is, I shit you not, this is completely honest.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:37.300
One of the parrots, parrot number four.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.660
That's what you call them too.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:43.380
That's what you put on their prisoner ID badges.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.220
Parrot four.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.380
You didn't finish your gruel, parrot four.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:53.220
Are vittles not up to your demanding standards?

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.700
Perhaps parrot six would enjoy the rest of your gruel.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.940
While parrot seven looks at his parrot Hayworth poster.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.180
Okay, so parrot, sorry, your gag was parrot Hayworth.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:06.660
Yeah.

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.540
Okay, go ahead.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.620
It's like Shawshank, parrot redemption.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.020
I got it.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.380
Shit.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.340
Just make sure Shawshank redemption, but with parrots.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.700
This is gonna, we've had a lot of fun.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.220
Here's just gonna be like, parrot four died.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.060
And we just had like five minutes in.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.420
Okay, so why do you have so many parrots?

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.060
Please justify it.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.340
Something happened to parrot four.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.940
Parrot four was lonely.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.180
So...

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.620
Wait, what?

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.940
Fuck you parrot four.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.060
They don't get along.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.220
The parrots hate each other.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:35.380
They have like, it's like game of thrones.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.340
They have different houses.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:39.700
Thank you for being...

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:43.940
Pikachu fights the others and she's smaller and weaker than the rest.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:49.300
Put them in a different part of the house.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.100
Stop, Travis.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:50.900
Travis, stop.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.180
Is your parrot named Pikachu?

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.500
Wait, what?

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.780
Is your parrot named Pikachu?

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.420
Yeah, you want me to go through the names?

01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:59.380
Sorry.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.540
Now I want to list the fucking names?

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:02.980
Yeah, list your parrot names.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.620
Hey, goodbye everyone else's questions.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.340
Okay, list the names of all your parrots.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.060
All right.

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.500
If you can remember them.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.060
Yeah, right.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.540
We have Celeste.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.620
We have Buckberry.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.460
We have Pikachu.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.020
Fantastic.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.420
We have Sadie.

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.340
We have Taco spelled T-A-A-K-O named after the wizard.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.460
My mom's a fan of the show.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.140
Hell yeah.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.860
And then we have Pepper and am I missing one?

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.420
Wait.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.140
Yeah.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.100
Yeah, you are.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:32.980
Yeah, you are.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:34.420
You know how I know?

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.940
You have seven parrots.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.900
Rexie.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.300
We have Rexie short for Tyrannosaurus Rex.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:39.940
All right.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.340
Okay.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.620
Was that the seventh?

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.700
No, that was number five.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:45.860
Jesus, we are in the weeds.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.580
Can I ask you?

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.740
I want to ask you two questions and I'm going to ask them in succession

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.260
and then you can answer them in succession.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.860
First question is, what's the worst part about living with seven parrots?

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.180
The second question is, what's the second worst thing about living with seven parrots?

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.780
Wait, can I add a third question?

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.340
Of course.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:07.380
Third question.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.700
Is there any improvement that you thought, oh, thank God we have that seventh one?

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:12.180
Yeah.

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:16.980
Did you have like a home invaders and like six weren't enough to bring them down?

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.180
The seventh one swept in and bit off their dicks.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.300
Okay.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.340
Tell me the worst thing about living with seven parrots.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.980
And then tell me the best thing about living with seven parrots.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.220
Okay.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.980
So we have one, two, three, and four.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:29.780
We need answers.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.100
Okay.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.140
So what's the worst?

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.020
Worst thing is that parrots absolutely cannot be potty trained.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.460
No, they're parrots.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:35.620
Yes.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.580
They're huge.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.700
Yeah, that's huge.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.340
What's the second?

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.580
The second worst thing is probably that one of them is a sociopath.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.660
But you can never remember which one.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.860
So it's like they ask you to join them in a room alone.

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.820
You're like, wait a minute.

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.340
Are you the one who, oh well.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.900
But it is really good at solving bird crime.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:55.140
Yeah.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.820
It's parrot number four, the lonely one.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.580
Oh, that fucking parrot four.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.980
What's the name of parrot four?

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.780
Do you remember?

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.500
Yeah, Sadie.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:04.980
Sadie.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.780
Fuck Sadie.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.260
Sadie.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.300
No, Sadie's great.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.020
What's the best thing?

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:09.540
I hope they get avian flu.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.700
Jesus, Travis.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.900
Come on, Travis.

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.820
And then they all turned against me.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.220
Yeah.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.620
I'll drink some more Malort, thank you very much.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:24.900
To put a nice button on this, to give it just sort of a nice ending,

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:30.980
because we've just been dunking on your seven small birds of paradise for a bit.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:36.900
What's the best thing about living with seven birds?

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.340
Thank you, Griffin.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.020
What's the best thing about the seven birds?

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.860
You can't just say, thank you, I need the best.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.540
There's not a best thing.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.060
We'll edit it in later.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.820
The best thing about having seven birds would probably be the look on all of our

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.540
friends and loved ones faces of concern and shock and horror as they enter our house.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:01.380
Do you ever just, thank you so much.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:01.780
Thank you.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.140
Thank you for all your parents.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.420
Did you think you were going to be up here for 15 minutes, by the way?

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.060
Probably not.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.420
I hope you wore comfortable shoes.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.740
That's going to do it for us.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.420
Thank you so much, Chicago, for listening to us.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.380
We hope you had fun.

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.740
Thank you to everybody.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:22.100
Let's have a big round of applause for everybody that was brave enough to stand up and ask a

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.540
question because it's very scary.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.780
So thank you to everybody.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.500
Do you see that?

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:27.780
So what?

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:29.060
Well, the P's upside down.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.580
The P's upside down.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:30.980
There we go.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.860
Now your U is, I'm not going to troubleshoot you.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.380
On one side it says juice and on the other side it says juice.

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.180
It probably says Justin because like in the TV show, remember?

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:41.300
Anyway.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.900
Now it says Jostin, now it says Jorps.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.620
Now it says-

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.340
Now keep going.

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.460
Okay, now it says Josta.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.260
Thank you to everybody for coming out.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:48.660
Thank you.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.300
Can we turn the house lights down because people are starting to leave to get to their cars early.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.260
It's freaking me out.

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:52.980
It's bumming me out.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.180
I don't want to say, bye everybody.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.060
Like no hard feelings.

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.780
I do it all the time, but I just don't want to, I can't say it.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.460
Wait, get a poster on your way out.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.300
Yeah, make sure to buy poster sneakers.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.100
We got you.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:02.740
You're busted.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.980
So now buy a fucking poster.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.860
So that's, thank you so much to the Chicago theater, which is beautiful.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:16.420
And I hope you're all frequenting this venue as much as humanly possible because it's fucking gorgeous.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.300
It's really amazing.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.980
And thank you to Chicago in general.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.580
Yeah, you've been amazing.

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:23.860
Thank you to Schmaners for opening for us.

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.900
They were fantastic.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.420
Thank you to our daddy for doing our intro and coming with us and helping us out.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:36.100
Thank you to Paul for coming around and helping us out with everything.

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.340
Check out the music of Paul and Storm available everywhere, books are sold.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:40.820
Everywhere.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.940
It's everywhere.

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.780
You can't trip without finding Paul and Storm.

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.620
Oh, and go on the Joko Cruise also.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.300
Joko Cruise is going to be on it.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.140
Yeah, my wife and I are going to be doing Schmaners.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:49.940
Our dad will be there.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.180
We're going to probably do some D&D, not a venture zone, but D&D stuff.

01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:54.420
Yeah.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:58.180
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.420
It's a departure off the album, but in the days to come.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:00.740
Yes.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.900
I also just want to say a general thank you to our wives and families and babies and stuff

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.700
for being so cool.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:08.500
Yeah.

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.900
Thank you to CAA.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.660
Thanks for them.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.180
We're not going to be, because of the aforementioned babies, they got to get to bed.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.180
So we're not going to be hanging out afterwards and stuff.

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:21.220
But we so appreciate you all coming and being so kind to us.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.220
Because really, having this many people here to see our dumb podcast really means the world.

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:25.620
Yeah.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.660
And I used to live in Chicago, and I've seen shows here.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:33.300
And the fact that we're up here right now is never not going to be completely surreal.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.260
You're so kind.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.540
Thank you.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.180
Thank you all so much.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:36.820
Thank you so much.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.940
So every week on my Bim Bam, if you never listen, Griffin reads the last Yahoo.

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.580
And then on the next episode, we come back and sort of discuss it.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.220
This one was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.220
Thank you, Seth.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:55.460
Yahoo answers user Caleb, who asks, has there ever been a person to get shoot in the balls

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.500
and survive?

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.000
Ouch!

01:09:58.020 --> 01:09:59.620

And together, we host a podcast called Still Buffering, where we answer questions like,

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:42.100
why should I not fall asleep first at a slumber party?

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.380
How do I be fleek?

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.500
Is it OK to break up with someone using emojis?

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.260
And sometimes we talk about butts.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.300
No, we don't.

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:49.800
Nope.

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:56.180
Find out the answers to these important questions and many more on Still Buffering,

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.540
And I was too.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.180
Butts, butts, butts, butts, butts.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:31.940
Well, you've changed your mind, far too many times, over and over again, over and over again.
