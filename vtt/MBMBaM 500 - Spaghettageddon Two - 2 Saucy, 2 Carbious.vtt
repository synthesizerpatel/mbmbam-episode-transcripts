WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:45.360
Do you need a pitch?

00:48.880 --> 00:56.480
Here's where I'll start. Too high. Let me know. Too low. No, no, that's right. Do you want to

00:56.480 --> 01:01.760
just let me know when you're recording? Yeah, I'm recording now. Yeah, it's hot. Isn't it rich? Oh,

01:01.760 --> 01:06.720
sorry. Now I'm recording. Isn't it? Oh, sorry. No, it was recording before. It was recording before.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.840
He got a virus pop-up. Yeah, it's recording now. It's recording now. And Juice McAfee's got this

01:11.840 --> 01:17.120
one, so don't worry about it. People love this, and you're really ruining it for me. No, we got

01:17.120 --> 01:22.160
it. Well, we'll edit all of this out. The virus hackers are the ones who are ruining it, and it's

01:22.160 --> 01:27.920
Norton Antivirus who sponsored this 500th episode of the show. They are a brick wall. Go ahead and

01:27.920 --> 01:38.240
sing for me now. Isn't it rich? Uh-huh. Are we a pair? Are we? Me here at last on the ground and you

01:38.240 --> 01:53.680
in midair. Where are the clowns? Where are they? Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve? One who keeps

01:53.680 --> 02:04.240
tearing around and one who can move. I can just tell those levels aren't good. Where are the clowns?

02:04.240 --> 02:11.200
He's just fluctuating. He's all over the fucking place I know. There ought to be clowns. Just when

02:11.200 --> 02:15.920
I stopped. Oh, God. I thought that was it. Yeah, I didn't know there was a bridge. Opening doors.

02:15.920 --> 02:24.720
It's 500. All right. Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours. Making my entrance again with

02:24.720 --> 02:37.920
my usual flair. Sure of my lines, but no one was there. That's gotta be the end. Don't you love a

02:37.920 --> 02:45.200
farce? Hold on. Actually, I just come around on it. It's my fault I fear. It's your curry sauce that

02:45.200 --> 02:54.160
you're rubbing on. I thought that you'd want what I'd want. I'm sorry, my dear. Uh-huh. Bring them

02:54.160 --> 03:06.160
home. Goose those levels. Send in the clowns. But where are the clowns? Take me home, Justin.

03:06.160 --> 03:27.440
Don't bother. They are here. They are here. Maybe next year. Hello and welcome. Are you gonna sit

03:27.440 --> 03:31.040
back down now? I gotta sit back down, yeah. We could all do standing if you guys wanted to. No,

03:31.040 --> 03:36.640
this is my home, my very comfortable. The conceit of the episode is we have just filled our rigid

03:36.640 --> 03:42.480
frames with hot pasta. The last thing I need to be doing is elevating my- Can I introduce- Oh,

03:42.480 --> 03:46.960
I've introduced- Introduce it. 499 of them. Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me,

03:46.960 --> 03:50.560
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your

03:50.560 --> 03:54.560
middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm still, even after all these years,

03:54.560 --> 04:02.560
your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. So welcome to the 500th episode of My Brother,

04:02.560 --> 04:15.520
My Brother and Me, Spaghetageddon 2. Too saucy. Too carbious. Now, a lot of people pointed out

04:15.520 --> 04:20.800
that apparently in episode 251, we said that episode 500 was going to mark the beginning of

04:20.800 --> 04:26.000
period 3.0 of My Brother, My Brother and Me. Oh, interesting. And now I would like to suggest

04:26.000 --> 04:31.200
a change. Okay. Right off here, right off the bat. Maybe from now on, we're an advice show for a

04:31.200 --> 04:38.560
bygone era. Okay. Old timey, like how do you do good at the hoop and stick thing? Yeah, yeah.

04:39.200 --> 04:46.960
Hey, so how do your bodies feel presently? I'll tell you, Griffin. Yeah. Feel great. Okay. I ate

04:46.960 --> 04:54.560
two bowls of that saucy stuff. Munched it all up. Special thanks to our stepmom, Carol,

04:54.560 --> 05:01.280
for that saucy stuff. Carol gave us the chunky stuff. The saucy stuff we crave. Yeah, it's the

05:01.280 --> 05:07.600
saucy stuff we crave. And I threw that right down my hole. And it's weird because I remember

05:07.600 --> 05:14.960
Spaghetageddon 1 feeling like energy had been put in me by the pasta. But weirdly,

05:14.960 --> 05:21.360
this go round, it feels like it went the other way. And I was somehow, it was taking something

05:21.360 --> 05:27.760
out of me because I feel like I need to go to sleep. You feel heavy. I feel a heft. Well,

05:27.760 --> 05:33.120
we did also listen to smooth jazz while we ate spaghetti. Yeah, that helped push me further down

05:33.120 --> 05:41.680
the hole. And so maybe that's a reflection of 10 years just sort of where my body is. Yeah. Now,

05:41.680 --> 05:50.640
I had my pasta because it is of that, of that bean life. I had mine on Shirataki noodles,

05:51.200 --> 05:56.640
which are made of seaweed and they are indistinguishable. No, I'm kidding. They're bad.

05:56.640 --> 06:01.840
And saying that I ate- They weren't bad. They weren't bad. That was a passable pasta experience.

06:01.840 --> 06:08.400
Yeah, but saying I ate spaghetti for lunch would be like saying I read the VHS amore on the back

06:08.400 --> 06:14.080
of old school and I had seen the movie old school. There's really not a connection between the two.

06:14.080 --> 06:20.480
It's a ghost of the experience. This is our 500th special episode. I hate recording in the same room.

06:21.840 --> 06:28.640
I fucking despise it. I'm looking at your faces. We're in Travis's office. I have also positioned

06:28.640 --> 06:33.360
Justin directly across from you. How do you work like this, Travis? What do you mean?

06:33.360 --> 06:42.320
It's, I need sparse, Spartan. It is, there's chaos. This is representative of my brain. A lot of half

06:42.320 --> 06:47.440
formed but fully charged ahead ideas. Yeah. This is what I've done here. You just kind of got an

06:47.440 --> 06:53.760
Ewok village play set up there next to some sort of Cinco de Mayo skeleton man. Yeah. So it's just

06:53.760 --> 07:00.880
like, what's the theme, bud? Well, that shelf is all comic books. We got superheroes on that big shelf.

07:00.880 --> 07:06.480
This shelf is all about me. I'm mostly focused on the Ewok play set Cinco de Mayo shelf. Well,

07:07.200 --> 07:14.640
Ewoks like to party. Nub nub. This is our 500th episode. Oh boy, it feels like 486 though,

07:14.640 --> 07:20.080
doesn't it? Yeah. The time just fucking goes the normal speed. So was the special element we added

07:20.080 --> 07:25.280
here us just being really sad and tired and talking about my room? No, we're not going to

07:25.280 --> 07:30.320
talk about your room. We're going to have special guests. We've got, I'm assuming you

07:30.320 --> 07:36.400
guys have prepared some other stuff. Yeah. And it's going to be a fun episode. I got updates

07:36.400 --> 07:41.360
from a lot of people. Oh, that'd be fun. I've got some yahoos and, but they're special yahoos

07:41.360 --> 07:46.000
cause I'll read them funny or something. Oh, nice. Nice, nice, nice. Hey, do you guys want to start

07:46.000 --> 07:53.680
with an update? Yes. Okay. Um, so this update. Is that your refrigerator? I mean, are you asking

07:53.680 --> 07:59.040
if that is a physical refrigerator on the sound? It's a little bit of a buzz. Yeah. And you let

07:59.040 --> 08:05.200
that happen? I edit it out. You edit the refrigerator buzz out? Yeah. Why don't you edit

08:05.200 --> 08:11.680
the refrigerator out of the office? Uh, so this is from I'm quote new to not aversary end quote.

08:11.680 --> 08:17.040
And you answered my question on episode 91 feeding frenzy. I was the question that inspired the title.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.360
You told me the best way to heal my newly single heart was to get my girl shark pack together,

08:21.360 --> 08:27.440
break some hearts and eat some seals. I'm pleased to say I followed your advice and 2012 became a

08:27.440 --> 08:31.840
year where I took chances, met new people and followed and moved to a new city where I met the

08:31.840 --> 08:36.640
man of my dreams. Eight years later, I'm happily married with a beautiful puppy and I listened to

08:36.640 --> 08:42.720
feeding frenzy anytime I need to pick me up. All the best, Jenny. I'm assuming you named either

08:42.720 --> 08:49.600
the puppy or your husband after us. Yeah. Or both. And I'm also assuming that the husband is a very

08:49.600 --> 08:56.720
handsome, very eloquent Mako shark who has gotten the power to speak like through magic, like in the

08:56.720 --> 09:02.480
movie that won the Oscar. I can't remember Free Willy Big Man in the Water. Yeah, I think that

09:03.280 --> 09:08.560
my bet and Jenny did not describe the husband. But here's what I like to fix there. Yeah,

09:08.560 --> 09:15.360
a very resilient, maybe a little scarred seal. Oh, I see. And Jenny attempted to eat the seal,

09:15.360 --> 09:20.400
but then they fell in love and now married and they have a seal pup. And that's what she means

09:20.400 --> 09:28.480
by puppy. It's a seal baby. A human seal hybrid. All right. Well, that sounds like a listener of

09:28.480 --> 09:34.400
our show. Right, guys? Hey, what if on 500 we just fucking rip them up? We didn't really talk about

09:34.400 --> 09:40.400
this beforehand, but what about on 500? Okay, let's do this. Ready? Hey, everybody, thank you.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.440
There is no way for us to say thanks enough to make up for how much you have done for us in our

09:45.440 --> 09:52.720
lives and created a bounty and a blessing that we, or any human being who has ever lived,

09:52.720 --> 09:58.480
does not deserve. Thank you. But we can't just do that the whole time. No. So what if we just rip

09:58.480 --> 10:02.880
them the fuck up? And maybe that'll be a start of a new era, you know? The start of the new area

10:04.240 --> 10:10.560
is the new areola. Oh, we're shock jocks. We insult people, we talk about nasty body parts.

10:10.560 --> 10:15.520
The new energy. Let's talk about the nastiest body part. The areola. That's fucking good.

10:17.360 --> 10:26.640
Areola 51. Am I right, boys? Alien-ness. Areola 51 is something that we need to nurture like a

10:26.640 --> 10:31.840
small flame that hold that idea of areola 51. I want to like make sure that we do have enough

10:31.840 --> 10:35.920
kindling to put on it and blow on it. Because what's the follow up? You know what I mean?

10:35.920 --> 10:39.920
Yeah. I mean, that's, that's, I want to, I want to nurture it until it's a spark right now. Skin

10:39.920 --> 10:46.000
dependence day. Skin dependence day. Areola 51. It's really good. I'm getting close. You know

10:46.000 --> 10:51.520
what I mean? I'm in the areola because it's like area. You can't actually do the same. Oh,

10:51.520 --> 10:57.280
there it goes. Oh no, I killed the flame. Not enough kindling. Oh, damn it. Should we,

10:57.280 --> 11:01.920
do you guys want to do a yahoo? This is going to be pretty fucking loosey goosey. Let's bring

11:01.920 --> 11:05.920
somebody in. Let's bring in a special guest. Okay. Okay. Let's, but it's not, if we,

11:05.920 --> 11:12.000
if we have a lot of them, it's not going to be very special, is it? So let's decide on three

11:12.000 --> 11:17.040
right now. No, not three. Let's get them all in the room and we'll make them fight it out.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.720
Let's bring our daddy in. Let's get dad in here because he does have diarrhea and I would like to.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.240
He needs to go. He aided this beginning. He is bad off, boy.

11:26.400 --> 11:32.800
Okay. Uh, hi dad. Hi. Do you remember how to do, by the way, this energy has been,

11:32.800 --> 11:36.640
this episode has been so fucking low energy, dad. So if you could bring some spice and really get

11:36.640 --> 11:41.040
us going, that'd be huge. Please display good microphone technique. Are we blaming that on

11:41.040 --> 11:47.120
the pasta? I'm blaming it on the pasta and the fact that I broke my fucking spine last night

11:47.120 --> 11:52.960
at our show where I did a full blown death drop. Hey dad, I wanted to, this is Clint McElroy. He's

11:52.960 --> 11:57.840
Hey everybody. It's me, Clint McElroy bringing the energy. So yeah, give us that juice dad,

11:57.840 --> 12:04.800
that stinky stuff, the shit we crave. About what? About funny stuff. Let me start by this. Okay.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.240
What's your favorite moment from My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the podcast?

12:09.200 --> 12:16.480
Uh, the first time I was on. Okay. When was that? Yeah. When was that? Um, it was a long time ago

12:16.480 --> 12:21.520
because I was, we were still up on the hill in the old studios at the radio station. Yeah. And I had

12:21.520 --> 12:26.640
to step outside because I was laughing too loud and it was bothering my recording compatriots.

12:26.640 --> 12:32.720
I see. So I stepped outside. So wait, we just called you on the phone? Yeah. Yeah. We called

12:32.720 --> 12:37.440
them on the phone. Was it for a bonus episode? Yeah. That was a full episode. We were on the

12:37.440 --> 12:45.200
phone. This was back when we recorded the show on a fucking yak back on a broken talk boy. Uh,

12:45.200 --> 12:51.120
yeah. We would hold it up to a landline. Dad, how would you say that, um, what's the biggest impact

12:51.120 --> 12:56.800
on your life? Like how have we changed it? How have we fixed it? How we fixed it. It had, you have

12:56.800 --> 13:04.960
fixed my life by enabling me to build my own career. Finally, you know, uh, to make something

13:04.960 --> 13:11.840
of myself. Yeah. You know, um, and, and I've gotten, the big thing is I've gotten a chance to

13:11.840 --> 13:18.240
like meet Joel from mystery science theater 3000. That was, that was a big life. Who's the best

13:18.240 --> 13:24.480
famous person you've gotten to meet by riding our coattails? That's a good one. Uh, well,

13:24.480 --> 13:31.520
now wait a minute. I think Joel, maybe Joel was Joel from mystery science theater. 3000 Joel from

13:31.520 --> 13:41.520
it. Joel. Yeah. Um, Brandon Ralph was a nice get. Nice dude. Fucking jacked tall. What did you think

13:41.520 --> 13:48.880
of Brandon, Brandon, Ralph's huge muscles? His frame. Um, his pecs were good, but when he

13:48.880 --> 13:53.280
pulled up his shirt and showed us his six pack, I thought that was a little, it's weird that he has

13:53.280 --> 13:59.360
to do it every 15 minutes. He has a timer on his watch. Excuse me. Yeah. And he actually, it was,

14:02.880 --> 14:07.520
he said Superman, make a whoopee and he pulls up his shirt and he's got a six pack of Michelob

14:07.520 --> 14:13.840
ultra under there every time. Uh, that was, that was good. Um, what's your favorite city we visited

14:13.840 --> 14:20.400
for live shows? And what's the worst city? Yeah. Listen for me going, I will go back to the Wilbur

14:21.200 --> 14:27.440
in Boston. Well, you say that we are specifically not going back to the Wilbur this year.

14:29.040 --> 14:34.720
Well, I still, that, that first time we did a live Taz and we stepped out on the stage

14:34.720 --> 14:39.280
and I've never experienced anything like that. And I've done boys. I've been,

14:39.280 --> 14:44.880
walked a lot of stages. I've trod a lot of boards, but that was an extremely cool moment.

14:44.880 --> 14:50.480
I felt like that was, that was awesome. Um, but it's not the 500th episode of the adventure zone.

14:50.480 --> 14:57.120
Correct? No. Oh, it's not. No. What is this for? Uh, okay. Uh, and what was that least favorite

14:57.120 --> 15:02.480
city? Which one did you really hate? It was a real stinker and be honest, be honest about it.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.360
Yeah. We'll bleep it out. We'll bleep it out. We'll bleep it out because Hey dad,

15:05.360 --> 15:11.760
after 500 we're fucking ripping them, dude. Yeah, dude. I would have to say the time we spent in

15:11.760 --> 15:20.960
San Francisco was, I can't believe you actually answered it. One of the best times. Hey folks,

15:20.960 --> 15:24.960
Clint McElroy. Thank you so much. Am I done? You're actually done. Yeah. You're done. Do you

15:24.960 --> 15:31.600
want to say anything earnest? Oh, honest, earnest. Yeah. You mean like going on about how damn proud

15:31.600 --> 15:37.600
I am of you guys? Get out, get out. No, I love that stuff. I just, I'm very proud of you guys.

15:37.600 --> 15:45.200
I really, and the, just, just to be able to look on my oldest son's face and see how happy he is

15:45.200 --> 15:54.320
that I am proud of. Oh God. And, and look, I, um, I don't want to really. Hey dad, on your way out,

15:54.320 --> 16:00.240
will you send in the clowns? Just tell them they're up. Do we want to send another get,

16:00.240 --> 16:05.920
am I done? If Henry's not up, can you send, can you ask Rachel to come in? Uh, okay. So let's

16:05.920 --> 16:12.240
talk about how the show, do you all think it has changed since we became parents? I think it's,

16:12.240 --> 16:16.400
all our jokes are still totally relatable. I think everything hasn't changed. I think that

16:16.400 --> 16:22.720
we didn't miss a fucking step, did we? I don't think we missed a step, did we? Have you guys

16:22.720 --> 16:27.680
started encountering the idea of like, now our kids will soon listen to like shit we said,

16:27.680 --> 16:31.680
um, like five, six, seven, eight, 10 years ago. Are you reaching that part with, are you reaching

16:31.680 --> 16:37.760
that with Charlie where Charlie's like talking to you about, hey, come on in, come on in. Join us.

16:37.760 --> 16:44.480
Is Henry asleep? No. That really traps my ass. If I'm being honest. Anyways, here's Rachel. Hi hun.

16:45.040 --> 16:50.880
Hi. Um, how are you doing? Are you frustrated because our son didn't take a nap? This is an

16:50.880 --> 16:57.280
honest place. I'm, I'm kind of frustrated. I did some work in there, told him a story about

16:57.280 --> 17:02.080
Superman. I thought he liked it. Wait, was it off the dome? It was right. I flipped it right off

17:02.080 --> 17:08.320
the dome. What did he do? He wanted to be slow in his story and beat the Joker. So anyway,

17:09.520 --> 17:13.200
and that didn't work. He's not asleep. No, he's not asleep. All right. Well, I'm not worried

17:13.200 --> 17:19.360
about it. What, um, what am I, am I supposed to? Well, this is kind of a retrospective, 500,

17:19.360 --> 17:24.560
looking back. Your first, your face, if you could rank, this is gonna be really tough. If you could

17:24.560 --> 17:35.760
rank your top 10 My Brother, My Brother B episodes. Uh, 17. Oh nice. Oh yeah. Hey, that's a safe bet.

17:35.760 --> 17:43.680
Shooting before the first like 50 is a safe bet. 17 is gonna be like our, like we said some wild

17:43.680 --> 17:49.840
shit and why did she pick 17? Which leads me to 43. Oh, that's a dog whistle right there. And

17:49.840 --> 17:56.400
those two, if you think about it, canonically are pretty linked actually. Yikes. I mean, I could

17:56.400 --> 18:03.360
continue to just name numbers. How about I say my least favorite ones? Okay. Yeah. So number one.

18:03.360 --> 18:08.160
Yeah. That's an easy, easy call. I bet everyone at home is going.

18:08.160 --> 18:19.200
Yeah. You, you came on the team later. You were recruited by Tom Cruise's guys,

18:19.200 --> 18:24.000
the ones he uses to find brides. Yeah. We needed to get Griffin married to be a little bit more

18:24.000 --> 18:28.800
relatable. The admins whittled down the list and you were brought on the team a little bit later

18:29.360 --> 18:37.440
after the product had already been in production for a few years. Now is the product you

18:37.440 --> 18:43.680
in this scenario of the podcast? Um, it's, we're, it's symbiotic. Or is it your seed?

18:43.680 --> 18:48.240
Oh yeah. My seed? Well, let's talk about my seed. Okay. Pretty cool.

18:50.640 --> 18:56.800
Made a little guy with it. You did. I didn't. Hey, we did it. Thank you. You took my seed.

18:57.520 --> 19:03.040
And you ran with it. I really, I've seen the before and after and you did a great job.

19:03.040 --> 19:10.320
You made it your own dude. Don't say that that's weird slime is I, I had anything to do with it

19:10.320 --> 19:17.440
afterwards. Rachel, you've listed the first episode of this podcast. Yeah. If you imagine being 10

19:17.440 --> 19:25.440
years ago and being someone who listed that, can you, is there even a glimmer in your mind,

19:26.000 --> 19:32.640
even a spark where you think, bet these guys are going to make $500. This is the sort of thing

19:32.640 --> 19:36.960
that 500 of them will be. I mean, I didn't even think you guys would still be brothers by now.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.800
I just assumed that like people who listened to that first episode is like, if you find an injured

19:42.800 --> 19:46.160
baby bird and you're like, I'm going to nurse it back to health. But then you found out you had

19:46.160 --> 19:51.120
to nurse that bird for like 500 days. And you're like, Oh, I really thought he'd be flying by now.

19:51.120 --> 19:57.200
You only have to nurse the bird for the first like 100 days. And then you're just waiting for

19:57.200 --> 20:03.520
him to fly because today, the day you fly with more gems about horses. Yeah. We met about a year

20:03.520 --> 20:12.240
after the show had started. You and Rachel, not us. No, me and Rachel, uh, our guest. And I met

20:12.240 --> 20:17.520
you right after you did your second city show or right before somewhere around there. It was right

20:17.520 --> 20:23.440
before. Yeah. Yeah. This would have been, uh, and did you go back? We kind of had a little flirt

20:23.440 --> 20:27.840
going on, a little correspondence going on for a while after. This is great with Justin sitting

20:27.840 --> 20:34.880
in between us. And did you go back and listen to the old episodes where I would talk pretty much

20:34.880 --> 20:40.880
about like, you know, how I didn't wash my Bush or some shit like that and be like, I can't not

20:40.880 --> 20:45.040
get with him. I was actually always surprised at how comfortable you were talking about how

20:45.040 --> 20:51.520
terrible your digestive system was. I was like, this man is really comfortable talking about his

20:51.520 --> 20:58.320
diarrhea on a podcast and this, and he's trying to be my boyfriend. But when we met, I did have

20:58.320 --> 21:03.200
bad diarrhea. I got on the airplane and told you about that. But Rachel, you now have the insight

21:03.200 --> 21:08.800
that you can share with our listeners at home. Is that just a funny persona? I mean, he plays it up

21:08.800 --> 21:15.600
for sure. Mr. Bad guy. That's a good character. The grooving place at home. Rock solid digestion.

21:15.600 --> 21:21.840
This guy, he poops once a day, every day. Same time. Same time. Say you're watching by it. It

21:21.840 --> 21:28.560
lasts an hour and a half. I love you a lot. I love you too. And I'm glad I met you because I feel

21:28.560 --> 21:35.200
like I can't go back and listen to episodes one through 50. You were a lot sadder. I was much

21:35.200 --> 21:40.160
sadder. That seemed to be a thing. I remember early after we started dating, getting tweets

21:40.160 --> 21:47.520
from people like, I miss sad. He was funnier when he was sad. He wasn't. Wicked was not.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.440
Well, Rachel, thank you so much for your contributions to our family. Thanks for having

21:51.440 --> 21:59.040
me. Yeah. And the love and laughter that you provide me every day with your smile, your grace.

21:59.040 --> 22:07.520
Okay. Justin's clocking out. Okay. Who'd you get? Your wife. I got a big get for a real special,

22:07.520 --> 22:13.680
special guest. Okay. This co-host of saw bones, a mayoral tour of misguided medicine. My wife,

22:13.680 --> 22:19.760
my best friend, don't plug your own show. Smurl McElroy. Welcome Dr. McElroy. Thank you. I like

22:19.760 --> 22:25.360
the purple mic. Yeah, that's very nice. You've been with her since the beginning, since before

22:25.360 --> 22:30.640
the beginning, you were already shaping Justin into the performer and co-host that he is today.

22:30.640 --> 22:39.120
Mm-hmm. What's it like to finally see all your hard work pay off and to have a partner who

22:39.120 --> 22:42.720
finally is bringing something to the table? Because you were a doctor for a while. Well,

22:42.720 --> 22:47.840
Justin was just like kind of a lay about video game journalist. And now he's able to provide

22:47.840 --> 22:52.640
for you and give something to society. So you don't have to do all the work. Is it nice?

22:52.640 --> 22:58.320
Yeah. I think it's a huge relief, really. I mean, you bet on somebody, you take that gamble,

22:58.320 --> 23:03.600
you put all that work in and you just really hope at some point it pays off.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.000
Sid, you've known us for a while. Can you remember the exact moment where success ruined us?

23:10.160 --> 23:15.200
Or if you prefer me specifically, because I've always been ruined.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.480
Yeah, Travis was ruined. Travis came pre-ruined from the factory.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.880
We got our first iTunes review where somebody was like,

23:20.880 --> 23:24.400
yeah, pretty good. And Travis was like, that's what did Travis.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.720
I got second place in a lip sync battle in elementary school and ever since then.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.560
He's just been spoiled milk.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.600
I think the bidet has been a real turning point for you.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.720
Was that not a present from you to him?

23:38.720 --> 23:40.320
Well, I guess I take the blame for it.

23:40.320 --> 23:45.600
But I became the sort of person that would appreciate the gift. I mean, in your defense.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.080
You did want a bidet before I got you the bidet.

23:48.080 --> 23:54.480
Now that he's got a pretty like constantly clean hole, like how has he been since that?

23:54.480 --> 23:54.800
Yeah.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.040
Have you noticed a sort of difference?

23:55.040 --> 23:56.960
Do you mean as a lover?

23:57.520 --> 23:59.040
No, I don't want to talk about that.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.240
I don't either.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.480
Hey, Sid, what's your favorite episode of the podcast of My Brother, My Brother and Me?

24:05.600 --> 24:06.800
It's so hard to choose.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.240
I bet it is, Sidney.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.120
There's quite a few.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.120
I bet it is hard. That's not why.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.560
Sidney, what's your favorite bit from My Brother, My Brother and Me?

24:14.560 --> 24:15.600
Don't do this.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.080
You can't pick one favorite bit.

24:18.080 --> 24:18.560
This isn't fair.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.160
Nobody's taken Shrimp Heaven now yet.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.400
Just pick one favorite bit.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.840
Nobody's taken Donkey.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.720
Donkey's huge right now.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.920
Donkey's a pretty big one.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.200
It's really sad that when I try to think of my favorite bits,

24:31.200 --> 24:34.640
they're all from like over 300 episodes ago.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.440
When I asked Sidney to come in here, Rachel said,

24:37.440 --> 24:39.360
it's fine. I just did it. It took five minutes.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.960
You have to stroke three of those a little bit.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.960
But that quote is to be expected.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.440
Oh, boy.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.280
Sidney's refusing to do that though.

24:49.280 --> 24:49.840
Maybe like,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.760
I'm very, I love them all.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.280
It's just, you guys are so great.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.400
More of a Taz fan.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.480
You have listened to My Brother, My Brother and Me.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.440
That's what hurts.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.280
It's just one thing.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.160
I've showed you videos of like, look at the funny thing I did.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.560
I haven't listened since we had kids.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.200
Okay.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.920
Well, yeah, so you haven't heard all the shit

25:11.920 --> 25:13.920
he's been talking about these two.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.680
Everyone can agree all our best episodes were before that anyway,

25:17.680 --> 25:18.400
to be fair.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.240
That's where we were just really grinding.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.240
We were just like, hey, we just got to record.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.440
We just got to get an hour out there.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.800
The show was our kid, wasn't it?

25:24.800 --> 25:25.120
Yeah.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.200
The three of us got together and made a baby

25:27.200 --> 25:28.320
and the baby was our show.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.800
There was a lot of horse stuff back then.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.920
And that's fucking funny.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.400
Why do you think that that's so funny, Sidney?

25:34.400 --> 25:36.160
Sidney, why are horses so funny?

25:36.160 --> 25:37.200
I mean, they're big.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.160
They are, yeah.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.160
We never talk about that, I think.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.080
They got funny names.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.480
They kind of look like they're going to talk, right?

25:47.120 --> 25:48.800
They look like at any moment they're going to,

25:48.800 --> 25:50.640
and it's weird then that you like ride them.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.920
Have you guys seen Bojack Horseman?

25:51.920 --> 25:52.320
He talks.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.040
He talks, yeah.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.400
I'm glad to finally get like a doctor's opinion on the fact

25:56.400 --> 25:58.400
that horses' mouths look like they should be talking.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.440
I feel that so to my core.

26:01.440 --> 26:05.040
Sid, was there a moment in our meteoric rise to podcast stardom

26:05.040 --> 26:07.360
where you thought, I got to start treating him better.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.160
I'm going to lose him.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.920
Um, yes.

26:12.640 --> 26:13.280
When was that?

26:14.640 --> 26:15.120
No?

26:15.120 --> 26:16.080
Okay, that's fine.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.680
You treat me very well.

26:18.240 --> 26:18.880
No, no.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.120
I mean, you know.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.040
Yeah, I guess.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.120
I guess at some point with like, you know, the live shows and everything

26:27.120 --> 26:28.640
and everybody cheering for you all.

26:28.640 --> 26:28.960
Yeah.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.000
Cheering like, I want to fuck your brains out, Justin.

26:32.000 --> 26:32.480
Stuff like that.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.920
Look at that sexy guy.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.320
Yeah.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.440
I'm going to feel him.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.440
I love the one who only wears Disney shirts.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.200
I'm going to steal that wiener.

26:40.160 --> 26:44.560
Sydney, what do you feel like you as a podcaster have learned from us

26:44.560 --> 26:46.400
in your own podcasting careers?

26:48.960 --> 26:54.560
Well, I mean, this sounds like I'm stroking your egos,

26:54.560 --> 26:58.880
but everything, I would never have done a podcast otherwise.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.000
This is that good shit.

27:00.000 --> 27:00.960
Keep it coming.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.320
No, but I mean, it's true.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.560
I would never have thought to do it.

27:04.560 --> 27:10.080
I mean, in the doctor world, a lot of us don't know what podcasts are

27:10.080 --> 27:11.840
or how to find them or get them or how you go about it.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.680
You've been telling them about it though, right?

27:13.680 --> 27:13.920
Yes.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.880
She burns them cassette tapes.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.320
I mean, it's growing, but doctors are never on like the cutting edge

27:20.320 --> 27:22.880
of like cool new media or anything cool and new.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.640
Sounds like those doctors have borders and they're not without them.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.240
They have some borders around what they'll listen to.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.160
And they only shop at borders.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.880
They only shop at borders, which is closed so they can't buy podcasts.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.520
You know, just side note, because you just made me remember this

27:38.480 --> 27:41.680
for like the first 50 episodes to get my friends to listen to it.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.040
I did burn it on the CD.

27:43.040 --> 27:43.920
Oh, yeah, for sure.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.520
Yeah, I used to because I worked at the Shakespeare Company

27:47.520 --> 27:50.720
and then like a company van and I would use it to drive like materials

27:50.720 --> 27:52.640
and then the touring company would use.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.920
I would like leave the CD in the like in the player

27:55.920 --> 27:58.080
so that when they started the car, it would just be on.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.120
That sucks, bud.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.080
That's rough.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.360
But look at me now.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.160
That's rough.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.400
Even now at work, sometimes people will be like, how's your blog?

28:06.400 --> 28:07.200
Oh, cool.

28:07.200 --> 28:07.840
It's pretty good.

28:07.840 --> 28:12.320
I mean, this is a confessional sort of medium, right?

28:12.320 --> 28:15.200
Now, is there a possibility the doctors are doing that because they're jealous?

28:16.480 --> 28:17.200
I don't think so.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.000
I don't think they know what I'm doing.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.800
Would you say how many who's who would you say Sidney has saved more lives?

28:26.800 --> 28:29.360
OK, this is interesting because we get emails from people.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.520
They're like, you saved my life.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.640
Yeah, you really made me laugh.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.840
Us or a doctor.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.340
You.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.240
A doctor, me.

28:36.240 --> 28:36.960
OK, yeah.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.880
OK, but let's change the parameters.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.920
OK, OK, think about it this way, right?

28:41.920 --> 28:42.800
You're strong, right?

28:42.800 --> 28:47.280
You could pick up 50 pound weight and very tiny picks up a big crumb.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.800
I think that's more impressive.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.040
Right.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.600
So you may have saved more lives, but the amount we've saved comparatively.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.120
We are a pizza rat.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.320
Yeah, you see us saving our life and you're like,

28:58.320 --> 29:02.560
that shouldn't be them doing that, but we're going to do it anyway.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.480
I guess what I'm saying is, are you proud of us?

29:05.280 --> 29:06.240
Of course I'm proud.

29:07.920 --> 29:12.640
You all have definitely your skill set has brought a lot more joy to people

29:12.640 --> 29:14.800
than I think my skill set does.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.240
But the problem is you also do podcasts and I do not doctor.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.560
So you still handily whip my ass.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.720
Yeah, Sidney, thank you so much for joining us.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.600
Will you at some point, will you see if Charlie wants to come in?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.760
We'll get a real Bim Bam fan on here.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.480
She will.

29:30.480 --> 29:30.720
Yeah.

29:30.720 --> 29:31.920
Are you sure you're ready for that?

29:31.920 --> 29:34.320
Could I get my wife in to talk about how great I am?

29:34.320 --> 29:37.200
Sure, yes, I guess.

29:37.200 --> 29:37.440
Okay.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.120
But we got to hurt, we're running out of time.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.920
It's just that you guys, you got to talk to your wives

29:43.920 --> 29:45.440
and I just miss Teresa a lot.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
Yeah, I know, but look at the time.

29:47.440 --> 29:47.760
Yeah, I know.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.720
Where does it go?

29:48.720 --> 29:51.200
I mean, we're only a half an hour into our hour long show.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.360
Wow, okay, we have time for lots of special guests.

29:53.360 --> 29:53.600
Yeah.

29:54.160 --> 29:54.960
Thank you, Sidney.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.520
Thank you all.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.640
I'm going to go blast off in the bathroom while we wait for our next guest.

29:58.640 --> 30:03.200
All right, this is a segment where Travis and I talk about Griffin who has left the room.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.200
Do you want me to get pissy, sir?

30:05.200 --> 30:05.760
Yes, please.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.280
I just think I might not edit this one.

30:09.280 --> 30:09.760
Oh?

30:10.240 --> 30:11.680
Yeah, I think I might just leave all this.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.560
Wouldn't that be fun?

30:12.560 --> 30:16.480
I mean, Justin and I were really quiet while you peed so we could hear it through the microphone.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.280
Oh, cool.

30:17.280 --> 30:17.680
Yeah.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.720
That's authentic.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.720
That is, that's that rough and raw stuff, you know?

30:20.720 --> 30:25.920
Let's listen to how Justin would do it.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.400
Uh-oh.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.280
It's really quiet.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.000
Maybe he's nervous.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.680
I hear it a little bit.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.280
Maybe we should open the door.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.480
Just open the door.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.840
The acoustics are bad.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.160
We need to get room tone on your pissies.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.040
We're going to have you finish this bottle of water and do a take two.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.040
Real quick before he gets back, Travis, you're my favorite.

30:41.040 --> 30:41.920
Okay, thanks.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.400
All right, just count us back in.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.120
Okay, it was just your pissy was real quiet.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.320
And a three and a four.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.160
You know what to do.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.240
Uh, do you want to do another catch up?

30:52.240 --> 30:52.400
Yeah.

30:52.400 --> 30:52.960
Want to check in?

30:52.960 --> 30:53.680
My wife?

30:53.680 --> 30:54.080
Yeah.

30:54.080 --> 30:54.880
My wife.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.760
My wife.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.120
I legitimately thought I had a problem with the weird excess chocolate in my office,

30:59.120 --> 31:02.880
but Justin being like, just throw it away, made me feel much better.

31:02.880 --> 31:07.120
I have not thrown away the old chocolate, but it comforts me to know that the chocolate police

31:07.120 --> 31:08.800
will not come for me if I do.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.480
I would now appreciate your advice on whether I should make a sign for my office with the

31:12.480 --> 31:18.560
nickname you gave me, Dr. Prematorium's Fudge-a-matorium.

31:18.560 --> 31:19.440
That's good shit.

31:19.440 --> 31:19.920
Yeah.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.880
Hi, honey.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.440
Hello.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.640
Yes, make that sign.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.920
Hello, welcome.

31:23.920 --> 31:27.040
That was a pretty low stakes sort of problem that we saw too, huh?

31:27.040 --> 31:30.640
Yeah, we did start doing a lot more slow pitches in our later years.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.720
Well, you can only do so much roommate shit.

31:33.360 --> 31:39.360
Now, uh, joining us in the studio is the co-host of, uh, Shmanners, a wildly popular

31:39.360 --> 31:41.600
advice cast, uh, that I also happen to be on.

31:41.600 --> 31:46.560
And, uh, it's Teresa McElroy, and she also, she and I started dating two months before

31:46.560 --> 31:48.240
we started recording My Brother, My Brother, Me.

31:48.240 --> 31:54.160
So she has been there from the beginning, and you've really seen me become unbearable.

31:54.160 --> 31:54.640
Is that true?

31:54.640 --> 31:55.120
It's true.

31:55.120 --> 31:55.600
Yeah.

31:55.600 --> 32:01.760
I think that the, that the real catalyst for, um, Travis's head not fitting through the

32:01.760 --> 32:04.880
door anymore is the thank Travis for Travis.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.680
Yeah, that did happen.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.200
I think I started myself.

32:07.200 --> 32:07.920
I think you did.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.840
Which is, yeah, very appropriate.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.480
Yeah, that's the thing.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.240
It's like, oh, who said that first?

32:14.240 --> 32:14.800
I did.

32:14.800 --> 32:20.640
I love, I love, um, that Teresa needed basically no prompting to get into that.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.240
Someone said, hey, isn't Travis kind of, and she just ripped the sleeves off her shirt.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.160
It's like, let's fucking go.

32:26.160 --> 32:30.320
Well, here's the thing, here's what people don't see, the listeners at home, is that

32:30.320 --> 32:32.320
my wife does not think I'm funny.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.960
And so the balance there is like-

32:34.960 --> 32:36.880
I like to make him work pretty hard for it.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.200
I'll come out and be like, hey, listen to this funny thing I did.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.880
And she'll just look at me like, that's dumb.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.040
And I'm like, oh no, people laughed at it on Twitter.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.400
Have you heard about play along at home?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.200
Um, I have.

32:47.200 --> 32:47.760
What do you think?

32:47.760 --> 32:48.320
Let's get your thoughts on-

32:48.320 --> 32:49.440
In the dark moments.

32:51.040 --> 32:56.240
In the dark times with Travis staring into a mirror lit only by candles and his own sadness.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.280
And he says, maybe I should stop doing play along at home.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.680
That is the opposite of what happens, good sir.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.760
I come busting into whatever room she's in like, listen to these questions I wrote.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.760
You'll never believe what I found out about squirrels.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.960
What's your feelings on play along at home?

33:10.960 --> 33:14.560
Well, the first time that he came to me with this quiz, I said,

33:14.560 --> 33:17.200
so is this quiz for your brothers or for the listeners?

33:17.920 --> 33:18.880
And he said-

33:18.880 --> 33:20.000
A good important question.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.360
He said, yes, it's for everyone.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.120
It's for everyone, so play along at home.

33:25.120 --> 33:25.760
Okay.

33:25.760 --> 33:33.040
And I thought that these would be maybe like, like it would be some kind of like trivia game.

33:33.040 --> 33:33.840
It is.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.720
But it's not really.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.520
Now, honey, would you say that maybe I happen to have a certain,

33:40.240 --> 33:44.880
I don't know, dark desire to create things that only I find funny?

33:45.520 --> 33:46.800
Oh, you mean like sad libs?

33:46.800 --> 33:51.600
Like sad libs and play along at home and pretty much half the stuff I find-

33:51.600 --> 33:53.120
All the jokes you've ever said.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.640
Yeah, it says like, I find that you can't please-

33:56.640 --> 33:58.240
Okay, I heard that, Justin.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.400
Not all the jokes, you're right.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.920
Honestly, you've honed me, I would say to a razor sharp edge.

34:03.920 --> 34:08.160
Only of my best stuff makes it on air now.

34:08.160 --> 34:12.960
Now tell me, is play along at home part of the razor?

34:12.960 --> 34:15.440
Hey, you wouldn't believe the other shit I don't use.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.720
Now, Charlize, what is your favorite episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me?

34:21.280 --> 34:24.480
Well, I would be remiss if I didn't say Spaghetti Gettin' One.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.680
You are the first of the wives to actually name an episode, so thank you.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.640
Thank you for that.

34:30.640 --> 34:34.800
What's your favorite bit?

34:34.800 --> 34:39.040
Does Fugue for Tin Brothers, does that count as a bit?

34:39.040 --> 34:40.160
I think it does, yes.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.560
I don't think so, we didn't really write that.

34:42.560 --> 34:42.880
Right.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.440
Technically, Lin stole the music for it, so-

34:45.440 --> 34:46.160
And our jokes.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.920
So he didn't really write it either.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.480
So that's the real noodle scratcher.

34:50.480 --> 34:50.800
It is.

34:51.680 --> 34:52.720
Who wrote that?

34:52.720 --> 34:53.840
This is like that time travel-

34:53.840 --> 34:55.600
To whom does the bit belong?

34:55.600 --> 34:59.360
Exactly, if I go back in time and I hand Shakespeare a copy of Hamlet,

34:59.360 --> 35:00.880
and then he uses that to make Hamlet.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.400
Who wrote Hamlet, right?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.000
Still Shakespeare, or I guess who-

35:04.800 --> 35:07.680
No, because I'm creating a cyclical loop of where did I get it from?

35:08.400 --> 35:09.280
Shakespeare.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.520
Okay, but I'm taking it back to him and giving it to him,

35:11.520 --> 35:13.920
and he's using that to make Hamlet.

35:13.920 --> 35:16.800
Yeah, but you still gave it to him because you had it from Shakespeare.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.320
Damn, Griffin, you solved it.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.760
What he's not saying is then he disappears from the photograph, right?

35:21.760 --> 35:23.200
Why is Shakespeare in the photograph?

35:23.200 --> 35:24.720
Who took a photograph of Shakespeare?

35:24.720 --> 35:27.200
And then you gotta get Shakespeare and Mrs. Shakespeare

35:27.200 --> 35:29.360
to hook up in a car at their junior prom.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.400
Gotta get Biff out of there.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.680
What if he went back too far and you gave it to teenage Shakespeare

35:35.680 --> 35:37.920
and he wrote it was like, pfft, this sucks.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.240
Bring me to play with jugs.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.960
And then he never wrote anything.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.560
But then he wrote Romeo and Juliet.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.840
Sure, right, okay, that's fair.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.040
Teresa Marie, thank you so much for joining us.

35:49.040 --> 35:52.960
And for making our brother a better person.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.240
A thankless job that made Justin a better person.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.680
You've got so many more miles to go, Teresa.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.600
I am a bearable person now.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.160
You're my favorite person, Travis.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.040
Thank you, you're my favorite too.

36:05.040 --> 36:05.600
I love you.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.160
I love you too.

36:07.280 --> 36:09.840
Oh no, they're kissing, they're friction right on the table.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.320
That's how we do it.

36:12.320 --> 36:15.200
And I hope that your listeners know that it's all in good fun.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.240
We rib each other.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.520
Apparently not my jokes.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.680
No, your jokes are terrible.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.680
She got the memo, man.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.720
Post 500, ripping that butt.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.920
Thank you, Teresa.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.720
You're welcome.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.600
She's ripping that butt.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.280
She's ripping your butt, dude.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.640
Okay, so we have in the room now.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.760
Griffin went to go get Henry.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.360
I don't know how long we're gonna have him.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.240
Bebe, hello.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.160
Hello.

36:38.160 --> 36:38.960
Well, that's Charlie.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.040
That was a no from Henry.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.800
That's a big no from Henry.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.300
Okay.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.760
Griffin, you share a microphone with me.

36:45.760 --> 36:46.560
Okay.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.600
That's a rubber glove.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.360
That's a rubber glove, Charlie.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.800
Why does Travis have that in his office?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.000
That's a great question.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.760
Is it for weird bad stuff?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.120
No, it's for my hair.

36:57.280 --> 36:57.840
Hi, Bebe.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.200
Please don't call me Travis, Bebe.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.960
You know I don't like that.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.640
Stop touching the microphone, Charlie.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.920
Wait, good mic technique.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.400
Come on, baby.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.200
Good mic technique.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.240
We've done our drills at home.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.040
Hi.

37:07.040 --> 37:07.840
Hi, Charlie.

37:07.840 --> 37:10.640
What's your favorite bit?

37:10.640 --> 37:12.560
Like you watch, you know how sometimes you and I,

37:12.560 --> 37:17.280
before you go to bed, watch at your asking for it,

37:17.280 --> 37:19.680
watch some My Brother, My Brother, Me cartoons

37:19.680 --> 37:21.120
that people make on YouTube?

37:21.120 --> 37:22.320
You know how we watch this sometimes?

37:23.040 --> 37:25.840
The one about ice cream

37:25.840 --> 37:28.560
or the one where you make a new outfit for that?

37:28.560 --> 37:29.680
Those are my two faves.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.560
Oh, is the one about ice cream the one with the flavor brown?

37:32.560 --> 37:32.960
Yeah.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.000
Yeah, that was pretty good.

37:34.000 --> 37:34.880
How's that song go?

37:35.840 --> 37:36.880
Well, I forgot.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.360
Do you want ice cream?

37:39.360 --> 37:40.960
Oh, that dreamy, screaming cream

37:40.960 --> 37:43.520
and the chocolate flavor of vanilla bean.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.920
I want to switch.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.680
Okay, do you want to come over and sit with me?

37:47.680 --> 37:48.720
Hey, Bebe.

37:48.720 --> 37:49.920
Why don't you, why don't you-

37:49.920 --> 37:50.480
There you go.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.680
Yeah, go sit over there, cousins.

37:52.720 --> 37:53.600
Oh, that's great.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.720
Charlie, if you did a podcast about anything,

37:56.720 --> 37:58.160
what would you do a podcast about?

37:58.720 --> 37:59.280
Candy.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.440
Okay, what would you say about candy?

38:02.240 --> 38:04.000
That I love candy

38:04.000 --> 38:07.120
and we'll talk about all the different kinds of candy.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.560
Yeah, Bebe, what's your favorite candy?

38:11.360 --> 38:13.120
Like those weird little strawberry hard candies

38:13.120 --> 38:14.000
with Gush in the middle?

38:15.440 --> 38:16.400
You like the gummies too.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.680
Do you like sour gummies?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.120
I don't.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.680
Well, I like sweet gummies.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.080
Okay.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.920
Okay, cousins, don't fight over the microphones, please.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.840
Charlie, do you think Marin was overrated

38:25.840 --> 38:27.680
just because he's been on the scene for so long?

38:27.680 --> 38:28.180
Yeah.

38:28.960 --> 38:29.680
Maybe.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.080
Yeah, maybe.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.440
Do you think when cereal came around

38:31.440 --> 38:33.440
and sort of like opened up a lot of people to podcasting-

38:33.440 --> 38:35.840
Bebe, don't play with the wind filter, please.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.800
Leave the wind filter there.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.120
Just leave them right there.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.160
We don't need to touch it anymore.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.200
Hey, Bebe, don't touch.

38:41.200 --> 38:41.680
Don't touch.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.840
So, Charlie, I was asking you about cereal season one.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.560
It seemed to really cause a real zeitgeist.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.200
Do you think that was for the positive or for the negative?

38:49.200 --> 38:49.920
Do you think?

38:49.920 --> 38:51.520
I'd like a critical analysis.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.560
What do you think about cereal?

38:53.840 --> 38:55.040
It's amazing.

38:55.040 --> 38:55.200
Yeah.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.440
What is your favorite thing about cereal?

38:58.160 --> 39:04.080
That when some cereals get soggy, it gets really sweet.

39:04.080 --> 39:04.800
Yeah.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.480
Bebe, do you like cereal?

39:06.480 --> 39:06.960
Yes.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.000
What's your favorite cereal?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.280
Strawberry.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.160
You like strawberry.

39:10.160 --> 39:12.160
Okay, I'm picking up that I think-

39:12.160 --> 39:13.760
Is your favorite food strawberries?

39:14.480 --> 39:15.200
Yes.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.640
Yeah, strawberries are pretty good.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.560
What's your favorite My Brother, My Brother, and Me bit?

39:20.640 --> 39:22.720
You silly, Daddy.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.440
Okay.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.320
I am pretty silly.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.760
Do you think Daddy's funny?

39:25.760 --> 39:26.480
Yes.

39:26.480 --> 39:26.800
Yeah.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.960
Hey, can I ask you a question, Bebe?

39:28.960 --> 39:29.920
What?

39:29.920 --> 39:31.600
How do you feel about play along at home?

39:32.960 --> 39:34.400
Do you like it or is it really bad?

39:35.360 --> 39:36.560
I like it.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.800
Yeah, that's who I'm doing it for.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.200
Okay.

39:39.200 --> 39:39.760
My turn.

39:39.760 --> 39:42.240
Okay, Charlie, what do you think about play along at home?

39:42.240 --> 39:43.520
It's amazing.

39:43.520 --> 39:43.840
Yeah.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.480
Wow.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.480
Hey, I'm resonating with the younger generation.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.080
I'm picking up that new demographic.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.200
That's interesting.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.720
Do you think that Uncle Travis and Uncle Griffin are too mean to Daddy

39:52.720 --> 39:55.200
about opening his refreshing sodas in the middle of the show?

39:55.200 --> 39:55.760
I knew it.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.840
Maybe.

39:59.840 --> 40:00.320
Maybe.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.320
But he does kind of grip it and rip it, right?

40:02.320 --> 40:03.840
He grips it and he rips it, right?

40:03.840 --> 40:06.000
He really makes a meal of it.

40:07.200 --> 40:07.520
No.

40:08.160 --> 40:08.480
No.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.200
Charlie, do you have any other favorite My Brother, My Brother, and Me bits

40:11.200 --> 40:13.120
that you'd like to share with us?

40:15.520 --> 40:17.360
No, those are the only two.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.080
Only those two?

40:19.760 --> 40:20.800
Silly Justin.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.400
Bebe, we've been thinking about rebranding.

40:22.400 --> 40:23.760
Can you think of another title?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.360
Like what else the show could be called?

40:25.360 --> 40:27.280
No, me.

40:27.280 --> 40:34.880
Uncle Travis, what's your favorite, favorite of your podcast?

40:34.880 --> 40:35.380
Me.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.680
Oh, good question, Charlie.

40:37.680 --> 40:42.320
My favorite bit is there is an episode where we talk about Tim Curry

40:42.320 --> 40:44.480
driving an ice cream truck and he says,

40:44.480 --> 40:47.120
I'm hanging out in here with Pikachu and Charmander.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.240
I'm chilling in here with Pikachu and Charmander.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.800
Charizard, pump the brakes.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.720
Charizard is driving a pylon.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.400
We're all eating push pops.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.800
And the way that Griffin says it backs me up every time I think about it.

41:02.800 --> 41:09.040
With Charmander.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.320
Bebe, will you tell us a joke?

41:12.640 --> 41:12.880
What?

41:15.040 --> 41:16.400
Charlie, that's a pretty good joke.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.360
Hey, Bebe, guess what?

41:18.880 --> 41:19.440
Chicken butt.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.360
That's actually way better than Travis's.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.360
Hey, Charlie, can you tell it?

41:29.360 --> 41:31.840
Can you tell us a joke?

41:31.840 --> 41:32.560
Do you know a joke?

41:32.560 --> 41:34.240
All right, now don't be silly.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.840
Joke telling is deadly serious.

41:35.840 --> 41:36.240
Yeah.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.280
Guess who?

41:37.280 --> 41:37.600
Who?

41:38.160 --> 41:39.440
Chicken poo.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.000
That's good.

41:40.000 --> 41:40.400
That's good.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.120
That kind of was the same formula.

41:43.120 --> 41:43.360
Why?

41:43.360 --> 41:44.640
Chicken pee.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.280
Chicken pee?

41:46.080 --> 41:46.640
It's pretty good.

41:47.280 --> 41:50.000
This show used to be about something, wouldn't you say, Charlie?

41:50.000 --> 41:50.400
Yeah.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.160
Charlie, what do you think this show's about?

41:52.160 --> 41:53.600
Yeah, what does My Brother, My Brother mean about?

41:53.600 --> 41:55.280
If you had to tell a friend what our-

41:55.280 --> 41:56.240
Chicken poop.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.680
It's about chicken poop.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.200
Chicken hand.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.080
Chicken hand.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.280
Yeah, it's another part of the chicken.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.640
If you had to tell-

42:02.640 --> 42:03.760
Chicken nose.

42:03.760 --> 42:07.120
Hey, Charlie, would you say that Justin has changed since he had kids?

42:07.120 --> 42:08.080
Chicken poop.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.200
Do you think I'm different since I had kids?

42:09.200 --> 42:10.640
Bebe, please stop talking about chicken poop.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.000
I've never been a lot of chicken poop.

42:14.000 --> 42:14.960
Yeah, that's wild, isn't it?

42:14.960 --> 42:15.440
That's a good point.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.960
All right, well-

42:16.960 --> 42:17.760
All right, thanks, guys.

42:17.760 --> 42:18.640
Thanks, cousins.

42:18.640 --> 42:19.200
I love you.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.160
Well, then you got to bring something.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.880
Bebe, stop hanging off the microphone.

42:27.680 --> 42:28.480
No, no, no.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.400
I mean like a bit or something.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.520
Like a story or-

42:31.520 --> 42:32.720
Bebe, would you guys sing a song?

42:32.720 --> 42:34.000
Oh, hey, she does celebrity impressions.

42:34.000 --> 42:34.320
Oh.

42:34.320 --> 42:35.280
Oh, tight.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.240
Do Michael Keaton.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.920
No, do a celebrity impression.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.000
One of your best ones.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.120
Is that Spongebob?

42:45.120 --> 42:45.600
Yeah.

42:45.600 --> 42:46.240
Very good.

42:46.240 --> 42:46.640
Very good.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.360
All right, thanks, Charlie.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.080
One more.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.120
Okay, she got one more.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.320
Just a little bit more heat.

42:50.320 --> 42:50.640
Uh-oh.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.920
Bebe's going to walk the room and explore the space.

42:55.920 --> 42:58.240
She has to move the microphone from the stand.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.000
Charlie, do your impression.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
Kermit the Frog here.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.200
That's good stuff.

43:03.200 --> 43:03.920
That's very good.

43:03.920 --> 43:04.640
I love it.

43:04.640 --> 43:05.760
Bebe, do you want to sing a song?

43:05.760 --> 43:12.640
Twinkle, twinkle in the stars.

43:12.640 --> 43:17.360
How I wonder what you are.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.720
Can I sing a song?

43:18.720 --> 43:19.440
Sure, Charlie.

43:20.640 --> 43:24.160
All the other girls here are stars.

43:24.160 --> 43:28.240
Beyond the northern lights.

43:28.240 --> 43:32.480
They try to shine into your current life.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.560
Too close and too bright.

43:35.440 --> 43:37.840
They try and they try.

43:37.840 --> 43:42.320
But everything that they do is a ghost of a trace.

43:42.320 --> 43:46.080
I'm a pale imitation of you.

43:46.080 --> 43:50.880
I'll be the one to drive you back home, Kathleen.

43:51.840 --> 43:52.400
Yay.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.080
Wow, that's really good, Charlie.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.360
Well done.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.040
She wrote that last week, actually.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.320
I told her it wasn't good enough.

43:58.320 --> 43:58.800
I'm sorry.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.240
We're going to keep retooling it.

44:00.240 --> 44:00.800
Come on.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.080
All right, you two kids out of here.

44:02.080 --> 44:02.640
Bye, Charlie.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.280
Bye, Bebe.

44:03.280 --> 44:03.920
Bye, cousins.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.760
Leave the microphone, Charlie.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.640
Charlie, leave the microphone.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.600
She's doing an Airhead-style protest where she won't leave the studio.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.000
She's got a gun full of hot sauce.

44:12.000 --> 44:12.640
Good job, guys.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.920
Guys, I just figured out how we're going to amp this episode up.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.560
We got a microphone.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.440
We can take out the thing.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.880
You got a pull-up bar.

44:22.880 --> 44:23.600
I say...

44:23.600 --> 44:25.760
Oh, we're all going to see how many pull-ups we can do?

44:25.760 --> 44:27.840
I think this episode has got to have a pull-up contest.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.400
Okay.

44:28.400 --> 44:28.960
Yeah, all right.

44:30.080 --> 44:33.840
Now, Griffin, we'll just take turns holding the microphone up to the person doing the pull-up.

44:33.840 --> 44:34.640
Yeah, it's fucking tight.

44:34.640 --> 44:35.360
This is good.

44:35.360 --> 44:39.120
Travis, move your big basket of laundry that you have in your office for some reason out of the way.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.320
That's where my closet is.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.480
Yeah, again, in the office is a strange...

44:42.480 --> 44:42.960
Okay, wow.

44:42.960 --> 44:43.920
That's a big closet.

44:43.920 --> 44:44.640
Yeah, sure.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.480
Get a big bag of barbecue.

44:46.480 --> 44:48.000
It's not a bag of barbecue.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.520
Just the usual office shit.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.000
I cleaned it up.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.800
I cleaned it up so that you could be in here.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.720
Okay, so who's going to go first?

44:54.720 --> 44:55.440
How secure is this?

44:55.440 --> 44:57.280
Because I already ate shit once.

44:57.280 --> 44:57.840
It's secure.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.880
Hang on all the time.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.120
Okay, so do you use this?

45:01.120 --> 45:04.080
Well, you can use hands like this or hands like this.

45:04.080 --> 45:05.200
Can you do a pull-up?

45:05.200 --> 45:05.520
Yeah.

45:05.520 --> 45:06.720
I've never done one before.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.360
You can do it.

45:07.360 --> 45:12.160
In middle school, I tried to do one and the doctor, the gym doctor, told me to just stop.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.960
If you want to do a pull-up...

45:14.960 --> 45:16.160
Just go ahead now.

45:16.160 --> 45:16.480
All right.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.120
Okay, do it.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.680
What are we counting as a pull-up?

45:19.680 --> 45:20.480
If it goes...

45:20.480 --> 45:22.480
Get your chin up to your hand level.

45:23.840 --> 45:24.480
One.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.200
Oh my God.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.760
Two.

45:27.760 --> 45:28.960
I can't do more than two.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.920
All right, Justin, you're up.

45:29.920 --> 45:30.400
Dude, that was...

45:30.400 --> 45:33.040
Hey guys, that was my first pull-up ever in my life.

45:33.040 --> 45:33.680
That was two.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.320
Okay, that was two pull-ups.

45:36.320 --> 45:36.720
Here we go.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.040
This isn't fair.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.120
I have more weight than Griffin does to pull up.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.160
You got more power though.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.600
Yeah, you have more torque.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.680
You could really stomp my ass if you wanted to.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.320
I won't be at that.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.000
I didn't realize that I came up with the idea.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.280
You are literally hoisting on your own batard.

45:55.280 --> 45:55.840
One.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.480
Baby.

45:56.480 --> 45:56.800
One.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.280
That's good.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.080
That's one.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.920
Oh, this is a bad idea.

45:59.920 --> 46:00.400
All right.

46:00.400 --> 46:02.320
Let's see how Dougie Big Arms does it.

46:02.320 --> 46:03.440
Here we go, Dougie Big Arms.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.320
That's one.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.200
That's two.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.120
His neck looks crazy and big.

46:07.120 --> 46:07.600
That was three.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.400
That's all you needed.

46:08.400 --> 46:11.840
Yeah, all I needed to do was three to win and it's because I've been working out.

46:11.840 --> 46:14.480
My guts hurt real bad.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.840
Yeah, sure, babe.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.640
Yeah, bud.

46:16.640 --> 46:20.320
Hey, you got any more catch-ups, check-ins?

46:20.320 --> 46:21.520
A check-in would be nice.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.720
I would like to pause it if we can...

46:24.720 --> 46:25.520
All right, let's pause it.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.760
Let's get real for just a second.

46:28.400 --> 46:33.920
We don't have to get saccharine, but I want to ask you guys your favorite sort of memory

46:33.920 --> 46:37.040
associated with us doing this show.

46:37.040 --> 46:37.680
Oh, cool.

46:37.680 --> 46:42.560
Like for dad, like doing that first task at the Wilbur, that was huge.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.200
That was a wild...

46:43.200 --> 46:46.800
That was our first show that I remember thinking like, this is fucking wild.

46:46.800 --> 46:47.840
This is getting out of hand.

46:47.840 --> 46:54.800
I will never forget the first live show we ever did was opening for Jordan Jesse Go at

46:54.800 --> 46:55.920
Second City in Chicago.

46:56.640 --> 47:03.200
And we were very nervous to do it because we'd never done it live and we'd always relied

47:03.200 --> 47:04.000
on it at that point.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.120
I think we were literally at a year at that point, almost exactly.

47:07.120 --> 47:09.520
Yeah, because it was on my birthday and we started on April 10th.

47:09.520 --> 47:10.720
My birthday is April 17th.

47:10.720 --> 47:15.600
And so we went out and I at that point called my girlfriend, Teresa, and I was like, I'm

47:15.600 --> 47:16.160
so nervous.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.320
She was like, just focus on making your brothers laugh.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.200
Just don't worry about it.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.320
I did a throw up backstage.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.120
I did a literal mom skeddy right there.

47:23.120 --> 47:23.920
That's not a joke.

47:23.920 --> 47:24.880
I did that with my body.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.880
And then the show went super great.

47:26.880 --> 47:31.360
And it was the first time I had heard people laugh in the room at things we were saying

47:31.360 --> 47:31.920
and enjoy it.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.120
And that was very special.

47:34.240 --> 47:38.880
I think, and it's why we haven't talked about Max Fun since we've been doing this wrap up

47:38.880 --> 47:43.440
episode, but it's been mostly sort of bits and bytes and goofs and pranks and stuff.

47:44.240 --> 47:53.200
But I remember waiting in line at Trader Joe's in Chicago with like two feet of snow on the

47:53.200 --> 47:53.440
ground.

47:53.440 --> 47:55.760
And I just walked and I was miserable and soggy.

47:55.760 --> 47:59.440
And while I was checking out, I checked my email on my phone and there was one from Jesse

48:00.240 --> 48:01.600
inviting us to be on the network.

48:01.600 --> 48:05.120
And that was like, that's the most memorable moment.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.800
That was a defining moment.

48:06.800 --> 48:10.400
That's where it was like, hey, this is like, we're going to make money.

48:10.400 --> 48:11.120
Dude, this is a job.

48:11.120 --> 48:14.800
Yeah, this could be more than just a hobby.

48:14.800 --> 48:20.480
And also we were all such big fans of his show and a bunch of Max Fun stuff.

48:20.480 --> 48:26.160
And so the idea of, it was like meeting a celeb and you feel this weird like, oh, our

48:26.160 --> 48:29.200
worlds are weirdly intersecting at this one moment.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.720
Only it's not just the one moment.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.880
It's like all the moments after.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.680
That was so nice.

48:33.680 --> 48:42.960
I think that was when we filmed the Candle Nights episode of the TV show and the having

48:42.960 --> 48:48.320
the crowd of people there and like all our family being there and the filming and everything.

48:48.320 --> 48:52.480
It really felt like, I don't know, it really felt like a thing.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.920
Like we had like, it was one of the rare times where I've taken to say, you know, it's

48:55.920 --> 49:01.840
hard when you make a podcast every week, there's another one to make.

49:01.840 --> 49:05.760
So you very rarely like, that's part of the joke I think with us talking about like

49:05.760 --> 49:07.600
favorite bits, favorite episodes or whatever.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.920
Like, I don't know, we have to do another one next week.

49:09.920 --> 49:11.600
You can't rest on your laurels too much.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.040
It's just, you got to do another one.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.360
So I think that was one of the few moments that actually took the time to realize how

49:17.360 --> 49:21.200
far we'd come and how cool was what we get to do.

49:21.200 --> 49:25.920
Yeah, you like, you know, getting pretty emotional during that shoot.

49:25.920 --> 49:33.120
Like, I don't know that a lot of people realize like, that was our, and J.D. Amato taught

49:33.120 --> 49:38.400
us this term as he taught us so many things because he single-handedly saved that show

49:38.400 --> 49:45.440
and is a lifelong member of the of the fam, the martini shot, as he called it.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.080
That was the last thing we filmed, like that scene about sitting there.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.640
And it was a scary thing like us doing the TV show.

49:50.640 --> 49:51.760
We had no idea what we're doing.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.120
And this was like this weird, cathartic, we had just done the show.

49:55.120 --> 50:01.280
I had just fucking smashed the mayor's car with the car, just fucking annihilated it

50:01.280 --> 50:02.080
earlier in the day.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.240
So I had a lot of emotions going on.

50:04.240 --> 50:07.200
And to have that be the last thing we shot, that's standout.

50:07.200 --> 50:12.320
That's been for me, like a recurring theme from the beginning, because the truth is,

50:12.320 --> 50:16.560
the honest thing is going into it, Justin and Griffin were already doing the joystick

50:16.560 --> 50:23.040
podcast and I wasn't doing anything that was like of any kind of public interest whatsoever.

50:23.040 --> 50:28.640
Or and Justin, you know, whoever came up with the idea first, I think it was Justin.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.560
But like, let's do a podcast.

50:30.560 --> 50:31.520
And then it was Justin.

50:31.520 --> 50:31.760
Yeah.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.960
When we went into that first episode, Justin said, we're just going to do like a test

50:34.960 --> 50:36.400
one to see how it goes.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.240
And I was so nervous.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.640
But him saying like, this is just like for practice.

50:40.640 --> 50:41.680
And I was like, oh, OK.

50:41.680 --> 50:42.800
So then I was able to do it.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.040
Yeah.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.080
And then we finished recording.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.640
I still have to tell Travis that actually before every episode.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.440
And then we finished recording.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.360
Justin's like, OK, yeah, we'll just publish that.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.920
And I was like, oh, thank God I didn't know we were publishing before.

50:51.920 --> 50:53.200
It would have been so in my head.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.600
And then people received it well and liked it.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.200
And I'm like, it was nice.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.280
So I guess, you know what?

50:59.280 --> 51:00.320
Let's go ahead and call it there.

51:00.320 --> 51:02.880
This has been a wonderful time of reflection and growth.

51:02.880 --> 51:04.880
I want to say thank you to everyone who sent in updates.

51:04.880 --> 51:06.400
I'm sorry we only did two.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.840
Can you just rattle some off?

51:07.840 --> 51:09.440
I think that it would be-

51:09.440 --> 51:14.640
Back in October 2016, I wrote in saying that my wife and I bought a house and found 280

51:14.640 --> 51:18.640
rolls of toilet paper in unopened 40-roll boxes in the attic.

51:18.640 --> 51:22.160
There's 45 rolls left, and I just got the last box down for the attic.

51:22.160 --> 51:25.840
And I'm getting nervous because I can't go back to buying toilet paper after living like this.

51:25.840 --> 51:29.520
I can run the numbers and figure out how much shitting you're doing, my man.

51:30.640 --> 51:31.040
Let's see.

51:31.040 --> 51:35.760
You answer a question about my roommate about starting a bone collection on episode 476.

51:35.760 --> 51:39.040
I did follow your advice and just asked my roommates how to start a collection.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.520
But before they could help me, they turned out to be shitty people.

51:41.520 --> 51:42.320
So I'm moving out.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.720
Good news, I thought I-

51:45.440 --> 51:46.000
Good news, though.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.680
I asked my dad, who spends a lot of time in the woods, if he had any bones or advice

51:49.680 --> 51:52.720
how to get them, and now I have a pretty large collection.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.760
Thank you for your advice, even if my roommates turned out to be total jerks.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.520
Oh, this is a more recent one, but this one made me really happy.

52:00.080 --> 52:00.640
Hey, brothers.

52:00.640 --> 52:04.800
This is Calvin, the ravioli champion from the 2019 Candle Knights episode.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.640
I decided to take your advice and start training an heir to the ravioli throne.

52:08.640 --> 52:13.200
There's a young lady who also works at the camp who has been a competitor in the past,

52:13.200 --> 52:15.600
and she has the stomach of a true champion.

52:15.600 --> 52:18.400
We've talked and decided that I will tab out early this year,

52:18.400 --> 52:22.960
after a reasonable healthy ravioli, and in the same moment announce my successor

52:22.960 --> 52:25.440
and continue to coach her for the remainder of the meal.

52:25.440 --> 52:28.240
It will be a true move me moment, just like Rocky.

52:28.240 --> 52:31.520
Thank you for the advice on my positive situation and happy 500.

52:32.400 --> 52:35.920
A while back, I sent you a question about a fast food joint with an employee that wouldn't

52:35.920 --> 52:38.320
take my family's order until we solved his riddles.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.200
This led to you-

52:39.200 --> 52:44.320
This led you to the website riddles.com, which then grew into the segment riddle me piss.

52:44.320 --> 52:47.280
After listening to the episode, my family and I returned to the restaurant,

52:47.280 --> 52:50.000
only to find the burrito riddler wasn't working there anymore.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.880
In fact, we don't know where he went, or if he was real.

52:52.880 --> 52:56.240
And to this day, what should I do if I see him out in the world,

52:56.240 --> 53:00.160
continuing his chaotic work of refusing service to people until they solve his riddles?

53:00.160 --> 53:03.520
And should I be prepared with a riddle myself, should we ever cross paths again?

53:03.520 --> 53:08.160
It's the people who wrote in with the updates asking us for more advice.

53:08.160 --> 53:08.560
Yes.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.120
Like you, everybody only gets one.

53:11.120 --> 53:11.920
Everybody gets one.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.360
Oh, here's one.

53:13.360 --> 53:18.560
In episode 102, you answered my question about how to cope with my then-boyfriend

53:18.560 --> 53:21.520
going on a two-month trip to Scotland to do field work.

53:21.520 --> 53:25.600
Justin had just gotten through Sydney's time abroad in Africa, so your response was,

53:25.600 --> 53:28.160
as usual, a mix of heartfelt advice and hilarious goops.

53:29.200 --> 53:34.160
In addition to suggesting eternal sunshining myself, you recommended my boyfriend bring

53:34.160 --> 53:39.680
back three baubles from the trip, which then led to a bit that made your anti-juggler stance

53:39.680 --> 53:42.320
part of the NBNBM canon.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.360
Damn, that was a big one then.

53:43.360 --> 53:44.480
Sorry, jugglers.

53:44.480 --> 53:48.080
Instead of pulling an eternal sunshine, we Skyped a lot and tried to stay busy.

53:48.080 --> 53:50.160
He did come back with three baubles from me.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.200
No juggling.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.960
And just a few months later, we got engaged.

53:52.960 --> 53:56.960
As of today, we've been married for almost seven years, and we are expecting our second

53:56.960 --> 53:57.760
child in April.

53:57.760 --> 53:58.000
Holy shit.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.680
Thank you for entertaining us through the years.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.280
We love you, Rachel and Joshua.

54:01.280 --> 54:01.840
That's big.

54:03.440 --> 54:07.520
That's another kind of unforgettable moment is that time we did the show in...

54:07.520 --> 54:08.240
That was Huntington.

54:08.240 --> 54:15.680
Okay, but I'm thinking about the show that we did in Wisconsin, where we had two and

54:15.680 --> 54:16.800
a half proposals.

54:16.800 --> 54:18.160
Yeah, right, right, right, yeah.

54:18.160 --> 54:19.360
Yeah, that was wild.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.440
I'd say maybe even the half proposal was probably the weirdest part.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.560
Yeah, that might be weird.

54:25.840 --> 54:29.280
Yeah, this has been a lot of fun, and it's been fun doing this.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.120
It's a shame we have to cancel the podcast.

54:32.240 --> 54:33.680
I wish we could keep doing it, but...

54:33.680 --> 54:37.440
I kept hoping that Jesse would call and say, I've changed my mind, but no, he's...

54:37.440 --> 54:40.800
Just to say he's proud of us, that also would be cool.

54:40.800 --> 54:41.920
Yeah, but our licenses run out.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.760
Our children are just screaming at us.

54:43.760 --> 54:45.920
They're just screaming and screaming.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.200
Thank you so much for listening.

54:47.840 --> 54:51.360
Thank you to you at home for everything you've done for us.

54:51.360 --> 54:52.160
We really can't thank you enough.

54:52.160 --> 54:56.720
The thing to me that I'm so thankful for you at home is everyone who has ever told

54:56.720 --> 55:01.600
someone else that they should check out the podcast, we owe you a debt of gratitude that

55:01.600 --> 55:02.640
can never be repaid.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.720
Yeah, it's the reason we're here.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.440
It's the reason we are here doing this still.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.520
I used to be able to say we've never paid for advertising, but one of you two dipshits

55:13.520 --> 55:18.080
did a Facebook campaign without talking to the other ones, and so now that's a lie.

55:18.080 --> 55:22.000
Now we've got Zuckerberg fucking beating down our necks, and we're part of the corporate

55:22.000 --> 55:22.320
machine.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.960
But before that, word of mouth was the only way that we got around.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.160
And it got around, we did.

55:28.160 --> 55:29.120
And that's all thanks to y'all.

55:29.120 --> 55:35.840
We're working on, it should be up soon in the merch store, a 500th episode challenge

55:35.840 --> 55:39.680
coin that's like, if you're part of that 500 club, you'll be able to show it with

55:39.680 --> 55:41.920
pride with the 500th coin.

55:42.560 --> 55:46.960
And as self-indulgent as this has been in, what, a month and a half, we're going to

55:46.960 --> 55:50.080
also be celebrating our 10-year anniversary, which is wild.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.600
And also I tried to run the numbers on how many episodes we've missed if we don't

55:53.600 --> 55:55.520
hit even 520.

55:55.520 --> 55:56.000
Not a lot.

55:56.640 --> 55:57.920
I guess not very many at all.

55:57.920 --> 55:59.600
Not enough, not enough.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.720
Yeah, we're going to take the next 30 episodes off.

56:03.440 --> 56:04.880
Do you have a final yahoo this time?

56:04.880 --> 56:05.840
Oh, I can pull one.

56:06.800 --> 56:07.280
Wow.

56:07.280 --> 56:13.040
Well, I just want to say, I also wanted to say thank you because it's weird.

56:13.040 --> 56:16.720
I feel like there's a gun to my head because there's children screaming like, be grateful

56:16.720 --> 56:17.280
faster.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.200
Well, let's do all the other stuff, right?

56:19.200 --> 56:23.840
Check out Maximumfun.org, our podcast home, John Roderick and the Longer Winters for

56:23.840 --> 56:28.000
the use of our theme song, Putting the Days of the-

56:28.000 --> 56:29.520
You never have to do this part, bud.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.400
It's a departure, is the name of the title of the track.

56:34.400 --> 56:38.480
Yeah, we're very grateful to be able to use that song.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.040
Also, just sort of final review.

56:41.040 --> 56:44.560
I never want to eat spaghetti before recording the podcast again.

56:44.560 --> 56:45.920
It did not make me funnier.

56:45.920 --> 56:52.000
It made my body sort of feel leaden and sagging.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.080
What you've learned is that the magic was in you all along.

56:56.080 --> 56:56.320
Yeah.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.880
You didn't need the magic spaghetti, or at least it was.

56:58.880 --> 56:59.840
I mean, was.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.040
He used up the magic.

57:01.040 --> 57:04.880
Or it's possible, yeah, 10 years ago, it's just my body wasn't just a big duffel bag

57:04.880 --> 57:07.920
full of socks like it is now.

57:08.720 --> 57:12.240
Also, a big thank you to all of our family, the ones who joined us on the episode today.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.920
Hello, I'm all of a family.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.520
I've been making this show happen for over 10 years.

57:19.520 --> 57:20.480
That's our producer.

57:20.480 --> 57:24.080
He's usually on my consider yourself my dad.

57:29.120 --> 57:32.560
You all have you all have changed our lives.

57:32.560 --> 57:35.760
This feels too like I don't know.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.880
It doesn't even cover it.

57:36.880 --> 57:42.160
Yeah, but it doesn't feel like it like created our the lives that we live now is because

57:42.160 --> 57:43.840
of the support you all have given us.

57:43.840 --> 57:49.280
And yeah, I don't know what my life would even look like without this show.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.120
And you boys, I love you both so much.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.320
I'm so glad I get to do this show with you guys every week.

57:54.320 --> 57:56.080
It is it is amazing.

57:56.080 --> 58:01.440
Now every week on this show, as you know, at this point, Griffin gives us a Yahoo!

58:01.440 --> 58:04.000
And we come back next week and talk about it.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.120
Talk about our thoughts.

58:05.120 --> 58:05.520
Yeah.

58:05.520 --> 58:06.800
Griffin, what do you got for us?

58:06.800 --> 58:08.320
Well, Chad sent this one and thanks, Chad.

58:08.320 --> 58:08.800
It's Yahoo!

58:08.800 --> 58:10.080
Answers user, Tim.

58:10.080 --> 58:12.000
I think everybody who sends in Yahoo!'s.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.360
Yeah, everybody.

58:13.360 --> 58:15.520
It's a fucking minefield out there.

58:15.520 --> 58:16.240
It's a slog.

58:16.240 --> 58:20.960
Yeah, it's a psychic minefield and you all are.

58:20.960 --> 58:24.240
We have faced so many troubling concepts.

58:24.240 --> 58:27.200
Yeah, I can't imagine the other ones who didn't make it on the show.

58:27.200 --> 58:29.120
That's just the cream that rose to the top.

58:29.120 --> 58:31.520
But below that cream is a bunch of sewage.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.760
Anyway, just a lot of botulism.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.400
Right.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.760
OK, anyway, thank you, Chad.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.280
Tim asks.

58:38.720 --> 58:42.960
Is it bad to eat a burger for breakfast just once?

58:44.320 --> 58:45.520
My name is Justin Mackerel.

58:45.520 --> 58:46.480
I'm Travis McElroy.

58:46.480 --> 58:48.080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

58:48.080 --> 58:50.160
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.280
Kiss your dad.

58:51.280 --> 59:18.560
Square on the lips.
