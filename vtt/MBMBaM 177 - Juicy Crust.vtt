WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.920 --> 00:51.200
Welcome, my brother, my brother of me, isn't it? I'm Justin McElroy.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.480
He's out of stroke.

00:55.120 --> 01:03.840
I was in England for a week, wasn't I? And now I am. Now this is how I sound, isn't it?

01:03.840 --> 01:07.440
This will be, we are making podcast history right now, because it's definitely the first

01:07.440 --> 01:12.800
time in podcast history that one of the hosts of the podcast has spoken for the entire episode

01:12.800 --> 01:17.840
in one long word. One long, joined, constant word.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.080
Well, I can't help, can I talk, can I?

01:22.080 --> 01:25.200
I also think it's possible that we have somehow traveled back in

01:25.200 --> 01:28.000
time and changed the past so that Justin is fading away.

01:30.320 --> 01:37.840
I spent a week abroad, didn't I? And this is how I talk now. Me and Obama. Madonna.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.680
You and Obama?

01:39.680 --> 01:43.360
Madonna. You're Darma and Greg.

01:43.360 --> 01:44.720
You're Jeffrey Dahmer?

01:44.720 --> 01:45.600
Madonna.

01:47.200 --> 01:47.920
You donger.

01:49.680 --> 01:55.040
She's a singer, isn't she? From Bronx. Now she's from England, like me.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.800
Madonna. He's saying Madonna.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.880
This is going to be a fun, like, word search episode.

02:00.880 --> 02:05.440
It's like a word search episode where Justin says dumb shit and you can't understand it.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.120
You got to look at it diagonally and upside down. There it is. Madonna.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.000
Circling.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.040
Pretty sneaky, sis.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.480
Pretty sneaky, Madonna.

02:13.200 --> 02:20.560
It's an embarrassing story, isn't it? I was, I was practicing this voice when I was in London one

02:20.560 --> 02:26.800
night and I accidentally might've said it in front of people who lived here, didn't I? Didn't I?

02:26.800 --> 02:29.040
They, I mean, they're not here.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.720
There was a lot of pronouns. You kind of lost me.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.920
You know, it gets confusing.

02:31.920 --> 02:32.960
Yeah, there's a lot of pronouns in British.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.200
Because I still feel like I'm over there, don't I?

02:35.200 --> 02:38.800
Yeah. Yeah. What is it about, what is it about your current environment

02:38.800 --> 02:40.960
that makes you think you're still in London?

02:40.960 --> 02:44.160
Is it just the fact that you're speaking with this preposterous accent?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.400
Well, it's all the vinegar, isn't it?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.760
It's also not so much of an accent.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.080
Hold on, Travis. Travis, I hate to, I hate to interrupt you,

02:50.080 --> 02:54.320
but Justin has just made the proclamation that he's surrounded by vinegar,

02:54.320 --> 02:56.880
which is somehow a defining characteristic of London.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.440
I bought a lot of vinegar over there, didn't I? Don't have room to store it, do I?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.640
I feel like there'll be epic customs problems with that.

03:04.640 --> 03:11.680
I told him I sold vinegar. I got a work visa for the States, didn't I? To sell vinegar.

03:11.680 --> 03:17.440
Oh, so your accent was so convincing that the customs people believed that you were immigrating out of.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.000
Well, they knew I was a Brit, didn't they?

03:21.520 --> 03:23.840
There's a lot of holes in this story, Justin.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.480
Are you immersed in vinegar? Are you taking like a vinegar soak?

03:28.480 --> 03:34.080
I want to help you blimey blokes from the States side with your advice show, don't I?

03:34.080 --> 03:35.280
I'll tell you, don't I?

03:35.280 --> 03:38.000
You sound exactly like Russell Brand. Exactly the same.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.480
You also sound incredibly uncertain of yourself.

03:40.480 --> 03:46.240
You also sound like you require our verification for every single sentence that you say.

03:46.240 --> 03:53.440
But well, I'm bi-coastal now, aren't I? It's harder to judge what I'm saying.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.640
No, it is definitely much harder to judge.

03:56.640 --> 04:06.240
I mean, what time is it? Isn't it 9? 4? Can the Brits not tell time?

04:06.800 --> 04:10.320
No, but I'm like bi-coastal now, aren't I?

04:10.320 --> 04:14.400
I don't- bi-coastal means something totally- I mean, I guess it's on a different coast,

04:14.400 --> 04:18.000
but the coast is on a different continent. When you be intercontinental.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.440
Now it's international waters. Let's get the quiz show started.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.880
Okay. Representing England, let's man it.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.320
All right. Everybody, thank you for listening to-

04:30.320 --> 04:31.760
The show is canceled forever.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.240
Very long-winded episode of My Bim Bam. We're all going to have a lot of fun with accents

04:36.240 --> 04:41.520
and voices and cadence, and we're all just going to have a blast. No advice this week,

04:42.080 --> 04:47.760
just accents. So strap it- strap it in, strap it on, and let's just get loose.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.600
Are you all excited about Thanksgiving, aren't you?

04:51.600 --> 04:51.920
Okay.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.880
Okay. What's that? I don't have Thanksgiving.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.080
I think in the-

04:56.080 --> 04:57.600
Go blind, we gov!

04:57.600 --> 04:58.320
Oh, okay, no.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.480
Hello, hello, what's all this then?

05:00.480 --> 05:00.880
Justin has bitten-

05:00.880 --> 05:02.720
Oh, it's contagious, ain't it?

05:02.720 --> 05:07.840
Justin has bitten Travis, sending the virulent stream into his blood.

05:09.040 --> 05:14.480
What are you guys doing? Get away- guys, get away from me. I said get the fuck away! Oh, no!

05:14.480 --> 05:15.280
Oh, Apple!

05:15.280 --> 05:17.040
Oh, Colin!

05:17.040 --> 05:19.840
Lock, stock, and barrel. Snatch. Don't you know?

05:19.840 --> 05:23.600
Gov, I'm itchy, aren't I? Reference is hilarious.

05:24.960 --> 05:25.840
Crisps!

05:25.840 --> 05:28.720
Please, Christ, please, Jesus Christ, please.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.960
We don't have them in my country, do we?

05:32.960 --> 05:34.880
Here, we call him Jeezy Crazy.

05:37.760 --> 05:38.960
Jesus Crisps.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.800
Juicy Crust.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.200
We love his miracles, don't we?

05:45.200 --> 05:51.520
Watered wine, wine vinegar, we love it.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.000
Juicy Crust, heal my accent.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.320
Shit, we're not going to say anything funnier than that.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.520
We have an hour and we're not going to say anything funnier than that.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.160
Maybe if you believe harder.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.520
Oh, Juicy Crust.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.160
Juicy Crust, everybody.

06:20.160 --> 06:24.080
I'm going to work on my American accent for the rest of the show, aren't I?

06:24.080 --> 06:24.400
Okay.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.880
All right, okay.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.760
This is, all right, this is a strain.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.000
You sound like Hugh Jackman.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.640
And wait, is Hugh Jackman- it's hard to tell, isn't it?

06:36.640 --> 06:39.040
It's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

06:39.040 --> 06:39.520
Isn't it?

06:40.080 --> 06:40.480
Isn't it?

06:40.480 --> 06:40.980
Nope.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.780
Here's the first question.

06:43.780 --> 06:44.580
So my buddy-

06:45.780 --> 06:46.500
God damn it.

06:46.500 --> 06:50.020
My buddy gave me- God, I'm going to get it.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.580
My buddy gave me his iPhone 4 after dropping it,

06:52.580 --> 06:55.060
breaking the screen and getting an iPhone 5 right away.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.460
After I offered to pay him, he said-

06:57.460 --> 06:59.140
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

06:59.140 --> 06:59.380
Okay.

06:59.380 --> 06:59.940
Not correct.

06:59.940 --> 07:00.580
Correct course.

07:01.140 --> 07:01.700
Okay.

07:01.700 --> 07:05.540
After I offered to pay him, he said, quote,

07:05.540 --> 07:11.140
I was going to throw it away anyways, so just have it, end quote, for free.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.860
I am now, after about three weeks, selling it on eBay.

07:16.660 --> 07:17.860
Do I owe him anything?

07:18.420 --> 07:20.660
What if he asked for it back for some reason?

07:21.220 --> 07:26.420
My gut instinct is that I only owe him a sucks to suck when he asks.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.020
That's from Clueless in Cleveland.

07:29.220 --> 07:30.180
Yeah, that's funny.

07:30.180 --> 07:33.300
When I first read this question, my immediate impulse was,

07:33.300 --> 07:34.900
of course you don't owe him anything.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.340
He gave it to you.

07:36.340 --> 07:38.020
What you do with it is your business.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.180
But then, just hearing it just then-

07:40.180 --> 07:41.220
Hearing it out loud.

07:41.220 --> 07:41.460
Yeah.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.100
All I could think was, you've only had it for three weeks.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.540
Why did he give it to you?

07:46.180 --> 07:49.780
Was there some arrangement, like you needed the phone and it still worked,

07:49.780 --> 07:51.220
even though the screen was cracked?

07:51.220 --> 07:54.180
Or did he just kind of like toss it to you and go,

07:54.180 --> 07:56.820
I was going to throw this away, so whatever, fuck it.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.940
I'm assuming he didn't give it to you like on consignment.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.860
Like he probably thought you were going to use it, right?

08:01.860 --> 08:02.500
Yeah, right.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.180
It's a tricky situation.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.940
That's all I mean, that's all that I have.

08:07.940 --> 08:10.820
Because listen, I've broken my fair share of iPhones in my day,

08:10.820 --> 08:14.020
like seven of them, and I still have all of them.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.580
Do you remember when dad broke your iPhone?

08:16.580 --> 08:18.180
Yeah, the first time.

08:18.180 --> 08:21.140
Dropped it on the side of a pool, like face down,

08:21.140 --> 08:23.300
and it just, that thing fucking exploded.

08:23.300 --> 08:26.260
And then he very nonchalantly picked it up and handed it to you

08:26.260 --> 08:29.220
without acknowledging it, and then was like,

08:29.220 --> 08:30.980
what's up, later.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.700
What's up, later, and turned to walk away.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.540
And you're like, hey Pops, you exploded.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.540
One second, my little sly fox.

08:41.460 --> 08:44.500
I think that the fact that you're asking us

08:44.500 --> 08:47.780
and not like talking to your friend about it,

08:47.780 --> 08:50.420
lets me know that maybe you know there's something up.

08:51.140 --> 08:55.140
Like if your morality is scratching the back of your cerebellum

08:55.140 --> 08:59.460
and saying, hey, maybe this isn't, you know, cool.

08:59.460 --> 09:03.620
I will tell you the scenario in which I know 100%

09:03.620 --> 09:04.420
it is not cool.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.860
If your friend broke his iPhone, replaced it,

09:07.860 --> 09:09.940
and you said, well, I've always wanted an iPhone,

09:09.940 --> 09:11.140
but I couldn't afford one.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.380
And he said, well, here you go,

09:13.380 --> 09:14.820
I was just gonna throw this one away.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.420
And then you turn around and sell it.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.540
That he was then in that case,

09:19.540 --> 09:21.860
then he sees you using your flip phone again.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.620
And he's like, oh, what happened to the iPhone?

09:23.620 --> 09:25.540
And you say, oh yeah, no, I sold it.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.300
Don't worry, I got 20 bucks for it.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.980
And I use that to get drunk.

09:28.980 --> 09:31.140
I'm sorry, but that's homeboys problem

09:31.140 --> 09:32.740
for not fucking thinking of that,

09:33.700 --> 09:36.420
thinking without that, you know, mercantile edge.

09:36.420 --> 09:36.980
You know what I mean?

09:38.020 --> 09:40.180
He was gonna throw that shit in the fucking garbage.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.860
That's money straight out of your pocket, dog.

09:41.860 --> 09:45.940
That's a lot of, that's a lot of moolah potential.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.700
Assuming he just gave it to you,

09:47.700 --> 09:49.220
not with the intent of you using it,

09:49.220 --> 09:51.620
but just to like, give it to you.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.620
I think what I would do in your scenario

09:53.620 --> 09:56.100
is call him up and say, hey, I got some sucker

09:56.100 --> 09:58.340
to give me some money for that phone you gave me.

09:58.340 --> 09:59.860
You want to split it halfsies.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.140
You want half this dough.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.500
And then only give him like 20%.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.100
Yeah, you don't know.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.540
Don't tell him how much you got.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.380
Then it's a windfall for both of you.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.540
Otherwise, I think you're gonna feel weird about it

10:09.540 --> 10:10.580
because you're right.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.020
There's every chance he could say like,

10:12.020 --> 10:14.180
hey, listen, if you're not using that phone,

10:14.180 --> 10:15.700
my sister needs one.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.340
So I'm just gonna get that back from you.

10:19.220 --> 10:22.020
Why do you, why did you want a broken iPhone?

10:22.820 --> 10:24.900
Well, trust me, as someone who's broken it,

10:24.900 --> 10:26.260
there's two layers of screen.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.220
No, it's no good.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.100
It's no good.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.380
No, you can still use it.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.860
No, it's not like perfect and new anymore.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.860
Listen, it's never going to impress anyone.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.300
That's the thing, you own an iPhone

10:35.300 --> 10:36.420
so that someone looks at it and goes,

10:36.420 --> 10:39.380
oh God, your tactic is so beautiful.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.180
Biggest question I guess precedes that one,

10:42.180 --> 10:46.260
which is why would you want an iPhone 4

10:46.260 --> 10:48.900
even in working condition when the 5 is already out there?

10:48.900 --> 10:50.420
Once the 5, I don't know if you guys knew this,

10:50.420 --> 10:55.540
once the 5 came out, the 4 and the 4S were broken already.

10:55.540 --> 10:56.500
Do you know what I mean?

10:56.500 --> 11:00.340
Just like in principle, they did not work anymore.

11:00.340 --> 11:03.380
See, that's why I advocate not getting anything,

11:04.020 --> 11:08.100
no iPhones, no phones until it's reached.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.100
Wait till they say this is the last iPhone.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.380
This is the last, this is the final iPhone.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.820
There are no new iPhones out.

11:12.820 --> 11:15.700
The iPhone 63 is the best.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.980
Does this only apply to iPhones

11:16.980 --> 11:19.060
or is like, has my HTC One been broken

11:19.060 --> 11:21.380
since I brought it out of the AT&T store?

11:21.380 --> 11:21.860
Yes.

11:21.860 --> 11:22.900
Since I looked at it and said,

11:22.900 --> 11:24.980
oh, you look special and different.

11:24.980 --> 11:28.260
Hey, chumps that bought the PlayStation 4, too soon.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.340
Wait for 63.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.660
They all stop at 63, by the way,

11:32.660 --> 11:34.660
except for the Nintendo 64.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.180
The Nintendo 64 was so amazing.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.420
Broke the mold, really broke the mold with that one.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.540
You guys want a Yahoo?

11:41.540 --> 11:42.180
Please.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.700
This Yahoo was sent in by Jared Anger.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.260
Thanks, Jared.

11:44.260 --> 11:47.060
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Fiss Jorg.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.060
Fiss Jorg who asks,

11:51.060 --> 11:54.900
can I get in trouble if I take off the clothes

11:54.900 --> 11:56.180
on the mannequins in a store?

11:57.780 --> 12:00.260
I'm 18 years old and a guy who's never had sex

12:00.260 --> 12:01.460
or even had a girlfriend before.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.020
Okay.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.340
That much was clear from the subject matter.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.460
I keep telling myself,

12:05.460 --> 12:08.260
I'm going to go looking for a girl to have sex with

12:08.260 --> 12:09.300
sometime soon,

12:09.300 --> 12:11.780
but don't feel fully prepared to do it yet.

12:12.740 --> 12:13.380
I thought about-

12:13.380 --> 12:14.900
Because that's such a production.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.140
I know.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.460
You gotta take a shower.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.700
You have to powder your jimmies.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.140
Have to find girls.

12:21.140 --> 12:21.860
Where are they?

12:21.860 --> 12:22.420
Also that.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.060
I thought about practicing how to take off clothes

12:25.060 --> 12:26.340
on mannequins for practice.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.740
My plan is to go into a store where they sell women's clothing

12:28.740 --> 12:30.260
and have female mannequins inside.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.060
Then I can practice on how to take off pieces

12:33.060 --> 12:35.300
of women's clothing such as bras, panties, etc.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.900
by doing it on the mannequin.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.580
I don't want to seem like an idiot the day

12:38.580 --> 12:41.540
that I actually do have sex and won't know

12:41.540 --> 12:43.860
the proper technique in order to take off a girl's panties

12:43.860 --> 12:44.820
or bra or whatever.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.900
Sorry for saying panties, everybody.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.140
Will I get in trouble if the employees of the store

12:49.140 --> 12:50.500
see me doing this though?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.140
If so, could I just take the mannequin in the bathroom

12:53.140 --> 12:53.700
and do it?

12:53.700 --> 12:54.820
They won't see me.

12:54.820 --> 12:55.300
Yes.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.780
You should always just take the mannequin in the bathroom.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.940
That will look way less suspicious.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.140
It is if nobody sees you.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.420
Because this kid sounds like a sneaky criminal mastermind.

13:06.420 --> 13:07.060
You are-

13:09.140 --> 13:09.700
Okay.

13:09.700 --> 13:10.100
He's gonna-

13:10.900 --> 13:12.980
Let me just like outline it mathematically

13:12.980 --> 13:14.900
because I think that that latter option is obviously

13:14.900 --> 13:17.540
the best option because this kid doesn't know

13:17.540 --> 13:22.020
his- the fucking way around that whole situation,

13:22.020 --> 13:22.900
that whole scene.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.380
And it does take practice.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.620
You guys can pretend to be smooth criminals all you want,

13:27.620 --> 13:28.260
but it does.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.580
It's gonna take this kid five to six minutes

13:30.580 --> 13:32.180
to solve this puzzle.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.260
Let me throw this out.

13:34.260 --> 13:36.900
It would take him much less than five to six minutes

13:36.900 --> 13:40.500
to perform like an exfil to the Sears bathroom.

13:41.380 --> 13:41.860
You know what I mean?

13:41.860 --> 13:42.420
Let me throw this out.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.660
This is how you get away with it, right?

13:44.660 --> 13:47.460
An employee stumbles upon you stripping down a mannequin

13:47.460 --> 13:49.140
and they're about to say something

13:49.140 --> 13:51.380
and then they notice the blackboard upon which

13:51.380 --> 13:53.140
you are scribbling notes and equations.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.220
Yeah, that's gonna be-

13:55.220 --> 13:56.580
They're gonna be so dumbfounded

13:56.580 --> 13:57.460
that they're just gonna go,

13:57.460 --> 14:00.100
oh, well, clearly this is bigger than both of us.

14:00.100 --> 14:00.900
I just want-

14:00.900 --> 14:04.580
You're saying that anytime anyone has a blackboard

14:04.580 --> 14:06.340
doing things on it,

14:06.340 --> 14:08.820
people won't question their scientific methods?

14:08.820 --> 14:11.060
Have you seen the show Numbers, Griffin?

14:11.700 --> 14:14.100
Because that's all that happens on it.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.860
People scribble on a blackboard

14:15.860 --> 14:17.700
and then someone gets arrested.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.260
Have a check, have a clipboard with you

14:20.260 --> 14:23.220
with like a sheet that you can make check marks on

14:23.860 --> 14:25.620
while you're taking the clothes off the-

14:25.620 --> 14:29.460
Oh, oh, and then when the salesperson says something to you,

14:29.460 --> 14:31.940
you say, oh, it took you four and a half minutes

14:31.940 --> 14:32.660
to say something.

14:33.860 --> 14:35.780
Oh, the Western branch did way better

14:35.780 --> 14:36.820
and then run out of the store.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.660
Loss prevention, not your strong suit here.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.900
Loss of innocence prevention.

14:40.900 --> 14:41.940
What are they losing?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.980
What is being lost in this scenario?

14:44.980 --> 14:48.180
Loss of mannequin shame.

14:48.180 --> 14:51.620
I look forward to the moment

14:51.620 --> 14:56.180
when this kid perfects his clothes taking off game

14:56.180 --> 15:00.500
and then he finally meets that special prostitute

15:00.500 --> 15:02.740
and he gets her back to the hotel room

15:03.460 --> 15:05.700
and he gets all the clothes off

15:05.700 --> 15:08.980
and then he has this staggering realization

15:08.980 --> 15:12.180
that he has no idea what comes next.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.500
He has obsessed about-

15:14.500 --> 15:17.460
The weirdest part of this whole thing.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.860
He will take his hand, hold it in the air

15:19.860 --> 15:23.940
as if he's doing a high five in one swift motion,

15:23.940 --> 15:26.020
karate chop it to the ground

15:26.020 --> 15:27.780
and in that smooth motion,

15:27.780 --> 15:29.700
all of the women's clothes are gone

15:29.700 --> 15:32.100
and she'll say, holy shit, that was amazing.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.060
Do me now.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.300
And he says, do what now?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.660
Do you who?

15:36.660 --> 15:40.340
I was under the assumption that that was sex.

15:40.340 --> 15:45.060
I thought that that was the thing.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.660
I'm gonna go.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.340
There's some definite gray area here.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.220
There's definitely some moral ambiguity in this issue.

15:51.220 --> 15:55.220
If you fuck a mannequin at the store, that is a no-no.

15:55.220 --> 15:58.980
You can shoplift from that store all the fuck you want

15:58.980 --> 16:00.020
because they're not gonna do stuff

16:00.020 --> 16:02.980
but you have made yourself vulnerable in a big way.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.700
You have violated God's laws

16:05.700 --> 16:08.020
and state and city laws probably too.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.980
I also wanna throw out internal policies of Lane Bryant

16:10.980 --> 16:13.460
just in general violated.

16:13.460 --> 16:17.700
Can you imagine being a sales associate at that store

16:17.700 --> 16:19.380
after this kid has had a couple of months

16:19.380 --> 16:21.060
to perfect this technique

16:21.060 --> 16:23.780
and it's just like naked mannequins everywhere

16:23.780 --> 16:25.380
and you cannot catch the blur

16:27.060 --> 16:29.060
that is stripping these nannikins to the ground

16:29.060 --> 16:30.900
in 0.02 seconds.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.820
I'm pretty sure they call him the streak.

16:34.900 --> 16:35.700
Well, not really

16:35.700 --> 16:38.500
because the streak didn't make other people naked, did he?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.180
That really wasn't part of his legacy.

16:40.980 --> 16:41.700
Or the joke.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.500
Either one, it's just because naked.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.340
I'm just saying it was built on a faulty premise.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.700
The streak himself was naked.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.700
This kid obviously has no interest

16:49.700 --> 16:51.140
in taking his clothes off at all.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.260
You're assuming.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.300
I'm assuming.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.020
You're right, Travis.

16:55.460 --> 16:57.380
I think that this kid would be the greatest

16:57.380 --> 16:59.620
criminal mastermind ever if he could pull this off

16:59.620 --> 17:01.300
because if the cops catch up with him

17:01.300 --> 17:03.620
and draw their guns or go to draw their guns,

17:03.620 --> 17:04.980
only wait, where's my gun?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.660
And my pants and my shirt.

17:06.660 --> 17:07.380
And my bra.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.060
And my bra and my underwear

17:10.740 --> 17:14.020
and my cock ring that I wear for that.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.540
I think that you can do this

17:15.540 --> 17:18.260
but while you're conducting these experiments,

17:18.260 --> 17:22.020
you have to loudly announce, just aloud,

17:22.740 --> 17:24.660
you know, I think this will fit me

17:24.660 --> 17:26.580
but I'm not sure if this will fit me.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.660
And I think if you do that,

17:28.660 --> 17:31.300
then everyone will assume that you're just gonna try it on

17:31.300 --> 17:34.260
as sort of like a cool gender-bending,

17:34.260 --> 17:35.940
metrosexual kind of look.

17:37.380 --> 17:38.020
It's possible.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.340
I do not think the physiology of a real life woman

17:42.340 --> 17:43.700
is the same as a mannequin though.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.700
I think there's probably a little bit more.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.500
There's been a lot of advances in mannequin technology

17:48.500 --> 17:49.940
over the last couple of decades.

17:49.940 --> 17:54.660
They don't have any kind of fleshy give, I'm assuming.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.380
Have you checked?

17:56.100 --> 17:57.220
I haven't, no.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.660
Well, you know what happens when you assume.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.340
I have, you're right.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.980
I'm making a lot of assumptions here.

18:02.980 --> 18:05.700
Yeah, I worked at Land's End, trust me.

18:06.260 --> 18:08.100
You had fleshy, fleshy mannequins?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.620
Fleshy, squeezable mannequins.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.820
Fuck, that sucks.

18:11.460 --> 18:12.980
Oh man, that's a bummer.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.300
Have you ever seen that Nickelodeon show

18:15.300 --> 18:16.500
with the mannequin with the hat on?

18:17.060 --> 18:18.420
It was like that but in reverse

18:18.420 --> 18:19.860
because they were like human all the time.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.260
In retrospect, Land's End might've employed slaves.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.100
Okay, that's kind of what it sounds more like.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.420
Now that I'm thinking through it,

18:28.420 --> 18:29.620
they were crying a lot.

18:29.620 --> 18:30.100
Okay, so I don't wanna-

18:30.100 --> 18:31.300
They might've been just customers.

18:31.940 --> 18:33.620
Yeah, that's why I got fired.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.260
This weekend I went on a date

18:36.260 --> 18:38.740
and the girl pulled in, I forgot my wallet.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.620
The only thing is later after I pay for a meal,

18:41.620 --> 18:43.940
she told me to put something in her purse

18:43.940 --> 18:46.740
and the only thing in there was her wallet.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.420
Everything else after that went great.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.420
Otherwise she seemed pretty cool.

18:54.420 --> 18:57.060
Is this a deal breaker or should I agree

18:57.060 --> 18:58.900
to a second date and see?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.300
That's from Cond in Canada.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.700
If she had a purse and the only thing in it was a wallet,

19:06.420 --> 19:07.780
why didn't she have a clutch?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.460
I guess that's my biggest question.

19:09.460 --> 19:10.100
Good question.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.380
I hate to go fashion police on this woman, but-

19:14.100 --> 19:16.980
Is it possible that it was not actually a wallet

19:16.980 --> 19:22.180
but just some sort of makeup case or maybe a gun?

19:23.780 --> 19:25.380
You think it was a gun?

19:25.380 --> 19:30.260
Like a gun in a case, not just like a wallet-shaped gun.

19:30.260 --> 19:30.980
That's stupid.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.380
I'm saying like a Derringer.

19:34.820 --> 19:36.980
No, but that would be in a garter on her hip.

19:36.980 --> 19:37.620
What am I saying?

19:37.620 --> 19:38.420
I'm sorry.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.500
Yeah, you would not keep a Derringer in your purse.

19:42.660 --> 19:47.380
There is no universe of all the infinite multiverses

19:47.380 --> 19:53.460
that exist throughout the string of oblivion.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.820
There is no universe that exists where this is actionable

19:56.820 --> 19:59.140
because you done checked out this girl's open purse

19:59.860 --> 20:03.620
while she wasn't looking and that's a crooked move, man.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.980
No, no.

20:04.980 --> 20:07.460
She told him to put something in there.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.540
But you don't want to go Columbo.

20:09.540 --> 20:12.260
You don't want her to think that it's like a fact-finding-

20:12.260 --> 20:13.140
Just one last thing.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.940
There's only a wallet in there.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.620
There's a wallet in there.

20:17.620 --> 20:18.580
One last thing.

20:18.580 --> 20:19.540
Let me throw this out.

20:19.540 --> 20:24.660
Is it possible that she said that she forgot her wallet

20:24.660 --> 20:26.900
because instead she did not have the funds

20:26.900 --> 20:28.500
in her bank account to cover this?

20:29.060 --> 20:31.300
And rather than say, oh no, I'm broke.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.020
She just went-

20:32.020 --> 20:34.580
That's why this is an actionable information.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.260
Yeah, that could be the case, Travis.

20:36.260 --> 20:39.300
In which case you'd be history's greatest monster.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.500
Congratulations.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.700
You're a real dick.

20:42.420 --> 20:46.900
So I'm saying that, you know, if it went well otherwise-

20:46.900 --> 20:49.940
Okay, I want to roll it back for a moment though.

20:53.700 --> 20:56.180
I understand when you say she pulled the,

20:56.180 --> 20:57.540
I forgot my wallet.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.500
What was the dialogue leading up to that

21:00.500 --> 21:02.980
that she felt the need to volunteer that information?

21:02.980 --> 21:04.900
I did think that too, Travis.

21:06.420 --> 21:07.620
Have you guys not ever-

21:08.500 --> 21:11.700
I guess I should start from the bottom and work my way up.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.540
Have you guys been on a date before?

21:13.540 --> 21:16.580
Yeah, but was there a point where a question asker said,

21:16.580 --> 21:18.100
you're going to pay for this, right?

21:18.100 --> 21:18.500
No.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.020
Or we're going to split it?

21:20.020 --> 21:20.500
Dummy.

21:21.220 --> 21:22.580
That's probably not how it happened.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.900
It was probably more like the end of the meal came.

21:24.900 --> 21:28.500
There's this awkward moment where if it's your first date,

21:29.220 --> 21:32.900
there are so many sexual politics to figure out

21:32.900 --> 21:34.100
who is going to pay.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.780
By the way, split it every single time,

21:35.780 --> 21:37.620
which is I imagine what happened.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.260
She went to get in her purse and said,

21:40.260 --> 21:41.460
oh, I forgot my wallet.

21:41.460 --> 21:45.140
Oh man, actually in this scenario, she lied to you.

21:45.140 --> 21:45.460
Yeah.

21:45.460 --> 21:46.980
She definitely did lie to you

21:46.980 --> 21:49.940
unless she thought she forgot her wallet.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.260
How big was this wallet?

21:55.060 --> 21:56.900
Because he said he saw the wallet in the purse.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.460
If the purse was gigantic and the wallet was very tiny,

21:59.460 --> 22:01.860
but if the purse was only slightly larger

22:01.860 --> 22:04.420
as to only allow the whole thing of the wallet-

22:04.420 --> 22:07.700
The purse didn't have anything in it

22:07.700 --> 22:09.540
when she went to look in it, right?

22:09.540 --> 22:11.540
She opened up the purse, no wallet in there.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.700
Oh shit, I've been carrying around an empty wallet.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.860
You would think that maybe she would have felt that.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.100
Again, an issue that definitely would have been solved

22:18.100 --> 22:18.900
if you had a clutch,

22:18.900 --> 22:21.860
but let's go ahead and ignore that part

22:21.860 --> 22:23.140
of the equation real quick.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.180
Where was the wallet?

22:24.180 --> 22:25.540
It was in her fanny pack.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.500
Later on, she realized her mistake

22:28.500 --> 22:29.780
and was very embarrassed.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.620
Transferred the wallet from the fanny pack

22:31.620 --> 22:34.900
to the empty purse and then realized her faux pas,

22:34.900 --> 22:36.820
then decided to put together this test

22:36.820 --> 22:38.900
of Solomon's wisdom for you.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.740
Had you, gave you permission to look inside of her purse,

22:42.740 --> 22:44.340
putting the ball in your court,

22:44.340 --> 22:45.700
do you love this woman?

22:45.700 --> 22:46.900
Do you love this woman enough

22:46.900 --> 22:49.700
to look over this possible transgression?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.940
Because if the answer is yes, the truth will out,

22:51.940 --> 22:53.460
the truth will be exposed,

22:53.460 --> 22:55.780
it was a mistake the entire time she didn't lie to you.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.860
This woman is how I met your mother,

22:57.860 --> 22:59.940
end of series, series of what?

22:59.940 --> 23:04.660
I am, I don't think the right move is to bring this up.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.940
There are too many variables to consider and-

23:07.940 --> 23:10.340
Not really, I kind of just outlined the whole thing,

23:10.340 --> 23:10.840
didn't I?

23:10.840 --> 23:18.440
I think I am a little bit unnerved by this-

23:18.440 --> 23:20.760
Purse that only has one thing in it?

23:20.760 --> 23:22.360
What is she doing?

23:22.360 --> 23:22.760
Get a clutch.

23:22.760 --> 23:27.160
You don't have any starlight mints or ticket stubs.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.000
I'm not crazy about, first off,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.360
you know this question asker is lying

23:30.360 --> 23:32.280
because I've never seen a person with one thing in it,

23:32.280 --> 23:34.920
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.320
By definition, purses have a hundred things in them.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.960
If I had a purse, it would be loaded to the brim

23:39.960 --> 23:41.880
with every, oh man, I wish I-

23:41.880 --> 23:45.240
I would have so many Milky Way minis in there.

23:45.240 --> 23:48.200
Anyway, I am a little concerned about this person

23:48.200 --> 23:51.160
running a grift on their first date.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.160
I don't like that.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.880
I think that it's a little weird

23:55.880 --> 23:57.640
that the first time out of the gate,

23:57.640 --> 23:59.320
you're running a grift.

23:59.320 --> 24:03.240
Yeah, I also need to know, was this an online date?

24:03.240 --> 24:04.760
Because let me tell you the statistics.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.360
Of all the online first dates there are,

24:08.360 --> 24:11.000
do you know what the percentage of dates

24:11.000 --> 24:12.760
that don't make it to date three?

24:14.520 --> 24:15.000
What?

24:15.000 --> 24:15.640
It's a hundred.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.760
It's a hundred percent.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.480
A hundred percent.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.280
It's a hundred percent.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.920
We're talking about a quick turnaround on these bad boys.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.680
We're talking about two ships passing.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.840
So what about the people that get married

24:24.840 --> 24:26.680
from people they met online match.com?

24:26.680 --> 24:28.440
Is that they just get married on date two?

24:28.440 --> 24:29.400
Not, they don't exist.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.080
Where have you met people like that?

24:31.080 --> 24:32.760
On match.com commercials.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.160
That's right.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.920
Do you guys think it's weird?

24:34.920 --> 24:36.680
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this still.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.440
There is a lot to unpack.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.560
Do you think it's weird that on their first date,

24:42.120 --> 24:47.880
this woman asked her her beau to put her suitor

24:47.880 --> 24:49.480
to put something in her purse?

24:49.480 --> 24:49.720
Yeah.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.840
I don't want to out you dude,

24:50.840 --> 24:51.880
but I don't think that happened.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.840
I think you peed their purse.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.520
You snooped a poop.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.320
You sneaky creep.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.920
You know he did because there's no woman alive

25:00.920 --> 25:02.920
who would be like, thank you for paying for dinner.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.960
And could you put these mints into my purse?

25:05.960 --> 25:08.280
I don't know you or really anything about you.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.120
You may be an incredibly violent human,

25:10.120 --> 25:12.920
but go ahead and look in my little chest of secrets here.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.800
Go ahead and look right in there.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.760
In fact, if you want to stick your filthy paw,

25:16.760 --> 25:18.040
I don't know where that paw has been

25:18.040 --> 25:19.400
because I don't fucking know you.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.880
Go ahead and put that in my treasure prize.

25:21.880 --> 25:25.160
Go look in that place that holds the secret to that one lie

25:25.160 --> 25:27.400
that I definitely remember telling you earlier.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.000
Also, I don't want to JFK this,

25:29.000 --> 25:30.120
but like what position?

25:30.120 --> 25:31.240
Where were she standing?

25:31.240 --> 25:33.080
You standing in the purse placement.

25:33.080 --> 25:36.120
That she could hand you something that you could put

25:36.120 --> 25:37.720
in the purse that she couldn't reach her full.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.600
A single fluorescent light bulb hung overhead.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.040
You got a direct 90 degree stare down in this bad chasm.

25:45.000 --> 25:45.480
What's in there?

25:45.480 --> 25:47.480
How intense was this game of Twister

25:47.480 --> 25:49.960
that she could not come get put in her purse?

25:49.960 --> 25:51.400
Maybe it was like a direct challenge.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.760
She was like, put the lipstick in the purse.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.120
And you're like, no, that's not how to put it in the purse.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.960
The purse does contain my wallet,

25:57.960 --> 26:01.320
which occupies every square inch of space within the purse,

26:01.320 --> 26:03.320
except one lipstick size cavity.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.320
And it's up to you to find out where that is.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.320
Go ahead and root around in there for five to 10 minutes.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.400
Oh no, my secrets.

26:10.600 --> 26:11.640
Yeah, I don't know.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.200
When did this date turn into legends of the hidden temple?

26:14.200 --> 26:15.880
You have to uncover.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.000
Ah, temple guard.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.240
No, like I said.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.680
No, that's just the waiter who is also a temple guard.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.440
This is a weird restaurant.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.840
Man, I got, there's nothing actionable.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.920
Like there is too much going on here.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.400
I think you need to just scrap this and start again.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.720
No, I say you go set a date and see how it plays out,

26:33.720 --> 26:36.200
but be ready to j'accuse her.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.640
Oh shit, no, wait, grift her back.

26:38.760 --> 26:39.640
Double grift.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.360
Double grift, that's the only-

26:40.360 --> 26:41.480
I forgot your wallet.

26:41.480 --> 26:42.440
If you really like this girl,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.800
you need to come to terms with this woman is a grifter.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.440
And the only way she's going to respect you

26:48.440 --> 26:50.520
is if you grift her back in a big, big way.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.720
You gotta take it over the top.

26:51.720 --> 26:52.360
You know what I mean?

26:54.040 --> 26:55.160
God, this is the start of like

26:55.160 --> 26:57.320
the greatest Match.com commercial ever.

26:57.320 --> 26:57.800
Yeah.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.320
I met John because his profile said that he was interested

27:01.320 --> 27:04.440
in taking care of dogs and fostering pets.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.920
And so I stole like $15,000 from him on day three.

27:08.920 --> 27:09.960
We're married now.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.200
And this dumb fuck didn't even see it coming.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.000
So now we're married.

27:13.720 --> 27:14.680
Take it from me.

27:14.680 --> 27:18.280
The waiter was my husband and he stole the credit card numbers.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.840
Match.com has been the site of more grifts.

27:20.840 --> 27:27.480
Okay, Cupid is where you go if you want to fuck.

27:27.480 --> 27:31.880
And Match.com is where you go if you want to get fucked

27:31.880 --> 27:34.600
and lose all of your money, lose all your savings.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.640
What is- what's Living Social?

27:37.640 --> 27:38.440
Is that a dating site?

27:38.440 --> 27:39.880
Maybe that's for long cons.

27:39.880 --> 27:40.600
No, that's- I'm sorry.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.040
That's like a Groupon-esque deal site.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.340
Okay.

27:43.340 --> 27:53.580
Let's run a grift of our own in the money side.

27:53.580 --> 27:59.740
The grift is Hulu.com.

27:59.740 --> 28:00.620
It's a website.

28:00.620 --> 28:01.820
And really what we're going to do-

28:01.820 --> 28:03.740
I don't think we're going to say that about Hulu.

28:03.740 --> 28:08.540
No, here's the thing, you and me and Dupree and our audience

28:08.540 --> 28:12.380
are going to run a grift on the money side.

28:12.380 --> 28:13.980
Run a grift on Hulu.

28:13.980 --> 28:15.660
Now, you know Hulu Plus.

28:15.660 --> 28:16.860
They're sponsoring.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.380
They're responsible.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.580
Just hear me in the end, okay?

28:20.460 --> 28:23.020
Do they have you, me, and Dupree on Hulu Plus?

28:23.020 --> 28:24.220
It's impossible to say.

28:24.780 --> 28:27.020
You can watch your favorite TV shows like SNL,

28:27.020 --> 28:29.820
Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, and Scandal.

28:29.820 --> 28:32.220
I just watched Shark Tank on Hulu today.

28:32.220 --> 28:32.720
Thank you.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.660
There's old episodes you can binge on.

28:35.660 --> 28:37.420
Lost, Doctor Who, Community.

28:38.220 --> 28:41.020
Hulu Plus is a service that lets you watch all this stuff

28:41.020 --> 28:42.460
for just $7.99 a month.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.500
There's a bunch of ad-free movies, kids content,

28:46.620 --> 28:49.900
tons of great stuff on there for just $7.99 a month.

28:49.900 --> 28:50.540
But here's the grift.

28:50.540 --> 28:51.420
Are you ready for the grift?

28:51.420 --> 28:54.140
I should also mention there's Hulu Originals,

28:54.140 --> 28:55.980
like The Wrong Manson, Behind the Mask.

28:55.980 --> 28:57.500
But here's the grift.

28:57.500 --> 29:02.380
You're going to go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother

29:03.180 --> 29:05.660
and you're going to get two weeks for free.

29:06.380 --> 29:07.420
That's right.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.100
At HuluPlus.com slash my brother,

29:09.100 --> 29:10.460
you can get two weeks for free.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.140
Run the grift on Hulu Plus.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.420
They're begging for it.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.740
They left this back door open for you.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.180
Stick it right in there.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.980
Stick it right in their back door.

29:19.980 --> 29:25.020
Stick it to Corpo and just take all this premium original

29:25.020 --> 29:28.620
and syndicated television programming for free for two weeks.

29:29.580 --> 29:30.460
Yeah, it's for free.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.620
Yeah, but really, make sure you check out Behind the Mask

29:32.620 --> 29:35.900
because it's a former costumed character.

29:35.900 --> 29:36.780
Oh, shit.

29:36.780 --> 29:37.420
It's so true.

29:37.420 --> 29:38.940
They did not get us up in the mix.

29:38.940 --> 29:39.740
No.

29:39.740 --> 29:42.380
Like, hey, so when you played Cowabunga,

29:42.380 --> 29:44.460
how many kids tried to touch your cow dick?

29:44.460 --> 29:45.420
Like 18.

29:45.420 --> 29:47.260
All of the kids.

29:48.460 --> 29:49.660
How is your dirt?

29:50.780 --> 29:52.220
My dirt is deep.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.500
It's deep, deep, deep in there.

29:55.100 --> 30:00.220
I've been trying to get at it, but it's in my folds.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.020
You know what I mean?

30:01.020 --> 30:02.140
Oh, yeah.

30:02.140 --> 30:03.740
You can't get in there with liquids.

30:03.740 --> 30:04.940
Can't do it.

30:04.940 --> 30:05.660
I try, man.

30:05.660 --> 30:09.500
And I've gotten the full fucking, what was that, guys?

30:09.500 --> 30:10.460
Andy Kaufman.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.020
You know what I mean?

30:11.020 --> 30:12.540
I used to like swallow a cheesecloth

30:12.540 --> 30:14.540
and like just like get in there.

30:14.540 --> 30:15.260
Yeah.

30:15.260 --> 30:18.220
I've been giving him the old college, but it's tough.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.540
I bet my buddy Travis has a solution for you.

30:20.540 --> 30:21.820
Guess who's back?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.100
Stack Soap is back.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.620
Put your soap in my soap.

30:24.620 --> 30:25.100
That's right.

30:25.100 --> 30:27.100
Stack Soap's the only soap with a divot in it

30:27.100 --> 30:29.980
so you can take the stupid sliver that you get

30:29.980 --> 30:32.540
at the end of soap bar usage and put it right in the divot.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.060
It's infinite soap.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.500
It's better than ever.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.620
Tell me about the new versions.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.060
Peppermint, jasmine, and unscented.

30:40.060 --> 30:41.820
There is nothing better than minty soap.

30:41.820 --> 30:42.140
Nothing.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.780
It is the most refreshing.

30:44.780 --> 30:47.740
I popped a bar into the bathrooms at work.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.780
It was like down to that stupid sliver.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.580
It was down to the nub in like a week.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.820
Everybody was jamming on it so hard.

30:55.820 --> 30:58.620
And then I just popped it right into the new soap.

30:59.340 --> 30:59.580
That's how Stack Soap works.

30:59.580 --> 31:01.260
And everybody's mind was blown.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.220
They just fell down on the floor shaking, crying.

31:04.220 --> 31:04.940
It's amazing.

31:04.940 --> 31:05.820
It's a miracle.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.500
Get it for people this Christmas.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.820
It makes a great gift and you're really going to free people out

31:09.820 --> 31:11.820
because they may not have heard of it before.

31:11.820 --> 31:15.660
And then you're going to seem like a real sharp person.

31:15.660 --> 31:21.340
You can get them at Whole Foods in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland,

31:21.340 --> 31:25.740
Washington, DC, Virginia, Kentucky, and South New Jersey.

31:25.740 --> 31:29.740
Now that is the best way to do it because if you get it there

31:29.740 --> 31:32.780
then Whole Foods will start carrying it to other stores.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.740
But if you buy that shit on Amazon, it doesn't give a fuck about Stack Soap.

31:35.740 --> 31:38.300
No, but if you're not in any one of those places,

31:39.020 --> 31:40.220
Amazon's the way to go.

31:40.220 --> 31:40.540
Yeah.

31:40.540 --> 31:41.420
And you can get it there.

31:42.540 --> 31:43.820
Go to StackSoap.com.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.380
You can get all the info, but we love Stack Soap.

31:46.380 --> 31:51.580
They're our early sponsor of our show and they have helped make it possible for a long time.

31:51.580 --> 31:52.700
So go to StackSoap.com.

31:53.260 --> 31:57.980
Buy it for people you love or people that you hate.

31:57.980 --> 31:58.860
That stink.

31:58.860 --> 31:59.980
That stink like you do.

31:59.980 --> 32:01.340
Shitty, shank heads.

32:01.340 --> 32:03.820
All right, this next message is from Mary Ricks.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.460
I'm going to break it down for a minute.

32:06.460 --> 32:06.860
Okay.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.620
The next message is from Mary Ricks.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.820
It's from Blaine Flowers.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.020
Happy birthday to my amazing wife.

32:13.020 --> 32:17.420
I wanted to get you a unicorn, but they were out of stock at Bed Bath & Beyoncé.

32:17.420 --> 32:23.740
I hope this message delivered by the world's top experts on God's most beautiful creatures

32:23.740 --> 32:25.260
will do the trick instead.

32:25.260 --> 32:28.460
All of the love, Blaine.

32:28.460 --> 32:32.860
Do we have any metric for knowing how bad we fucked this up and how much we miss this

32:32.860 --> 32:33.500
birthday by?

32:34.060 --> 32:37.580
Yes, we've missed her birthday by 11 to 12 days.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.180
That's not bad, guys.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.420
I think that's a bit under our average actually.

32:43.980 --> 32:46.620
So 11 to 12 days of shipping on this birthday wish.

32:49.180 --> 32:51.420
I appreciate all these Jumbotron messages.

32:51.420 --> 32:56.220
It truly is amazing to me that like our listeners care enough about the show that they like

32:56.220 --> 32:58.540
give us money just to say people's names out loud.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.820
Like that's fucking crazy to me.

32:59.820 --> 33:03.500
And I am truly very thankful for that on this very thankful week.

33:04.620 --> 33:07.100
But stop asking us to do birthdays.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.860
How about birth months from now on?

33:08.860 --> 33:13.180
Because that's something I bet we can nail the birth month thing.

33:13.180 --> 33:16.860
We're kind of fuck ups, but I think we can get that right at least.

33:16.860 --> 33:21.900
And you should know that it's not always our fault, except it almost always is.

33:21.900 --> 33:22.940
Sometimes it's no one's fault.

33:22.940 --> 33:24.940
Sometimes it's just chronology of time.

33:24.940 --> 33:28.220
Yeah, you know, always trying to fuck us.

33:28.780 --> 33:30.460
Something Mary knows something about.

33:30.460 --> 33:32.620
Just keeps on a marching, doesn't it, Mary?

33:32.620 --> 33:33.020
It's all right.

33:33.020 --> 33:33.980
You hang in there.

33:33.980 --> 33:38.540
There's another message for Ian Clowery from Patty Kavanagh.

33:39.340 --> 33:43.900
I want to wish a happy 30th birthday to my buddy Ian from Wexford in Ireland.

33:43.900 --> 33:48.540
He turned me on to NBNBAM and I thought a personal message would be a nice thing to do.

33:48.540 --> 33:53.660
And nothing says personal like three dudes thousands of miles away wishing you a happy birthday.

33:53.660 --> 33:59.020
Maybe now that maybe now that you're 30, you can finally grow out that beard like mine from Patty.

33:59.020 --> 34:02.220
There's something a little better than a birthday wish that comes with a little bit of intimidation.

34:02.220 --> 34:05.100
Yeah, just right at the end, like, and also you got a shitty beard.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.100
Also, your beard is bullshit.

34:07.100 --> 34:10.700
Happy B-Day, which does not stand for beard because you're an idiot.

34:12.060 --> 34:13.260
Maybe you want it.

34:13.260 --> 34:17.100
You can touch my beard if you want to just this once because it's your birthday.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.020
You gotta get some of that testosterone rub.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.900
Put it directly to the face.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.740
Go ahead, Justin with this jingle, please.

34:23.740 --> 34:27.980
Subway hacks.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.220
See, I was imagining something a little bit more like Americana.

34:33.020 --> 34:35.580
Something a little like Springsteenian.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.980
Little diddy, but Subway hacks.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.780
Yeah, something down in that red is Subway hacks.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.460
You know what I mean?

34:42.460 --> 34:46.780
You like sandwiches on the cheap, Subway hacks.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.020
I think Travis should be in charge of jingles for Subway hacks.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.940
I think he's got a better grasp.

34:50.940 --> 34:51.900
I'm in touch with the people.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.420
I know real America.

34:53.420 --> 34:54.540
Subway hacks.

34:56.620 --> 34:56.860
Always.

34:56.860 --> 35:01.420
Getting extra cut, getting extra couple inches on that $5 footlong.

35:01.420 --> 35:06.620
It's Subway hacks for American, American lunch.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.380
Cold cuts, cutting corners with Subway hacks.

35:12.300 --> 35:15.340
You know them motherfuckers got mozzarella cheese.

35:15.340 --> 35:16.700
You just gotta ask for it.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.180
Take it from your pal Garth Brooks.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.860
Subway hacks.

35:20.860 --> 35:23.660
I'm out of retirement to do this bit.

35:25.580 --> 35:29.580
There's one more project I always dreamed about working on

35:29.580 --> 35:33.580
and it's a fake jingle for a podcast for a segment of it.

35:34.380 --> 35:35.180
Subway hacks.

35:35.980 --> 35:38.380
Gotta catch them all, Subway hacks.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.500
Call them Baton Rouge.

35:42.220 --> 35:45.900
Oh, I got friends behind glass counters.

35:45.900 --> 35:51.820
Faith Hill's got a mean and insatiable hunger for Subway sandwiches.

35:51.820 --> 35:56.380
And the only way I can feel it is with their sponsorship, Subway hacks.

35:57.100 --> 36:02.460
Also at some point I became Tim McGraw apparently instead of Garth Brooks.

36:03.420 --> 36:07.660
Oh no, I've exposed the fact that Faith Hill left Garth Tim McGraw.

36:07.660 --> 36:08.940
Fuck, they're all the same.

36:08.940 --> 36:09.500
God damn it.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.580
They're all just a bunch of fucking slack shod yokels

36:11.580 --> 36:13.820
wearing the same fucking hats and playing the same three chords.

36:13.820 --> 36:16.540
God damn it.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.060
What's wrong with you?

36:18.060 --> 36:18.940
Subway hacks.

36:20.780 --> 36:23.020
Always ask for spinach as the first topping.

36:23.020 --> 36:27.260
They'll try to trick you by asking lettuce or tomato, but stay focused.

36:27.260 --> 36:29.500
And by saying spinach and tomato instead,

36:29.500 --> 36:32.380
they will give you as much nutritious expensive spinach

36:32.380 --> 36:36.140
as they would icy cheap lettuce instead of a measly five leaves.

36:36.780 --> 36:40.380
And add a bonus, when you later add lettuce to your sandwich,

36:40.380 --> 36:44.380
they will flash you a look of defeat as they're now a card carrying member

36:44.380 --> 36:48.540
of a secret Subway hacking society.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.220
That's from Victor.

36:53.100 --> 36:55.340
This is obviously a very tremendous valuable tip

36:55.340 --> 36:58.460
that's going to save all of our listeners thousands of dollars every year.

36:58.460 --> 37:01.180
But I don't know that I would call any scenario

37:01.180 --> 37:05.420
that results in me eating more spinach as a successful hack.

37:06.380 --> 37:07.100
Yeah, I think you have been hacked.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.220
It's not about the action, it's about the outcome, Griffin.

37:10.220 --> 37:14.300
It's that you can then just throw the spinach away in front of them.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.500
This hack will get you two giant free fistfuls of lima beans.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.220
Like, cool.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.140
I could not hack it and then not hack those.

37:22.140 --> 37:26.780
By the way, sir, I hate to call Victor out here,

37:27.340 --> 37:31.260
but I think once I've got one vegetable on my sandwich,

37:31.260 --> 37:33.340
I'm already pretty proud of myself.

37:33.900 --> 37:37.420
I don't think I need to show off by putting two on there.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.300
I just have to assume you're announcing that loudly to the audience

37:40.300 --> 37:42.300
or maybe calling your wife to tell her

37:42.300 --> 37:43.820
how many cookie points you earned

37:43.820 --> 37:46.140
by getting both spinach and lettuce on your sandwich.

37:46.140 --> 37:46.700
Cookie points.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.620
Does Subway let you redeem cookie points yet?

37:48.620 --> 37:50.860
Is that an actionable currency yet?

37:50.860 --> 37:51.580
No, not yet.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.100
We'll get that going.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.340
This next one's from Chelsea T.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.580
Who says it is cheaper to order a veggie sandwich

37:57.580 --> 38:00.620
and pay to add ham than it is to buy a ham sandwich.

38:01.260 --> 38:05.420
If you want, you can ask for a clump of cookie dough instead of a cookie.

38:05.420 --> 38:09.980
You can also ask them to put the cookies in the toaster for 30 seconds

38:09.980 --> 38:11.580
and the chocolate chips get all gooey and great.

38:11.580 --> 38:15.020
No, no, no, I can't do a fucking hack

38:15.020 --> 38:19.020
that requires me to like get this poor Subway engineer

38:19.020 --> 38:22.060
to do extra work and like hold up the line.

38:22.060 --> 38:25.340
All right, first off, first off, they're artists, all right?

38:25.340 --> 38:30.220
They're not just cobblers putting together sandwiches

38:30.220 --> 38:32.300
free of any sort of artistry.

38:32.300 --> 38:33.260
These are artists.

38:33.260 --> 38:34.540
You're right, my apologies.

38:34.540 --> 38:38.700
I want to say this, though, that if you are the dude in line at Subway

38:38.700 --> 38:40.060
and they're like, would you like a cookie with that?

38:40.060 --> 38:42.860
And say, no, what I want is a lump of dough.

38:42.860 --> 38:46.860
And if you could ask them to toast a regular cookie

38:46.860 --> 38:49.100
and you can ask for a lump of cookie dough,

38:49.100 --> 38:51.420
can you ask for a lump of cookie dough

38:51.420 --> 38:53.660
and ask them to cook it right in front of you?

38:55.420 --> 38:58.140
I really want a cookie, but I want to be there for the process.

38:58.140 --> 38:59.900
I have to see that it's free range.

38:59.900 --> 39:00.700
I have to see.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.980
I want to be all up in every step.

39:03.980 --> 39:06.140
I have to see that it's a cruelty free cookie.

39:06.140 --> 39:33.020
I'm sorry.

39:33.020 --> 39:37.260
And the best comedians in the English speaking world for international waters.

39:37.260 --> 39:40.620
Go to maximumfun.org or look for us in the iTunes store.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.460
I'm a guy in his early 20s.

39:42.460 --> 39:43.580
Oh, you got a Yahoo, don't you?

39:43.580 --> 39:44.380
I do, I got a few.

39:44.380 --> 39:46.300
This Yahoo was sent in by Meredith Mahan.

39:46.300 --> 39:46.860
Thank you, Meredith.

39:46.860 --> 39:51.340
It's by Yahoo Answers user Voltorb8787.

39:52.780 --> 39:53.820
Thank you, Voltorb.

39:53.820 --> 39:57.420
Who asks, are double ghosts real?

39:59.740 --> 40:01.420
I know regular ghosts are real.

40:01.420 --> 40:02.620
Wait, hold on real quick.

40:02.620 --> 40:03.260
Yep.

40:03.260 --> 40:05.580
I want to guess what he means before you say it.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.980
Why don't you write it down on a piece of paper?

40:09.260 --> 40:09.980
Okay, wait, hold on.

40:09.980 --> 40:11.980
I'm going to type it into the Skype window.

40:11.980 --> 40:12.460
Keep going.

40:12.460 --> 40:12.700
Okay.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.500
I know regular ghosts are real.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.060
I want Travis to type it first.

40:18.060 --> 40:18.540
I'm sorry.

40:18.540 --> 40:20.700
This has become much more important to me than the question.

40:21.260 --> 40:21.900
Okay.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.260
It's a fun little metagame that really none of our listeners are going to be able to enjoy,

40:25.260 --> 40:25.660
but we'll see.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.980
I also enjoy it afterwards.

40:27.980 --> 40:29.180
He is a slow type.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.100
I know, Jesus Christ.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.940
Are you just hunting and pecking?

40:32.940 --> 40:33.180
Yes.

40:33.180 --> 40:33.420
Okay.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.820
This is actually two guesses, Travis, which is kind of bullshit.

40:38.700 --> 40:41.340
Well, it's double ghosts, so double guess, bitch.

40:41.340 --> 40:42.700
All right, Griffin, go ahead.

40:42.700 --> 40:43.740
Are double ghosts real?

40:43.740 --> 40:45.740
I know regular ghosts are real.

40:45.740 --> 40:49.980
My cousin said that a ghost could die and be a double ghost,

40:50.540 --> 40:53.980
and the ghost's connection to the spirit world is stronger and it's more powerful.

40:54.860 --> 40:56.620
See, I would think it would be weaker.

40:57.260 --> 40:57.820
Why is that?

40:57.820 --> 41:03.900
Well, because the ghost already can't manifest as much as a human being is,

41:03.900 --> 41:07.900
so you would think then the second ghost would be even flimsier than the ghost.

41:08.540 --> 41:12.700
See, we're getting into some Channel 101 prison-prison break territory right now.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.580
The prison inside the prison where prisoners go for breaking the rules.

41:16.940 --> 41:18.700
We are really getting fucking deep down in it.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.460
There's different planes, right?

41:22.460 --> 41:23.340
There's got to be different...

41:24.700 --> 41:26.620
God, I just watched Poltergeist.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.540
I just watched Poltergeist. I feel like they address this.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.980
The problem is, is that how deep does that rabbit hole go?

41:31.980 --> 41:33.420
Can you have triple ghosts?

41:33.420 --> 41:37.820
Well, eventually there's just going to be one ghost in the deepest verse, right?

41:37.820 --> 41:42.860
Unless you're talking about like a ghost, like quintuple ghost murder suicide.

41:42.860 --> 41:46.140
Well, you can have a quintuple ghost because that's how God was born.

41:46.940 --> 41:48.300
God's a quintuple ghost.

41:48.300 --> 41:48.860
I don't...

41:48.860 --> 41:51.340
But where did he come from?

41:51.340 --> 41:51.980
You know what I mean?

41:51.980 --> 41:53.340
That's always a good question, isn't it?

41:53.340 --> 41:55.580
Whoa, it's a real chicken and egg kind of thing, isn't it?

41:55.580 --> 41:56.220
Yeah.

41:56.220 --> 41:56.700
How would you...

41:56.700 --> 41:57.900
What if each time...

41:57.900 --> 42:02.300
Okay, what if each time the ghost died and came back, they were just 1% smaller?

42:03.100 --> 42:04.460
Okay, I like this.

42:04.460 --> 42:05.660
But then, okay...

42:05.660 --> 42:07.980
But also 1% denser.

42:10.060 --> 42:14.220
And so then eventually you get like a dark matter kind of thing, right?

42:14.220 --> 42:17.660
Where you have a very tiny but very dense ghost.

42:17.660 --> 42:22.780
That ghost is going to be super A, easy to eat, B, delicious.

42:22.780 --> 42:26.620
Ghosts are going to eat the fuck out of smaller ghosts.

42:26.620 --> 42:32.700
So you're saying like once that process, once a ghost is being eaten by other livelier,

42:32.700 --> 42:38.380
I guess, for lack of a better adjective, ghosts, they get super fucking fat.

42:38.380 --> 42:39.340
I bet you guys...

42:39.340 --> 42:40.300
No, not fat.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.180
Dense.

42:41.180 --> 42:42.540
You know what I bet, guys?

42:42.540 --> 42:48.460
I bet that Pac-Mens have protests about people creating quadruple ghosts for eating

42:48.460 --> 42:49.900
because it's cruel to ghosts.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.540
Oh, shit.

42:50.540 --> 42:51.980
I didn't even think about that shit.

42:51.980 --> 42:54.140
Pinky and Bunky and Inky and all those dudes.

42:54.140 --> 43:00.620
They've got to be like trillions upon trillions of layers deep.

43:00.620 --> 43:07.100
They're like foie ghosts and they have been raised, farm raised, killed multiple, multiple,

43:07.100 --> 43:10.780
multiple times to be the most delicious to the residents of Pac-Land.

43:10.780 --> 43:11.500
Yeah.

43:11.500 --> 43:12.780
How do you kill a ghost though?

43:13.820 --> 43:16.380
That is a huge question that I have been struggling with.

43:16.380 --> 43:18.300
I feel like in my encounters...

43:18.300 --> 43:23.820
If I know one thing from Final Fantasy, you cast cure on them.

43:23.820 --> 43:25.420
Yeah, that definitely hurts their HP.

43:25.420 --> 43:27.420
But it's more of a banishment.

43:27.420 --> 43:29.420
I feel like you can only banish a ghost.

43:29.420 --> 43:30.940
I feel like killing a ghost...

43:30.940 --> 43:32.700
Well, you can bust them.

43:32.700 --> 43:33.180
You know what I mean?

43:33.180 --> 43:35.020
You can also shame them.

43:35.020 --> 43:36.940
That's really just a containment, isn't it?

43:36.940 --> 43:41.420
I mean, ghosts aren't being busted so much as they're just being imprisoned.

43:41.980 --> 43:43.420
The whole thing's a misnomer.

43:43.420 --> 43:44.940
Well, when you bust them...

43:44.940 --> 43:46.940
Imprisoning makes me feel good.

43:46.940 --> 43:52.540
It's sort of like when you're on the basketball court and someone does an ankle breaker and

43:53.100 --> 43:55.660
dribbles around you and they busted you.

43:55.660 --> 43:56.380
You got busted.

43:56.380 --> 43:56.860
You know what I mean?

43:56.860 --> 43:58.540
So it's embarrassing.

43:58.540 --> 44:00.140
So you've also embarrassed the ghost.

44:00.860 --> 44:07.340
Could a ghost be ill and recover or be mortally wounded but not die?

44:07.340 --> 44:09.420
You can't be mortally wounded if you're already dead.

44:09.420 --> 44:10.220
It doesn't make any sense.

44:10.220 --> 44:10.700
That's what I'm saying.

44:10.700 --> 44:12.620
You could be immortally wounded.

44:12.620 --> 44:13.180
Whoa.

44:13.180 --> 44:14.060
Like Highlander.

44:14.060 --> 44:15.100
That's tricky though.

44:15.100 --> 44:17.260
Griffin, can you read the question again real quick?

44:18.540 --> 44:19.180
Sure.

44:19.180 --> 44:20.220
Are double ghosts real?

44:20.940 --> 44:24.060
Did you need more or just the synopsis?

44:24.060 --> 44:25.740
I know regular ghosts are real.

44:25.740 --> 44:30.060
My cousin said that a ghost could die and be a double ghost.

44:30.060 --> 44:36.060
I just wanted to stop you right there and point out that this guy has the sweetest cousin ever.

44:36.060 --> 44:40.860
This guy is cousin-ing so hard and that is exactly what a cousin should be doing.

44:40.860 --> 44:44.780
Not only reinforcing your own dumb belief in ghosts,

44:44.780 --> 44:48.700
but expanding your horizons on what a ghost can be.

44:50.060 --> 44:51.660
Because one of two things is going on.

44:51.660 --> 44:53.740
Either that cousin just went back to his friends like,

44:53.740 --> 44:57.500
oh my god, you guys, I totally told Todd that ghosts could die.

44:58.140 --> 45:01.500
Or that cousin is Stephen Hawking.

45:02.780 --> 45:07.660
There are some people who responded to this question

45:07.660 --> 45:13.820
and the tone of their answers possess a level of certainty

45:15.180 --> 45:19.020
with which I speak about like the deliciousness of cinnamon toast crunch

45:19.020 --> 45:21.420
or the fact that the sun rises in the morning.

45:22.220 --> 45:25.660
They are so so certain that they have solved this conundrum.

45:26.220 --> 45:27.820
Like for instance, you can't die twice.

45:27.820 --> 45:31.020
A ghost can only stay in its current state or move on to the other side, one word,

45:31.820 --> 45:33.980
accepting that it is no longer part of the physical world.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.980
If the ghost crosses over, they become a spirit,

45:35.980 --> 45:37.660
which is the soul's natural state.

45:37.660 --> 45:39.580
In that sense, the spirit would be more powerful

45:39.580 --> 45:41.420
because it would no longer be tied to the physical realm

45:41.420 --> 45:42.700
or to its own past anymore

45:42.700 --> 45:45.580
and would also obtain knowledge and support from the other side.

45:45.580 --> 45:47.900
So it sounds like being a ghost is kind of a shit deal.

45:47.900 --> 45:51.340
Yeah, I thought something I want to sign up for.

45:51.340 --> 45:53.820
Yeah, but I mean, how is that any different from how we used to speak

45:53.820 --> 45:56.460
with certainty about the sun revolving around the earth?

45:57.900 --> 46:00.780
You're saying ghost technology hasn't come far enough for research.

46:00.780 --> 46:04.380
I'm just saying that, listen, you can believe with your mind all you want.

46:04.380 --> 46:06.060
You got to believe with your heart.

46:06.060 --> 46:09.900
And I believe ghosts can die and come back with my heart.

46:10.780 --> 46:12.860
That doesn't make it true, Travis.

46:12.860 --> 46:14.940
I believe with my heart.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.260
Listen, he's got mustard seed faith in his heart

46:17.260 --> 46:20.300
about his hypothesis of ghost murder.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.700
Let's just let it be

46:22.700 --> 46:25.100
because we're obviously not going to be able to change his mind about it.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.140
Travis, are you set in your ways?

46:26.140 --> 46:27.820
No, because it's not in my mind, it's in my heart.

46:27.820 --> 46:29.580
Right, in your mustard heart.

46:29.580 --> 46:31.660
Is there anything I can say to you to change your mind?

46:31.660 --> 46:33.500
You can show me a ghost who hasn't died.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.260
I'm sure there are tons of ghosts that haven't died

46:35.260 --> 46:37.580
just in the same way that there are tons of humans who haven't died.

46:37.580 --> 46:38.380
Show me.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.540
Show you, right, you can't prove a negative.

46:40.540 --> 46:42.220
Show you a human that hasn't died?

46:42.940 --> 46:43.420
Yes.

46:43.420 --> 46:45.740
Pierce Brosnan, Emilio Esteves.

46:45.740 --> 46:46.860
We're getting off track.

46:46.860 --> 46:47.340
Courtney Love.

46:47.340 --> 46:48.380
You're using me with your logic.

46:48.380 --> 46:48.780
Me.

46:48.780 --> 46:49.820
What are your damn science?

46:49.820 --> 46:54.140
The heavens opened up and juicy crust came down from heaven above

46:54.140 --> 46:58.380
and said, Travis, ghosts can never die.

46:58.940 --> 47:00.140
What would you say then?

47:00.140 --> 47:01.820
I know, because I invented them.

47:03.180 --> 47:04.700
I invented ghosts.

47:04.700 --> 47:08.780
I would say that I was an American and I would wait to hear from our Jesus.

47:08.780 --> 47:09.580
Which Jesus?

47:10.620 --> 47:11.500
Jeezy Creasy.

47:13.900 --> 47:15.580
Yes, I can't argue with that.

47:16.460 --> 47:18.300
I'm a guy in his early 20s.

47:18.300 --> 47:20.860
In an effort to step out of my comfort zone,

47:20.860 --> 47:24.060
I recently started taking Zumba classes in secret.

47:24.060 --> 47:27.660
However, through sheer bad luck, I found out my boss,

47:27.660 --> 47:30.540
who happened to be randomly walking by the studio I go to,

47:30.540 --> 47:34.380
caught a glimpse of me shaking my bodacious booty.

47:34.380 --> 47:36.460
Now my entire team knows.

47:36.460 --> 47:40.060
How can I play this off effectively and still save face?

47:40.060 --> 47:42.300
That's from Crumping in Columbus.

47:42.300 --> 47:43.900
And you'll be happy to know the question asker

47:43.900 --> 47:46.220
has gone through the trouble of making the Columbus with a K.

47:47.020 --> 47:49.580
You have got to lean into it.

47:49.580 --> 47:51.820
You have got to lean into it.

47:51.820 --> 47:52.300
Just like-

47:52.300 --> 47:54.700
Are you gonna be still the butt of jokes

47:54.700 --> 48:02.220
when you have got just like an incredible Zumba crafted body?

48:02.220 --> 48:04.940
No, you'll be the envy of the whole office pool.

48:04.940 --> 48:08.220
I'm saying show up like full jazzercise outfit.

48:08.220 --> 48:12.220
Whoa, you're saying like develop an entire identity around Zumba.

48:12.220 --> 48:12.720
Yeah.

48:13.420 --> 48:14.700
You become Mr. or Mrs. Zumba.

48:14.700 --> 48:16.140
Because here's the thing, they can only make fun of you.

48:16.140 --> 48:18.460
They can only make you the center of the butt of the joke,

48:18.460 --> 48:19.580
as long as you let them.

48:21.180 --> 48:23.100
You have to show them that it doesn't bother you.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.780
You have to show them that it doesn't bother you.

48:25.580 --> 48:25.900
Are you saying-

48:25.900 --> 48:27.020
And keep drinking your milk.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.380
You own the Zumba.

48:28.380 --> 48:30.300
You become Dr. Zumba.

48:31.420 --> 48:32.220
Attorney at law.

48:34.220 --> 48:35.260
It's worth it, man.

48:35.260 --> 48:38.540
If this guy is an attorney, he can be like the David Comey of Austin, Texas.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.300
The attorney, the caveman attorney that rocks.

48:40.940 --> 48:44.220
And be the attorney that fucking undulates.

48:44.220 --> 48:48.220
You're saying guy, but do we know if this is man or woman?

48:48.220 --> 48:50.460
Says I'm a guy in the early 20s, so-

48:50.460 --> 48:51.660
He does say guy, okay.

48:51.660 --> 48:52.220
Yeah.

48:52.220 --> 48:53.260
That's right.

48:53.260 --> 48:54.860
Second, here's my question.

48:54.860 --> 48:55.900
Is your boss fat?

48:56.460 --> 48:57.580
Oh my God.

48:57.580 --> 48:58.700
That would be sick.

48:59.500 --> 49:02.460
Welcome to my new Spike reality show, Is Your Boss Fat?

49:04.060 --> 49:06.060
You're watching Undercover Fat Boss.

49:06.060 --> 49:07.980
Who's this new fat employee we have?

49:08.540 --> 49:10.860
This new fat employee sucks at his job.

49:10.860 --> 49:13.020
Why did we hire this new fat employee?

49:13.020 --> 49:15.260
But I know it's our boss, because nobody's this fat.

49:15.260 --> 49:16.380
Nobody's this fat except-

49:16.380 --> 49:18.780
No, wait, what about Undercover Fat Boss?

49:18.780 --> 49:20.620
You take a boss who's very skinny.

49:20.620 --> 49:23.020
You take him away for six months and fatten him up,

49:23.020 --> 49:25.100
and then bring him back as the boss again.

49:25.100 --> 49:26.540
Hey, hey, Gordo.

49:26.540 --> 49:28.380
Do you have a good trip?

49:28.380 --> 49:29.740
Jesus Christ, this guy.

49:30.620 --> 49:32.620
Did you eat all the pigs in Hawaii?

49:33.340 --> 49:33.900
Fat fuck.

49:37.740 --> 49:38.460
Wait a second.

49:39.340 --> 49:40.380
I see the seams.

49:41.100 --> 49:43.580
Are we on Undercover Fat Boss right now?

49:44.380 --> 49:45.820
Man, this show sucks dick.

49:45.820 --> 49:49.180
Wait, I'm not signing any waivers.

49:51.100 --> 49:52.700
I don't want my personal brand associated

49:52.700 --> 49:54.700
with this bullshit TV show.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.980
I got a brand to maintain.

49:55.980 --> 49:58.780
I can't be seen on Undercover Fat Boss.

49:58.780 --> 50:01.580
People give you trouble over you getting healthy.

50:02.300 --> 50:05.180
Like, I guess if you can take it on the chin

50:05.180 --> 50:08.700
and just let it roll off your back

50:08.700 --> 50:11.100
and just wait for these fat fucks to die.

50:11.100 --> 50:12.620
Because really, here, break it down.

50:13.580 --> 50:14.860
Why would they make fun of that?

50:14.860 --> 50:16.780
A, because you're a dude?

50:16.780 --> 50:18.540
Well, that's sexist.

50:18.540 --> 50:20.780
B, because they think it's stupid?

50:20.780 --> 50:21.900
Well, that's judgmental.

50:21.900 --> 50:23.340
And they're probably not healthy

50:23.340 --> 50:25.500
because they think exercise is stupid.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.820
Or C, they're just judgy assholes.

50:27.820 --> 50:29.580
Like, what does it matter?

50:29.580 --> 50:30.780
You're not doing anything wrong.

50:30.780 --> 50:32.540
It's not like they caught you doing something shameful.

50:32.540 --> 50:35.420
I don't think it's sexist so much as it's zumbist.

50:35.420 --> 50:39.580
Because I think it would alter my perception of man or woman

50:39.580 --> 50:41.420
if I knew that they were into zumba.

50:41.420 --> 50:42.220
Not in a bad way.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.660
It just changes my outlook.

50:43.660 --> 50:46.300
I traded in my iPod for a zumba a long time ago,

50:46.300 --> 50:47.580
and I don't regret the decision.

50:48.540 --> 50:50.460
I actually bought a zumba to clean my floors

50:50.460 --> 50:51.180
when I wasn't home.

50:52.780 --> 50:53.660
I got a zumba.

50:54.540 --> 50:55.580
No, go ahead.

50:55.580 --> 50:56.700
Keep it rolling.

50:56.700 --> 50:58.860
I got zumbas.

51:01.900 --> 51:03.340
It locks my car.

51:03.980 --> 51:08.700
So I think that every dude that gives other dudes shit

51:08.700 --> 51:10.380
for how good they are at dancing

51:10.380 --> 51:13.500
is absolutely jealous of the fact that this person

51:13.500 --> 51:13.980
is very good at dancing.

51:13.980 --> 51:15.180
Oh, yeah, it's such insecurity.

51:15.180 --> 51:17.740
Like, there are very few things that I think that about.

51:17.740 --> 51:19.900
I think that there are people that harbor prejudices

51:19.900 --> 51:21.260
against certain activities,

51:21.260 --> 51:24.700
and thus they give people a guff over those activities.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.300
Dancing, I do not think, is one of them.

51:26.300 --> 51:28.220
You see, like, fucking Savion Glover,

51:28.220 --> 51:30.460
like, just destroying it.

51:30.460 --> 51:32.940
You can't be like, look at this dude fucking tap dance.

51:32.940 --> 51:36.380
No, no, like, the most uncultured human being alive.

51:36.380 --> 51:38.860
I always said Gregory Peck, but I think I'm behind.

51:38.860 --> 51:40.940
I think you think Gregory Hines.

51:43.740 --> 51:45.260
You ever seen Gregory Peck dance?

51:45.820 --> 51:47.820
God, get it out of his finch.

51:47.820 --> 51:50.220
He can probably, he can probably move it.

51:50.220 --> 51:51.660
I mean, not anymore, obviously.

51:52.620 --> 51:54.380
But the same charge could be leveled

51:54.380 --> 51:56.620
at Gregory Hines, fellow dead person.

51:56.620 --> 51:58.860
You think they have a dance in double heaven.

52:01.900 --> 52:03.740
God, there's only one thing that could make

52:03.740 --> 52:05.980
ghost Gregory Hines better at dancing

52:05.980 --> 52:07.580
is if he was a double ghost.

52:07.580 --> 52:11.820
I don't want to, I don't want to commit this theory to paper,

52:12.380 --> 52:15.820
but both Gregory Peck and Gregory Hines passed away in 2003.

52:15.820 --> 52:18.860
I think that they are, if they have gone through the path,

52:18.860 --> 52:22.380
the multi-ghost pass, I think they're probably

52:22.380 --> 52:23.660
at about the same level.

52:24.380 --> 52:25.340
Best Greggs.

52:25.340 --> 52:28.380
Best Greggs forever and ever into oblivion.

52:29.180 --> 52:29.980
You guys want Yahoo?

52:30.780 --> 52:31.280
Sure.

52:32.300 --> 52:33.900
This Yahoo was sent in by Hilary Armstrong.

52:33.900 --> 52:34.380
Thanks, Hilary.

52:34.380 --> 52:34.940
It's by Yahoo!

52:34.940 --> 52:38.060
who answers user Megan, who asks, what are the tactical demands

52:38.060 --> 52:38.780
in badminton?

52:40.220 --> 52:41.020
Good question.

52:41.020 --> 52:43.420
Doing an assignment in BTE-C sport

52:43.420 --> 52:45.020
and really stuck on this question.

52:45.020 --> 52:45.500
Help.

52:45.500 --> 52:47.420
No idea what BTE stands for.

52:47.420 --> 52:48.540
BTE?

52:48.540 --> 52:49.040
C.

52:49.660 --> 52:50.700
BTE-C.

52:50.700 --> 52:51.820
BTE-C.

52:51.820 --> 52:52.300
BTO.

52:52.300 --> 52:53.100
BTE.

52:53.100 --> 52:55.100
It's taking care of business.

52:55.660 --> 53:02.300
I think it's badminton, tennis, electro, and cart.

53:02.300 --> 53:05.580
So it's a new bad-ass sport that blends the best elements

53:05.580 --> 53:07.260
of those four.

53:07.260 --> 53:07.580
Yes.

53:07.580 --> 53:08.540
Please repeat the question.

53:09.100 --> 53:10.940
What are the tactical demands in badminton?

53:12.700 --> 53:15.660
You got to take out the weak first.

53:15.660 --> 53:16.780
It's not Hunger Games.

53:16.780 --> 53:17.500
You understand that.

53:17.500 --> 53:18.300
It's like, it's like-

53:19.020 --> 53:22.700
You got to outlast, outsmart, outplay, outdance.

53:22.700 --> 53:23.900
Travis, you confused the survivor.

53:23.900 --> 53:25.900
You got to say shuttlecock without laughing.

53:26.780 --> 53:28.940
I think you got to do a lot of things in this sport

53:28.940 --> 53:30.060
without laughing.

53:30.060 --> 53:30.540
You know that?

53:30.540 --> 53:32.700
OK, you know that move where you kind of wind up like you're

53:32.700 --> 53:35.100
really just going to smash the shit out of the shuttlecock,

53:35.100 --> 53:37.420
but then you just kind of tap it over the net?

53:37.420 --> 53:38.140
There's that move.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.020
OK, so I have a theory that everybody is, at least,

53:42.380 --> 53:46.380
every sport has claimed at least one life, right?

53:46.380 --> 53:47.660
Football, definitely.

53:47.660 --> 53:49.580
Baseball, almost certainly.

53:51.420 --> 53:52.300
Baseball, definitely.

53:52.300 --> 53:52.940
Baseball, definitely.

53:52.940 --> 53:54.860
Yeah, I killed that kid's mom in Owen Meany.

53:56.060 --> 53:56.380
What?

53:56.380 --> 53:56.620
No.

53:56.620 --> 54:00.460
No, hockey, sure, definitely.

54:00.460 --> 54:03.260
You're talking about slippery, slippery foot knives.

54:04.060 --> 54:07.260
Badminton, I think is the exception to the rule.

54:07.260 --> 54:10.220
I do not think a badminton in any measure-

54:10.860 --> 54:12.060
Let me, let me paint you a picture.

54:12.060 --> 54:13.180
Could possess lethality.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.460
Because obviously the first consideration-

54:14.460 --> 54:17.580
OK, they go, wait, they go for a power spike, power spike,

54:17.580 --> 54:19.660
shuttlecock, someone's opening their mouth saying,

54:19.660 --> 54:22.460
I got it, shuttlecock, down the throat, choking to death.

54:22.460 --> 54:22.860
But no, you can't-

54:22.860 --> 54:25.340
Time look won't work because it's got the spines on the net.

54:25.340 --> 54:26.700
It's a safety pop, Travis.

54:26.700 --> 54:27.500
It's covered in a-

54:27.500 --> 54:30.140
It's got a giant rigid net on the end.

54:30.140 --> 54:30.620
That's just-

54:30.620 --> 54:31.420
No, that's what I'm saying.

54:31.420 --> 54:33.420
That's what lodged it in the throat.

54:33.420 --> 54:35.660
Nobody has a throat big enough to get that stuck in there.

54:35.660 --> 54:36.220
Nobody does.

54:36.220 --> 54:37.100
Not anymore.

54:37.100 --> 54:39.980
Back in the day, you must have used to have a much thinner,

54:39.980 --> 54:41.260
smaller girth cock.

54:42.940 --> 54:43.980
Don't you fucking laugh.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.100
Don't you laugh at that.

54:45.100 --> 54:45.660
Don't.

54:45.660 --> 54:48.460
A person lost their life because of that cock.

54:48.460 --> 54:51.820
So Justin just linked this fucking badminton forum.

54:51.820 --> 54:54.140
Sorry for speaking out of turn, everybody,

54:54.140 --> 54:55.980
because someone definitely died of a heart attack

54:55.980 --> 54:57.100
while playing badminton.

54:57.100 --> 54:58.780
But listen, if I was playing badminton-

54:59.660 --> 55:00.140
No, if I-

55:00.140 --> 55:02.300
Justin serves the internet.

55:02.300 --> 55:02.940
All right.

55:02.940 --> 55:04.060
It's a fun part of the show.

55:04.060 --> 55:05.260
But if I was playing badminton,

55:05.260 --> 55:07.260
somebody ran onto the court and stabbed me to death,

55:07.260 --> 55:08.860
that's not a badminton related injury.

55:09.660 --> 55:11.340
Because there's no way that you could-

55:11.340 --> 55:14.380
Nobody's worked up a sweat playing fucking badminton.

55:14.380 --> 55:14.860
You know what I mean?

55:14.860 --> 55:17.660
Like the physical strenuousness of this task

55:17.660 --> 55:20.140
did not cause this person to keel over and fucking die.

55:21.020 --> 55:22.460
It's impossible.

55:22.460 --> 55:23.660
Mythbusters?

55:23.660 --> 55:24.700
Myth busted.

55:24.700 --> 55:26.380
We don't need to send this to those guys.

55:27.180 --> 55:28.620
We can do this shit ourselves.

55:28.620 --> 55:30.620
We can DIY this myth bust.

55:30.620 --> 55:33.500
Hey, we've been relying on mythbusters for too long, America.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.260
It's time we take this matter into our own hands.

55:35.260 --> 55:37.260
Nobody has ever died playing badminton

55:37.260 --> 55:39.260
because nobody moves playing badminton

55:39.260 --> 55:42.460
and everything is made out of unkillable materials.

55:43.500 --> 55:44.620
Can't be done.

55:44.620 --> 55:45.100
Can't be done.

55:45.100 --> 55:47.340
The rackets weigh like half a gram.

55:47.340 --> 55:47.740
Can't be done.

55:47.740 --> 55:48.300
What if you-

55:48.300 --> 55:48.780
Oh, okay.

55:48.780 --> 55:49.980
What if you were running too fast,

55:49.980 --> 55:51.980
you slipped, hit the net, decapitated?

55:51.980 --> 55:54.380
Nobody runs while playing badminton.

55:54.380 --> 55:56.380
It's little kid tennis.

55:56.380 --> 55:57.180
Okay, okay.

55:57.180 --> 55:58.300
You're playing badminton.

55:58.300 --> 56:00.940
There's a light sprinkle of dew upon the ground.

56:00.940 --> 56:03.500
You slip, you fly backwards.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.780
I accidentally hit you with my racket.

56:06.780 --> 56:07.020
You did.

56:07.020 --> 56:08.940
Why are you on my side of the badminton court?

56:09.660 --> 56:10.780
Because we're playing doubles.

56:12.140 --> 56:14.540
What if you make a bet with the person you're playing against?

56:15.500 --> 56:18.060
If they lose, they have to eat their whole racket.

56:18.860 --> 56:19.260
That's good.

56:19.260 --> 56:23.260
Or if they lose, you get to kill their wife.

56:23.260 --> 56:25.580
We're going to play badminton and whoever loses

56:25.580 --> 56:27.260
gets killed by the other person.

56:27.260 --> 56:29.660
It's the most dangerous game to the sequel.

56:30.380 --> 56:31.980
Hey, listen, we liked your first book.

56:32.780 --> 56:34.460
I don't know so much about this new one.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.780
It is kind of implausible.

56:36.780 --> 56:37.900
You're playing badminton, right?

56:37.900 --> 56:38.540
You go back.

56:38.540 --> 56:39.020
I'm not.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.700
So that's like, I guess, step one.

56:40.700 --> 56:42.620
Like, let me undo this theory

56:42.620 --> 56:44.140
because I'm definitely not playing badminton.

56:44.140 --> 56:46.380
Okay, person A is playing badminton

56:46.380 --> 56:49.260
and person B has hit the shuttlecock into a high arc.

56:49.260 --> 56:51.820
You're scooting back to get it.

56:51.820 --> 56:53.260
You knock over the grill.

56:53.260 --> 56:54.780
You set the house on fire.

56:54.780 --> 56:56.460
Oh, sleeping grandma dead.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.620
Why wouldn't you go get her?

57:01.420 --> 57:03.340
Because playing badminton hardened you.

57:04.380 --> 57:05.980
And plus you need to finish the game.

57:06.860 --> 57:08.860
I want to thank you guys so much for listening.

57:09.820 --> 57:11.980
Sorry, we can't move on from the fact

57:11.980 --> 57:15.180
that Travis is just painting a picture of two people

57:15.180 --> 57:18.460
who are so fucking into their badminton game

57:18.460 --> 57:20.460
that not only will they allow themselves

57:20.460 --> 57:22.140
to lose every piece of property they own,

57:22.140 --> 57:24.300
they will allow their grandmother to fucking die.

57:25.020 --> 57:26.300
They'll allow their grandmother to fucking die.

57:26.300 --> 57:28.140
It's two out of three and they're tied one, one.

57:28.140 --> 57:30.620
Oh man, this actually does sound like a clutch scenario.

57:30.620 --> 57:31.820
Can I put money on this game?

57:33.740 --> 57:35.260
Sorry, Travis made it up.

57:36.300 --> 57:38.140
Thank you so much for listening to our show.

57:39.420 --> 57:40.700
We hope you had a lot of fun.

57:41.420 --> 57:43.180
Thank you to people tweeting about the show

57:43.180 --> 57:45.820
like Slammer of Jams, David Pemberton,

57:45.820 --> 57:49.500
Chetur, Ricardo, Andre, Chris Spain,

57:49.500 --> 57:52.220
JP Erickson, Pizza Lawyer, Blaine Flowers.

57:52.220 --> 57:55.820
Gotta say a huge, huge thank you to Agent O'Hara,

57:55.820 --> 57:58.780
Tyler Crowley, who made another delightful

57:58.780 --> 58:00.140
NBNB AM cartoon.

58:00.860 --> 58:02.860
If you want to see that, it's about Horsey.

58:02.860 --> 58:04.140
You can go to our Twitter feed.

58:04.140 --> 58:06.780
It's Twitter.com slash NBNB AM.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.220
We tweeted it recently.

58:08.220 --> 58:10.300

check out that Mitchell and Webb look

58:33.420 --> 58:35.100
or Supersizers Go.

58:35.100 --> 58:37.100
Both of them are British shows that are hilarious.

58:37.100 --> 58:38.220
If you like this show, you'll like that.

Did you finish it, Juice?

58:46.300 --> 58:47.100
No, not yet.

58:47.100 --> 58:50.140
I got kind of behind because I made me bored.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.020
I don't know what it was.

58:53.020 --> 58:54.140
I'll get back on it.

58:54.140 --> 58:55.660
Out of your fucking mind?

58:58.060 --> 58:59.500
Is that everything we have to do?

58:59.500 --> 59:00.540
Griffin, you have to thank

59:00.540 --> 59:01.820
John Rodgers and the Lawn Renders

59:01.820 --> 59:02.700
for the use of the theme song

59:02.700 --> 59:03.660
as a departure off the album.

59:03.660 --> 59:04.620
Put in your days to bed.

59:04.620 --> 59:05.900
Do you know how fucking shitty I feel

59:05.900 --> 59:07.660
that I can't go see them in concert?

59:07.660 --> 59:08.540
I mean, I could, but like,

59:08.540 --> 59:10.700
I would have to like fly to the Pacific Northwest

59:10.700 --> 59:11.660
and I don't think I have.

59:11.660 --> 59:12.220
I don't think I can.

59:12.220 --> 59:13.660
And then there's the restraining order.

59:13.660 --> 59:15.100
There is the restraining order.

59:15.100 --> 59:16.540

59:42.540 --> 59:43.340
But until that time,

59:43.340 --> 59:44.780
Griffin McElroy is here to take us away.

59:44.780 --> 59:47.740
Guys, my kitty just broke into my office.

59:47.740 --> 59:48.620
Adorable.

59:48.620 --> 59:50.380
What are you doing here, you little thief?

59:50.940 --> 59:52.380
Well, now he's stuck inside.

59:53.660 --> 59:55.900
I wish I could share him with our listeners.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.700
This Yahoo was sent in by Aaron McVicker.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:00.940
Thanks.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.140
Oh, just one second.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.380
This, thank you, Aaron McVicker.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.180
It's by Yahoo answer to user Kelvin who asks,

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:10.380
where is a good place to eat if you like to watch

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.900
old people spill stuff?

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.100
Oh, I'm just a McElroy.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.300
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.660
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.100
Get your popcorn.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.940
It's more better than my brother, Marie, isn't it?

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.300
Kiss him.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:40.460
Pretty close.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.380

Justin, what are you doing?

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.540
Uh, strapping a chicken in my arm.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.140
Heard there's some plague out west,

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:00.860
so I just wanted to, you know, kind of get out ahead of it.

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.220
Justin, if you'd ever listened to our medical history podcast,

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:07.100
Sawbones, where we talk about everything from trepanation

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.300
to bloodletting, you would know that that is a ridiculous idea

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.340
and it will never work.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.300
Sawbones, I haven't caught it.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:14.780
Sawbones?

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.780
Yes, it's every Friday on the Maximum Fun Network

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.540
and we record it together.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.020
You a doctor or something?

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.520
No.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:53.440
Yes.
