00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:54.400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to our Yuletide sort of now flowed into Boxing Day.

00:54.400 --> 01:02.080
Don't miss it, our Yuletide Observation of Candle Nights.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.200
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm already embarrassed by that joke I just made.

01:09.520 --> 01:14.000
I'm a baby. I am a baby. I'm a man-sized baby.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.520
And my name is Griffin McElroy.

01:15.520 --> 01:20.400
Baby G, Big T, Daddy J, here with you again.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.920
My brother and my brother made an advice show for the modern era.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.600
This is a time for you to gather with your family and say, hey, I got this show.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
It's for you sometimes.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.240
It's for you sometimes. Once in a great while, it's for you.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.800
There's 51 episodes in a year that you should not listen to because it gets

01:38.800 --> 01:42.080
coarse, I would say, the subject matter and language that we use.

01:42.080 --> 01:42.960
It gets quite blue.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.400
It gets blue and coarse, but not this time. This time, this weekend, it's...

01:48.400 --> 01:49.280
Red and smooth.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.400
It's nice and smooth.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.160
It's like a rough... Most of the time, it's like a rough blueberry bramble patch,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.640
and you don't want to go through that bramble patch because it's sharp.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.480
There are sharp edges and it's blue.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.000
This is like a raspberry pillow.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.640
This is a raspberry pillow for you to sleep on. Come with us.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.840
No curse words. Here we go.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.880
No curse words in this episode. Merry candle nights to all, and to all a good episode.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.400
Yeah, well, we'll see if we can do that without cursing.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.840
I don't have that, a lot of hope.

02:13.840 --> 02:19.040
Hey, guys, my girlfriend and I were debating about giving children gifts early.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.360
I believe giving kids grifts...

02:21.360 --> 02:30.560
I believe grifting my kids is wrong because the long con rarely works on four-year-olds.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.240
It doesn't do anything detrimental harm to them, and it's perfectly fine as long as it's

02:34.240 --> 02:38.400
approximately by the holiday they are going to get the presents for anyway.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.160
She thinks it would make the kids impatient and possibly demean the holiday.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.360
We would appreciate your help in deciding who is right.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.280
Feuding face-off in Florida.

02:48.880 --> 02:54.240
How are you supposed to get all excited for Christmas Eve and for Ho-Ho to come

02:54.880 --> 02:58.400
if Ho-Ho already came on, like, December the 20th?

02:58.400 --> 02:59.280
Well, here's the solution.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.960
What if they got to open their presents, but then you're like, okay, that's what you get,

03:02.960 --> 03:06.160
and then you rewrap it, and then they open them again on Christmas?

03:07.680 --> 03:11.200
Travis, I don't think outside of some, like, wacky memento or,

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200
if you will, clean slate scenario that that goof is going to work.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.360
What if you offered them, like, an envelope full of money,

03:17.360 --> 03:19.200
or they can take what's in box number two?

03:20.080 --> 03:20.720
Hold on.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.920
I need a paper towel.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.880
Did you spill coffee?

03:23.440 --> 03:24.160
Justin!

03:25.520 --> 03:27.920
This was supposed to be an edit-free episode.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.960
It will be.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.960
Justin has spilled coffee all over his charger.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.960
We have moments left before the computer shuts down.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.720
Before the house burns all the way down to the ground with all of our gifts down inside of it.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.720
Hey, did you guys listen to that candlelight episode?

03:42.720 --> 03:44.640
Yeah, it was real good, till they all died in the fire.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.520
I think we're not the right people to talk to about this,

03:47.520 --> 03:52.000
because we decided, we elected, to save our candlelight episode

03:52.000 --> 03:54.480
for the day after candlelight happened.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.560
No, candlelight is a long celebration.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.520
It goes two months.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.040
It goes to, like, mid-February.

03:59.040 --> 03:59.760
Oh my god.

03:59.760 --> 04:00.260
I know.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.680
But when it starts is always a question.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.480
Yeah, that's the question.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.040
The question, well, it doesn't start until we do this episode, so.

04:07.040 --> 04:07.760
Oh, okay.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.260
Right.

04:08.260 --> 04:16.900
So, I think it's bad, because kids, in this world, in my life, as a 31-year-old man,

04:17.780 --> 04:19.460
I don't have to wait for anything anymore.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.660
I don't get excited about anything.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.580
I don't get excited about anything, because I can just get it.

04:22.580 --> 04:26.660
If I want a new Rachel Ray 12-inch skillet with non-stick coating,

04:26.660 --> 04:27.860
I just buy it on Amazon.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.220
I get it the next day.

04:29.220 --> 04:29.620
Yeah.

04:29.620 --> 04:30.740
For $2.99.

04:30.740 --> 04:34.820
I mean, I miss looking forward to something that much,

04:34.820 --> 04:39.860
and, like, your kids are going to be older, and then next year, after December 12th,

04:39.860 --> 04:40.740
we're all going to be dead.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.140
So, why not let them look forward to Christmas one more time?

04:44.340 --> 04:45.620
I think it's December 20th.

04:45.620 --> 04:48.820
So, don't rob us of those precious eight days that we're going to.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.380
Also, as a parent, I am not a parent yet.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.820
Big announcement, everybody.

04:56.580 --> 05:02.420
I imagine, as a parent, you get drunk on that power of your kids are powerless.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.020
They can't buy anything.

05:04.020 --> 05:04.660
Oh, yeah.

05:04.660 --> 05:07.300
Your kids are poor, and they can't buy anything.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.540
But you can buy everything, because you're rich.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.580
So, why not lord that power over them?

05:12.580 --> 05:14.580
Like, I know what you got, and you don't, because you're a kid,

05:14.580 --> 05:17.060
and you've never bought anything for yourself in your life.

05:17.060 --> 05:20.420
Unless I give you, like, an allowance, and you go to KB Toys

05:20.420 --> 05:22.020
and buy yourself a Super Soaker or something.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.620
I'm saying, drink in that power.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.820
Just enjoy it.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.740
Ride that wave, as long as it'll take you.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.780
What if you convince your kids that, like, yeah, you can open the present,

05:29.780 --> 05:31.540
but then you don't get any other presents?

05:31.540 --> 05:32.340
Yeah, you can-

05:32.340 --> 05:35.060
And then you kind of, like, laugh when you say, like, you went over that,

05:35.060 --> 05:35.860
but you won't get any other.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.220
And they're like, oh, we want to open it.

05:37.220 --> 05:38.180
And you're like, OK.

05:38.180 --> 05:41.060
And then they open it, and then Christmas morning, nothing.

05:41.060 --> 05:42.820
Everything's gone, and you're like, see what you did?

05:42.820 --> 05:45.540
Because your greed and avarice, you get nothing.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.380
And you teach them the hardest lesson.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.420
You can have these presents, but let's see you dance first.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.180
You know what?

05:52.180 --> 05:57.380
Now that it's the day after Christmas, what you should do is really mess with them.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.740
Get back that power trip, and just put something else under the tree.

06:00.740 --> 06:04.660
Say, oops, just 364 more days, and you'll be turning into this bad boy.

06:04.660 --> 06:05.460
Leave it there all year.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.300
Let them know who's boss.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.100
I'm ready for it.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.820
Why are you, like, pushing against me?

06:10.820 --> 06:12.820
Because you're pushing me out of the house.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.100
I own the couch, though.

06:14.100 --> 06:14.900
This is bad.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.820
Hey, Griffin.

06:16.820 --> 06:17.540
You want a Yahoo?

06:17.540 --> 06:17.940
Yeah.

06:17.940 --> 06:19.060
Yeah, that's what we need.

06:19.060 --> 06:22.980
This Yahoo was sent in by Christa Whalen.

06:22.980 --> 06:23.940
Thank you, Christa Whalen.

06:24.820 --> 06:29.860
It is by Yahoo Answers user Angie, who asks, what is the best Christmas song to strip to?

06:29.860 --> 06:31.620
Can we talk about this at our family show?

06:32.180 --> 06:32.580
Yeah.

06:32.580 --> 06:33.460
Yeah, I think so.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.100
As long as we keep the answers clean.

06:36.100 --> 06:36.660
Okay.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.220
Yeah.

06:37.220 --> 06:40.100
I'm doing a striptease as part of my boyfriend's Christmas present.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.020
I have the naughty Santa costume.

06:42.020 --> 06:43.540
I just don't know what song to use.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.500
Any suggestions?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.940
I suggest not getting that present.

06:48.740 --> 06:49.780
What's wrong with that?

06:49.780 --> 06:52.580
What's wrong with a holiday striptease and a naughty Santa costume?

06:52.580 --> 06:56.420
Why did she spend so much on the hottest naughty Santa costume

06:56.420 --> 06:58.580
if she wasn't gonna do the striptease for her BF?

06:58.580 --> 07:00.260
She really backed into this idea.

07:00.260 --> 07:02.580
I think she should have probably picked the song first

07:02.580 --> 07:07.460
and then gone out and spent 72 bucks at Magic Makers to pick up the...

07:07.460 --> 07:09.940
Well, it depends on the song that you're stripping to.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.580
If you're gonna strip to like Santa baby, for instance,

07:12.580 --> 07:14.660
you want to put on a diaper and a Santa hat.

07:14.660 --> 07:15.220
That's true.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.940
Because that'll really ram home the theme.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.860
That'll really take it to sexy time.

07:19.860 --> 07:20.100
Yeah.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.660
If you're gonna do Little Drummer Boy, you need some bongos.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.180
Well-placed bongos.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.660
If you're gonna strip to the Christmas classic,

07:26.660 --> 07:28.660
someone chopped off my arms, you're gonna need commitment.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.900
You're gonna need to really buy into the bit.

07:32.420 --> 07:34.020
Actually, it's funny that you mentioned Santa baby.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.780
That is, according to the best answer as chosen by Asker,

07:37.780 --> 07:39.300
number one is Santa baby.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.780
It screams striptease, she says.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.420
No, it's the steviest Christmas song.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.180
In that list is also Blue Christmas, which I could see.

07:48.180 --> 07:49.700
I mean, it's a slow Christmas song.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.420
Also on that list is Have a Holly Jolly Christmas.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.340
Unless her name is Holly.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.500
Or Jolly.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.300
Still, I think it would be a little too fast-paced.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.700
There would be too much, yeah.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.220
She just passes out at the end.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.100
Do the Charleston.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.900
Get those flapper knees going.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.260
Is that what those are called?

08:08.260 --> 08:08.900
Flapper knees?

08:08.900 --> 08:09.700
Yeah, flapper knees.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.540
I feel that you contradicted when I said

08:11.540 --> 08:12.980
Santa baby was the steviest song.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.340
What's the steviest Christmas song?

08:14.340 --> 08:16.340
The steviest Christmas song is Griffin Dino.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.140
Baby, it's cold outside.

08:19.140 --> 08:20.180
That's the steviest.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.340
Especially when you get like, creeps are like,

08:22.340 --> 08:25.380
you get like, Willie Nelson and Nora Jones singing it together.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.100
Isn't there a line in there that's talking about

08:28.100 --> 08:30.980
my mother will worry, or my family will worry?

08:30.980 --> 08:32.020
And then there's the line where he's like,

08:32.020 --> 08:33.140
no, just drink this.

08:33.140 --> 08:33.780
Drink this.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.340
You have to drink this, it's so tasty.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.620
Yeah, I have to get away.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.980
No one knows that you're here.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.420
I'll call you a liar.

08:43.940 --> 08:44.900
It never happened.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.860
The holidays are inherently unsexy, right?

08:51.860 --> 08:53.140
I don't think Christmas is sexy.

08:53.140 --> 08:55.140
I don't think there's much sexy about Christmas,

08:55.140 --> 08:59.780
about fat dude who comes into your house's exhaust pipe

08:59.780 --> 09:01.780
and leaves you gifts, none of which are sexy,

09:01.780 --> 09:02.900
because your grandpa is there.

09:02.900 --> 09:03.860
And he's like, what's that?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.340
You can't have a sexy thing in that box, can you?

09:06.340 --> 09:08.180
I would like to see the follow up to this question.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.180
It's like, well, the strip tease went well,

09:10.180 --> 09:11.460
but I probably should have waited until

09:11.460 --> 09:13.940
after the family Christmas to do it.

09:13.940 --> 09:15.460
My boyfriend kept saying, what'd you get me?

09:15.460 --> 09:16.020
What'd you get me?

09:16.020 --> 09:16.660
What'd you get me?

09:16.660 --> 09:18.020
And I was on the spot.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.460
Yeah, it is uncomfortable when you have to open

09:19.460 --> 09:20.980
your gifts in front of your family.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.620
And I'm sorry, a strip tease just isn't a very good present,

09:23.620 --> 09:26.420
because you can internet that, you know what I'm saying?

09:26.420 --> 09:28.980
And then it's over in how long is Santa baby?

09:28.980 --> 09:29.940
Three minutes?

09:29.940 --> 09:30.660
Over in three minutes.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.340
And then it's like, oh, your present's gone.

09:32.340 --> 09:34.260
Vanished into thin air, into the ether.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.740
Unless it's like the ability to call for a strip tease

09:36.740 --> 09:37.460
at any moment.

09:37.460 --> 09:39.540
A book of 100 strip tease coupons.

09:40.420 --> 09:44.180
Good for one wholly inappropriate thing.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.300
You can use it in July.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.700
That's a gift that keeps on giving.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.660
Hey, Christmas tradition for us to adjudicate on.

09:50.660 --> 09:54.340
My two sisters and I have one incredibly important tradition,

09:54.340 --> 09:56.580
disaster-themed gingerbread houses.

09:56.580 --> 09:59.700
We've done tornadoes, gingerbread house foreclosures,

09:59.700 --> 10:02.260
Godzilla rampaging through gingerbread Tokyo,

10:02.260 --> 10:05.540
and last year is a combo, oil spill and WikiLeaks.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.300
That's from Ellen.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.740
I don't know what a WikiLeaks looks

10:08.740 --> 10:10.020
like in a gingerbread house.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.460
I don't know what WikiLeaks is.

10:12.100 --> 10:12.740
Oh, good.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.980
Is that when Wikipedia stopped working for a week?

10:14.980 --> 10:17.860
It's when Wikipedia got of an aerial disease.

10:17.860 --> 10:19.140
Oh, gross.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.020
Yeah.

10:20.020 --> 10:20.740
Christmas.

10:20.740 --> 10:21.240
Christmas.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.340
There's the problem with this year,

10:26.340 --> 10:30.420
is that there were a lot of truly really rough disasters.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.660
I mean, you could go tsunami, not funny.

10:32.660 --> 10:34.020
Not funny at all, actually.

10:34.020 --> 10:34.980
That's pretty horrible.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.780
You could make a tsunami gingerbread house,

10:37.780 --> 10:39.380
but then you would lose your job at Geico.

10:41.060 --> 10:42.980
Could you do an Occupy Wall Street gingerbread house?

10:42.980 --> 10:44.100
It's an Aflac, wasn't it?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.140
When Geico's Aflac.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.180
Here, we'll try it again.

10:46.180 --> 10:46.580
And I'll just say.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.820
You could lose your job at Aflac as a duck voice.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.260
Quack, quack.

10:50.260 --> 10:50.740
Can you do it?

10:51.780 --> 10:53.540
That's what I do instead of laughing now.

10:53.540 --> 10:53.860
Thanks.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.020
Can you do Occupy Wall Street gingerbread house?

10:56.020 --> 10:57.540
I think you have to do Occupy Wall Street.

10:57.540 --> 10:58.180
Gotta do Occupy Wall Street.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.180
Just a bunch of gingerbread tents and hippies.

11:00.740 --> 11:00.980
Yeah.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.940
Do that, and Twilight.

11:03.940 --> 11:06.340
You spray it with some sort of orange glaze.

11:06.340 --> 11:07.620
Orange demigloss.

11:07.620 --> 11:10.740
What if you combine Twilight and Occupy Wall Street,

11:10.740 --> 11:13.380
and everything was going well, the Occupy Wall Street movie,

11:13.380 --> 11:16.580
and then the vampire set in.

11:16.580 --> 11:19.140
What if the vampire, oh my god.

11:19.140 --> 11:21.620
What if Occupy Wall Street people are vampires?

11:22.260 --> 11:22.820
Think about it.

11:23.620 --> 11:24.100
So wait.

11:24.980 --> 11:26.020
Here's what I'm saying.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.340
What better place to hide in plain sight?

11:29.060 --> 11:32.900
We already know that 99% of people you know in your day to day life are vampires.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.940
The other 1% are robots.

11:33.940 --> 11:34.900
Yeah, the 1% are robots.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.980
50% of those vampires and robots are wizards.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.980
And another 33% are robot wizard vampires.

11:40.980 --> 11:41.540
Okay.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.940
That's a horrifying Venn diagram you've just created.

11:43.940 --> 11:50.980
Yeah, and 0.001% the mythological Jewish Golem.

11:51.940 --> 11:55.780
So just to keep it holiday themed.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.380
The Golem comes in Holonka, right?

11:58.180 --> 11:58.980
I'm not for that.

11:58.980 --> 12:01.460
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:01.460 --> 12:05.540
I would suggest, I think that this is a good Christmas tradition.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.780
There's a lot of creativity, which I like.

12:07.780 --> 12:11.540
There's working together, creating something edible, which is always good.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.100
Next year, you're going to be able to turn it out.

12:14.100 --> 12:14.900
Oh my God.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.820
Just pictures of Quetzalcoatl and Ragnarok battling for supremacy.

12:19.380 --> 12:20.180
So it's going to happen.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.740
A bunch of ancient gods are going to come.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.340
Yeah, they're going to walk the earth.

12:24.340 --> 12:29.620
It's going to be Quetzalcoatl, Ragnarok, and Kevin Sorbo battling for supremacy.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.620
Both of his fists are chupacabras.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.620
John Cusack caught in the middle of it all.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.140
John Cusack, run with your family.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.540
You're not saying John Cusack's a god, right?

12:39.540 --> 12:42.500
No, I'm saying he is our window into the situation.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.780
We can see it through John Cusack's eyes, and that's how we know how it affects us.

12:45.780 --> 12:48.580
John Cusack is the universal humanities representative.

12:48.580 --> 12:49.080
He is.

12:49.860 --> 12:50.580
But not a god.

12:52.260 --> 12:53.940
You've never seen him play putt-putt golf, obviously.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.340
Not a traditional god, but he's a god among men.

12:56.980 --> 12:57.300
Sure.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.500
You guys want a yahoo, or do you want to keep talking about Cusack?

13:00.500 --> 13:01.300
No, no, no.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.220
I'm going to keep thinking about Cusack.

13:03.220 --> 13:04.020
When are you not?

13:04.020 --> 13:04.520
Yep.

13:05.140 --> 13:06.340
Oh, this is fun.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.860
Crystal Whalen sent this one in, too.

13:07.860 --> 13:08.740
Thank you, Crystal Whalen.

13:08.740 --> 13:13.300
It's by a yahoo answers user, Supafreak, who asks, I think I know who tried to kill me.

13:15.220 --> 13:16.900
Okay, sorry for the fake title.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.380
Just wanted to make it more interesting and something to get your attention.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.180
Don't report it.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.180
Anyways, have a merry Christmas, everybody.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.780
And yeah, that's all I wanted to say.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.460
Wow.

13:25.460 --> 13:25.960
That's...

13:26.820 --> 13:27.780
Isn't that sweet?

13:27.780 --> 13:28.280
Wow.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.620
That's not a question, really.

13:33.620 --> 13:33.940
It's not.

13:33.940 --> 13:37.460
I just wanted to pass along yahoo's Christmas wishes to everybody.

13:37.460 --> 13:40.020
That's what passes for holiday greetings over there.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.900
Okay, wait.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.420
So this is my issue with this.

13:42.420 --> 13:50.740
This girl, this person, wanted to wish everyone happy holidays, merry Christmas,

13:50.740 --> 13:54.580
and she thought the best way to get everyone's attention to do that

13:54.580 --> 13:57.060
is to let them know that there had been an attempt on her life,

13:57.060 --> 13:58.660
and she thinks she knows who did it.

13:58.660 --> 14:00.900
Do you know how many people have wished me happy holidays this year?

14:00.900 --> 14:01.380
How many?

14:01.380 --> 14:02.340
I can't even count.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.700
A billion, though, if I were to guess roughly one-sixth of the world's population.

14:05.700 --> 14:06.500
Right.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.420
So it doesn't matter anymore.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.620
But if someone ran up to me and bit me on the face and said,

14:11.620 --> 14:12.740
I'm a dog person.

14:12.740 --> 14:13.220
I'm a dog.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.340
I'm half dog, half man.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.100
I said, what are you talking about?

14:16.100 --> 14:17.140
And they said, just kidding.

14:17.140 --> 14:18.260
Happy holidays.

14:18.260 --> 14:19.540
Also enjoy the rabies.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.980
That one's gonna mean something to me.

14:20.980 --> 14:21.780
You're gonna remember that.

14:21.780 --> 14:22.820
I'm gonna remember that.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.380
Well, yes.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.380
Let's have another yahoo.

14:27.380 --> 14:27.860
What do you think?

14:27.860 --> 14:29.060
One that actually makes sense.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.140
This one was sent in by HorseLoverFat.

14:31.140 --> 14:32.420
Thanks, HorseLoverFat.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.780
It's by yahooanswersuser.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.300
Touch my pigtails and die.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.020
Who asked?

14:36.020 --> 14:36.740
Oh, no.

14:36.740 --> 14:41.060
If you were a legitimate vampire, as 99% of the world is,

14:41.780 --> 14:45.460
who would you surprise with the gift of eternal life this Christmas?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.540
For me, it would be Bob from Accounting.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.780
He has nice hair, and it deserves to look that way forever.

14:50.580 --> 14:51.540
Wow.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.060
A legitimate vampire.

14:54.900 --> 14:59.140
Not one of these fakie, not one of these fly-by-night Johnny-come-lately vampires.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.860
Not one of these kids that go to the mall on a hot topic,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.700
and they buy the fangs, and they put them on their teeth,

15:03.700 --> 15:04.900
and they bite each other.

15:04.900 --> 15:05.140
Yeah.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.140
And then they get sick from the bites.

15:07.140 --> 15:12.020
From the bites and the Chinese-made fake fangs.

15:12.020 --> 15:14.500
They're made of lead, and you get sick from putting them in your mouth,

15:14.500 --> 15:16.180
and then from putting them in the neck.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.860
I don't know if I can say this or not,

15:17.860 --> 15:20.420
but I think I would give that eternal life to the Pope.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.100
Make him forever Pope.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.140
Oh, no.

15:23.140 --> 15:23.460
Really?

15:23.460 --> 15:32.660
You're enjoying John Ratzenberg that much that you're going to keep him as eternal Pope?

15:32.660 --> 15:34.740
I just kind of like the idea of forever Pope.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.820
I feel like he could really get a lot done.

15:36.820 --> 15:37.700
That's impossible.

15:38.260 --> 15:39.220
Think about it.

15:39.220 --> 15:40.260
If he, if he-

15:40.900 --> 15:42.260
None of us are Catholic, by the way.

15:42.260 --> 15:42.660
Go on.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.420
If you're a vampire, you can't-

15:47.460 --> 15:48.420
How is your day going to be?

15:48.420 --> 15:50.180
He wears a cross on his hat.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.380
It's going to be unpleasant.

15:51.940 --> 15:53.300
It's going to be unpleasant.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.420
It's a labor of love.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.300
I'm going to live forever, and I'm going to have migraines the whole time.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.580
Because there's a cross on my hat.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.940
Like, what are you talking about?

15:59.940 --> 16:00.900
The Pope is the worst.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.860
I don't know anybody-

16:01.860 --> 16:03.540
His whole style is going to have to change.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.140
I mean, that's obvious.

16:05.140 --> 16:08.100
I don't know anybody with more day-to-day cross exposure than the Pope.

16:08.820 --> 16:10.740
Okay, then I'm going to switch to David Boreanaz.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.700
Well, that's a little on the nose.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.300
Yeah, he's the Pope of my heart.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.260
I know he can do it.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.540
I've seen him succeed as a vampire previously.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.860
You are the only one I know that can handle this power.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.020
Enjoy doing bones forever.

16:26.020 --> 16:28.100
I can't trust James Smoshner with it.

16:28.100 --> 16:34.740
He'll probably just go to a comic book convention and try to make $75 buying meat.

16:34.740 --> 16:35.780
I'm going to say Ellen.

16:38.020 --> 16:38.660
Why Ellen?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.220
Here's my reasoning.

16:41.220 --> 16:45.380
Can you imagine a world after Ellen, post Ellen, P.E.?

16:46.820 --> 16:48.420
Can you imagine the year one P.E.?

16:50.500 --> 16:52.500
I cannot, and I don't think the world could either.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.380
I don't want to imagine.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.660
I just want to see her dance, and she'll dance the whole show and never get tired,

16:56.660 --> 16:59.860
because she's a vampire, and then she'll get angry at her guests who get tired.

16:59.860 --> 17:02.340
Because when you're a vampire, you can pretty much dance forever.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.740
Can I do Robert Pattinson just as like payback?

17:06.740 --> 17:07.460
Surprise.

17:07.460 --> 17:07.860
Surprise.

17:07.860 --> 17:08.740
Now you live forever.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.900
Oh, what if you gave him eternal life and then immediately staked him to the heart?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.100
Just like right away.

17:14.100 --> 17:14.820
One, two, punch.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.900
Well, that would just be murder.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.500
Or could you get around the murder charge?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.980
You'd be like, hey man, he was a vamp.

17:20.980 --> 17:24.340
Yeah, you cannot be tried for killing a vamp.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.060
Okay.

17:25.060 --> 17:25.700
That's true.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.900
Or a tramp.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.220
Can you get one from a rail car?

17:29.220 --> 17:30.020
Or a scamp.

17:30.020 --> 17:30.740
Or a scamp.

17:30.740 --> 17:31.300
Get out of here.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.220
Oh, now I've got it.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.540
I'm going to turn all of the rail riders, all of the lovable hobos into vampires.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.340
Oh my God.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.260
Hey, ABC, I will sell you the series that I just created.

17:43.460 --> 17:44.740
Boxcar Vampires.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.300
Beautiful boxcar vampires that ride the rails in 40K.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.580
Boxcar Trampires.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.980
Boxcar Trampires.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.660
Boxcar Trampires.

17:52.660 --> 17:56.260
What they'll do is they'll go around and have premarital sex.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.380
And then some of them go to college.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.900
And some of them learn a little bit about love, but a lot about themselves.

18:04.900 --> 18:05.300
Yeah.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.460
And one of them is Neve Campbell.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.420
More like matronly, I think.

18:10.420 --> 18:14.020
I would have gone with Misha Barton because she looks vampiric in the face region.

18:14.020 --> 18:14.740
She does, right?

18:14.740 --> 18:15.860
She looks hollow.

18:15.860 --> 18:19.060
Her and Tilda Swinton, I think, would be good.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.420
Tilda Swinton could be her mom.

18:20.420 --> 18:21.700
Can we sign Tilda on that?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.460
I'm not ready for TV.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.620
You get to play a boxcar vampire.

18:25.620 --> 18:26.580
Where do I sign?

18:27.300 --> 18:30.660
How many times do I have to sign to be a boxcar vampire?

18:30.660 --> 18:32.260
That is an undeniable role.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.500
I want you to know that sounds like Russell Brand doing an impression of Tilda Swinton.

18:37.460 --> 18:38.980
How about Russell Brand the vampire?

18:38.980 --> 18:39.620
What's he doing?

18:40.660 --> 18:42.500
He already looks like he lives in a boxcar.

18:42.500 --> 18:47.140
Whatever the opposite of eternal life is, I would like to give to Russell Brand, I think.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.380
I would like to give him like 30 second life remaining.

18:51.380 --> 18:51.940
Have life.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.100
Just to see what he does.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.980
Only now do I know what it means to truly live.

18:56.980 --> 18:57.620
And then he's dead.

19:00.340 --> 19:00.980
Let's move on.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.180
Let's keep the flow going.

19:02.180 --> 19:02.820
Yeah, sounds good.

19:02.820 --> 19:03.460
Maintain the flow.

19:03.460 --> 19:07.700
My mom tells me the story of how, once as a child, I noticed that the presents were

19:07.700 --> 19:09.940
wrapped in the same wrapping paper as previous year.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.620
And shortly thereafter, the whole parents bring the presents deal had to be revealed.

19:13.620 --> 19:19.220
At what age and how did you all discover this parental Christmas conspiracy?

19:19.220 --> 19:22.340
Brian in Barranquilla.

19:22.340 --> 19:23.060
It's Columbia.

19:23.860 --> 19:24.340
First of all...

19:27.540 --> 19:28.020
Wait, what?

19:29.380 --> 19:30.740
Wait, I'm going to read this again.

19:30.740 --> 19:31.300
Okay.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.460
My mom sometimes tells me the story of how, once as a child, I noticed the presents were

19:35.460 --> 19:37.780
wrapped in the same wrapping paper as previous year.

19:37.780 --> 19:45.300
And shortly thereafter, the whole parents bring the presents deal had to be revealed.

19:46.660 --> 19:46.900
Like...

19:47.620 --> 19:48.420
Wait a minute.

19:48.420 --> 19:49.540
The parent...

19:49.540 --> 19:49.780
What?

19:51.220 --> 19:53.940
The parents bring the presents to Santa Claus and Santa Claus delivers them?

19:53.940 --> 19:55.300
That seems like an awfully secretive...

19:55.300 --> 20:00.100
No, I think Santa Claus brings the presents to the parents and the parents distribute

20:00.100 --> 20:00.900
them appropriately.

20:00.900 --> 20:01.620
I don't think Santa...

20:01.620 --> 20:06.500
I don't think Ho-Ho, Sinterklus, would operate with a middleman like that.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.380
I think he would.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.780
Why are his prices are so high?

20:09.780 --> 20:11.300
What if he cut out the middleman?

20:11.300 --> 20:11.780
Yeah.

20:11.780 --> 20:15.300
There's a lot of overhead in the holiday delivery operation.

20:15.300 --> 20:21.380
To my knowledge, if there is this conspiracy of parents bringing the gifts from Santa Claus

20:21.380 --> 20:24.100
to Underneath the Tree, I have not been made aware of it.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.860
You know what else is a conspiracy?

20:25.860 --> 20:28.340
That 9-11 was caused by aliens.

20:28.340 --> 20:30.020
It was the Illuminati's work.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.900
And that's total fakie Hollywood BS.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.420
Santa Claus is Illuminati?

20:35.220 --> 20:36.420
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.780
I jumped in in the end there.

20:37.780 --> 20:41.540
No, Santa Claus is Paul Giamatti in the film Fred Kloss.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.900
I can understand how you'd be confused.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.540
I'm not sure I understand what...

20:48.100 --> 20:51.380
I think this is one of those tinfoil hat nut jobs.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.500
Yeah, yeah.

20:53.380 --> 20:54.420
Loose change, right?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.060
Loose slay.

20:55.060 --> 20:55.620
I get it.

20:55.620 --> 20:59.780
I just want to throw out that going with the concept that parents bring the presents or

20:59.780 --> 21:01.940
whatever, if your parents...

21:02.660 --> 21:06.500
If you called them on that the wrapping paper was the same as last year and your parents

21:06.500 --> 21:10.260
couldn't talk their way out of that, man, they're not good at lying or they just gave

21:10.260 --> 21:11.540
up or you were like 14.

21:11.540 --> 21:14.580
Yeah, that's not a good way to get out of that situation.

21:14.580 --> 21:17.140
Oh yeah, the wrapping paper's the same.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.580
Yeah, it was us, whatever.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.180
Why would Santa need to bind your...

21:20.180 --> 21:26.100
Okay, this is what I feel personally in my heart and you people at home may have a different

21:26.100 --> 21:30.820
opinion on this, but I feel like Santa Claus doesn't wrap anything.

21:30.820 --> 21:31.380
Yeah.

21:31.380 --> 21:32.660
No, he's all foam.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.340
Santa Claus brings the...

21:34.340 --> 21:35.860
Is he just the delivery man?

21:35.860 --> 21:36.980
Is that his only duty?

21:36.980 --> 21:40.100
All he does is brings them, eats some cookies and jams out.

21:40.100 --> 21:45.300
Santa Claus is like Amazon, the parents put in the call for presents, he brings them.

21:45.860 --> 21:47.300
I'm not comfortable with that either.

21:47.300 --> 21:47.860
No, I don't like that either.

21:47.860 --> 21:51.940
I like that there's a man somewhere in the world who I've never met nor will I ever see

21:51.940 --> 21:56.100
who knows the darkest recesses of my heart, knows what material objects I want.

21:56.100 --> 21:59.860
That's the scariest thing to me because he knows that when I watch TV and the forever

21:59.860 --> 22:02.900
lazy comes on, there's something that clicks in my head and goes, well, it looks like Travis

22:02.900 --> 22:06.340
is going to go forever lazy this year and I don't want anyone to know that I want the

22:06.340 --> 22:07.540
forever lazy, right?

22:07.540 --> 22:11.460
Here's the other thing is that Santa Claus was the only person that knew that this year

22:11.460 --> 22:14.740
for Christmas, I wanted Drive Angry shot in 3D on Blu-ray.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.860
Did he get it for you, Griffin?

22:17.860 --> 22:19.460
Santa Claus did get that for me.

22:20.260 --> 22:21.060
But he told...

22:21.620 --> 22:23.540
He used Travis as his envoy.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.500
It came to me in a dream.

22:26.500 --> 22:31.220
Santa Claus appeared and said, hello, Griffin needs Drive Angry.

22:31.220 --> 22:35.220
Travis was, for a moment, made Santa flesh on Earth.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.420
That's what you're saying.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.780
Santa made corporeal.

22:40.180 --> 22:41.700
What's your best Christmas present ever?

22:41.700 --> 22:46.820
We asked you guys to tell us and our friend Cole said, I've gotten tons of video games

22:46.820 --> 22:49.780
and stuff for Christmas, but nothing beats my blanket.

22:52.740 --> 22:54.020
By the way, I'm doing that to people now.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.020
I'm putting in weird inflections.

22:56.020 --> 22:58.420
I'm a tall-ish dude and no blankets were long enough.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.060
So my mom made me a very long fleece blanket by hand.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.900
I'm still using it seven years later.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.620
You said that so precociously.

23:05.620 --> 23:06.900
That's my blanket.

23:06.900 --> 23:07.860
Take that, world.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.460
Nothing beats my blanket.

23:09.460 --> 23:10.820
Don't touch my blanket.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.260
I mean, blankets are great.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.540
I'm surprised that yours...

23:13.540 --> 23:14.820
I'm a rough sleeper.

23:14.820 --> 23:18.900
I sleep rough on my blankets, so they don't last longer than two or three years.

23:19.700 --> 23:25.380
I got me a Scotty blanket, a Scottish Terrier themed blanket about a decade ago.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.940
Went to college with me, moved back to West Virginia, then to Cincinnati.

23:29.940 --> 23:30.660
Still have it.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.300
Use it every day.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.060
It's made out of real Scotty skin.

23:33.060 --> 23:35.700
Yeah, and that's how you know it's good quality.

23:37.460 --> 23:42.580
I think every time you get a present, you should look at it and give it a shake and say,

23:42.580 --> 23:45.140
I don't know, it's no blanket, and throw it aside.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.500
I'm too tall for this book.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.300
Make a taller book for me.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.180
My mommy made a bigger book.

23:54.340 --> 23:55.860
I'm still using that book.

23:55.860 --> 23:56.360
I'm still...

23:58.260 --> 24:00.660
That's my tall book I've used for seven years.

24:00.660 --> 24:03.140
This is an extra long slanket.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.380
Now, what's a...

24:05.380 --> 24:05.780
Hold on.

24:05.780 --> 24:06.900
I need to take a timeout.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.260
What's a forever lazy?

24:09.140 --> 24:13.460
Forever lazy is like the next form of snuggie, but it's like a full...

24:13.460 --> 24:14.580
Like it wraps around your leg.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.940
It's like a onesie with a hood that's a blanket and zips down.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.220
It's got compartments.

24:19.220 --> 24:24.100
So if you're a dude, you get the zipper to use for the bathroom and it's got back zippers

24:24.100 --> 24:26.340
so you can keep it on while you use the restroom.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.020
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.820
It's more or less like somebody looked at the sweatsuit and said,

24:30.820 --> 24:32.020
this could be lazier.

24:32.020 --> 24:37.700
And you said that you, in secret heart of yours, that you want one of these.

24:37.700 --> 24:41.780
You want an article of clothing that, let me get this straight, you can poop through.

24:42.660 --> 24:45.060
You want an article of clothing that you can make bathrooms.

24:45.060 --> 24:49.620
The only reason I want it is because in the commercial, it seems to indicate that you

24:49.620 --> 24:55.700
could wear this to a tailgate party at a football stadium and no one would say anything to you

24:55.700 --> 24:56.420
about it.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.660
Everyone would be like, hey, sweep forever, Lacey Steve.

24:59.620 --> 25:04.100
That's funny, Travis, because it sounds like this article of clothing has a tailgate.

25:04.100 --> 25:04.820
It does.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.900
It has a little portal.

25:07.860 --> 25:11.460
I have to take exception with the whole premise of your question.

25:11.460 --> 25:17.860
As everyone knows, the next evolution of the Snuggie is a closed garage door three hours

25:17.860 --> 25:19.860
and a car engine running.

25:19.860 --> 25:20.980
And the courage to do what's right.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.500
And the courage to do what's right, exactly.

25:22.500 --> 25:28.340
You know, I wish they made a Snuggie that was like separate for your legs and your chest.

25:28.340 --> 25:32.420
And instead of being made out of like a sweatsuit, it was like nice formal wear.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.060
You mean like a tuxy?

25:35.060 --> 25:37.620
Like, yeah, or just a nice shirt.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.220
A tuxy.

25:39.220 --> 25:42.100
A nice blouse and a casual skirt.

25:42.100 --> 25:45.060
So you're saying like clothes, like you wish they made clothes.

25:45.060 --> 25:46.980
A class Snuggie.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.340
I guess that's what I'm saying.

25:48.340 --> 25:52.260
Okay, I don't know what situation you would be.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.020
Is that business casual, did you say?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.300
Casual, casual?

25:55.300 --> 25:56.100
Formal casual?

25:56.980 --> 25:58.180
I forgot one thing.

25:58.180 --> 26:03.540
The slacks also have a tiny zipper in the back that you can unzip and just go wild in

26:03.540 --> 26:04.020
the bathroom.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.060
Just go crazy in there.

26:05.780 --> 26:06.340
Don't even...

26:06.340 --> 26:07.140
Somebody walks...

26:07.140 --> 26:11.220
My biggest fear in this life is that I'm going to be at a gas station in Louisiana somewhere

26:11.220 --> 26:17.540
using like a gas station bathroom and someone walks in on me and sees my treasure.

26:17.540 --> 26:22.020
So now he walks in and just sees you in a tuxedo and he's going, oh don't mind me.

26:22.020 --> 26:25.780
I mean, I wouldn't wear a suit jacket to the bathroom, Travis, but I'd be wearing formal

26:25.780 --> 26:29.220
slacks and they couldn't see anything.

26:29.220 --> 26:31.940
That actually, I'm going to get this real for Candle Nights.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.660
When I was a kid, I was eight years old.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.980
I know this story.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.020
We were traveling.

26:38.020 --> 26:39.620
It's not funny, it's horrifying.

26:39.620 --> 26:42.580
It is not funny, but you can get, come on, get up in here.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.660
There was this, I was at Cracker Barrel.

26:44.660 --> 26:48.340
We were on a road trip, it was a Cracker Barrel and I was at the bathroom reading a newspaper

26:48.340 --> 26:55.780
and I was making Tuesday and a guy comes up to the crack in the door and he's wearing

26:55.780 --> 27:02.100
a tank top and he looks like some sort of vagrant, but he starts looking in and then

27:02.100 --> 27:07.780
he pulls inside his tank top to show me his nipples pierced and goes, and then it runs

27:07.780 --> 27:08.100
out.

27:08.100 --> 27:12.500
And I said, okay, like out loud, like really loud to try to scare away or something.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.660
And that happened to me.

27:14.660 --> 27:15.380
So, I guess.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.900
Merry Christmas!

27:16.900 --> 27:19.300
I guess what I'm saying is Merry Christmas.

27:20.580 --> 27:23.940
Cracker Barrel, where pedophiles eat, where pedophiles cook.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.700
Your down home pedophile kitchen.

27:25.700 --> 27:29.380
Come on, eat, look at some kids on the John and play some checkers.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.180
Everything's okay.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.020
You all right, Justin?

27:32.020 --> 27:34.660
Yeah, I just went to, took me to sort of a weird place.

27:34.660 --> 27:35.140
Yeah.

27:35.140 --> 27:36.100
Maybe a Yahoo?

27:36.100 --> 27:36.980
Maybe a Yahoo.

27:37.620 --> 27:38.420
Oh, God.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.220
That'll bring it out.

27:39.940 --> 27:40.820
It already is out.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.660
I need something to stuff it back down.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.020
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

27:44.020 --> 27:44.500
Thank you, Krista.

27:44.500 --> 27:44.980
It's by Yahoo.

27:44.980 --> 27:45.380
God!

27:45.380 --> 27:46.820
I know, she sent in like 30.

27:46.820 --> 27:51.620
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mycroft, who asks, what are some awkward places to hang mistletoe?

27:51.620 --> 27:52.340
Belt buckle.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.060
Gallows.

27:53.060 --> 27:56.420
Funny, awkward, uncomfortable, or bizarre places to hang mistletoe?

27:56.420 --> 27:56.900
Shanks.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.100
On the top of the coffin.

28:00.820 --> 28:01.780
Oh, man.

28:01.780 --> 28:02.420
What?

28:02.420 --> 28:03.380
It's Christmas.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.180
Yeah.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.140
Oh, gosh.

28:05.140 --> 28:06.180
The top of the speculum?

28:07.220 --> 28:08.100
I don't know what that means.

28:08.100 --> 28:08.340
Okay.

28:08.340 --> 28:10.580
What is that, like a tongue?

28:10.580 --> 28:13.460
What's a funny, awkward place to hang, you know what I really like?

28:14.420 --> 28:15.780
On your belt buckle.

28:15.780 --> 28:16.340
That's good, though.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.020
That's hysterical.

28:18.020 --> 28:18.980
No, I already said that one.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.380
We know, we're commenting on the comedy of it.

28:21.380 --> 28:22.980
Belt buckle was good.

28:22.980 --> 28:23.220
Yeah.

28:23.220 --> 28:27.460
What about on the back, what about on the back belt loop of your pants so it looks like you're

28:27.460 --> 28:28.740
saying, kiss my fanny?

28:30.420 --> 28:32.980
That's what we're used to for candle lights, you have to say fanny?

28:33.540 --> 28:36.660
Now, just so you know, Griffin, in many countries that aren't America,

28:36.660 --> 28:38.980
fanny means something completely different.

28:38.980 --> 28:39.700
Is that true?

28:39.700 --> 28:40.180
Yeah.

28:40.180 --> 28:40.820
I didn't know that.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.540
What does it mean?

28:41.540 --> 28:42.740
That's darty.

28:42.740 --> 28:43.860
I don't want to know about it because it's candle lights.

28:43.860 --> 28:44.500
No, you don't.

28:44.500 --> 28:44.820
All right.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.140
What about anywhere?

28:47.140 --> 28:48.260
Anywhere in the world?

28:48.260 --> 28:51.060
Anywhere that you hang mistletoe is always awkward and terrible.

28:51.060 --> 28:57.540
Guys, have you ever been, we've all been on this planet for between like 28 and 31 years,

28:57.540 --> 28:59.300
or no, like 25 years, right?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.100
24.

29:00.100 --> 29:00.900
But that's okay.

29:00.900 --> 29:01.140
Yeah.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.820
It's Christmas, you don't know my age.

29:02.820 --> 29:03.460
That's all I want.

29:03.460 --> 29:06.180
I asked you for Christmas for a card.

29:06.180 --> 29:08.180
A birth certificate.

29:08.180 --> 29:08.740
Proof.

29:08.740 --> 29:09.460
Some kind of proof.

29:09.460 --> 29:12.180
I wanted you and Obama to give me a birth certificate for Christmas.

29:14.180 --> 29:17.540
Like, have you guys ever been to a Christmas party or gathering or somebody's house where

29:17.540 --> 29:20.740
there was actually mistletoe on display?

29:21.460 --> 29:22.900
Yes, but not until recently.

29:22.900 --> 29:27.140
I went to a party and I walked into the kitchen.

29:27.140 --> 29:27.620
Hold on, wait.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.140
This story sounds like it's going to be long.

29:29.140 --> 29:30.260
Will it also be funny?

29:30.260 --> 29:30.900
Yes.

29:30.900 --> 29:31.860
It's very short.

29:31.860 --> 29:34.020
Is it linked to human history?

29:34.020 --> 29:35.780
Let me assuage your fears.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.300
It's very short, but not funny.

29:39.300 --> 29:40.980
Okay, break on through then.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.420
I walked into the kitchen and looked up and there was a mistletoe hanging in the middle

29:46.420 --> 29:51.700
of the room and around the perimeter of the room were eight guys looking really uncomfortable

29:51.700 --> 29:53.300
waiting for a girl to walk into the room.

29:57.940 --> 29:58.580
What are you doing?

29:58.580 --> 29:59.060
Look up.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.060
You got me.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.660
Get some chapstick.

30:02.660 --> 30:04.900
Get your birch bees, it's smooching time.

30:04.900 --> 30:11.620
I can't, maybe this was a fever dream, but I feel like I went to a boy-girl party in

30:11.620 --> 30:17.220
middle school where mistletoe was hung aloft from the rafters like something that you hang

30:17.220 --> 30:17.940
from rafters.

30:18.740 --> 30:21.780
I think it's the most awkward thing in the world and I wish we would stop doing it.

30:21.780 --> 30:22.900
I've never been smooched.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.220
No, thanks to mistletoe.

30:25.220 --> 30:25.460
Okay.

30:26.260 --> 30:29.220
Yeah, I don't think that that's a real thing people are doing.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.620
Are there any good answers on that one?

30:31.620 --> 30:37.620
The fifth street overpass, the end of my dog's tail, and that's awful.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.540
And last but certainly not least, all on your mom.

30:40.740 --> 30:41.940
Okay, it was funny for a minute.

30:42.660 --> 30:45.380
I don't actually, above the toilet.

30:46.580 --> 30:47.700
I like that actually.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.500
Kiss the toilet.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.340
Kiss that toilet before you use it.

30:50.340 --> 30:51.220
In the oven.

30:51.220 --> 30:55.780
Well, I guess, isn't that how Virginia Woolf died?

30:56.900 --> 30:57.300
What?

30:57.300 --> 30:58.340
Looking for mistletoe in the oven?

30:58.340 --> 30:59.620
Yes, Virginia Woolf.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.220
There is mistletoe in the oven.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.100
Just keep looking.

31:02.100 --> 31:02.660
Keep looking.

31:03.860 --> 31:04.260
Darn it.

31:04.980 --> 31:05.620
We lost her.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.140
On the cat's litter box.

31:07.140 --> 31:10.740
What's up with people wanting to kiss cat butts and food?

31:10.740 --> 31:15.300
Hey, everybody in mistletoe, you know that you don't just have to kiss whatever inanimate

31:15.300 --> 31:16.180
object home.

31:16.180 --> 31:18.740
It's not like a binding contract.

31:18.740 --> 31:20.420
On your dad's wardrobe.

31:20.420 --> 31:21.380
The litter box.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.420
On a table lamp.

31:22.420 --> 31:23.140
Light switch.

31:23.780 --> 31:24.740
Come here, light switch.

31:26.100 --> 31:30.020
Well, I guess that there's mistletoe there so I have no choice, I suppose.

31:30.020 --> 31:35.220
These, every time that I've ever been confronted with mistletoe and someone's like, hey, mistletoe,

31:35.220 --> 31:38.020
I always just go, no, and walk away.

31:38.820 --> 31:39.700
There's no penalty.

31:40.580 --> 31:44.180
Cassandra says, put it in the guy's locker room, smiley face.

31:44.180 --> 31:47.060
I don't think that's going to play out how you think it's going to play out.

31:47.060 --> 31:47.460
No.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.420
Good game, Brock.

31:48.420 --> 31:49.140
Hey, Brick, come here.

31:50.340 --> 31:52.180
Did you just name them Brick and Brock?

31:56.660 --> 31:57.460
Hello, Brock.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.180
Hello, Brick.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.860
I guess we should have seen this coming.

31:59.860 --> 32:01.380
Christmas law abides us, Brick.

32:01.380 --> 32:02.100
I know, Brock.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.260
Why are we so adherent to it?

32:04.260 --> 32:05.060
Hey, good hockey.

32:05.060 --> 32:05.540
Come here.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.380
That's hockey sweater.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.540
Let me take it off of you while I kiss you under the mistletoe.

32:09.540 --> 32:10.340
Hey, what's going on in here?

32:10.340 --> 32:11.300
Get out of here, Brack.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.260
Get out of here, Brack.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.380
Brick and Brock are kissing.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.220
Come over here, Brick.

32:15.220 --> 32:15.620
You're cool.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.260
Brick, time to kiss party.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.180
It's pronounced Bruce for the last time.

32:20.180 --> 32:20.820
It's Bruce.

32:20.820 --> 32:21.700
Now it's Bruce.

32:21.700 --> 32:30.580
I'm a 24-year-old dude, and I really just enjoy giving presents to my friends.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.580
I don't give expensive or ostentatious gifts.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.780
I generally just enjoy being able to find and give a thoughtful gift.

32:35.780 --> 32:39.620
My problem is, I always wind up feeling slighted or annoyed if my friends can't even bother

32:39.620 --> 32:40.580
to return the favor.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.660
That's how it looks to me when you say, oh, you are.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.940
Am I giving gifts for the wrong reason?

32:47.940 --> 32:50.980
Or should I expect a bit of courtesy from my close friends?

32:50.980 --> 32:52.100
That's from Jarsh.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.940
Hey, Jarsh, you are taking a turn right in the middle of that question.

32:55.940 --> 32:58.100
We were like, I just like giving my friends presents.

32:58.660 --> 32:59.620
Turn.

32:59.620 --> 33:01.940
I'm mad my friends don't give me presents back.

33:01.940 --> 33:02.740
Yeah, I don't know.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.100
I just like giving presents.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.260
And I guess I also like getting them very much.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.540
I wish that second part was happening.

33:11.620 --> 33:12.500
I mean, it does make it.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.340
It has less to do with the fact that you're not getting back possessions that you can

33:16.340 --> 33:18.980
then have and add to your vault.

33:18.980 --> 33:22.580
But it makes it awkward when you get someone a present and they don't get you a present

33:22.580 --> 33:22.740
back.

33:22.740 --> 33:24.260
It makes it awkward for both parties.

33:24.260 --> 33:28.260
I think that you have to, I think we might have talked about this before, but I think

33:28.260 --> 33:33.860
the best thing to do is keep in your car non-perishable, like $10 to $20 presents.

33:34.420 --> 33:39.060
But don't, if you know, you can look around at the people in your life and know like,

33:39.060 --> 33:40.660
they're not going to give me a present.

33:40.660 --> 33:40.900
Yeah.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.660
If you see something for them that you're just like so moved, like, oh man, he loves,

33:46.660 --> 33:50.420
you know, these tiny figurines and you see those tiny figurines and it's like a buck,

33:50.420 --> 33:51.140
grab it for him.

33:51.140 --> 33:52.580
But it's not a contract.

33:52.580 --> 33:55.380
You're not making an unsoaken deal with him like, hey, I got you this.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.380
So where's my thing?

33:58.020 --> 34:04.100
I have a dumpster's worth of Ferrero Rocher cartons in the trunk of my Toyota Matrix that

34:04.100 --> 34:05.620
I just keep like, oh, thanks.

34:05.620 --> 34:06.180
One sec.

34:06.740 --> 34:07.860
I left yours in the car.

34:07.860 --> 34:08.980
I forgot yours in the car.

34:09.860 --> 34:10.580
It's not wrapped.

34:11.140 --> 34:12.980
It's Ferrero Rocher's.

34:12.980 --> 34:13.780
It's half eaten.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.940
I hope you like hazelnut.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.700
It's spelled just like it sounds.

34:19.700 --> 34:22.900
I thought your gift to me was that you're going to stop mispronouncing hazelnut.

34:22.900 --> 34:23.620
It's hazelnut.

34:24.500 --> 34:28.900
Actually, you're the one mispronouncing it if you read the original German translation

34:28.900 --> 34:30.820
of the word hotzelnut.

34:38.980 --> 34:41.540
I actually genuinely like getting people gifts.

34:41.540 --> 34:46.740
If you have a friendship with somebody, then you have to ask yourself, look back at the

34:46.740 --> 34:47.620
past year.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.580
Didn't they do something?

34:48.580 --> 34:52.980
I know that every friend that I have has done something for me or been considerate in some

34:52.980 --> 34:58.260
way for me over the past year that is worth more to me than whatever gift they would otherwise

34:58.260 --> 34:58.500
get.

34:59.460 --> 35:00.660
That's a good way of looking at it.

35:00.660 --> 35:06.100
Phone call when I'm feeling sick or helping me out with a project or whatever it is.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.300
They picked up a movie tab or bought you dinner or something.

35:09.300 --> 35:12.660
If you think back over the past year, I'm sure that person has done something.

35:12.660 --> 35:19.780
If they haven't done something that merits a $10 present, then maybe you need to re-evaluate

35:19.780 --> 35:20.420
your friendship.

35:20.420 --> 35:24.020
I bet if you think about it, there's probably something that's happened that just makes

35:24.020 --> 35:26.420
you want to get them a present because you care about them.

35:26.420 --> 35:31.700
Now, does that mean that you should be hurt if they don't get you something?

35:31.700 --> 35:31.940
No.

35:31.940 --> 35:32.660
Absolutely.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.700
Absolutely, it should.

35:34.340 --> 35:34.980
No, no.

35:34.980 --> 35:36.180
No, it shouldn't.

35:36.180 --> 35:40.100
For all you young guys out there, I'm going to clue you into something that I think is

35:40.100 --> 35:44.180
the best thing for the holiday season for this very reason, and it's Christmas cards.

35:44.180 --> 35:47.220
It's something that says, hey, you're my friend and I was thinking about you on Christmas

35:47.220 --> 35:48.180
and Merry Christmas.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.380
Sorry there's no toys in this.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.260
I forgot to put the check in.

35:52.260 --> 35:53.220
I forgot any toys.

35:54.340 --> 35:59.060
Yeah, I mean, you are giving gifts for the wrong reason.

35:59.060 --> 36:02.500
If you really like giving people gifts, do it for yourself because it makes you feel

36:02.500 --> 36:02.660
good.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.100
But I mean, honestly, at this point in my life, the best gift someone could give me

36:06.100 --> 36:09.300
is to tell me that I don't have to find a place to put a thing.

36:10.180 --> 36:14.420
You don't have to find a place to put this, so Merry Christmas, I guess.

36:14.420 --> 36:24.260
I evaluate my whole year by the number of boxes under my candle light's candle holder.

36:24.260 --> 36:25.620
Right, have you been a very good boy?

36:26.740 --> 36:28.020
There's only one way of finding out.

36:28.020 --> 36:31.540
There's only one way of finding out my year's successes and failures.

36:31.540 --> 36:31.780
Yeah.

36:31.780 --> 36:34.340
Today, this year, I ended up with 22.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.300
22 boxes or 22 successes and failures?

36:37.300 --> 36:40.740
22 boxes, which I guess translates over to 22 successes.

36:41.380 --> 36:45.780
I was shooting for 30, though, so I guess I wasn't as good a boy as I thought I was.

36:46.340 --> 36:46.740
CJ?

36:47.860 --> 36:50.420
My cat's trying to interrupt the show by attacking Griffin.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.100
Hey, here's a Christmas tradition.

36:52.100 --> 36:57.300
Minnie Wombat and I have decided all our Christmases will be spent watching Nicolas Cage movies

36:57.300 --> 36:58.900
and ignoring family phone calls.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.500
Okay, that last one is just mine.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.180
That's from Julie AKA WheezeGirl.

37:03.540 --> 37:04.980
I think that that's fantastic.

37:05.780 --> 37:09.700
I think it becomes unsustainable unless you're going to watch the same ones every year.

37:09.700 --> 37:13.140
I think you could get a day's worth of solid Nicolas Cage entertainment.

37:13.140 --> 37:14.420
And I'm going to take it one step further.

37:14.420 --> 37:18.020
Instead of just ignoring the phone calls, board up the windows,

37:18.580 --> 37:23.460
hunker down, and pretend like you are the last people on earth and you're watching Nicolas Cage.

37:23.460 --> 37:24.580
Post-apocalyptic Cage.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.020
Yeah, turn it around like this.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.460
Post-apocalyptic Christmas.

37:27.460 --> 37:32.420
Now, Travis, when you bought me, when you sent through via Santa Claus's magic network,

37:33.220 --> 37:35.860
Drive Angry Shot in 3D on Blu-ray,

37:35.860 --> 37:39.620
was it because you had read this question and thought maybe this is a tradition I could get into?

37:39.620 --> 37:42.260
That you could hunker down and ignore your family for the rest of our lives?

37:42.260 --> 37:42.740
Yeah.

37:42.740 --> 37:43.460
Yeah, I guess.

37:43.460 --> 37:43.700
Okay.

37:45.060 --> 37:48.900
I'm just looking for some logic in the darkness.

37:48.900 --> 37:53.300
Well, this is a place, a good point in the show to discuss the

37:53.300 --> 37:59.060
a little bit of Christmas knowledge that I've picked up, a little bit of Candle Night's knowledge.

37:59.060 --> 38:04.020
And that is when it comes to the idea of buying someone a quote-unquote funny gift,

38:04.580 --> 38:08.820
it's important to remember that it's real funny for like three minutes.

38:08.820 --> 38:09.060
Yeah.

38:09.060 --> 38:11.460
And then they have it for the rest of their lives.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.940
Now, Drive Angry in 3D is an awesome movie.

38:14.580 --> 38:17.700
It is. It's a real good film.

38:17.700 --> 38:22.100
I thought about it long and hard of if it was a funny present or something, Griffin.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.620
Now, Griffin, I want you to look me square in the eye and tell me you won't watch that movie.

38:25.620 --> 38:28.180
Am I going to get drunk in like two weeks and just pound through it?

38:28.180 --> 38:28.660
Yes.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.340
Yeah, I'm going to tear that movie apart.

38:30.340 --> 38:31.220
Exactly.

38:31.220 --> 38:32.420
Have you seen it once already?

38:32.420 --> 38:32.900
I have, yeah.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.300
I saw it in 3D as God intended.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.780
What worries me is that the box doesn't have the full title.

38:37.780 --> 38:40.100
It just says Drive Angry, not Drive Angry shot in 3D.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.140
So I'm wondering if-

38:41.140 --> 38:42.180
Like it's store brand?

38:42.180 --> 38:47.300
Removed from its 3D environment, from its natural habitat, if the film has changed in some way.

38:47.300 --> 38:52.980
It actually becomes a slow, respectful meditation on the briefness of human existence.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.700
Or brevity, or briefness.

38:56.340 --> 38:57.140
Both work.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.020
Briefness was my favorite 1980s rapper.

39:00.020 --> 39:04.580
I like Kumo D, I like the briefness, and I like Slick Mouth.

39:06.740 --> 39:07.860
Thank you for the gift, Travis.

39:07.860 --> 39:08.340
It was very nice.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.140
You're welcome, Griffin.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.140
Justin, I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.

39:11.700 --> 39:12.420
Maybe next year.

39:13.380 --> 39:15.060
Griffin, you got any more Yahoos?

39:15.060 --> 39:16.180
Are we done yet?

39:16.180 --> 39:18.100
Holiday- I feel like we've only been going like 20 minutes.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.540
Holiday comedy.

39:19.540 --> 39:20.340
40 minutes.

39:20.340 --> 39:21.060
40 minutes.

39:21.060 --> 39:21.780
How do you-

39:21.780 --> 39:22.740
Here, this is good.

39:22.740 --> 39:25.780
Uh, Yahoo Answers, uh, or I'm sorry, Krista Whalen sent this one in too.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.020
Thank you.

39:26.020 --> 39:27.060
Jesus Christ!

39:27.060 --> 39:28.180
It's by Yahoo Answers user-

39:28.180 --> 39:29.140
Happy birthday!

39:29.140 --> 39:31.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monty who asks,

39:32.740 --> 39:34.820
How to react to a bad Christmas present.

39:34.820 --> 39:39.540
My mom asked me if I was going to see Twilight, and I told her, no way, I hate Twilight.

39:39.540 --> 39:45.220
So the other day I ran out of socks and I opened my mom and dad's closet to borrow some of my dad's

39:45.220 --> 39:47.460
socks. Welcome back to that.

39:49.140 --> 39:50.580
And I found the Twilight book.

39:50.580 --> 39:54.580
The other day, I look at the tree and there's a present for me shaped exactly like the book.

39:54.580 --> 39:55.860
How should I react to the present?

39:57.700 --> 40:00.900
Okay, there's a lot of twists and turns in this question.

40:02.820 --> 40:06.500
First, I want to say kudos to your mom.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.180
That when you're like, hey, do you like Twilight?

40:08.180 --> 40:09.060
And you're like, nope.

40:09.060 --> 40:10.420
Absolutely not.

40:10.420 --> 40:12.580
And she's like, oh, got it.

40:12.580 --> 40:13.620
Light bulb.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.140
There's no way your mom, your mom might buy that book for you before that you have that

40:17.140 --> 40:17.540
conversation.

40:17.540 --> 40:22.100
There's no way your mom's like, well, now I'm pot committed, so I guess.

40:22.100 --> 40:24.180
The $12.99 damage is done.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.540
I've got to get this gift for him.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.140
Crabby book it is.

40:31.140 --> 40:32.100
Oh man.

40:32.100 --> 40:35.060
Why are you in your daddy's closet looking for socks?

40:35.060 --> 40:36.420
Were you in his sock closet?

40:38.660 --> 40:40.500
Why does your dad have so many closets?

40:40.500 --> 40:41.540
Two questions.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.860
Why does your daddy have a sock closet?

40:43.860 --> 40:46.980
And B, why are you hunting for dad socks?

40:46.980 --> 40:49.220
They're going to be way too big for your kid feet.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.980
They're going to fall down around your ankles.

40:50.980 --> 40:53.860
You're going to look ridiculous, like some sort of stupid elf.

40:54.580 --> 40:56.820
Hey, here's the correct answer to this question.

40:56.820 --> 40:57.780
This is how you react.

40:57.780 --> 41:02.340
Hey, mom and dad, thank you for giving me life and paying for everything.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.380
And also this book.

41:03.380 --> 41:06.420
I really appreciate everything you do for me, and I'll totally read it.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.260
The end.

41:08.260 --> 41:08.660
Yahoo!

41:08.660 --> 41:12.100
Who is this user random number responded, yell, what the beep?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.780
And go shoot up an airport.

41:13.780 --> 41:15.700
Source, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

41:17.220 --> 41:18.260
I'm not sure I understand.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.220
That's how the Call of Duty game starts.

41:21.220 --> 41:23.860
He gets a Twilight book, and then he just loses it.

41:23.860 --> 41:24.740
Yeah, that's post.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.020
That's a plot of Postal 4.

41:26.740 --> 41:30.820
Dude, just be thankful for what you got, whether you like it or not.

41:30.820 --> 41:31.940
That's how Christmas do.

41:35.780 --> 41:36.980
That's how Christmas do.

41:36.980 --> 41:40.900
You really want your mumsy to be like, why you spoiled ungrateful brat?

41:40.900 --> 41:42.740
You might have more presents than that.

41:42.740 --> 41:48.500
Okay, Christmas is not about presents, even though that's pretty cool.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.260
To include that in the tradition.

41:50.260 --> 41:58.500
I love that Justin didn't preface that by saying there's another Yahoo!

41:58.500 --> 42:02.260
Answers user, so it just sounded like Justin just flowed straight off the dome.

42:02.260 --> 42:06.020
I want to jump back to the middle of that answer, though, where the dude says,

42:06.020 --> 42:08.100
maybe you have more presents than that.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.780
God, I hope so.

42:09.780 --> 42:13.700
I'm getting you one thing, it's the thing you say you don't like.

42:14.340 --> 42:17.380
Hey, Jimmy, how was your Christmas?

42:17.380 --> 42:18.660
It was pretty cool, I guess.

42:18.660 --> 42:19.940
I got a book.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.500
Oh yeah, was it like getting complete encyclopedia?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.020
No, it was Twilight.

42:24.020 --> 42:25.220
I just got a Twilight.

42:25.860 --> 42:27.540
I definitely, definitely do not like it.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.140
I was real sad, told my mom beforehand I didn't like it.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.580
I would have rather just had the $13, but it's cool.

42:34.580 --> 42:39.460
Fonzie112 said, she is your mom, and you have to act like you like it, but don't overact.

42:40.340 --> 42:42.980
Every once in a while, look at it like you're reading it.

42:42.980 --> 42:44.740
I don't like Twilight as well, but give it a chance.

42:44.740 --> 42:46.660
For the rest of his life, or like that day?

42:47.220 --> 42:48.340
I mean, how?

42:49.620 --> 42:52.180
Your mom asked you if you want Twilight, and you said, nope!

42:52.180 --> 42:54.340
And when you open Twilight, you can't be like, yeah!

42:55.700 --> 42:56.340
I got it!

42:56.340 --> 42:59.460
Thank God, because I totally flipped my position on this in the past couple days.

42:59.460 --> 43:02.340
I think you open, you look at it and go, ah, okay.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.740
Yeah, you launch it right at your mom.

43:04.740 --> 43:05.540
Oh, cool, cool!

43:08.580 --> 43:10.580
Just thwug your mom right over the head with it.

43:11.300 --> 43:12.420
She's asking for it.

43:12.420 --> 43:15.780
You can say, this is that Kindle that I asked for, and then you throw it in the fire.

43:17.380 --> 43:18.420
Look, now it's in the cloud!

43:19.780 --> 43:20.660
Let's see here.

43:20.660 --> 43:24.580
Let's see what else I got here in my candlelight sack.

43:24.580 --> 43:25.380
In your candle sack.

43:25.380 --> 43:26.420
In my candle sack.

43:26.420 --> 43:32.340
Uh, my boyfriend and I will not be around family this year for Christmas.

43:32.340 --> 43:34.820
What's a good way to make a memorable Xmas for two?

43:36.100 --> 43:38.580
Stumped Santa in San Diego.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.700
Laser tag battle.

43:41.700 --> 43:42.580
Laser tag.

43:42.580 --> 43:43.220
It's not open.

43:44.020 --> 43:44.900
Buy your own laser tag.

43:44.900 --> 43:45.460
That's what I'm saying.

43:45.460 --> 43:47.860
You set up your own laser tag, you flip over the couches, you barricade.

43:47.860 --> 43:51.540
Lake romantic holiday laser tag!

43:51.540 --> 43:52.500
Strip laser tag!

43:52.500 --> 43:53.620
Strip holiday.

43:53.620 --> 43:56.100
Everybody starts with Santa suits, everybody ends.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.140
With birthday suits.

43:58.260 --> 43:59.300
Jesus birthday suits.

43:59.300 --> 44:02.500
And also the laser tag best, so that you can track your score.

44:04.260 --> 44:06.820
I don't need to track it to remember this score.

44:06.820 --> 44:08.500
This is the sweetest Christmas score.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.260
I mean the doing it.

44:10.260 --> 44:10.660
All right.

44:10.660 --> 44:14.980
One of you just roam through the streets of your neighborhood, looking for people that

44:14.980 --> 44:19.620
have gone to visit family, and you just do some Christmas cat burgling.

44:20.180 --> 44:20.740
Wait a minute.

44:20.740 --> 44:22.820
Wait a second, Travis.

44:22.820 --> 44:25.780
Are you saying you go to the houses of people you know are out of town and you

44:25.780 --> 44:26.500
rob them?

44:26.500 --> 44:26.900
Yeah.

44:26.900 --> 44:29.300
And they say, hey, look what I just got you for Christmas.

44:29.300 --> 44:30.660
This DVD player.

44:30.660 --> 44:32.340
I got you a secret we could never share.

44:32.900 --> 44:35.940
Now we're bound together forever, because if you ever leave me, I'll tell everyone

44:35.940 --> 44:37.220
you're a cat burglar.

44:38.180 --> 44:41.620
How good at burgling do you have to be to be declared a cat burglar?

44:41.620 --> 44:44.340
I don't think you can just declare yourself that right away.

44:44.340 --> 44:46.340
I'm going to go rob that house, because I'm a cat burglar.

44:46.340 --> 44:49.380
I think you have to start off as like a rooster burglar, because they're real loud

44:49.380 --> 44:49.940
and annoying.

44:50.740 --> 44:55.220
If you wear cat ears while you rob a house and then prowl around it on all

44:55.220 --> 44:57.700
fours and you paint little whiskers on your face.

44:57.700 --> 44:59.940
And then if you get caught by the cops, you can just say, I'm a crazy person.

45:01.140 --> 45:02.900
I'm going to use the insanity defense.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.820
If you get that, that's the important thing.

45:04.820 --> 45:09.460
Dress like a cat, because if you a lot of first timers make the mistake of not

45:09.460 --> 45:10.420
dressing like a cat.

45:10.420 --> 45:13.860
If you dress like a cat and you get caught the first time, you can you can use

45:13.860 --> 45:14.340
the insanity defense.

45:14.340 --> 45:17.860
You can fur and rub up against the police officer's leg and say, you can't arrest me.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.300
I'm a poor little cowcoat.

45:19.300 --> 45:26.020
Meow, I'm just a big kitty cat.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.860
Meow, you got any nip?

45:27.860 --> 45:28.660
Meow.

45:28.660 --> 45:30.580
Think of what they'll do to me in prison.

45:31.700 --> 45:32.580
I can't go there.

45:32.580 --> 45:33.860
I'm a big kitty cat.

45:35.380 --> 45:38.420
Meow, where's your Christmas spirit?

45:39.380 --> 45:41.780
And then he'll let you go.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.420
And then it's back to stealing immediately.

45:45.540 --> 45:46.900
Walk back into the house.

45:46.900 --> 45:51.220
You just got let out of.

45:51.220 --> 45:53.780
It's really going to drive home the insanity defense.

45:57.780 --> 45:59.300
Where's the cat going?

46:00.660 --> 46:03.300
That big cat is going back into the house.

46:03.300 --> 46:04.740
We just caught him.

46:04.740 --> 46:05.620
How did you catch him?

46:05.620 --> 46:09.300
Well, sir, it seems the cat came back the very next day.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.660
That's how Catwoman started.

46:14.660 --> 46:18.100
This is a very CSI Miami Candle.

46:23.300 --> 46:25.140
What do you guys do for New Year's Eve?

46:25.140 --> 46:28.900
My friends and I agreed that it might actually be the worst holiday.

46:28.900 --> 46:32.260
It's even worse if you're single because when the countdown does happen,

46:32.260 --> 46:36.900
all the couples kiss and then you have to stand there alone, a lonely doofus.

46:37.540 --> 46:42.100
How do you do New Year's Eve and insights for the singles?

46:42.100 --> 46:43.860
That's from Ed in San Francisco.

46:43.860 --> 46:49.940
So if you can't get a smooch at midnight on New Year's Eve, you are unsmoochable.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.940
That's an excuse when that clock turns over and the promise of a new year

46:53.940 --> 46:56.420
fills us with a sort of drunken hope.

46:56.420 --> 46:57.860
And you get to necking.

46:57.860 --> 47:00.420
Neck with literally anybody you see.

47:00.420 --> 47:02.180
And they'll be like, yup, 2012.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.420
Yeah, you got to get your sexy right.

47:05.140 --> 47:08.740
And go to a party where there's a lot of people.

47:08.740 --> 47:10.260
And then just pair off.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.820
Get there, be like, ladies.

47:12.820 --> 47:13.780
You don't even have to pair off.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.020
Just make sure you're standing near a group of other single people

47:16.020 --> 47:17.380
because you're not thinking about it.

47:18.020 --> 47:20.820
Coupled people will only be able to kiss one person.

47:22.180 --> 47:25.140
You can bounce between people like a pinball pinball.

47:25.140 --> 47:31.620
Yeah, as soon as the balls drop, you just look at the person next to you

47:31.620 --> 47:35.060
who's also single and give them that nod like, is it us?

47:35.060 --> 47:35.620
What do you think?

47:36.260 --> 47:37.300
What's going down?

47:37.300 --> 47:40.660
And I think that, man, if you think New Year's is a boring holiday,

47:40.660 --> 47:42.020
I'm sorry, but you're doing it wrong.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.380
Yeah, it's the best holiday.

47:43.380 --> 47:46.100
It is the time to be like, hey, remember all that stuff

47:46.100 --> 47:47.700
that we had to deal with all year?

47:47.700 --> 47:48.740
That's dead now.

47:48.740 --> 47:49.940
This year is dead.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.580
The next year is a bright, shining, clean slate.

47:52.580 --> 47:53.780
Until December 20th.

47:53.780 --> 47:55.620
Until December 20th, when we all die.

47:55.620 --> 47:57.540
And the whole universe is a clean slate.

47:57.540 --> 47:58.980
Then everything is a clean slate.

47:58.980 --> 48:01.700
And God shakes the Etch-A-Sketch when we start over.

48:01.700 --> 48:01.940
Right.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.140
And Dana Carvey forgets what happened the day before.

48:07.140 --> 48:09.940
I am not crazy about New Year's.

48:09.940 --> 48:10.420
Really?

48:10.420 --> 48:12.580
Yeah, I'm not, I've never enjoyed it.

48:12.580 --> 48:13.700
I don't know why that is.

48:13.700 --> 48:18.020
I think it's because it's so far from Christmas.

48:18.020 --> 48:18.900
Yeah, I guess.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.220
I like Christmas a lot because of all the gifts and stuff.

48:22.020 --> 48:22.980
New Year's Eve gifts.

48:24.340 --> 48:26.100
Well, I think when it comes to New Year's,

48:26.100 --> 48:28.820
I think you have two options as far as the parties go.

48:28.820 --> 48:32.340
And you have the quiet reflection with a small group of friends

48:32.340 --> 48:35.300
where you all sit around like drinking wine and beer and champagne

48:35.300 --> 48:36.900
and talking about what's happened over the last year

48:36.900 --> 48:38.420
and things you look forward to in the next year.

48:38.420 --> 48:40.100
Which can be nice.

48:40.100 --> 48:40.500
Yeah.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.700
And then you just have the wild crazy party till two.

48:44.580 --> 48:48.180
I think the problem comes from when you kind of end up at a party

48:48.180 --> 48:49.460
that's in the middle of those.

48:50.180 --> 48:52.740
Where it's like a bunch of people sitting around

48:52.740 --> 48:54.740
talking about how crappy the year was before.

48:54.740 --> 48:57.700
You've really got to make sure that you go to a Skrillex concert.

48:58.340 --> 49:02.100
At midnight, pop some X, listen to him chop and screw,

49:02.100 --> 49:04.580
Auld Lang Syne, and just go for it.

49:04.580 --> 49:05.140
Yeah.

49:05.140 --> 49:07.700
I've never lived in a bigger city.

49:07.700 --> 49:09.460
Cincinnati is the biggest city I've ever lived in.

49:09.460 --> 49:12.020
But like the idea of going to a bar or club

49:13.300 --> 49:16.820
as like my final destination New Year's party.

49:16.820 --> 49:17.220
I don't know.

49:17.220 --> 49:21.220
That seems like you're setting yourself up to pay a bunch of money for drinks.

49:21.940 --> 49:25.460
You're never going to really get, you know, just pleasantly drunk.

49:26.180 --> 49:30.260
And also you're just surrounded by people you don't know who are going to be, you know.

49:30.260 --> 49:31.380
That's the biggest problem.

49:31.380 --> 49:34.580
It's the worry of lonely hearts that are going to be bumming you out.

49:34.580 --> 49:38.100
At a bar, there's going to be people who are just desperate for human connection.

49:38.100 --> 49:40.100
You know, one time I was working.

49:40.100 --> 49:41.620
I had to work New Year's Eve.

49:41.620 --> 49:48.180
The Blockbuster was open inexplicably until midnight, as it always was on the weekends.

49:48.180 --> 49:52.900
So I sat and watched the ball drop on a crummy little black and white TV.

49:52.900 --> 49:57.380
And there were, I kid you not, two people in there picking out videos.

49:57.940 --> 50:00.500
At midnight, New Year's Eve.

50:00.500 --> 50:07.060
Well, maybe they wanted to start out their year with six days and seven nights, you know.

50:07.060 --> 50:08.420
Well, that gives the twist.

50:08.420 --> 50:09.700
What did they end up getting?

50:09.700 --> 50:13.860
Did you guess Hush and Nutty Professor 2, The Clumps?

50:13.860 --> 50:14.420
Oh.

50:14.420 --> 50:17.300
Because that is what they, that's how they're kicking off.

50:17.300 --> 50:18.980
That's the first movie they want to watch that year.

50:20.180 --> 50:24.100
Don't paint this into a bad picture, because as soon as that ball dropped, midnight,

50:24.100 --> 50:27.220
they were magnetically drawn together and just started some mooching.

50:27.220 --> 50:28.740
You also like The Clumps?

50:29.300 --> 50:30.340
I love The Clumps.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.540
They're married now.

50:31.540 --> 50:32.580
Yeah, they're married now.

50:32.580 --> 50:33.940
Their last name is The Clumps.

50:35.300 --> 50:36.260
How did they do it?

50:36.260 --> 50:38.740
I don't know.

50:38.740 --> 50:40.980
I think it's pretty, pretty fantastic though.

50:40.980 --> 50:42.500
Do you guys have New Year's plans this year?

50:43.700 --> 50:48.580
I think we'll probably have a sort of a dinner party type thing with friends.

50:49.620 --> 50:50.260
Griffin, what are you doing?

50:50.260 --> 50:50.740
Skrillex.

50:50.740 --> 50:51.620
Skrillex concert.

50:51.620 --> 50:53.300
I'm going to do it in the mail and be really bored.

50:54.980 --> 50:56.660
I'm going to do a Skrillex dinner with friends.

50:57.860 --> 50:58.340
New Year.

50:58.340 --> 51:01.060
Can we all agree that 2011 was the year of the Skrillex?

51:02.260 --> 51:03.700
That's what it says on the Chinese calendar.

51:03.700 --> 51:05.060
Skrillex is my astrological sign.

51:05.060 --> 51:06.420
Yeah, I was born under the Skrillex.

51:07.620 --> 51:08.820
My outlook for next year is

51:12.340 --> 51:13.620
That's all it said.

51:13.620 --> 51:14.180
Sorry again.

51:17.060 --> 51:18.820
Onomatopoetically written out.

51:18.820 --> 51:21.540
Why don't people do more on a monopoetic dubstep?

51:21.540 --> 51:21.940
I don't know.

51:22.660 --> 51:24.020
Like written word dubstep?

51:26.020 --> 51:28.180
Did you read that new dubstep book?

51:28.180 --> 51:29.460
What are you talking about?

51:31.060 --> 51:31.460
It said,

51:31.460 --> 51:34.740
Wub wub wub wub drr drr drr.

51:34.740 --> 51:36.020
Slap on the bass now.

51:36.820 --> 51:37.460
What?

51:37.460 --> 51:38.260
Get on the bass.

51:38.820 --> 51:40.180
As written by will.i.am.

51:42.260 --> 51:46.100
It starts really slow, but once you reach about page 120 and you hit the drop.

51:46.100 --> 51:48.660
Oh man, it's so heavy.

51:49.300 --> 51:53.460
When it says call 911 now and then it really kicks into high gear.

51:53.460 --> 51:55.700
I like the part in the third chapter.

51:55.700 --> 51:56.740
It really got to me when it said,

51:56.740 --> 51:59.140
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

51:59.140 --> 52:02.740
I like that because it's kind of a high counterpoint to the wub wub wub wub wub

52:02.740 --> 52:04.820
that's also printed on the page over top of it.

52:05.860 --> 52:07.700
I don't know if the layering is working.

52:07.700 --> 52:10.260
I really liked in the about the author section when it was like

52:12.900 --> 52:17.460
I found the flashback chapter really confusing because it's reggae.

52:19.700 --> 52:22.740
Paul Skrillex lives in New England with his cat

52:24.420 --> 52:25.700
and his wife Dorothy.

52:25.700 --> 52:32.740
There are two kids who go to school in Connecticut.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.420
Oh Skrillex, he wrote the book on dubstep.

52:39.380 --> 52:41.940
Most important thing to him is his family and his walk with Christ.

52:47.380 --> 52:52.820
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first thank you guys as always for hanging

52:52.820 --> 52:57.780
out this year with us and spending so much of your time in our presence.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.020
Thanks to Maximumfun.org.

53:00.020 --> 53:02.340
This is basically completing our first year with them.

53:02.980 --> 53:03.700
It's been awesome.

53:03.700 --> 53:04.420
Thank you guys.

53:04.420 --> 53:09.700
If you have not listened to any other Maximum Fun shows, get out there.

53:09.700 --> 53:11.140
Maximumfun.org you can find.

53:11.140 --> 53:12.980
Stop podcasting yourself.

53:12.980 --> 53:18.900
Judge John Hodgman, Jordan Jesse Goh.

53:18.900 --> 53:28.580
We got a segment coming up on Jesse Thorn's relaunch of his show Sound of Young America.

53:28.580 --> 53:29.460
He's relaunching it.

53:29.460 --> 53:32.660
It's called Bullseye now and it's going to be on NPR.

53:32.660 --> 53:36.340
We're going to do at least one segment and it'll also be on the web.

53:36.340 --> 53:40.980
There'll be segments from there you can listen to and we'll be sure to tell you how to get those

53:40.980 --> 53:46.020
and make sure you tell them how much you like us on it so they'll continue to want to have us.

53:46.020 --> 53:48.340
Just tell everyone you see how much you like us.

53:48.340 --> 53:49.540
Yeah, tell them.

53:49.540 --> 53:51.540
Also, Maximum Fun is looking for an intern.

53:53.140 --> 53:56.180
If you're interested, I mean, it's a pretty sweet deal.

53:56.180 --> 53:56.820
Go check it out.

53:56.820 --> 53:59.460
I think it's Maximumfun.org slash intern.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.580
Is that where it is?

54:00.580 --> 54:01.380
Yes, I believe so.

54:01.380 --> 54:02.980
Is that the actual web address?

54:02.980 --> 54:03.860
I'm almost certain.

54:04.420 --> 54:06.420
Or just yell at your computer, intern.

54:06.420 --> 54:09.460
Maximumfun.org forward slash internships.

54:10.660 --> 54:17.380
They need a good intern and you'll probably end up meeting some really interesting people.

54:17.380 --> 54:18.100
Maybe us.

54:18.100 --> 54:18.580
Maybe us.

54:18.580 --> 54:19.060
Who knows?

54:19.060 --> 54:19.860
Probably not us.

54:19.860 --> 54:20.580
Probably not us.

54:20.580 --> 54:21.380
Maybe us.

54:21.380 --> 54:22.740
We're creations of the internet.

54:23.380 --> 54:26.340
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinners for letting us use the song,

54:26.340 --> 54:27.780
It's a Departure, as our theme song.

54:27.780 --> 54:31.300
It's on the album Putting the Days to Bed, which hopefully everybody got for Christmas.

54:31.300 --> 54:31.860
Hey, John.

54:31.860 --> 54:32.500
Merry Christmas.

54:32.500 --> 54:34.660
Merry Christmas, John Roderick and the Longwinters.

54:35.860 --> 54:36.740
Anything else?

54:36.740 --> 54:42.900
Thank you to everybody who bought t-shirts for your friends and family for the Yuletide.

54:42.900 --> 54:44.180
We saw a lot of great pictures.

54:44.180 --> 54:47.380
I know Golly ALA got a shirt and anybody else.

54:47.380 --> 54:52.180
You can always get more stuff like that at maxfunstore.com.

54:52.740 --> 54:53.380
Or dot org.

54:53.380 --> 54:54.020
Try them both.

54:54.020 --> 54:54.500
Try them both.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.460
One of them will work.

54:55.460 --> 54:57.780
And thanks to everybody who came out to the live shows.

54:57.780 --> 55:01.780
We posted them for our last two episodes and we hope everybody had a good time there.

55:01.780 --> 55:02.660
We certainly did.

55:02.660 --> 55:05.540
And we're going to do more soon, so stay tuned.

55:05.540 --> 55:06.820
So we'll see you in the new year.

55:06.820 --> 55:08.580
See you in 2012.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.780
Yeah, one last year, guys.

55:09.780 --> 55:10.580
Let's do it.

55:10.580 --> 55:12.260
Let's close out human existence with a bang.

55:13.140 --> 55:15.780
JC Fletcher sent in this final Yahoo question.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.220
Thank you, JC Fletcher.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.460
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ryan, who asks,

55:19.460 --> 55:24.020
what is the exact angle for getting gold properly with a sluice box?

55:27.540 --> 55:28.580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:28.580 --> 55:29.620
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:29.620 --> 55:30.980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:30.980 --> 55:32.660
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

55:32.660 --> 55:33.380
Kiss your dad.

55:34.100 --> 55:34.900
Wear on the lips.

55:40.980 --> 55:42.660
Keep your heart three stacks.

55:42.660 --> 55:43.700
Keep your heart.

55:43.700 --> 55:45.860
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

55:45.860 --> 55:46.900
Keep your heart.

55:46.900 --> 55:48.180
Man, these girls are smart.

55:48.180 --> 55:50.020
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

55:50.020 --> 56:14.020
Play your part.
