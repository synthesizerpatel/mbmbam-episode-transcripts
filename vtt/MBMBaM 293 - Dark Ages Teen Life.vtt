00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:49.920
No prep, just go. This is that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.120
This one's for them. Why did we practice? Why did we practice, Justin?

00:55.120 --> 00:58.000
Griffin, your part's down. No, I'm just doing the dance.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.960
No, do it. Do the song. I gotta do the dance.

01:04.960 --> 01:10.880
Okay, let's take it from the top. Griffin, you just edit all this out, yep.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.040
Yeah, you'll clean it up. Just go, just go, just go, just go.

01:13.040 --> 01:17.520
I'm fucking feeling it, I'm fucking hot. This is the- oh no, let me try again.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, please don't start in that key. Yeah, I don't think we can-

01:20.000 --> 01:24.160
This here, that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.320
This one's for them hood girls, them good girls, straight masterpieces.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.760
Smiling- Boop, boop.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.560
What? Oh fuck.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.120
I said that way. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.600
Griffin, you swore you weren't gonna do auto- Hot time, summer in the city.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.880
Mash up, like Gungli. With your head down over your pieces, brother.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.320
All right, listen. It's a track, it's a bore,

01:42.320 --> 01:45.760
it's really, it's a pity I'm locked to a name I call the police and a fireman.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.600
All right. Wait, hold on.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.400
Are you just doing a secret world of Richard Scarry or whatever,

01:50.400 --> 01:54.320
the busy world where you're just describing different professions someone could have?

01:54.320 --> 01:55.840
The secret world.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.880
Don't believe me, just one night in Bangkok with-

01:58.880 --> 02:00.080
Oh, that's fucking good.

02:00.080 --> 02:00.960
That's good, right?

02:00.960 --> 02:03.360
Don't believe me, just one night in Bangkok- You listening, Rocky Horror?

02:05.440 --> 02:06.720
Hi, welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.320
If Justin's not gonna say it, I guess I fucking will.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.080
It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your young-

02:10.080 --> 02:12.480
And a musical mashup, and a musical mashup.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.320
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.800
This is Stop Podcasting Yourself. Thank you for listening to Stop Podcasting Yourself.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.520
I'm Graham.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.760
And I'm Jordan Morris, boy detective.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.640
And I'm Marc Maron. Welcome to What If.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.440
Is that not how you pronounce it?

02:31.440 --> 02:34.320
I've always been curious how you pronounce it, because there's no vowels.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.120
Is it just what if?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.840
Hey, as long as it's not gonna be any kind of cohesion in this introduction at all,

02:39.840 --> 02:41.360
I wanna abandon this Yahoo!

02:42.240 --> 02:46.160
Because I'm just looking at it right now, and I think it's too mean for us to do,

02:46.160 --> 02:48.960
and it's by Level 9000 Yajur Jujur Davenport.

02:49.600 --> 02:53.520
And then the question, which is from Yahoo Answers user Dan,

02:54.160 --> 02:56.560
is what is Lou Bega's net worth?

02:56.560 --> 02:58.240
And I thought that would be like a front closer.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.520
I thought it'd be a front closer, but then I decided it'd be too mean.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.760
Until there's that cough button.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.240
Justin, why did you buy a fucking cough button if you're not gonna use it?

03:06.240 --> 03:07.200
All right, let me just cough again.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.080
I can still hear it a little bit.

03:12.080 --> 03:16.720
It sounded like he just got blasted through a wall behind a mattress.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.280
Anyway, I did look it up on CelebrityNetWorth.com,

03:19.280 --> 03:21.440
and it says he's worth a milli still.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.520
So that's pretty good, I think.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.760
I would think that to be on Celebrity Net Worth,

03:25.760 --> 03:28.560
that's like probably the de facto setting.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.120
Yeah, what if you clicked on him and it was just like 10 bucks?

03:32.320 --> 03:35.440
When they launched that site, that's probably what they put in for everybody.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.240
And then they're just like,

03:36.240 --> 03:38.800
"'Cause I don't know, probably like a million dollars."

03:38.800 --> 03:40.640
This is their Y2K, you know?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.480
If anyone drops below a million dollars,

03:42.480 --> 03:44.000
the computer wasn't designed to handle that.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.400
Gang, it goes a way lower than a milli.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.920
Significantly lower than a milli, yeah.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.520
Who's the famous person with the lowest net worth?

03:53.520 --> 03:55.120
That should be tracked on there, right?

03:55.120 --> 03:56.240
Like the poorest-

03:56.240 --> 03:58.320
You should be able to search lowest to highest.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.040
I just wanna see who we could get on the show for like a C note.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.080
This is an advice here for the modern era.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.680
I'm Errol's brother, Justin McElroy.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.200
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.600
Francis McDormand is worth $10 million.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.960
Way to go, Francis.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.800
Keep up the great acting.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.760
What about French Stewart?

04:16.480 --> 04:17.440
Good question.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.640
Griffin, search my name.

04:19.280 --> 04:20.640
Yeah, I'll search Travis McElroy.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.480
Says you're worth half of a pack of Starburst.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.680
That seems low.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.840
I've got three quarters of a pack sitting right here.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.040
Somebody needs to update this.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.400
Well, you also have to factor in the debt.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.920
Oh no, I ate three of them.

04:31.920 --> 04:32.880
They were right.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.160
They were right all along.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.160
This is an advice show for the modern era.

04:36.160 --> 04:36.960
Don't believe me?

04:36.960 --> 04:37.840
Just watch.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.680
Brothers, I broke up with someone last year

04:39.680 --> 04:40.960
that I was with for two years.

04:40.960 --> 04:41.920
It's been great.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.160
Because they were kind of a creepo.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.920
For example, when I broke up with him,

04:45.920 --> 04:48.640
they told me about a fetish I unknowingly fulfilled

04:48.640 --> 04:50.000
for them during our relationship.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.280
Cool, cool, cool.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.360
How the fuck can you not tell us what it is?

04:56.560 --> 04:58.800
Yeah, I'm holding you personally responsible

04:58.800 --> 04:59.840
for not telling us what it is.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.280
I'm gonna say dollhouse play.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.960
And I don't even know what the fuck that is.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.120
Yeah, Griffin made that thing up that doesn't exist.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.320
It's where you pretend to be characters from dollhouse.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.200
Oh, good.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.720
Yeah, with all the great character names I remember.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.200
The only problem is there are a few things of mine

05:15.200 --> 05:17.920
I'd like back and I have some of their things too.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.440
It was a long distance relationship

05:19.440 --> 05:22.720
so I can't go to their house to demand my things back.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.320
They blocked me on Twitter and Facebook

05:24.320 --> 05:26.000
so I can't contact them there.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.520
I also deleted them from my phone

05:27.520 --> 05:28.800
because I'm a giant dingus.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.720
Should I make a new account

05:30.720 --> 05:32.800
on either the sites to contact them

05:32.800 --> 05:33.920
or would that be creepy?

05:33.920 --> 05:36.160
That's from Ify in Indiana.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.520
What is this stuff?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.080
What is this stuff?

05:40.080 --> 05:42.240
How good could this stuff be?

05:42.240 --> 05:44.000
How good is this stuff?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.520
I included this question

05:45.520 --> 05:50.080
because it gave me a brilliant business idea.

05:50.080 --> 05:50.880
How good?

05:50.880 --> 05:54.720
That there should be like kind of like repo men

05:54.720 --> 05:56.720
or like movers, a company,

05:56.720 --> 05:58.560
like a third party company

05:58.560 --> 06:02.800
that you could hire to handle the exchange of goods

06:02.800 --> 06:05.200
left over at someone's house after you've broken up.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.280
Homie, you're talking about a divorce lawyer.

06:07.280 --> 06:07.840
No, no, no.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.400
I mean like this is like somebody who just,

06:10.400 --> 06:14.080
almost like who's the person who delivers the summons,

06:15.360 --> 06:16.880
who delivers court documents

06:16.880 --> 06:17.440
and they are always-

06:17.440 --> 06:19.280
I think it's the high magistrate.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.160
Yes, but just somebody whose job it is to like roll up

06:24.160 --> 06:26.800
and be like, hey, Debra sent me

06:26.800 --> 06:30.320
to get like her angel DVD box set

06:30.320 --> 06:33.840
and like her favorite hooded sweatshirt.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.240
Please don't make this more difficult than it has to be.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.720
Okay, I don't think it's a bad idea conceptually.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.480
Problems with it though include

06:43.200 --> 06:45.200
if the person denies that they have it,

06:46.320 --> 06:47.520
then what is like,

06:47.520 --> 06:49.360
does that have to be arbitrated before

06:49.360 --> 06:53.280
or is this person gonna have the full lethal force?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.760
A full blown dog, the bounty hunter,

06:55.760 --> 06:59.280
cavity surge like you got those DVDs at angel up you.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.400
I know it.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.040
I can see them right there fucking out of your butt.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.680
You can't hide any Joss Whedon DVDs from dog.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.240
You'll sniff them out no matter where they are inside you.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.760
I just think that like, if you think about all this,

07:12.800 --> 07:14.720
this happens all the time where people are like,

07:14.720 --> 07:15.920
I don't care about the breakup,

07:15.920 --> 07:19.680
but I miss like my favorite whatever.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.160
Yeah.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.760
I feel like this could be an even exchange

07:21.760 --> 07:24.480
because they say I have some of their stuff too.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.440
So this is like a same time, you know,

07:27.440 --> 07:29.520
like you give me that, I'll give you this.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.800
It's a one in one out exchange with the third party

07:33.680 --> 07:37.440
like kind of handling so you don't have to see anybody.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.120
There's some English on this ball

07:39.120 --> 07:41.120
that I'm trying to come to terms with.

07:41.120 --> 07:45.440
And it is if the, so the other person's a creeper

07:45.440 --> 07:48.320
and if the question asker had ended up with their stuff,

07:48.320 --> 07:50.400
I would have been like, that is your,

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
that's just their fee, you know what I mean?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.960
Like you get that stuff for putting up with

07:54.960 --> 07:57.600
what sounds like just sort of their whole

07:57.600 --> 07:59.200
weird garbage demeanor.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.520
And then congratulations, you've,

08:01.520 --> 08:05.280
you earned that series DVDs of Angel

08:05.280 --> 08:06.400
and then that's on them.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.240
But for them to take the shit

08:08.240 --> 08:10.960
and be a garbage demeanor creeper,

08:10.960 --> 08:12.240
then that's doubly bad.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.160
And I think it's time to stick the dog on them.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.400
I think so too.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.440
We can definitely agree that you should not see

08:19.440 --> 08:21.120
this person in person, right?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.080
Ever again.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.200
Yeah, yeah.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.040
Yeah, listen, and I don't have a problem

08:25.040 --> 08:26.400
with the fact that someone has a fetish.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.960
I want to make that clear before I make this next sentence,

08:28.960 --> 08:31.280
which is the type of person that during a breakup

08:31.280 --> 08:32.640
will be like, hey, by the way,

08:32.640 --> 08:34.320
hey, I just want you to know

08:34.320 --> 08:36.160
that like during that whole relationship,

08:36.800 --> 08:38.000
you were doing this.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.520
It's like, hey, time and place.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.400
Like, yeah.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.640
Well, yeah, the time is the zero death,

08:44.640 --> 08:45.840
heat death of the universe

08:45.840 --> 08:47.920
and the place is the garbage can where you live.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.400
There's another, there's another danger though.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
What if you know right now,

08:54.400 --> 08:57.440
because of the space of time and distance,

08:57.440 --> 08:59.760
like literal space, that this person is a creep.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.880
But what if when you see them in person,

09:02.880 --> 09:05.680
uh oh, here you come again.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.240
No.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.960
Just when I began to get myself together,

09:08.960 --> 09:11.360
you hear birds and you're just like back.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.880
Justin's not far off.

09:12.880 --> 09:13.760
Thank you, Travis.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.240
Whenever someone's like, I deleted them off my phone,

09:16.240 --> 09:17.680
I deleted all this stuff,

09:17.680 --> 09:19.920
that always to me sounds like someone going,

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
I was afraid like I would have won too many beers

09:21.920 --> 09:23.120
and start texting them.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.520
Or alternatively, the shit was so toxic

09:25.520 --> 09:27.360
that you don't even want to see their fucking name anymore.

09:27.360 --> 09:27.760
That's also possible.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.920
Which is the other alternate like possibility.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.800
Like, which makes,

09:30.800 --> 09:33.680
which makes my service all the better, Griffin.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.400
I think make a new,

09:34.400 --> 09:36.880
I think make a new email account or whatever,

09:36.880 --> 09:39.520
a new Twitter or whatever, a new Facebook or whatever,

09:39.520 --> 09:42.080
and just call it like Dog the Bounty Hunter 2,

09:42.080 --> 09:44.320
give me my fucking stuff back, Mark.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.240
Like, I don't think there's any problem with that message.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.080
I'm like, hey, don't block this account.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.200
Give me my shit back.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.080
I'm gonna call the dog,

09:50.080 --> 09:51.120
I'm gonna stick the dogs on you.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.640
This is your only warning.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.140
Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Maybe, or maybe you just like cut out the middleman

09:56.000 --> 09:57.040
and you go to their house

09:57.040 --> 10:00.160
and you nail a single like board to their front door.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.280
And when they open up their front door,

10:01.280 --> 10:03.040
they see this board and what's on that board,

10:03.040 --> 10:04.480
it's a bloody paw print.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.520
That's right, motherfucker.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.400
Here come the dog.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.000
The dogs are sniffing at you.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.200
Dog, he's sniffing.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.760
He's sniffing around the dog.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.960
How about Yahoo?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.080
Yeah, this one was,

10:14.080 --> 10:18.160
can I just say Zoe Kinski sent in a million this week

10:18.720 --> 10:20.880
and they were all fucking stellar

10:20.880 --> 10:22.480
and we need to come up with a new name for her.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.000
Somebody suggested Zoe Kinski, top of that ladder.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.440
That's not, it's bad.

10:27.440 --> 10:28.560
Top of the food chain?

10:28.560 --> 10:29.360
What about this?

10:29.360 --> 10:30.800
Zoe Kinski, top of the world.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.040
Riding high.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.480
Riding high, Zoe Kinski.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.920
Riding high is very good.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.200
Let's do it.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.560
Zoe Kinski, riding high.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.040
Thank you, Zoe.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user,

10:44.400 --> 10:45.280
a stranger.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.480
Oh, no.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.880
Who asks?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.640
At least it's uh and not the.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.840
Yeah, my girlfriend lives in Tokyo.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.680
Is a body, no, she doesn't exist.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.160
She doesn't.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.280
Is a body pillow with my picture on it

10:59.280 --> 11:01.280
as a Christmas gift weird or cute?

11:01.920 --> 11:04.880
Okay, so we've been dating a year now.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.560
She was a foreign exchange student to America.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.320
She doesn't exist.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.400
And she left back to Japan.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.440
She didn't need to book a ticket

11:11.440 --> 11:14.000
because non-existent people don't need to

11:15.040 --> 11:17.120
for at least nine months a couple months ago.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.960
Uh, I was thinking I would get her a body pillow

11:20.960 --> 11:22.960
and a custom print pillow case.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.080
The pillow case would be,

11:24.880 --> 11:25.920
the pillow case would be,

11:25.920 --> 11:26.640
what, sorry, go ahead.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.520
Do your thing.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.040
I just, no, I want,

11:29.040 --> 11:30.720
it's important that I say this now.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.000
As much as I always love further details

11:34.000 --> 11:35.360
in Yahoo questions,

11:35.360 --> 11:37.600
if this person does not think

11:37.600 --> 11:39.440
that after the initial question,

11:39.440 --> 11:43.120
we had a perfect fucking crystal clear

11:43.120 --> 11:48.080
technicolor image of every moment of their entire,

11:48.080 --> 11:51.120
I feel like I've watched Ken Burns' This Dude

11:51.120 --> 11:54.560
like over the past eight hours.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.200
It's like a sci-fi episode of a show

11:57.200 --> 11:59.600
where like you see the entire like lifetime play out

11:59.600 --> 12:00.800
and then the person wakes up

12:00.800 --> 12:02.640
and it's all been like an implanted memory

12:02.640 --> 12:04.320
and they're still like 23.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.680
That's how I feel about this person.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.760
I've lived this person's life

12:07.760 --> 12:09.840
through the headline of this question.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.160
It is the for sale baby shoes.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.320
I was gonna say that literal exact thing.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.120
Weird.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.560
Of Yahoo answers.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.920
I get all of it.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.400
Okay, the pillow case would be a picture of me

12:22.400 --> 12:24.080
with a white background on one side,

12:24.080 --> 12:25.840
completely non-sexual by the way,

12:25.840 --> 12:28.080
no nude or suggestive images

12:29.280 --> 12:31.520
and probably a pic of Mammoth Mountain

12:31.520 --> 12:33.760
with us in the distant background on the other side

12:33.760 --> 12:36.080
since it might be tacky to have a life-size pic of me

12:36.080 --> 12:37.360
on display at all times.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.360
Additional details.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.560
She is also a pillow.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.600
That's weird, right?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.320
The idea of like,

12:46.320 --> 12:50.720
and now a scenic tableau of that trip we took once

12:51.600 --> 12:52.560
to go up with that.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.680
Anyway, and the last thing-

12:53.680 --> 12:55.520
Because I couldn't decide between a pillow

12:55.520 --> 12:57.280
and one of those digital photo frames.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.280
Yeah, the last thing I'll do

12:59.280 --> 13:01.040
is put in a cheapo voice recorder.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.200
You really don't wanna splurge on this.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.040
With my voice recorded saying good night or I love you.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.240
Something along those lines.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.200
It's supposed to be a little thing

13:09.200 --> 13:11.040
to help her feel less sad when she goes to bed

13:11.680 --> 13:14.160
since I know we both miss being under one roof.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.880
Anyway, I just wanna get some people's opinion on this gift.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.680
Let's hate the sin, not the center

13:21.680 --> 13:23.120
in this particular question.

13:23.120 --> 13:23.680
I think like-

13:23.680 --> 13:24.480
I got it, Griffin.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.440
I've got the best,

13:25.440 --> 13:27.680
like the first thing that clicked into my head was this.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.640
And this, I wanna be 100% explicitly clear,

13:30.640 --> 13:31.600
this is sin.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.800
I haven't figured out which one yet,

13:32.800 --> 13:34.240
but it's definitely in-

13:34.240 --> 13:34.960
Idolatry.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.720
Probably, yeah.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.400
But the problem here is that

13:38.400 --> 13:40.160
this is the type of president that if-

13:41.040 --> 13:42.160
This is the type of president-

13:42.160 --> 13:42.880
Wait, what?

13:42.880 --> 13:46.000
Now just keep signing Ted Cruz.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.280
This is the type of president

13:47.920 --> 13:51.840
that if you are uncertain enough to turn to Yahoo,

13:51.840 --> 13:53.280
the answer is no.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.600
Especially when you include a cheapo voice recorder in it.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.760
I gotta ask something that I've had to ask you

13:59.760 --> 14:01.760
like a disappointing number of times lately.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.600
And is that funny?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.680
Is that gonna be a funny thing to go down?

14:05.680 --> 14:06.880
The answer, if the answer is no,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.200
then we can't talk about how we could tweak this

14:09.200 --> 14:11.520
and twerk it and take it to the fucking body shop

14:11.520 --> 14:12.480
and get it going so right.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.920
We can't take it to West Coast Customs-

14:13.920 --> 14:14.880
Well, let's reshape it.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.560
If pillow isn't the answer,

14:16.560 --> 14:18.800
what other thing could you put your face on

14:19.360 --> 14:23.760
that now becomes like a slam dunk 100% most definite swish?

14:23.760 --> 14:25.200
Let me hit you with this.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.640
What do you think about this?

14:26.640 --> 14:27.600
A dinner plate.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.240
Then they finish up their meal

14:30.240 --> 14:31.440
and it's just your face like,

14:31.440 --> 14:32.880
how is that lasagna?

14:33.680 --> 14:34.240
Good job.

14:34.240 --> 14:34.800
Was that lasagna?

14:34.800 --> 14:36.080
Good job, sweetie.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.360
My clean plate girl.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.720
Good job, spaghetti.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.080
Good job, spaghetti girl.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.200
It's our baby.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.520
Babe, it's our favorite meal.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.720
Good job, spaghetti.

14:52.240 --> 14:55.200
We would eat it together under the same roof together

14:55.200 --> 14:56.480
and I would watch it just,

14:56.480 --> 14:57.120
by which I mean,

14:57.120 --> 14:58.240
I would just sort of hold it up

14:58.240 --> 14:59.920
and drop it right on the floor

14:59.920 --> 15:03.280
because you're a specter of my imagination.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.560
You can't put it on her car

15:04.560 --> 15:05.680
because then everybody's gonna think

15:05.680 --> 15:08.080
she works for a Dylan delivery service.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.200
That's no good.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.280
That's my favorite Studio Ghibli movie.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.680
It was next to my neighbor Dylan

15:17.040 --> 15:18.560
and Dylan dillined away.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.880
Did you hear about Deborah?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.520
Yeah, she got dillined away.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.160
Her fucking parents ate Dylan's snacks,

15:28.160 --> 15:29.200
turned into pigs,

15:29.200 --> 15:31.120
which made her work in a bath shop.

15:31.120 --> 15:31.920
It sucked.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.200
It dillined away.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.280
Beautiful, beautiful film though.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.320
It was beautiful.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.120
Beautifully shot.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.880
And also Dylan in Madagascar.

15:40.880 --> 15:41.920
Was that one of his joints?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.320
They did Madagascar.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.680
I did Kung Fu Panda 3.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.360
Is it, maybe it's something where you cut out-

15:49.360 --> 15:50.400
Dylan spickable me?

15:52.000 --> 15:52.640
Okay, sorry.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.520
Maybe you just get one of those big head cutout things.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.000
You put it over her bed on the ceiling.

15:58.000 --> 15:58.560
Yes.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.840
So as she goes to sleep,

15:59.840 --> 16:00.640
you're just looking,

16:00.640 --> 16:02.080
you're looking over her,

16:02.080 --> 16:03.760
protecting her in the night times.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.640
And she'll just think about how it looks

16:06.640 --> 16:09.680
like some sort of demon has lifted you up to the skies.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.320
Oh yeah, the look on your face

16:12.320 --> 16:14.160
will need to be one of horror.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.840
Yeah, if you could make it so that

16:15.840 --> 16:18.000
just like a single drop of blood

16:18.000 --> 16:21.040
comes out of that weird ceiling body

16:21.040 --> 16:23.760
that you put up there like every 20 minutes or so.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.240
I would say every four hours

16:26.240 --> 16:28.080
because that's enough where you're gonna forget.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.920
That's gonna be really upsetting.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.800
Like, here's that, there's that cough button.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.560
Can I say if you draw attention to it?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.480
But Justin, before you hit the cough button,

16:38.480 --> 16:38.960
you're going,

16:40.000 --> 16:41.760
okay, so I should hold it in for all that.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.440
It's a fucking dubstep drop.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.720
Like, I'm proud of you.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.000
I think the audience is happy.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.680
Well, I edit those fuckers out.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.440
So like, I'm the happiest,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.280
like about the situation that is possible.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.040
But I think it's like an inner,

16:53.040 --> 16:55.600
it's an important new cast member on the show.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.000
It's Griffin, Justin, Travis, and Coffee.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.840
They're not, Coffee's a thing, but.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.880
Yeah, Coffee's been a part of this show for a long time.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.080
Wheeze, Wheezebo.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.280
He gets all the wheezing out.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.880
What if, can I suggest this?

17:10.880 --> 17:12.720
What if you put your face on a coffee mug?

17:12.720 --> 17:15.040
What if you put it inside the coffee mug

17:15.040 --> 17:16.560
at the bottom of the drink?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.520
So you finish it and there's just like a speech bubble

17:19.520 --> 17:20.720
like, you're ready to go.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.720
I got a better idea.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.320
How's your day?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.520
Here's to pick me up.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.200
What if you made it so that you get

17:27.200 --> 17:31.040
like a ceramic recreation of the top of your head

17:31.040 --> 17:33.040
and you sort of put it parallel

17:33.040 --> 17:35.680
with the drink hole on top of the cup

17:35.680 --> 17:37.920
so that it looks like the cup opening

17:37.920 --> 17:39.360
and hole of the coffee cup

17:39.360 --> 17:43.360
is a gaping, giant, grotesque mouth of yours.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.960
And then it's like you're barfing

17:44.960 --> 17:46.720
that good brown energy liquid

17:46.720 --> 17:49.920
just right into her mouth like a baby bird would do.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.680
I've said all that and it was a bad idea.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.080
Yeah, that's all right though.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.480
There's no bad ideas in brainstorming, Griffin.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.280
You're right.

17:57.280 --> 17:57.920
But that was.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.040
Sometimes you don't know what's gonna be good or bad

18:01.040 --> 18:02.560
until you get it out there.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.160
You gotta throw the coffee mug at the wall

18:04.160 --> 18:05.120
and see what sticks.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.280
Did I say that I maybe described it wrong?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.440
Could you visualize it good like I was saying?

18:09.440 --> 18:12.240
It was like a person's mouth was the opening.

18:12.240 --> 18:16.560
Yeah, like it would be like a clown at a mini golf.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.080
No, yeah, that was clear.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.400
And then every time, but I want you to envision

18:20.400 --> 18:22.080
every time you take a drink of that cup

18:22.080 --> 18:25.520
you're like confronting getting very close face to face

18:25.520 --> 18:28.080
with your boyfriend almost like he's challenging you

18:28.080 --> 18:30.560
with every sip as you lift his face to greet your own.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.960
That was actually, that was the fetish

18:34.960 --> 18:36.160
from the first question.

18:36.160 --> 18:36.480
Shit.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.160
Baby birding.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.920
Can I read a question?

18:41.360 --> 18:41.680
Yeah.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.760
Okay, because I really like this one.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.880
Welcome to the big show.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.720
I hope I don't blow it.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.160
I recently went to a liquor store

18:48.160 --> 18:51.040
and bought a magnum of wine to last me the week.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.200
On the walk home, I stopped in the grocery store

18:53.200 --> 18:55.840
and proceeded to drop the full magnum of wine

18:55.840 --> 18:58.640
which proceeded to shatter and spill out on the floor.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.640
I quickly got someone who works at the store

19:00.640 --> 19:03.760
to let them know and then walked out feeling embarrassed.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.320
As I walked home though, I started to feel guilty

19:06.320 --> 19:08.560
that I seemingly walked into a store,

19:08.560 --> 19:11.120
smashed the bottle and then walked out.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.520
Brothers, should I have waited while they cleaned up

19:13.520 --> 19:15.280
or offered to help in some way?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.680
And that's from No More Wine in New York.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.120
Um, oh man, what a fun situation.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.160
The worst.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.480
Why did you, it's weird, the weird thing to me,

19:24.480 --> 19:27.040
I guess New York, like, they don't have grocery stores

19:27.040 --> 19:30.560
in New York, so you have to go to like Jim's Ham Depot

19:30.560 --> 19:32.720
and get your ham and then you have to go to the,

19:32.720 --> 19:36.000
to the root vegetable depot and a lot of depots.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.080
Um, so you do have to like stop in like 16 different

19:38.080 --> 19:40.560
discreet places just to like get the components

19:40.560 --> 19:41.440
of a single meal.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.000
Um, because to me, it's, it's weird to think like,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.120
oh, I bought a big bottle of wine.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.480
Now it's time to go to the grocery store.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.320
Big bottle of wine, now it's time to go take this

19:48.320 --> 19:51.920
and me and my, my grapey buddy to a second location.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.360
Um, that part is weird.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.400
That part's weird to me.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.120
Should you feel bad?

19:55.120 --> 19:56.880
No, that's like their, that's their job.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.000
But you should feel bad.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.920
I, I, I hate this situation for you so much

20:01.920 --> 20:04.640
because you bought what was supposed to last you a week

20:04.640 --> 20:07.040
and you lost it in moments.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.920
And like, that's so painful to me.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.360
I, like, I-

20:11.360 --> 20:14.320
You're sad, wait, you're sad because the wine died.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.320
The wine died, Griffin.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.360
That was gonna be their wine compatriot that was like,

20:19.360 --> 20:20.880
hey, you and me for the week.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.800
This is like my ration of wine and you lost it.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.000
And like, you're not gonna get, you walked home in shame

20:28.000 --> 20:30.400
and you're gonna punish yourself for the week

20:30.400 --> 20:34.400
because you made like the stock boy clean up your magnum mess.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.320
And I, ah.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.680
Is there a similar situation?

20:37.680 --> 20:42.160
Is there anything worse than breaking a glass

20:42.160 --> 20:44.800
while you're at a bar or a restaurant and being like,

20:44.800 --> 20:47.040
I made a, I made a uh oh.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.320
Yeah, there is something worse.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.880
Bringing a glass from another restaurant,

20:50.880 --> 20:52.240
smashing it on the floor

20:52.240 --> 20:53.200
because that's what this person did.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.560
Yeah, but that's not, that's not theirs.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.800
Like, if I, I would rather somebody came in my house

20:56.800 --> 20:59.200
and like shattered some dishes that they brought from home

20:59.200 --> 21:00.400
and do it to my own shit.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.320
I, I, I went on a bunk, a bunk trike,

21:04.320 --> 21:05.840
by which I mean a drunk bike.

21:05.840 --> 21:06.880
They should call it that

21:06.880 --> 21:08.400
because once you reach a certain point,

21:08.400 --> 21:09.520
that's how you called it.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.600
Um, I want a drunk, what's it called?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.560
Like you get on a petty-

21:12.560 --> 21:13.360
The Pedal Wagon.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.240
Pedal Wagon, yeah.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.080
And I got, went on a bar crawl

21:16.080 --> 21:17.120
and we stopped at one place

21:17.120 --> 21:19.360
that had a little arcade in the back.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.400
And so me and a buddy were,

21:20.400 --> 21:21.760
I put in some quarters to play some

21:21.760 --> 21:23.920
Super Street Fighter II Turbo Championship Edition.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.120
I was like, fuck yeah, here we go.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.480
Almost as soon as I put the quarters in

21:26.480 --> 21:28.560
and began my campaign as E-Honda,

21:29.120 --> 21:32.320
I put my drink down on the NBA jam machine.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.400
Not realizing that the console I put that on-

21:34.400 --> 21:35.440
It's a sloped console.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.080
It was at about maybe like a 60 degree angle.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.000
It's not sloped, oh great.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.160
And so my glass broke and I was torn

21:42.160 --> 21:43.760
because there was broken glass on the floor.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.400
It was a hazard.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.360
But I'd just begun my game of Street Fighter II Turbo Edition.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.280
What did you do?

21:50.000 --> 21:50.160
I just-

21:50.160 --> 21:51.440
Don't leave me in suspense.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.080
I stood there.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.040
Somebody came and cleaned it up.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.840
It wasn't a big deal.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.440
While you continued playing,

21:55.440 --> 21:56.960
like you just like lifted your feet up

21:56.960 --> 21:57.920
without looking at them

21:57.920 --> 22:00.000
so they could sleep around your toes.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.120
It was 50 cents.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.400
It was two quarters.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.600
Listen, I get it.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.080
Uh, question after the next time this happens

22:06.080 --> 22:08.240
and you drop it and it shouldn't happen again

22:08.240 --> 22:09.280
and it shatters on the ground,

22:09.280 --> 22:10.800
I want you to loudly announce

22:10.800 --> 22:13.440
the Piggly Wiggly sends their regards

22:13.440 --> 22:14.480
and then storm out.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.640
I, uh, here, if this,

22:18.640 --> 22:21.920
this is not necessarily a funny thing to say,

22:21.920 --> 22:22.880
but it is the truth.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.680
You couldn't have helped cleaned up

22:25.680 --> 22:27.840
because they, I'm sure, have, uh-

22:27.840 --> 22:28.160
Yeah.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.440
Like insurance policies that do not protect them

22:31.440 --> 22:33.840
if like customers get hurt in their store.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.560
If you were cleaning up your own shit in the store

22:36.560 --> 22:37.280
and then you got cut,

22:37.280 --> 22:38.640
then that could be a lawsuit for them.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.160
So they wouldn't let you help anyway.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.360
And it would have been way worse

22:41.360 --> 22:44.000
if you had just stood there watching them clean up.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.280
That was the right thing.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.880
That was literally the worst thing you could,

22:46.880 --> 22:49.040
like that would be worse than kicking their teeth in.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.840
Mop up my, mop up my, uh-oh.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.320
Scrub my whoopsie.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.040
Because if you take that a step further,

22:57.040 --> 22:58.240
you're concerned if you're someone

22:58.240 --> 23:00.880
who just seemed to walk in, smash a thing and leave.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.120
It's way worse to be a person who walked in,

23:03.120 --> 23:06.800
smashed a thing so they could watch others clean it up.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.720
Like that's a way worse person to be.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.600
Uh, okay. Um, I have a fucking great solution.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.600
And this is a new thing that everybody can do.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.120
Uh, anytime you want, okay?

23:21.120 --> 23:21.600
You ready?

23:22.160 --> 23:24.720
I'm gonna change this person's life and everybody's life.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.600
Next time you do something that's like so embarrassing

23:27.600 --> 23:28.720
that you think you're never,

23:28.720 --> 23:30.800
like you make a huge mess in a place

23:30.800 --> 23:34.080
or you like, you, you're like, like happen to this person,

23:34.080 --> 23:35.200
you smash a bottle or whatever,

23:36.000 --> 23:37.440
just run for the door.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.600
And right as you hit the door, as you're about to leave,

23:39.600 --> 23:43.120
shout, jackass four, coming to theaters next year.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.160
Run out the door.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.520
So anytime you bust your ass.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.920
Bust your ass, you fall, you knock something over, whatever.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.600
Point at a bush and say, did you get that?

23:51.600 --> 23:52.080
Did you get it?

23:52.080 --> 23:53.520
Point at a bush, say, did you get it?

23:53.520 --> 23:55.920
Or like get your, uh, camera phone out

23:55.920 --> 23:58.400
and act like you're like talking into it.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.960
Like you're getting some like gorilla footage.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.600
And then just shout, jackass four, come to theaters next year.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
Yeah, you crash your car into another car.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.320
You'd be like, ah, got you punked, season three.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.680
I'm Johnny Canoxville.

24:09.680 --> 24:10.480
And then you run away.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.320
What's up, wild boys?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.000
Fuck you and your Jeep, later.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.080
I got you season four.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.840
Bam's here, the whole team.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.720
It's Bam town.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.680
And then you run away.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.600
Justin, I thought you were going to go a different way.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.400
I thought we were on another like psychic link thing

24:24.400 --> 24:26.640
where my idea was for situations like this,

24:26.640 --> 24:28.000
where there is no good solution.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.240
What if everybody just carried a bag of treats around with them

24:30.240 --> 24:33.360
and then it's like their last resort, whoopsie bag.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.120
And it's like, if you drop a bottle of wine

24:35.120 --> 24:36.960
and somebody else has to clean it up

24:36.960 --> 24:39.680
and there's no good, there's no good solution for this problem.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.560
So maybe you just like reach in and you'd be like, fuck.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.400
All right, well, listen, obviously I goofed up

24:44.400 --> 24:45.680
and you're having to deal with it.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.800
So what do you like?

24:46.800 --> 24:48.080
Like a fun size Snickers.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.840
I've got like little puzzles in here.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.600
I've got super high bouncy balls.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.920
I've got some home.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.200
I got one of those, you know,

24:57.200 --> 24:58.960
those little plastic homies that you could get

24:58.960 --> 25:00.960
from the little gosh upon machines.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.040
I got a couple of those if that's what you're into.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.880
And I have one slimy hand left.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.240
So which is it gonna be?

25:06.240 --> 25:07.040
Which is it gonna be?

25:07.760 --> 25:09.200
I would take the slimy hand if I were you

25:09.200 --> 25:10.960
because that's like, you can get a lot of fun out of it.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.760
You always gotta dig to the bottom to find the foam plane.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.160
And it's never gonna be good.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.600
Like, yeah.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.200
But you love the idea of it

25:19.200 --> 25:22.320
because it's like, oh, it's like a World War II fighter plane.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.120
But it's gonna last you like 30 seconds in the real world.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.760
It basically turns your life into one of those

25:28.480 --> 25:31.440
hair redemption machines at Fantastic Sam's.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.520
Yeah, boy, that's gonna be an extremely local joke.

25:35.520 --> 25:38.080
Now there's Fantastic Sam's all over the fucking place.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.440
But do they do the hair machine there?

25:40.880 --> 25:44.960
They don't even do it at the Fantastic Sam's in Huntington.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.760
They realized they were losing a ton of money on toys

25:47.760 --> 25:50.240
and the hair was not covering the cost.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.800
I still wish I could figure out how the fuck they did this though.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.760
Just to explain it.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.880
And no, don't, don't explain it.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.080
Because if you don't know what I'm talking about,

25:58.080 --> 25:59.760
it's gonna sound fucking wild.

25:59.760 --> 26:00.400
It's gonna sound wild.

26:00.400 --> 26:05.360
There was a little, okay, it was a box.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.000
You can't pretend like you know how this shit works either.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.640
There was a box where the TV was.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.920
Right, and underneath that box, there was a flap, right?

26:15.680 --> 26:20.720
Some sort of, almost like a cat door into this machine.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.680
And then you open the machine and you throw your hair into it.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.840
You like scoop up some of your hair off the floor

26:25.840 --> 26:27.440
and you throw it into the machine.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.760
And then something happens.

26:29.760 --> 26:33.360
I don't, a wizard turns your hair into toys.

26:33.360 --> 26:37.040
And then all of a sudden, there's a toy there and no more hair.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.120
So don't piss that wizard off

26:39.120 --> 26:40.400
when he's just like walking down the street,

26:40.400 --> 26:41.680
like you bump shoulders and you're like,

26:41.680 --> 26:42.880
watch it, loser.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.000
And he's like, oh yeah?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.720
Your fucking hair is Starbursts now, asshole.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.200
Oh god damn it, not again.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.440
Oh no, hey bro, your hair is homies.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.800
Deal with it, idiot.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.720
Maybe think about that next time

26:54.720 --> 26:56.160
before you fuck with a hair lock.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.000
I don't know if that was,

26:58.000 --> 26:59.840
we'll probably get some good emails and tweets about that

26:59.840 --> 27:01.840
to let us know if that was just a,

27:01.840 --> 27:03.360
because they don't even do it there anymore.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.920
Also, Fantastic Sam's,

27:05.920 --> 27:08.160
this is something the women at Fantastic Sam's told me

27:08.720 --> 27:10.640
that I was not aware of,

27:11.200 --> 27:15.520
that all of the men and women

27:15.520 --> 27:18.480
that worked at Fantastic Sam's had to use,

27:20.320 --> 27:21.920
they couldn't use their own names.

27:21.920 --> 27:26.880
So we're saying, you're telling me that Sonny at Fantastic Sam's

27:26.880 --> 27:28.080
is not named Sonny?

27:28.080 --> 27:28.960
Wait a minute.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.080
Sonny works at Master Cuts.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.360
And also too, they don't do this anymore.

27:33.360 --> 27:39.840
But they used to not let people use their names.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.160
Why?

27:42.720 --> 27:43.680
Government.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.760
Because they wanted it to be like a chain,

27:45.760 --> 27:47.760
like a uniformity of experience.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.280
So like they wanted you to not,

27:49.280 --> 27:51.360
I mean that's like Dr. Fucking Who?

27:51.360 --> 27:54.240
It's like a mantle pass from person to person?

27:54.240 --> 27:54.720
Exactly.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.320
I'm Batman.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.200
Like what?

27:57.200 --> 27:59.040
What are you talking, how could that,

27:59.040 --> 28:02.240
what business, why would they do that?

28:02.240 --> 28:03.360
Nobody else does that.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.680
It's like you can't go to Taco Bell and be like,

28:05.680 --> 28:08.400
yo David, where's David at?

28:08.400 --> 28:09.840
Which one of you is David?

28:09.840 --> 28:11.440
Because there's one in every Taco Bell.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.360
Where's my Taco Bell Dave?

28:13.360 --> 28:14.880
Is there a Dave here?

28:14.880 --> 28:16.320
I also think though that it's like,

28:16.320 --> 28:21.040
it's the, like they didn't want you to go open up your own,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.760
like if you left Fantastic Sam's,

28:23.760 --> 28:25.120
you could not take your customers with you

28:25.120 --> 28:26.400
because they could never find you again.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.560
So like if you leaned in and you're like,

28:28.560 --> 28:30.320
my real name is Tom,

28:30.320 --> 28:31.920
like all the other people would turn around,

28:31.920 --> 28:33.360
sirens would drop from the ceiling,

28:33.360 --> 28:34.640
he'd be dragged away.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.280
Yes, right.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.000
And a different David would come out

28:38.000 --> 28:39.520
to finish cutting your hair.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.560
I've always been David,

28:40.560 --> 28:41.840
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.800
The sphere from the island would just like float over

28:44.800 --> 28:45.920
and just consume them?

28:45.920 --> 28:47.520
Nope, not crime.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.600
Well, it's sort of like on Flavor of Love,

28:51.600 --> 28:52.800
when the women would get evicted

28:52.800 --> 28:53.920
from the Flavor of Love house,

28:53.920 --> 28:55.440
they would lose their nicknames

28:55.440 --> 28:57.280
and they would get their real names back.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.560
Like they had to earn them.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.640
Like as soon as they were eliminated by Flav,

29:00.640 --> 29:03.680
they would no longer be like Stinkweave or whatever

29:03.680 --> 29:04.720
their fake name was.

29:04.720 --> 29:08.000
And they could be like Jillian again.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.440
Oh man, you've just pitched a wonderful dating reality show

29:11.440 --> 29:11.680
where it's all about them.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.200
Yeah, it's called Flavor of Love, Travis.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.200
No, no, no, imagine this where it's like

29:15.200 --> 29:17.200
the 20 women and they're all trying to compete

29:17.200 --> 29:19.040
to get kicked off so they can be free

29:19.040 --> 29:22.640
and earn their names back and like return to their lives.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.400
That is actually not too far.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.000
That's actually pretty close.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.760
Later seasons, especially.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.720
Let's go to the Money Zone

29:28.720 --> 29:31.520
so we don't have to kickstart this brave new

29:31.520 --> 29:32.960
vision for reality television.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.040
You need to know how to cook.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.160
It's really important and it's really fun.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.680
And I used to think that I had some vague idea

29:51.680 --> 29:52.960
and that was before Blue Apron.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.480
I've been using Blue Apron for almost,

29:55.040 --> 29:57.520
I would guess a year and a half, maybe two years almost.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.200
And it has taught me so much.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.200
I know it sounds like I'm getting choked up

30:03.200 --> 30:04.320
like it's the most moving thing,

30:04.320 --> 30:06.400
but really it's just my throat hurts.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.840
But for less than $10 a meal,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.600
Blue Apron delivers all the fresh ingredients

30:09.600 --> 30:11.680
you need to create home cooked meals.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.920
You just follow the easy step-by-step instructions.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.680
So even if you don't know how to cook,

30:17.200 --> 30:19.680
it's so easy with pictures and everything.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.560
What Justin said, no kidding.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.240
I love cooking Blue Apron.

30:24.240 --> 30:24.880
The meals are great.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.680
And no matter what your dietary preferences,

30:27.680 --> 30:29.760
they make it really easy to cook stuff.

30:31.200 --> 30:31.920
What's in it this week?

30:31.920 --> 30:32.720
Let me check.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.520
I got it right here.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.240
I got it right here.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.280
What are we cooking?

30:35.280 --> 30:37.920
Salmon with roasted Brussels sprouts and potato hash.

30:37.920 --> 30:38.960
Fuck yes.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.360
Now this is triple pork.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.280
It's probably like Mazabon or something,

30:43.280 --> 30:44.720
but it looks like Mazeman.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.520
So I'm going to go with triple pork Mazeman

30:47.520 --> 30:48.480
with garlic chives.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.120
I think that's actually just Guy Fieri's like medicine name.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.200
I'm triple pork Mazeman.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.560
Last week they had curry chicken over coconut grits.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.200
It was so awesome.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.480
But like Justin said,

31:02.480 --> 31:03.680
like the cooking that stuff is great

31:03.680 --> 31:06.880
and the meals are great and they're really,

31:07.520 --> 31:08.560
they're good for you.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.640
And they also have vegetarian and vegan options.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.240
But what Justin said is true.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.080
Like I, even when I cook stuff,

31:14.080 --> 31:15.600
not using the ingredients they send,

31:15.600 --> 31:17.120
like I am better at cooking.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.520
Like I understand the fundamentals of cooking

31:19.520 --> 31:20.800
way, way, way, way better

31:20.800 --> 31:22.480
because they teach you how to do it.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.120
It's awesome.

31:23.120 --> 31:23.680
It's so great.

31:24.960 --> 31:25.200
Yeah.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.760
So right now you can get your first two meals for free

31:27.760 --> 31:29.920
at blueapron.com slash my brother.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.200
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.920
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.760
I want to talk for a second about Squarespace.

31:38.880 --> 31:40.720
They're sponsoring the show this week

31:40.720 --> 31:45.520
and they are also the site at which I built mcroyshows.com.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.000
And I cannot stress enough that going into it,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.280
I knew basically nothing about website building.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.840
I don't know anything about coding.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.760
I don't know anything about the internet.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.360
I don't know how computers work.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.080
Travis thought that-

31:58.080 --> 31:59.200
I don't know what eyeballs do.

31:59.200 --> 32:02.320
Travis thought that your monitor was like digital paper

32:02.320 --> 32:04.400
and every time you went to a website,

32:04.400 --> 32:08.000
it printed it out somehow onto the monitor.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.480
Just bit by bit, piece by piece.

32:10.480 --> 32:14.480
But Squarespace is so user-friendly and intuitive

32:15.040 --> 32:18.000
that after about 45 seconds, I was like,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.040
oh, I get this.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.800
And I was able to create a website

32:20.800 --> 32:23.040
that people have just keep telling me

32:23.040 --> 32:26.320
looks very professional and is really easy to navigate.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.840
And it was so simple to do.

32:27.840 --> 32:32.320
It took me about an hour to make a website

32:32.320 --> 32:36.400
that I'm super proud of and does everything I needed to do.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.760
And I'm able to continually update as we add new stuff.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.680
And I think of new things to put on it.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.000
And it's so easy, you guys.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.200
I highly recommend it.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.120
You can start a free trial today.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.280
Just go to squarespace.com slash my brother

32:50.000 --> 32:54.640
and kick off your experimentation on the worldwide web

32:54.640 --> 32:58.000
because you should Squarespace.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.440
Roslyn Ricketts, the moment has come

33:01.440 --> 33:03.920
for us to pass a long message from Justin Sunset.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.360
You didn't want to read their nickname?

33:05.360 --> 33:07.840
You didn't want to give her a damn nickname?

33:07.840 --> 33:10.400
Roslyn, quote, monster Ricketts.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.240
Why would you read that?

33:12.240 --> 33:13.360
That's so good.

33:13.360 --> 33:14.560
It sounds like something that you get

33:14.560 --> 33:17.600
if you don't eat vitamin D for like a super duper long time.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.400
It's like after you get regular Ricketts,

33:20.400 --> 33:22.000
you get monster Ricketts.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.560
Roslyn Monster Ricketts, Justin Sunset has this to say.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.520
I hope you get this in time to say happy 29th birthday

33:27.520 --> 33:30.240
to the most amazing set of getaway sticks I've ever seen.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.760
And I really hope you're up to date on your podcast backlog.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.480
Otherwise, I'm at a heap of shit for not getting you a gift.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.800
Thanks for putting that pressure on us, Shesto.

33:38.800 --> 33:43.120
Well, don't worry because we didn't even come close to the date.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.320
This one's on us.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.960
Hey, Roslyn, I can't stress enough how great Justin thinks you are.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.800
And this is our fault.

33:50.800 --> 33:56.160
Well, this is on us, but I think we could actually put this on nobody

33:56.160 --> 33:59.360
because it says if she's behind her back, her catalog,

33:59.360 --> 34:01.600
she may not get to this until like fucking 2018.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.040
And then it doesn't matter.

34:03.040 --> 34:07.040
Right. The timeliness aspect has been lost entirely.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.000
And you know what?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.720
The thing is, is like well wishes and happy birthday.

34:10.720 --> 34:11.840
It's good for the whole year.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.160
Great point, Travis.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.560
Except not, it's extremely timely.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.040
Except not.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.080
We really, we blew it.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.280
We fucking blew it.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.000
Got another message here and this one's for Julia Boolya.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.280
And it's from Dad.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.360
Dad's, my, is this planned?

34:27.360 --> 34:31.120
No, this is just the universal like platonic idea of dad.

34:31.120 --> 34:35.680
Oh, God. Okay. Dad says to Julia Boolya,

34:35.680 --> 34:36.640
don't get me wrong.

34:36.640 --> 34:39.840
I love my new job with Alcatraz Cell house tours,

34:39.840 --> 34:44.080
but I'm so bummed that I had to cancel my trip to the LA podcast fest.

34:44.080 --> 34:47.280
I'm glad you were able to use your ticket and see the brothers McElroy.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.720
Thanks for texting the photo.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.480
Why was Justin laughing so hard?

34:50.480 --> 34:51.600
Love, Dad.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.640
We'll never know.

34:52.640 --> 35:00.720
Well, probably because Justin had him some crevasse and he drank it down smooth.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.600
There was a little bit of mixology happening there,

35:03.600 --> 35:05.440
but not as much as you maybe would have liked.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.760
And yeah.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.520
Depending on when you caught me at the LA podcast festival,

35:11.520 --> 35:15.600
like I don't think I did a lot, did I?

35:15.600 --> 35:16.480
Did I drink a lot?

35:18.080 --> 35:18.560
It was just-

35:18.560 --> 35:19.280
Would you say?

35:19.280 --> 35:21.040
You, no, you were just stiff Bevin.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.160
Okay.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.320
I don't think you drink a lot,

35:24.320 --> 35:26.800
but if I were to give you like a nickname for the day,

35:26.800 --> 35:28.400
it would be Stiff Bevins.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.680
Stiff Bevins.

35:29.680 --> 35:34.560
I do want to say Julia taking pictures during the show was illegal,

35:34.560 --> 35:37.760
so someone should be along shortly to confiscate that

35:37.760 --> 35:40.720
and maybe take you in for some time.

35:40.720 --> 35:41.600
Don't worry about it.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.720
Thank you for your support.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.240
Hi, my name is Stiff Bevins.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.240
If you need a phone confiscated,

35:46.240 --> 35:48.160
there's only one name to turn to.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.720
Look it up in the yellow pages.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.400
Or you can find me at Bob Evans.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.040
Stiff Bevins Bob Evans.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.160
It's a franchise spin-off.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.760
Not that those exist.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.560
You like steak?

36:01.520 --> 36:02.160
Don't have it.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.880
Got mashed potatoes.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.520
I'll shape them into anything.

36:07.520 --> 36:09.600
I'll make them into the shape of Robert Evans.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.200
Come have the Robert Evans mashed potatoes

36:13.200 --> 36:15.520
at Stiff Bevins' Bob Evans.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.760
Oh, Justin's broken.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.400
Let's be honest.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.600
We live in a world with too much media.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.040
You need a podcast on the front lines figuring out what's great.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.080
We're here for you.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.040
We're Pop Rocket.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.160
I am Guy Branum.

36:26.160 --> 36:27.360
I'm a comedian.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.160
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.000
I call myself a digital strategist.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.960
I'm Oliver Wang, academic and disc junkie.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.200
Margaret Wappler, je suis as journalist.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.000

Find us in iTunes or wherever you download podcasts.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.040
Pop Rocket, every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.080
I got another Yahoo here from Zoe Kinski.

36:54.080 --> 36:54.800
Yahoo.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.760
It's by Yahoo Answers.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.040
Yahoo's going out of business, isn't it?

37:00.000 --> 37:03.840
Are you worried this is going to be a nonrenewable resource?

37:03.840 --> 37:06.880
Do we need to do a GoFundMe to buy Yahoo Answers?

37:06.880 --> 37:08.960
I don't think, I think we could probably save Yahoo

37:08.960 --> 37:11.680
if we just give them that sound clip of you saying Yahoo

37:11.680 --> 37:14.480
at the beginning of the answer and then they can use it like the new,

37:14.480 --> 37:17.840
you know how they used to do Yahoo, everyone hated that.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.560
But if we do it, can you just break it off again for me?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.340
Yahoo.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.280
No, it wasn't as good the second time.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.480
It's from Yahoo Answers user, something's gone wrong.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.400
We will call them, Stiff Bevans asks,

37:34.160 --> 37:37.280
can you cook and eat the beans from a beanbag chair?

37:37.280 --> 37:42.560
From a beanbag chair?

37:44.640 --> 37:46.320
Let me hit you guys with this idea.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.240
I pause it.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.400
When you cook a meat, you're not supposed to eat that meat raw.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.680
Don't do that, you'll get very sick.

37:53.680 --> 37:54.960
There's toxins in there.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.760
If you cook it enough though, you can make anything,

37:57.760 --> 37:59.760
you can cook the toxins right out of anything.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.920
They used to eat their shoes in the Civil War.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.040
Revolutionary War?

38:03.040 --> 38:04.160
Probably both.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.440
Probably, I think most wars,

38:05.440 --> 38:07.760
probably somebody's gotten down on some shoe eating.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.040
Times are tight in the trenches.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.240
Can you cook and eat the beans from a beanbag chair?

38:12.240 --> 38:15.360
I think if you blast them for long enough.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.600
You know, the problem is, Kevin,

38:17.600 --> 38:18.960
they're so worried about if they could,

38:18.960 --> 38:20.560
they didn't stop to think about if they should.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.320
I mean, they shouldn't.

38:22.320 --> 38:22.800
No, Travis.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.760
Because then what do you know?

38:23.760 --> 38:28.320
But then when you sit on, you've cost yourself a chair.

38:30.080 --> 38:33.360
Well, I don't think you need to take all of the-

38:33.360 --> 38:35.520
Yeah, how many servings are in a beanbag chair?

38:35.520 --> 38:38.320
Yeah, that's how they measure beanbag chairs is by servings.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.880
I think that would be a big robust meal

38:40.880 --> 38:44.000
if you tried to party down on a whole bag chair.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.360
A sumo could feed a family for like a year.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.760
I mean, it's all polystyrene.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.280
I don't think you should eat that.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.360
Is that like a saying?

38:55.360 --> 38:58.480
It's all polystyrene to me, or what are you saying?

38:58.480 --> 39:01.120
No, I mean, it's like, they're filled with polystyrene.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.320
You probably shouldn't eat that.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.360
Are you a scientist?

39:04.160 --> 39:05.120
No, I'm not like a scientist.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.560
Are you a nutritionist?

39:06.560 --> 39:07.120
No, I'm not.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.480
Are you a beanbagologist?

39:08.480 --> 39:09.040
Yeah, really.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.400
Okay.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.760
Are you a fucking professional chef?

39:13.040 --> 39:15.840
I want to, you guys want to hear a hilarious joke?

39:15.840 --> 39:17.360
Kind of observational humor?

39:17.360 --> 39:17.680
Yeah.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.560
I was looking into, recently I had reason to look into

39:22.560 --> 39:24.960
what beanbag filling is made out of.

39:24.960 --> 39:31.840
And I found a listing for beanbag filling

39:33.360 --> 39:35.520
that you could use to refill a beanbag chair.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.000
But the thing about this beanbag filling is,

39:39.200 --> 39:40.560
it comes in a bag.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.200
So it's kind of like, let's cut out the middleman.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.240
That's a really good little witty.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.840
Kind of like a witty.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.600
It's kind of like a little fucking slice of life.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.160
Who's doing this?

39:54.160 --> 39:56.480
Who's doing fucking beanbag rehab?

39:57.040 --> 39:59.280
This episode of This Old Bag.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.320
Next on Antiques Roadshow,

40:02.320 --> 40:05.040
this beanbag is from the 18th century.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.320
This is my pop pops bag.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.920
A lot of stink memories in here.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.520
This would have been worth upwards of $15,000

40:11.520 --> 40:12.960
if you hadn't refilled it.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.200
I don't think you guys got it.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.240
So I'm going to try again.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.800
Could you do it in more of a stand up voice, please?

40:18.800 --> 40:19.680
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.040
Do it more presentationally.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.880
I think your energy was too low key.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.760
Okay, can one of you guys intro me in?

40:27.760 --> 40:29.120
Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.600
Oh, sorry, you do it, Travis, you volunteer.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.100
Okay.

40:32.480 --> 40:35.600
Coming up next on our stage, Justin McElroy.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.200
Give it up.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.400
Give it up for our man.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.520
Give it up.

40:47.040 --> 40:47.600
God, guys, wow.

40:47.600 --> 40:48.960
Tell some fucking jokes.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.800
This guy, hey, get this guy another drink.

40:53.680 --> 40:54.880
Okay, listen.

40:56.080 --> 40:56.640
Wow.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.760
God, you know, as everybody.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.520
Come on, do it.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.800
Holidays are coming up.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.680
We're warmed up.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.560
Just go for it.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.960
Holidays are coming up soon.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.960
And man, how you guys doing out there?

41:10.960 --> 41:11.680
We're doing good.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.760
Who invited young Philip Seymour Hoffman to this, right guys?

41:16.480 --> 41:17.360
Hey, be nice.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.040
He's doing his best.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.400
He's trying his hardest up there.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.280
Be nice.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.880
Yeah, so, bro.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.000
We believe in you.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.600
Don't listen to that guy.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.480
Look at this guy over here in the front row.

41:28.480 --> 41:32.880
He's like, can't wait for the jokes to start, right?

41:32.880 --> 41:34.720
Yeah, good observation.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.600
I'm just trying to have a nice night out with my wife.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.840
Yeah, what's your name, sir?

41:40.880 --> 41:41.760
Gregory.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.240
Hey, Gregory, you ever get into bean bags?

41:44.240 --> 41:45.040
No, I'm not.

41:45.040 --> 41:52.320
I'm a 41-year-old orthodontist, so I just have regular chairs.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.520
Who's this hot piece of ass you got with you?

41:55.520 --> 41:56.880
My name's Charlene.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.240
Hey, Charlene, what's up?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.200
She's my stepmom.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.640
Can we go?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.240
Can we get up and leave?

42:02.240 --> 42:04.240
Stepmom's so choice, dude.

42:04.240 --> 42:04.740
Thank you.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.560
Thank you so much.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.360
I'm flattered.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.120
What were you saying about bean bags?

42:11.120 --> 42:12.240
I love bean bags.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.240
Yeah, Charlene, I'd like to take you to a bean bag.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.360
Dude, you're so-

42:15.360 --> 42:16.720
Oh, that's so nice of you.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.440
Gregory, your stepmom's fucking juicy, dude.

42:19.440 --> 42:20.320
I love it.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.040
Thank you.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.080
Thank you so much.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.400
You know, it's nice.

42:24.400 --> 42:24.960
It's nice.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.880
I don't want to be told that all the time,

42:26.880 --> 42:29.200
but by a nice young man like this, I appreciate it.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.320
Yeah, let's kill you.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.800
No, you fucking got me with that, man, man.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.840
You really got me with that one.

42:33.840 --> 42:34.560
You really impressed me.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.960
Let's get another G&T over here for Charlene.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.600
Charlene, what's up?

42:37.600 --> 42:38.160
Thank you.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.960
You into bean bags?

42:40.960 --> 42:41.760
I am.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.480
Thank you for asking.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.440
Cool, cool, cool.

42:43.440 --> 42:49.120
Listen, I was shopping for like a bean bag.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.560
I do a podcast with my brothers,

42:50.560 --> 42:54.000
and we had a question about bean bag, the stuff in bean bags.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.920
So I was looking up bean bag refills.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.040
We've all been there.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.560
Yeah, I figured out what's in them.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.720
And I'm sorry, you're just fucking so hot.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.600
I'm like, thank you.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.600
I am feeling this.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.520
We are vibing.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.160
This is real.

43:07.040 --> 43:12.160
Yeah, so like, they had a bean bag filling refill on there.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.720
And but the thing is, it came in a bag.

43:14.720 --> 43:18.080
And I'm like, can we just cut out the middle man?

43:23.680 --> 43:25.440
Hey, this guy's choking over here.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.920
No, that's just my laugh.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.920
Oh, I've pissed myself.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.400
Hey, this guy pissed himself, everybody.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.360
That's hilarious.

43:34.720 --> 43:35.680
That's my fetish.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.400
Thank you.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.040
Look at this guy.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.040
He looks like Vanilla Ice's uncle.

43:39.040 --> 43:39.600
Yes.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.040
Yeah, embarrass me.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.880
It's all this is a fetish meeting for the public embarrassment.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.840
I think I think I'm just gonna go.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.920
I don't care for bean bag based humor.

43:49.920 --> 43:50.720
You're my ride.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.520
So here's my here's my hotel key.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.280
I'm staying at Dave's house.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.120
Well, that's weird.

43:57.120 --> 43:57.680
That's Dave.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.040
Install hotel locks like on his personal residence or

44:05.040 --> 44:05.920
now he's just cool.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.680
Wait, which Dave?

44:07.680 --> 44:08.960
I don't know where Dave.

44:08.960 --> 44:09.440
You know what?

44:09.440 --> 44:10.240
It doesn't matter.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.280
I'm just gonna go home.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.920
I got a long day at the office tomorrow.

44:13.920 --> 44:14.880
I'm the president.

44:14.880 --> 44:16.240
Oh, congratulations.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.600
Thank you so much.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.480
Thank you.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.320
What if I'm the fourth woman president?

44:21.920 --> 44:23.680
Okay, well, I'm going to have a Terry.

44:23.680 --> 44:23.920
Yeah.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.040
Guys, guys.

44:29.040 --> 44:29.920
Great skit.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.440
Thanks.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.960
And scene.

44:32.960 --> 44:38.400
This has been our summer camp skit bug for you're the best.

44:38.400 --> 44:39.760
Thank you for everything.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.080
Here's another question.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.240
I live in a two unit apartment building.

44:44.240 --> 44:48.160
My neighbor recently knocked on my door because he had been locked out of his apartment.

44:48.160 --> 44:52.480
I thought he wanted a place to hang, but he said my set of keys work on his door.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.840
But not to worry because his keys don't work on my door.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.960
Does that mean he's been trying to get into my apartment?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.800
Does this give me the right to casually check out his place?

45:03.440 --> 45:07.760
I was able to let him into his place as his apartment key is the same building

45:07.760 --> 45:11.600
as the building, same as the building's front door.

45:12.960 --> 45:13.280
What?

45:14.000 --> 45:14.480
Hold on.

45:15.200 --> 45:15.440
Okay.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.400
So you're in an apartment building.

45:16.400 --> 45:17.840
Your neighbor knocked on the door because he had been locked out of his apartment.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.480
I thought he wanted a place to hang, but he said my set of keys work on his door.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.400
Not to worry because his keys don't work on my door.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.040
Does that mean he's been trying to get into my apartment?

45:25.040 --> 45:25.680
Yes.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.920
Does that mean he can just casually check out his place?

45:27.920 --> 45:29.680
I was able to let him into his place as his apartment.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.920
No, no, you can't go into somebody's house.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.840
You can't go into someone's home.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.920
That's not even the colonel that I locked.

45:35.920 --> 45:42.000
This gentleman knowingly like lives in an apartment that apparently anyone in this

45:42.000 --> 45:46.320
building can go into and he's just accepted that as fact.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.480
No, it's a prisoner's dilemma thing going on here, okay?

45:50.480 --> 45:52.800
There's only two of them in the building.

45:53.360 --> 45:59.520
There is a key that works on the front door of the building and that key is the same lock

45:59.520 --> 46:03.280
configuration as this dude's apartment, right?

46:03.280 --> 46:06.880
So, but he says that his key doesn't work on your door.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.840
I would like to see that in action.

46:09.840 --> 46:10.400
No, that can happen.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.920
I would like to see him.

46:11.920 --> 46:12.560
No, okay.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.000
No, I hear what you're saying, Justin.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.520
You want to watch him try his keys.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.480
Yeah, I want to try your key in my door, dude.

46:18.480 --> 46:25.280
Because like I'm just going to take your word for it of a dirty like a dirty boy that loves

46:25.280 --> 46:29.040
people that just like catch him in the act 24-7 because that's the only reason I can

46:29.040 --> 46:30.800
think that he hasn't like made a huge mistake.

46:30.800 --> 46:34.640
Because he knows about this like this has clearly happened before that he's like,

46:34.640 --> 46:40.000
hey, this is a fact that I know and haven't complained to like the owners about.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.240
But like you could go into my apartment anytime if you want whenever you want.

46:44.240 --> 46:44.720
If you wanted to.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.720
Sometime around 530 on Wednesday.

46:46.720 --> 46:51.120
Or maybe I'll get a light installed in your place and I'll have a switch for that light

46:51.120 --> 46:55.840
in my place and I'll flip it and that just means come on by if you want to see some dirty stuff.

46:55.840 --> 46:59.920
Hey, if you want to see some grown folks activities, maybe wait for that light to come on

46:59.920 --> 47:02.560
and then you'll know that things are off and pop.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.400
Do you like grown folks stuff?

47:04.400 --> 47:06.480
Hey, do you like grown folks activities?

47:07.520 --> 47:11.120
Do you like do you like scoping them on the free and on the sly?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.440
Well, I got a deal for you.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.440
Have I got a life for you?

47:15.440 --> 47:16.080
Look at it.

47:16.080 --> 47:16.800
Come please.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.240
I'm journey you get to please.

47:19.680 --> 47:23.040
I OK, this is very OK.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.160
Here's the weirdest part about this.

47:26.160 --> 47:34.000
OK, this guy knows in his heart that you could like completely devastate his whole scene

47:34.000 --> 47:36.160
whenever you wanted to, because you have the key to his place, right?

47:36.160 --> 47:36.880
What is this?

47:36.880 --> 47:38.400
OK, hold on.

47:38.400 --> 47:43.840
What is this fucking world that you are living in where life is just like a fucking online

47:43.840 --> 47:49.760
survival combat video game where you just like when somebody logs off you go grief their shit?

47:49.760 --> 47:54.480
Do you not pay any fucking attention to the news where people just like kill each other

47:54.480 --> 47:56.160
off hand all the time?

47:56.160 --> 47:59.600
Like this is your downstairs neighbor plays music too loud.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.840
You could walk in and smother him with a pillow.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.200
And it's like legal now.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.400
Like that's the worst part.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.840
It's not even breaking and entering.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.440
It's just entering at this point.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.000
Just as I suggested murder, he's suggesting you're outside.

48:12.000 --> 48:12.800
You're mowing the lawn.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.800
You see them walk out with a suitcase like, yeah, I'm going to visit my float, my Florida

48:16.800 --> 48:18.960
and parents are like, oh, cool.

48:18.960 --> 48:19.840
Well, have a good trip.

48:19.840 --> 48:27.120
No, but like if you don't assume that that's a thing, then why do we have locks in the

48:27.120 --> 48:28.240
door in the first place?

48:28.240 --> 48:32.480
Like if you if you're like if you want to work on the honor system, that's fine.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.640
Like I'm going to go ahead and keep the lock on the door.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.800
That seems the base level.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.520
It doesn't matter.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.200
Why does OK.

48:40.640 --> 48:45.120
Why is this guy so cavalier about revealing this information to you, right?

48:45.120 --> 48:46.880
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

48:46.880 --> 48:51.520
Like why do you want to let somebody like without any knowledge of you really to let

48:51.520 --> 48:54.720
you know that you could just walk into their place whenever you wanted to?

48:55.280 --> 48:57.040
How did very suspicious to me.

48:57.040 --> 49:00.240
How did downstairs Pete figure this out in the first place?

49:00.240 --> 49:04.480
Like the first time he locked himself out of his apartment, his solution was, I know

49:04.480 --> 49:06.400
I'll try the other guy's keys.

49:06.400 --> 49:07.360
Oh, it works.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.400
Like that's never a thing I would think of doing.

49:10.400 --> 49:15.200
Yeah, seeing if the other person in the building can unlock my door at this point.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.360
But he doesn't just.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.400
He knows it.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.120
How does he know?

49:21.760 --> 49:28.480
Well, fucking he's got peer reviewed, hands on proof.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.400
Tried to scope your place out.

49:32.400 --> 49:36.080
And I think if the if we're going to tear down the walls this much, you may as well

49:36.080 --> 49:40.720
like install a window in the dividing wall of your duplex that you could just like check

49:40.720 --> 49:42.080
in on Jerry every morning.

49:42.080 --> 49:45.440
It's not good and it's not right.

49:45.440 --> 49:46.800
Are you guys moving?

49:46.800 --> 49:48.480
You guys are basically moving in together.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.040
Why don't we get rid of the pretense, right?

49:51.040 --> 49:52.160
Why don't we take that wall?

49:52.160 --> 49:53.840
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

49:53.840 --> 49:56.640
I want to let's get the property bros in here.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.400
Take that wall out.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.760
Put a nice I beam up there.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.120
Oh, that's I love that.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.440
Maybe some like exposed timbers.

50:03.440 --> 50:04.240
Rustic.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.600
Oh, I love that.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.480
Oh, you know what you do?

50:06.480 --> 50:07.440
You knock down that wall.

50:07.440 --> 50:09.200
You put in a two sided fireplace.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.600
Oh, I love it.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.160
Yeah, right?

50:12.160 --> 50:12.640
That's great.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.480
It's going to increase the value of your home.

50:14.480 --> 50:18.560
Open the whole thing up a lot more to increase the sidelines when you're jerking it.

50:18.560 --> 50:22.240
Yeah, it really turns the whole like jerking it thing around.

50:23.280 --> 50:23.520
Yeah.

50:24.560 --> 50:26.800
Maybe just put in a special jerking room.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.520
Yeah, why not?

50:27.520 --> 50:28.000
Why not?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.720
If we're going crazy, why not?

50:30.720 --> 50:32.480
That's that bumps up that Zillow.

50:32.480 --> 50:35.920
Well, but then you run into it's like, hey, we we ran into a problem.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.840
There ended up being a pipe in this wall.

50:37.840 --> 50:38.800
We had to cut that.

50:38.800 --> 50:41.440
We had to turn the jerking room into a jerking closet.

50:41.440 --> 50:41.840
Don't worry.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.120
We put a porthole in the door.

50:43.760 --> 50:47.600
It's a three bed, two bath, half bait.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.640
Hey, that's not what we were looking for, but all right.

50:52.640 --> 50:53.520
We'll make do.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.200
I want to read a Yahoo, can I?

50:55.200 --> 50:55.840
Please.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.280
How about this one from Morgan Davey?

50:57.280 --> 50:57.840
Thank you, Morgan.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

50:59.440 --> 51:07.040
Lag seeing who says, what did teens do in medieval times or back in ancient times?

51:07.040 --> 51:10.800
Were they having fun like nowadays or had more responsibilities?

51:10.800 --> 51:12.240
Were they having fun?

51:12.240 --> 51:14.880
Just some some hip cool dudes.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.760
Snapchat me on the children's crusade, bro.

51:17.760 --> 51:18.160
Come on.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.600
Took my dad's horse going hog wild tonight.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.280
Yeah, my sister fell into the thresher.

51:25.280 --> 51:26.720
Hashtag realness.

51:30.960 --> 51:34.640
Oh man, hurt my arm real bad while casting some silver.

51:34.640 --> 51:38.080
Hashtag type that with my silver arm.

51:38.080 --> 51:39.920
My woman crushed Wednesday's Queen Victoria.

51:39.920 --> 51:40.800
What's up, boo?

51:40.800 --> 51:41.600
WCW.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.440
Well, here's the thing.

51:43.440 --> 51:47.040
Back in medieval times, life expectancy was like 25.

51:47.680 --> 51:54.000
So the translation of this was that what is now teens for us was like seven year olds back then.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.440
It all scaled back.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.080
Yeah, true.

51:56.640 --> 51:57.920
Seven year old teens.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.280
How were they getting wild?

51:59.280 --> 51:59.920
What were they?

51:59.920 --> 52:02.000
I guess they called them sevens or whatever.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.200
Yeah, the sevens.

52:04.320 --> 52:08.960
Yeah, like he's just going through those awkward halfway through

52:08.960 --> 52:13.600
to three quarters of the way through his eighth year of life.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.440
It's just that awkward transition period.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.880
But the thing is, how did you rebel?

52:16.880 --> 52:17.760
Drinking beer?

52:17.760 --> 52:18.640
Everyone did that.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.680
Smoking tobacco?

52:19.680 --> 52:20.080
Everybody did that.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.920
Everyone was wheezing.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.000
Everyone was getting wacky on backy.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.760
That's a good point, Travis.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.440
Like it was not a thing back then.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.280
Kids could get fucked up.

52:29.280 --> 52:29.760
And they were about all the-

52:29.760 --> 52:32.960
What, you rebelled by not going to school along with everyone else?

52:32.960 --> 52:33.840
Along with everyone else.

52:33.840 --> 52:34.400
I can't read.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.280
I can't read either.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.320
Cool, let's get fucked up.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.120
I'm the king.

52:37.120 --> 52:37.920
I can't read.

52:37.920 --> 52:38.480
Okay.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.200
Okay, cool.

52:39.200 --> 52:39.920
I'm a peasant.

52:39.920 --> 52:40.640
I can't read.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.200
Great.

52:41.200 --> 52:41.700
Yeah.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.440
But what we can do is party.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.920
Probably the only way you could rebel is becoming a jester.

52:49.280 --> 52:50.720
Oh, you hate to see that.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.800
What could bring more shame to your family?

52:52.800 --> 52:57.520
First off, you learned to juggle heartbreaking to any parents.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.080
Yeah.

52:58.080 --> 53:02.800
Then you're locked in as a professional silly person at the castle,

53:02.800 --> 53:05.040
and the king only needs you when he's in a bad mood.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.320
That's a fucking bummer.

53:06.320 --> 53:07.600
How's your work environment?

53:07.600 --> 53:08.400
Pretty high stakes.

53:08.400 --> 53:08.880
Yeah, pretty much high stakes all the time.

53:08.880 --> 53:12.400
I only have one coworker, and it's really more of an audience member,

53:12.400 --> 53:15.280
and I only see him when he's completely been out of shape.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.760
And if I do a bad job, I die.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.760
Yeah, but think about it this way though.

53:19.760 --> 53:23.360
When that jester's off the clock, and he goes and he's chilling with his other sevens,

53:24.080 --> 53:26.080
and that party gets lit.

53:26.080 --> 53:26.720
Are you kidding me?

53:26.720 --> 53:27.120
That is true.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.480
There ain't no party like a jester party.

53:28.480 --> 53:29.200
Oh, fuck yeah.

53:29.200 --> 53:31.280
It's the only entertaining person.

53:31.280 --> 53:31.920
He's here.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.040
Fuck yes.

53:33.040 --> 53:33.680
We're drunk.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.240
We're ready.

53:34.240 --> 53:35.680
We're fucking ready to roll, dude.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.080
I know I don't want you to have to work when you're off the clock,

53:38.080 --> 53:41.520
but if you could turn this shit up because you're literally the only funny person.

53:41.520 --> 53:44.000
Juggle, juggle, juggle.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.040
Well, I don't know.

53:45.040 --> 53:48.480
If everybody, I wasn't gonna, but if everybody wants you to.

53:48.480 --> 53:49.360
This is crazy.

53:49.360 --> 53:53.120
Both me and Mike, both our sisters fell in the thresher today,

53:53.120 --> 53:54.480
and we could use a laugh.

53:55.760 --> 53:57.520
Can you turn this shit up, please?

54:01.680 --> 54:02.400
All right.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.320
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.640
Yeah, I've never seen either like this in my life.

54:06.640 --> 54:09.680
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

54:09.680 --> 54:14.640
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

54:14.640 --> 54:17.040
Man, Melissa would love this.

54:18.640 --> 54:22.480
This fucking crazy motherfucker is talking to a face on a stick.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.640
I love this shit.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.080
I'm losing my, I'm fucking losing my mind.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.600
I'm losing it with this guy.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.000
Is that rouge on your cheeks?

54:32.000 --> 54:32.480
Fuck that.

54:32.480 --> 54:40.640
Jingle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle, jangle.

54:40.640 --> 54:43.120
I'm gonna die literally months before my time.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.480
I'm 14.

54:46.480 --> 54:46.720
Fuck.

54:46.720 --> 54:48.560
Who invited old man Steven here?

54:48.560 --> 54:50.560
I miss Rebecca so much.

54:50.560 --> 54:53.840
And then they would just shit on the floor right there because nobody gave a fuck.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.040
Well, that was a joke.

54:55.040 --> 54:58.000
That was the first time anyone had ever shat right there on the floor.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.400
Somebody shit right there on the floor and be like, that's pretty funny too.

55:00.400 --> 55:04.240
Can you imagine how fucking easy it would be to tell a joke back then?

55:04.240 --> 55:06.080
Like, nobody fucking heard jokes.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.160
You could just be like, what's the deal with pigs?

55:08.160 --> 55:08.800
They smell.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.600
Ah, ha, ha.

55:09.600 --> 55:13.920
You guys ever notice how like the beanbag filling comes in a bag, cut out the middleman.

55:13.920 --> 55:16.640
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

55:16.640 --> 55:19.600
You could just shit on the floor and be like, jackass won.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.680
I invented it coming in 2000 years.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.200
Catch the fever.

55:25.840 --> 55:29.920
Man, I wish, man, I was just, I was born in the wrong time.

55:29.920 --> 55:34.640
I know people only live until like 30 and like everyone was getting ate up by witches

55:34.640 --> 55:35.680
in the forest.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.440
But man, that would have been good times.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.520
It's so fucking easy to be an entertainer.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.320
Oh, I know.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.760
This podcast, we got to churn out hours of content every week.

55:46.960 --> 55:50.320
Back then, like one joke and it would spread throughout the land.

55:50.320 --> 55:55.280
You could just walk to a different town and be like, hey, in my last town, I was the fucking

55:55.280 --> 55:57.200
funniest fool there and everyone loved me.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.880
And everybody would be like, I believe it.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.000
We don't have the internet.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.320
I can't check TMZ to see how much everyone hated you in your last town.

56:04.320 --> 56:07.120
Yeah, I don't know if you stole these jokes off Instagram or not.

56:07.760 --> 56:09.280
Yeah, because I can't check it.

56:09.280 --> 56:10.480
We don't have electricity.

56:11.440 --> 56:14.880
But if we did, we could check Instagram for sure.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.320
And bust your ass.

56:19.200 --> 56:22.560
Be careful though, because if you get up there and you're like, hey guys, beanbag refill

56:22.560 --> 56:24.560
comes in a bag anyway, it's cut out the middleman.

56:24.560 --> 56:25.680
They might be like, witch!

56:25.680 --> 56:27.680
You!

56:27.680 --> 56:31.040
He's tickled my innards with his devilry.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.280
It's a perfectly observed joke.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.880
No human man could be this funny.

56:36.880 --> 56:41.920
But I have had this thought many times in my daily slice of life day.

56:41.920 --> 56:42.160
Me too.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.400
Goody McElroy consorts with the devil.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.680
He's done his consorting and he's read our thoughts.

56:47.680 --> 56:54.240
I saw him change into a wolf at midnight, run through the beanbags, observing their humor.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.760
Did you hear his pacing?

56:55.760 --> 57:00.080
It was, I thought he was going to say one thing and he said a completely different one.

57:00.080 --> 57:03.600
Did thou witness his crowd work with Goody Charlene?

57:06.080 --> 57:08.960
This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother, me.

57:08.960 --> 57:09.920
It's very dumb.

57:09.920 --> 57:13.040
We got a Bunker Buddies live show coming up April 2nd.

And we're doing that alongside spilled milk.

57:27.680 --> 57:28.720

57:28.720 --> 57:29.680

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.160
Yep.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.440
Sitting by Yahoo answers.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.960
No, it wasn't, I mean Zoe Kinski, I guess, is technically a Yahoo answers user.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.720

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.560
But he's just McElroy.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.000

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.800
Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.080
And I'm Riley Smyrl.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.280
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering, a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.720
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics that kids have on their minds today.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.480
Hot teen topics?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:27.200
Well, you know, the questions that are plaguing teenagers through their tumultuous growing years.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.680
Questions like, how do I party?

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.560
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.200
The same questions that people like Sydney had during their years as teenagers.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.520
Many, many, many.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.480
Okay, not that many.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.320
So, so long ago.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.920
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:50.240
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or Maximumfun.org for new episodes every Tuesday.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.280
Still Buffering.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.320
I am a teenager.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:02.880
And I was too.
