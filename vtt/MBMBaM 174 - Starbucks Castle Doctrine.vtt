00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:50.080
The weather outside is frightful. Merry Christmas, everyone. It's 81 degrees outside

00:50.080 --> 00:55.920
of my house right now. It's 81 degrees. It's gonna be a warm Christmas at the McElroy household.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.840
By that, I mean Griffin McElroy. I guess that's kind of frightful when you think about, like,

00:59.840 --> 01:04.960
the earth and the fate of the world and its peoples. Christmas time has sprung because

01:04.960 --> 01:14.240
Halloween's over, so we're full-blown Christmas season. I got my Scrooged graphic t-shirt on,

01:14.240 --> 01:21.280
which I wear every holiday season. I have a frosty mug of cocoa, hot cocoa. I actually

01:21.280 --> 01:27.840
literally just drank some hot cocoa. Well, hey, kids, I'm Tom Turkey. Let me teach y'all a little

01:27.840 --> 01:33.920
lesson about why Thanksgiving deserves a chance. Tom Turkey, you had your fucking time in late

01:33.920 --> 01:40.320
August and you fucking blew it because you slept through it. I was on vacation. Yeah, I know you

01:40.320 --> 01:47.920
were, but you- I'm full tryptophan. What we should do is we should start celebrating American

01:47.920 --> 01:53.760
Thanksgiving during Canadian Thanksgiving, which is in October, pre-Halloween, and just get it out

01:53.760 --> 01:59.440
of the way. Listen, okay, straight up, though, it's an arbitrary day anyways for Thanksgiving.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.760
Like, it changes every year and it's just- does it really matter? Why not just make it, like,

02:04.320 --> 02:08.400
23rd- I don't know, March? No, no, I mean, we should- we should settle on a fucking date on

02:08.400 --> 02:14.000
this fucking thing because it's- It's September 17th. No, it's the 23rd. The 23rd, I feel like,

02:14.000 --> 02:19.040
is a good average Thanksgiving day, and it's not like when the Pilgrims and the Native Americans

02:19.040 --> 02:26.160
had their first sit-down, their first collabo. It's not like that shit happened on, like,

02:26.160 --> 02:30.640
a set Thursday. It was a day, you know what I mean? It was the 23rd, I think.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.920
It's not like the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ happened December 25th at 6.38 p.m.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.920
Yeah, it would be like if we celebrate Christmas, like, when was Jesus born? I don't know,

02:39.920 --> 02:44.480
Tuesday? The third Tuesday, maybe? I don't know, it seems about right. It seemed like a Tuesday-

02:44.480 --> 02:49.520
It had a Tuesday vibe in the Bible. Historians have a hard time pinning down- nope, 25th,

02:49.520 --> 02:55.360
says so. Ecclesiastes 22- Here's the problem, though, is that if we- if we don't do the- the

02:55.360 --> 03:01.600
Thanksgiving on, like, a floating day, one- one year, it'll just be, like, a big Saturday lunch.

03:02.320 --> 03:07.200
Like, there will be nothing special about it except, oh, we had three more sides than normal.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.760
Oh, maybe- maybe for you, Edatron. Yes, that would be your robot name.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.080
Oh, okay. Because you eat so much all the time?

03:14.720 --> 03:19.360
Right. I'm not saying you're fat, but you do eat a lot of- you consume a lot of content.

03:19.360 --> 03:24.240
Well, I- I want other people to not have it. Fair enough. This isn't My Brother, My Brother,

03:24.240 --> 03:28.080
Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. You wouldn't know it from our intro, but it is a

03:28.080 --> 03:34.640
comedy program, and we're gonna be serving up fresh laughs to you just as soon as we find our rhythm.

03:34.640 --> 03:41.360
It's been a while since we've made a live- an actual program, I'd say about three weeks or so,

03:41.360 --> 03:43.760
since we've made an actual- We've been busy.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.520
Well, you've been busy.

03:45.520 --> 03:50.000
That's not an excuse. To the people at home, we're just- we're just voices that come into

03:50.000 --> 03:53.920
their ears. Like, we're not human beings. They don't have time for marriages and,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.800
um, other big important life events.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.000
They don't want to see us, you know, wiping off the grease paint,

04:00.800 --> 04:01.840
returning- Exactly.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.440
Returning back to our lives. We don't have any stage door Johnnies

04:05.440 --> 04:09.040
there waiting for a glimpse of us as we slip out the back of the podcasting theater.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.600
As soon as we- we pronounce that kiss your dad's ground on the lips, we die for a week.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.800
We die in their minds.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.240
We have no lives and certainly don't have weddings.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.400
Or murder mysteries.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.280
But that's okay. We're here in your ears now. We're- let us cradle you into wisdom

04:25.280 --> 04:26.640
with this first question.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.520
Since American politics have become such a hot topic lately,

04:30.400 --> 04:33.360
I've been having a problem with my- one of my closest friends.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.640
Recently he's been getting extremely vocal and animated about his opinions

04:36.640 --> 04:40.160
whenever he finds a news article or political meme on the internet.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.000
Although we don't share the same views on these matters,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.320
he and I normally have a great time when we hang out.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.200
But since he's been constantly bringing up these topics,

04:47.200 --> 04:51.520
I find him difficult to be around. I don't want to ostracize him from my life.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.000
And I've told him a few times that talking about politics

04:54.000 --> 04:57.440
isn't how I want to spend my time with him, but he just won't listen.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.440
Is there a way I can avoid these conversations while also maintaining our friendship?

05:01.440 --> 05:04.080
And that's from Congressionally Confused in Connecticut.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.800
That someone has to be engaging with him.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.440
Like there's no way he's just sitting there and,

05:09.440 --> 05:10.640
an Obama, right?

05:11.440 --> 05:14.000
And like nobody answers and he just keeps going?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.480
Because if so, your friend is insane.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.920
You gotta- you gotta make him feel small.

05:17.920 --> 05:23.600
You gotta- you gotta learn so much more about whatever subjects he wants to talk about

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
that you politics him under the table.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.200
Like if you- if you haven't already started, it may actually be too late,

05:29.200 --> 05:33.520
but you need to start, you know, reading Le Monde exclusively.

05:33.520 --> 05:37.760
You need to start reading back- back catalog of the economists

05:37.760 --> 05:40.080
and just get like so deep in politics.

05:41.120 --> 05:46.320
You could do that or you could do what my parents did

05:46.320 --> 05:49.520
when I thought that I would start discussing politics with them.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.240
And this is actually pretty savvy on their part, so I'll pass this on along to you.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.680
What they did was when I would start espousing political opinions,

05:57.680 --> 06:01.600
they would just keep asking me questions about my political opinions

06:01.600 --> 06:07.040
until that thin veneer of basically a hodgepodge,

06:07.040 --> 06:10.800
paper mache construction of hope and good feelings

06:10.800 --> 06:12.560
and just a minimal amount of information.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.240
And stuff you learn from The Daily Show.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.040
And exactly.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.240
And that would- it was- that was- became sort of a tapestry that I would-

06:18.240 --> 06:22.640
I would wrap myself in and they would just ask questions about my beliefs

06:22.640 --> 06:24.720
until they crumbled around me.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.520
This sort of predated The Daily Show though, this interaction.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.880
Like I don't know- where did you get-

06:28.880 --> 06:30.640
Don't fucking age me Griffin, Jesus.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.960
No, I'm saying you're old as fuck, but where did you get your shit?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.400
Like Nick News? What was your-

06:34.400 --> 06:35.760
He read it on The Onion.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.120
The Onion. The paper one. The Onion.

06:39.120 --> 06:39.600
And I was like-

06:39.600 --> 06:40.480
Oh that would be great.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.840
Every time your friend brings up an article like you read in USA Today,

06:43.840 --> 06:45.600
bring up an article you read in The Onion.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.600
It's like- and you can believe this? He's- he's mating with aliens.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.560
Listen, you're basically fucking describing Facebook.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.000
That is basically just my Facebook wall right now that you're describing.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.600
Hey, Obama's a Muslim.

06:57.600 --> 07:04.000
Hey, somebody at a mall believed something about a dragon.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.520
That's The Onion headline, isn't it?

07:05.520 --> 07:06.160
I don't read much.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.360
That's pretty good.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.640
That's not bad. I'll find it.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.840
Does anybody-

07:09.840 --> 07:13.760
Obama says french fries are Benghazi.

07:13.760 --> 07:20.480
I have- I have friends that are- I would say very political.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.760
They talk about political things.

07:21.760 --> 07:26.640
But like, does anyone really like talking about this shit?

07:26.640 --> 07:31.600
Is there anyone that it doesn't make you just feel impotent?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.280
Here's the thing. That's the thing.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.240
Nobody enjoys talking with other people about this.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.280
They like talking at other people about this.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.360
They like just hurling facts and knowledge and random shit.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.040
I guess in the hopes that the other people listening will just

07:47.760 --> 07:50.480
realize that they are the superior political mind.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.520
People say not to discuss religion and politics because it's impolite.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.480
And I think that's fair because it rarely leads to any sort of positive discussion.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.360
But I think the other side of that is because they're also-

08:01.360 --> 08:04.240
Those conversations, almost by definition, can't be fruitful.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.560
You're going to have one of two things.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.040
Either you're going to have two people so dug in that all they are doing

08:11.040 --> 08:15.760
is espousing their own beliefs at the other person until they run out of breath.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.480
Or you're basically going to have an echo chamber

08:18.480 --> 08:21.920
where you're hearing your own beliefs repeated back to you.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.760
Neither one is healthy.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.480
Well, somebody's got to be- Yeah, you ain't Lincoln Douglas.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.200
You know what I mean?

08:27.200 --> 08:29.280
Somebody's got to be listening to this shit though.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.880
Or else explain Ron Paul.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.080
Ron Paul started with one guy.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.640
It was like Ron Paul talked to this one dude.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.280
And that dude was like, oh my God, Ron Paul, I'm so into you.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.360
And then he told two friends and then they told two friends.

08:39.360 --> 08:45.120
And then all of a sudden you had the Ron Paul extranet of human beings.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.800
You had the Ron Paul hive mind.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.960
And that was started by word of mouth.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.440
That wasn't big political contributions.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.600
Can I tell you guys a few things about Ron Paul?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.280
That I like?

08:55.280 --> 08:56.160
How long do you have?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.520
I know everybody's lives are so busy, but-

08:57.520 --> 09:02.560
Are you opening to joining with me and opening your hearts

09:02.560 --> 09:04.720
and just joining the relivution?

09:04.720 --> 09:07.120
That's what we call the revolution, but there's love in there.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.920
Let me tell you all about it.

09:09.920 --> 09:10.720
Do you like guns?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.640
Ron Paul sure as shit doesn't.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.160
If your friend wants to talk about politics,

09:14.160 --> 09:19.520
you should carry around in your pocket forms to sign up for the next election.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.920
To like make him run for city council.

09:21.920 --> 09:26.080
If he is so belligerent about this, make him run for political office.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.360
That's your only out.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.160
Because if he's not going to do that, then he's not serious enough about it.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.280
And if he does do that, you have to be his campaign manager.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.880
Oops, you fucked up now.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.800
That's that you played chicken and you lost.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.360
Oh, cut to 40 years from now.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.480
He's president and you're his chief of staff.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.000
And then you're like, hey, by the way, I've never really liked you that much.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.120
This was all a mistake.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.880
But I'm proud of the progress that you've made.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.400
Too bad that you beat the shit out of Ron Paul in the primaries.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.840
I was really rooting for that guy.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.680
I heard some really good news about him.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.800
What about what if every time your friend brings up 2013 American politics,

10:00.800 --> 10:05.600
you bring up 1913 American politics, but don't let him know the difference.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.640
But like and I hear that they're voting on something called prohibition.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.800
Then just see see if eventually he'll stop hanging out with you.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.240
Or you could always bring up rap beefs.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.880
Those are about the same thing.

10:18.880 --> 10:24.400
Yeah, but when they got Biggie, who was almost like the GOP, GOP,

10:24.400 --> 10:28.400
when the GOP got Biggie, that's when things really probably fucking did.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.320
I could I could send you guys some literature,

10:30.320 --> 10:32.800
but that that shit was entirely politically driven.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.360
Go for the three way beef between Pac, Biggie and Ron Paul.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.200
And let's just say one of them still alive.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.160
And then the other two died.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.240
Ron Paul was like, Biggie, they might as well call you the IRS

10:48.240 --> 10:51.440
because I'm not convinced of your continued solvency.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.120
And Ron Paul said nothing.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.400
He just got it fucking done.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.640
He just did the damn thing.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.600
Just did it.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.720
He did that hit.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.080
He did that hit on Biggie.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.520
No, he did it twice.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.400
Mystery solved.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.800
And now you know the rest of the story.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.080
Ron Paul, 2014.

11:08.080 --> 11:08.960
When's the next election?

11:10.560 --> 11:12.000
Yahoo, please.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.440
This Yahoo, as long as we're talking about politics,

11:15.440 --> 11:17.440
this Yahoo was sent in by Harrison Ross.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.080
Thanks, Harrison.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.040
But Yahoo answers user Friendly Cow, top contributor.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.960
Who asks, why can't you just walk into a store and take something?

11:28.480 --> 11:29.280
Then walk out.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.680
Like who is going to stop you?

11:31.680 --> 11:36.320
Walmart stop funding that greeters so you could just walk in,

11:36.320 --> 11:37.760
take whatever and walk out.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.440
As long as it doesn't have one of the things

11:39.440 --> 11:43.360
that make the alarms by the door go off.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.600
That's actually an unspoken law.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.200
If no one sees you, then you're good.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.800
It's like, oh, you got us.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.280
If you're saying shoplifting is legal,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.600
if you can cross the barrier and nobody sees you,

11:55.600 --> 11:59.200
the statute of limitations on that is until you get to your car.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.080
And then once you're there, it's all yally oxen free.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.920
I mean, that's the question.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.600
If the question is, why don't you do that?

12:05.600 --> 12:08.880
The answer is everybody does all the time.

12:08.880 --> 12:13.280
Yeah, you've just described the exact conditions

12:13.280 --> 12:16.080
through which everyone is stealing everything.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.680
Everyone's doing, I've never shoplifted anything in my life.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.560
Can I tell you why everyone doesn't do that?

12:22.560 --> 12:24.560
Because it's not exactly like everybody

12:24.560 --> 12:27.920
who would shoplift from Walmart is a master thief.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.000
I worked in loss prevention at Best Buy

12:30.000 --> 12:31.920
and like the ability to be like,

12:31.920 --> 12:35.280
oh, look at that person who's like hiding their eyes

12:35.280 --> 12:37.200
and looking around and it's like,

12:37.200 --> 12:40.400
yeah, you're not exactly like Pink Panther in this shit.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.040
It's that guy in the hoodie

12:43.040 --> 12:44.720
who won't make eye contact with anyone.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.320
But like, at Walmart, what's gonna,

12:48.320 --> 12:51.440
like someone, I've never understood

12:51.440 --> 12:53.280
you can just grab the thing and walk out the door

12:53.280 --> 12:54.960
and even if somebody's like, hey, you can't do that,

12:54.960 --> 12:57.040
I work at Walmart, you have to pay for that.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.880
What's stopping you from just being like,

12:58.880 --> 13:01.040
no, and there's really not anything you can do to stop me

13:01.040 --> 13:02.560
and then getting in your car and driving away.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.640
I mean, you can't do that.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.480
Can't they detain you?

13:06.480 --> 13:07.680
Can't they chain you to a right here?

13:07.680 --> 13:08.720
No, they can't, you know why?

13:08.720 --> 13:13.840
Because I'm a fucking adult and they have no legal authority over me.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.600
So wait, Griffin, are you implying that all of capitalism

13:17.600 --> 13:20.560
is just a smokescreen and we only do it

13:20.560 --> 13:22.400
because we think we have to do it?

13:22.400 --> 13:24.400
I'm saying that the societal norms

13:24.400 --> 13:27.120
are all entirely projected into our own minds

13:27.120 --> 13:28.960
by ourselves and our teachers.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.960
I'm saying if I go to Target right now,

13:30.960 --> 13:34.560
I can pick up a fucking PlayStation 3

13:34.560 --> 13:35.760
and walk out the door and someone's like,

13:35.760 --> 13:37.440
hey, you can't take that, I work at Target.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.600
And I can say, you're not my dad, like later, later.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.600
And I can hop on my skateboard

13:43.600 --> 13:45.280
that I've been riding through Target the entire time

13:45.280 --> 13:48.000
because nobody can fucking, they can't touch me.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.280
That's for fucking sure.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.560
It's like Target is like a haunted house rules.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.600
They can't touch you.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.480
They can't touch you.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.880
They're not gonna, there's a security guard by the door.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.440
He's not a fucking ordained by the city.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.840
My taxes don't pay his salary.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.880
He's not gonna fucking shoot me later.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.640
If you ever wanna have some fun.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.320
His gun squirts mustard.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.440
Like there's no way he can't stop you.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.200
That's why he sits by the fucking food court.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.240
He is not a cop later dog, later.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.240
If you ever wanna have some fun,

14:16.240 --> 14:18.080
if you're at like a big box store,

14:19.280 --> 14:21.200
trust me as someone who worked in loss prevention,

14:21.840 --> 14:24.960
they won't do shit until you try to leave with it.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.720
Even if they watch you do it.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.560
So just make eye contact with someone

14:28.560 --> 14:29.680
in the electronics department

14:29.680 --> 14:31.600
and put something down your pants.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.360
And then just before you leave,

14:33.920 --> 14:36.080
pull it back out and put it on a shelf.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.080
And then just walk out and goodbye everybody.

14:38.080 --> 14:38.960
And like you've done.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.880
Can I give you an alternative theory?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.840
Just shove it down your pants

14:41.840 --> 14:42.960
and walk the fuck out of the store

14:42.960 --> 14:44.240
because they're not cops.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.320
I wouldn't shoplift from a cop store,

14:46.880 --> 14:49.760
a cop good store staffed entirely by cops

14:49.760 --> 14:51.520
because they're gonna fucking enforce that shit.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.440
Travis, what could you actually do

14:53.440 --> 14:54.720
to someone you thought was stealing?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.480
Like what was my process?

14:58.480 --> 14:59.680
Crack this open, crack open

14:59.680 --> 15:01.600
how fucking impotent these dudes are.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.120
It really is, okay, listen,

15:03.120 --> 15:05.200
I don't wanna put all security guards on blast

15:05.200 --> 15:07.600
because I feel like I'm betraying my brotherhood.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.960
But here's the thing, you guys,

15:10.480 --> 15:12.400
the amount of quality,

15:12.400 --> 15:14.880
like the amount of things that you have to prove

15:14.880 --> 15:17.280
before you can even have someone arrested.

15:17.280 --> 15:17.520
Right.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.320
Like here's the thing,

15:18.320 --> 15:20.960
I could watch you, Griffin McElroy do it, right?

15:20.960 --> 15:22.560
Yeah, and you know,

15:22.560 --> 15:25.280
I'm fucking going to after this goddamn podcast.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.600
And then if I lost eye contact,

15:27.600 --> 15:30.080
like if I lost the visuals on you

15:30.080 --> 15:32.800
and you were just gone and then showed back up,

15:32.800 --> 15:33.920
I couldn't do shit.

15:33.920 --> 15:34.240
Couldn't do shit.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.360
Because I couldn't prove,

15:35.360 --> 15:37.440
all you would have to say is like, no, I put it back.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.520
Hey, that's not cool, I'm gonna call real cops.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.200
All right, they'll be here in like 20 minutes later, later.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.360
My car is 20 feet away, bye.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.000
The point Griffin is making is not that,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.240
it's not about whether or not they see you do it.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.040
What he's saying is they can watch you do it,

15:53.040 --> 15:56.480
watch you walk out the door and they cannot do anything.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.320
They can't do fucking anything

15:58.320 --> 15:59.520
because they're not a cop or my dad.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.680
If my dad was working loss prevention,

16:01.680 --> 16:03.120
he's like, no, son, don't.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.440
Like, all right, I'll put it back.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.560
And I put it back.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.800
But very rarely would that happen

16:08.800 --> 16:10.320
because my dad doesn't work retail.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.000
That would be a sweet,

16:12.000 --> 16:18.080
like some sort of a duel between they bring on Clint

16:18.080 --> 16:20.640
because he's the only one that can stop Griffin.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.040
It'll be sort of a Thomas Crown Affair vibe.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.440
I think Griffin's like rappelling through the ceiling

16:25.440 --> 16:27.760
and dad like cuts the string.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.520
Except by rappelling through the ceiling,

16:29.520 --> 16:31.120
you mean like just walking in the door

16:31.120 --> 16:33.760
and taking out a handful of boxes of Mike and Ikes

16:33.760 --> 16:34.480
and walking out.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.200
If you think I would go that small,

16:37.200 --> 16:38.480
I mean, I will go that small.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.440
I'll go small to big.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.120
I'm not paying for shit anymore.

16:42.880 --> 16:43.360
I don't wanna-

16:43.360 --> 16:45.840
I actually, I don't believe in shoplifting.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.240
It makes me so sad because I know who it affects.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.960
So what I do is I go in and I pick up the thing

16:50.960 --> 16:53.760
and then I leave like a clay pot I've made

16:53.760 --> 16:55.280
or some like shiny stones.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.560
So you like covert bartering basically.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.400
You like very one-sided bartering.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.800
They can't say yes to it

17:02.800 --> 17:04.160
because then everybody would do it.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.560
But I know that they appreciate those sand dollars.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.120
It's like farting in yoga class.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.760
That is what I equate shoplifting to

17:11.760 --> 17:13.200
is like farting in yoga class.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.600
Because you've done inventory

17:15.600 --> 17:16.800
at a major retail chain before.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.280
I have too.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.320
I imagine Justin has too

17:18.320 --> 17:20.160
since he's worked about 28 retail jobs.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.440
It's like typically 75, 80%.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.520
And then the other shit gets just straight up cribbed.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.720
And when someone, if you become a cog in that machine

17:30.720 --> 17:32.400
you're literally just a drop in the bucket.

17:32.400 --> 17:38.000
You're adding 0.0001 to the shoplifting rate at that point.

17:38.000 --> 17:38.560
Like it doesn't-

17:38.560 --> 17:40.000
Because most of it, most of it.

17:40.000 --> 17:40.960
I do wanna drop.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.160
When I worked at Best Buy, I had like 10 fools arrested.

17:44.160 --> 17:44.400
Yeah.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.080
How, Travis, how?

17:46.640 --> 17:49.280
Because I called the cops before they tried to leave.

17:49.280 --> 17:49.840
But you said they won't do anything-

17:49.840 --> 17:50.960
The cops are waiting.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.280
Hold on.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.320
Until they try to leave.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.520
Which is- Until they try to leave.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.680
And so then the people would walk out the door

17:55.680 --> 17:58.800
and the cops would fucking, you know, come in.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.680
No, okay.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.040
Travis, how on earth?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.400
Because I was fucking on point.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.400
With your profiling?

18:05.440 --> 18:06.480
No, because I want-

18:07.040 --> 18:08.960
Okay, so this is why there are greeters

18:08.960 --> 18:11.120
because people come in and you say hi

18:11.120 --> 18:13.840
and like your normal average person goes, oh, hi.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.200
And then people who are coming in to steal shit-

18:15.200 --> 18:17.120
So they look at you and they're like, can't talk.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.040
No, there are people that would come in

18:19.040 --> 18:21.360
and suddenly they'd be so surprised

18:21.360 --> 18:24.000
that a human being was like acknowledging them.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.640
They'd be like, what?

18:24.640 --> 18:28.000
Too busy, too busy, gotta steal something.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.800
In which aisle is your small and valuable things?

18:31.840 --> 18:34.000
About pocket size, please.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.720
Do you have that special belt that loosens your pants?

18:38.240 --> 18:41.200
The thing is, is like all you have to do is watch people

18:41.200 --> 18:43.840
and people, like I said, are not exactly master thieves.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.160
So they're like looking around all shady

18:46.160 --> 18:47.520
and like hiding stuff.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.160
And like, you know, when you see a 12 year old kid

18:50.160 --> 18:52.480
jacking out the refrigerator section,

18:52.480 --> 18:54.640
it's like, no, you're back there stealing stuff.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.240
I'm gonna give you one last chance at this

18:56.240 --> 19:00.640
before I just declare your entire form of profession made up.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
You can't physically stop people

19:02.640 --> 19:04.000
as they're leaving the store, correct?

19:04.800 --> 19:05.440
If someone went-

19:05.440 --> 19:06.800
All right, let's paint a hypothetical.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.400
No, no, no, I can.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.320
I have to prove that they were bypassing the checkout.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.680
You can't fucking touch them though.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.600
You can't grab them by the script.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.320
That's what I'm saying.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.440
If someone walked in the store-

19:17.440 --> 19:19.600
Oh, I hardly disagree.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.120
Let me finish my scenario.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.640
Someone walks in the store,

19:22.640 --> 19:26.720
goes full-blown supermarket sweep in two and a half minutes,

19:26.720 --> 19:28.240
just like runs through the phone aisle,

19:28.240 --> 19:31.920
like wee, just like knocking shit into their giant pants

19:31.920 --> 19:32.880
and then runs out.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.680
You can't do shit about that scenario.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.200
I would tackle the shit out of them.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.400
You can't, that's assault.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.520
That's assault and you go to jail

19:39.520 --> 19:40.960
and don't want that happening to you, my brother.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.120
I wouldn't do very well in prison.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.640
I'm just saying you wouldn't be able to-

19:46.640 --> 19:47.840
I would though.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.520
The settlement would pay for all the shit

19:49.520 --> 19:50.400
that he was gonna steal

19:50.400 --> 19:52.080
and then you'd be back to square one.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.680
But see, the problem is, Griffin-

19:55.680 --> 19:57.200
You're not Batman.

19:57.200 --> 19:57.520
You're not Batman.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.880
I don't know why we haven't talked about this

19:58.880 --> 19:59.920
for 20 minutes now.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.400
But the problem is the fiction that you're creating

20:02.400 --> 20:03.840
is not how people shop with.

20:03.840 --> 20:04.560
It's reality.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.120
I've never seen anyone do that.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.440
I agree that that would be a solid play.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.480
But people are trying to heist it.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.320
People are trying to Ocean's Eleven it

20:14.320 --> 20:16.400
and the first person I ever had arrested

20:16.400 --> 20:17.760
was hiding it in a baby carriage.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.720
Just pick up the thing and walk out.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.600
I do agree with you.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.240
That's what I'm saying.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.200
People just don't do it that way.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.480
They're not, not yet.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.960
Not until this episode hits the fucking web.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.400
God, Travis, I bet when you would catch someone stealing

20:30.400 --> 20:32.640
literally the second the cops are out of earshot,

20:32.640 --> 20:35.600
you would just crank Katrina in the waves

20:35.600 --> 20:37.040
and just dance around the store.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.840
Actually, the first time I had someone arrested,

20:39.840 --> 20:42.320
I jumped up and down in celebration

20:42.320 --> 20:43.680
so hard I hurt my ankle.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.880
Just like Batman does.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.960
I think that's how the killing joke ended.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.920
I am here at Starbucks studying

20:53.920 --> 20:57.040
and there's a guy taking out the only two comfy chairs

20:57.040 --> 20:58.400
with him in his bag,

20:58.400 --> 21:00.080
is putting his feet on the little table

21:00.080 --> 21:02.640
that is shared between them and hasn't bought a drink.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.560
I have no plans on sitting on them,

21:04.560 --> 21:06.880
but it's annoying me how inconsiderate it is.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.800
I just asked the barista if they could do something about it

21:08.800 --> 21:10.800
and they said they can't even talk to the customers.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.720
What can I do to fix this without getting into 50 cuffs?

21:15.280 --> 21:18.160
And that's from not a single fuck was given in South Texas.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.080
Can I just like, can I just say something?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.360
Can I just say something really quick

21:21.360 --> 21:22.880
based on this new fucking worldview

21:22.880 --> 21:24.640
that I've adopted since we started recording?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.040
Just walk up to him and take his bag.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.680
Just take his bag and walk out.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.720
What is he, like, what can he possibly do?

21:32.720 --> 21:33.760
He can't touch you.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.960
No, he actually can at that point.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.000
I don't think he is not associated with the store.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.520
I don't think you get the fucking castle doctrine at Starbucks

21:43.520 --> 21:46.400
no matter how much you think you live there, Brad.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.680
You're still associated with like humanity and the law

21:49.680 --> 21:51.360
and you can say, hey, you assaulted me.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.200
I was just trying to steal that.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, mine's a victimless crime

21:56.160 --> 21:58.720
in that no one was physically injured, but-

21:58.720 --> 22:00.960
Right, I just, man.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.840
This is why we have the liner at the beginning

22:03.840 --> 22:05.040
saying don't do anything we say

22:05.040 --> 22:06.560
because I'm basically telling everybody

22:06.560 --> 22:10.720
just fucking whatever's not nailed down, man.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.280
Grab it and go.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.760
I think, question asker,

22:13.760 --> 22:16.080
I think what you need to do is to realize

22:16.080 --> 22:18.720
that this seems inconsiderate

22:19.360 --> 22:24.000
until you consider that everyone in the world

22:24.000 --> 22:26.240
is inconsiderate and terrible.

22:26.240 --> 22:26.640
That's not-

22:26.640 --> 22:28.800
And so this is actually, this is pretty basic.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.960
If you ever need proof of it,

22:30.960 --> 22:33.680
all you have to do is travel.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.960
Travel, having just been on so many flights

22:36.960 --> 22:38.400
and going through so many airports,

22:39.200 --> 22:43.680
it is this microscope under which you can view

22:43.680 --> 22:46.080
the inconsiderate nature of all humanity.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.480
You go on one honeymoon and all of a sudden

22:48.480 --> 22:50.720
you've seen the curvature of our terrible Earth.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.480
Curvature of the terrible Earth

22:54.480 --> 22:56.240
was my favorite pop band in the 80s.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.680
I think this is a very different,

22:58.960 --> 23:00.640
I mean, I think they're very different people.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.680
Me, when I go into a place that is my home,

23:03.680 --> 23:05.760
literally all I'm thinking about is,

23:05.760 --> 23:07.760
please, God, don't let anybody yell at me.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.520
Just let me not get yelled at

23:09.520 --> 23:11.520
for this time that I've left my door

23:11.520 --> 23:13.120
and will soon return to it.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.400
Please don't let me get yelled at.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.880
If I'm at Starbucks, I'm pretty sure

23:16.880 --> 23:19.120
that when I plug my laptop into the wall,

23:19.680 --> 23:20.560
they're gonna yell at me.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's art juice.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.960
Are you gonna buy four coffees?

23:24.960 --> 23:26.880
It's four coffee feet, use the plug.

23:26.880 --> 23:27.360
Like, I didn't know.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.800
I just think it's a different world

23:28.800 --> 23:30.160
where some people don't think that way.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.520
I think it's very possible that this person

23:31.520 --> 23:33.200
doesn't know what a dick fish they're being.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.280
And if that's the case, then just walk up to him

23:35.280 --> 23:36.960
and say, hey, can I move your bag and sit down, please?

23:36.960 --> 23:39.280
Hey, do you know what my pet peeve is?

23:39.280 --> 23:40.960
As long as we're talking about inconsiderate people.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.840
And it's when someone either walks into a doorway

23:45.840 --> 23:48.720
in a room or gets to the bottom of a set of stairs

23:49.360 --> 23:52.800
and stops when there's a group of people behind.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.040
I was on a tour of a castle

23:55.040 --> 23:57.280
and very small doorways, very small things.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.760
And people would get inside the doorway of a room

23:59.760 --> 24:01.200
and stop and look around.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.400
And it's like, hey, dog, there's 30 people behind you.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.240
Life is so hard when your castle tours

24:06.240 --> 24:07.200
are interrupted that way.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.080
I know, Jesus.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.480
Hey, is this what it's gonna be?

24:10.480 --> 24:11.440
Is this how it's gonna be?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.640
I think that you run a real risk.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.320
Travis does have a fair point.

24:16.320 --> 24:16.720
Thank you.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.280
I don't think everyone on Earth is that way.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.080
But I think that if you're looking for people like that,

24:22.080 --> 24:24.240
you will find no shortage of inconsiderate people.

24:24.240 --> 24:26.000
Especially at Starbucks.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.440
You're looking at the worst place.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.560
Yes, and I think that if you allow it,

24:30.560 --> 24:33.040
you are constantly going to be annoyed

24:33.040 --> 24:35.280
by people that aren't directly inconveniencing you.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.160
And I know it's annoying,

24:36.160 --> 24:38.320
but unless you're being directly...

24:38.320 --> 24:39.520
If you're looking for a seat,

24:39.520 --> 24:42.160
I think you're 100% within your right to say,

24:42.720 --> 24:44.880
hey, would you mind if I sat there?

24:44.880 --> 24:46.480
That's human and natural,

24:46.480 --> 24:48.800
and that's how we should be interacting with each other.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.320
But if you don't need a seat and you leave your seat...

24:52.320 --> 24:54.240
First off, you can leave your seat, bummer.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.960
But secondly, it doesn't...

24:56.960 --> 25:00.640
Actually, the TikTok seat lock is enforceable by law.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.960
That is the only thing that our fucking legal system can allow.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.720
And you can actually assault someone if they break it.

25:08.720 --> 25:09.360
You can fucking beat the shit out of someone.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.560
You can steal their shit.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.000
But TikTok seat lock is...

25:12.000 --> 25:14.240
Is TikTok seat lock what you had in college?

25:14.240 --> 25:14.720
Yeah.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.240
We had barbershop.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.120
That's what we...

25:17.120 --> 25:18.240
What would you say?

25:18.240 --> 25:18.880
TikTok barbershop.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.240
TikTok barbershop?

25:20.240 --> 25:21.680
No, we would just say barbershop when you get up.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.080
You would quote your favorite barbershop lines from barbershop.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.200
But wouldn't that be confusing

25:25.200 --> 25:26.800
if you were just going to the haircut place

25:26.800 --> 25:28.720
and you were just announcing your friends like,

25:28.720 --> 25:29.760
oh, barbershop.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.120
And they're like, oh, should I sit in a seat

25:31.120 --> 25:33.920
or is he going to go get a shave and a polish?

25:33.920 --> 25:34.960
It was the 70s.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.400
We didn't get haircuts.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.080
What was your guys' favorite barbershop movie?

25:39.120 --> 25:40.640
I think it was Barbershop 2.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.120
That's right.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.400
I don't know when people started getting so rude.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.520
I don't know what the turning point,

25:47.520 --> 25:50.640
what the tipping point was using Malcolm Gladwell content.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.600
At some point, shit done tipped and everyone got really rude.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.520
I think it's when Touched by an Angel went off the air.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.880
We didn't have the soothing influence of Roma Downey there.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.880
I think if Roma Downey had walked into this Starbucks

26:00.880 --> 26:02.640
and be like, oh, child, you should get up

26:02.640 --> 26:04.800
and not be occupying three seats.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.320
Do you know, wait, do you know which one was Roma Downey?

26:08.320 --> 26:09.440
I'm Roma Downey.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.280
Which one was she?

26:11.280 --> 26:12.240
Who do you think she was?

26:13.280 --> 26:14.960
I thought she was the large black woman.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.400
No, you're done wrong.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.320
Okay, so you, in trying to fuck me, got fucked yourself.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.600
The old Roma Downey fuckeroo.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.920
You flipped it on yourself.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.360
I think it was Robert Downey Jr.'s wife.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.240
Oh, no.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.920
I think that's inaccurate.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.840
First off, she was a gypsy woman, I believe.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.880
She would have to take the junior first if they got married.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.440
Secondly, where do you get off?

26:43.440 --> 26:43.680
Where do you fucking start?

26:43.680 --> 26:46.960
Challenging people's Touched by an Angel knowledge

26:46.960 --> 26:50.960
when you yourself are pretty fuzzy on the basics of Touched by an Angel.

26:50.960 --> 26:55.600
Listen, all I need to know is was James Spader on that show

26:55.600 --> 26:57.280
or am I thinking of the wrong dude?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.400
Yes, he's on every show, but I think he was on that one too.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.720
This is what happens, you miss two weeks of episodes

27:02.720 --> 27:04.960
and I forget who Roma Downey is.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.920
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

27:06.720 --> 27:07.440
Sure, yeah.

27:07.440 --> 27:10.560
Ugh, I still had that tab open about why can't you just take shit

27:10.560 --> 27:12.080
and it makes me so angry.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.680
This Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Burghardt.

27:15.680 --> 27:16.240
Thanks, Ashley.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user

27:17.520 --> 27:21.680
PowerHouseStan who asks,

27:23.680 --> 27:27.280
can your girlfriend break up with you if she doesn't like your Facebook photos?

27:28.720 --> 27:31.600
We've been going out for three days, but she's been very distant.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.360
I don't know, before she was all over me and she doesn't even respond.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.400
I even added her on FB and she didn't respond.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.480
Any advice, kind people of Yahoo Answer?

27:43.200 --> 27:45.840
Additional details, I'm 16 and she's 15.

27:45.840 --> 27:49.840
Ah, Jesus, I've invited her places, but she says she has a strict father.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.040
I think I can be fun.

27:53.200 --> 27:53.700
Wow.

27:55.120 --> 27:59.360
Can your girlfriend break up with you if she doesn't like your FB photos?

27:59.360 --> 28:03.600
It's just so weird to me that that seems like the least of his worries.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.360
Listen, it's fucking hard out there,

28:09.360 --> 28:13.040
even for a relationship that's been going on as long as three days.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.080
A solid 72 hours.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.440
A solid 72 hours.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.240
The first 48 were amazing.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.160
We're amazing.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.320
It was like before sunrise,

28:24.320 --> 28:28.320
like every moment was just pregnant with romantic intent.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.680
And now she doesn't respond.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.400
She's pregnant.

28:31.360 --> 28:36.240
There has been a poke lingering for eight hours unanswered, an unrequited poke.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.200
I'm an old man and I don't know any better,

28:41.200 --> 28:45.600
but isn't it weird that they would engage in a relationship

28:45.600 --> 28:47.680
and not already be Facebook friends?

28:47.680 --> 28:49.840
That is quite puzzling.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.840
I think maybe this is a whirlwind affair.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.360
I think it's gotta be even a whirlwind affair.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.200
I feel like Facebook friendship should be step number one.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.280
Especially for a 15, 16 year old.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.240
Like if I'm considering that at 9 30,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.960
you gotta think that they have that in a handbook somewhere.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.280
I think if you don't have everyone in your high school

29:09.280 --> 29:11.280
on your Facebook friends list,

29:11.280 --> 29:13.840
you're basically, I mean your high school career is over anyway.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.480
Yeah, I mean, I like, you know,

29:16.480 --> 29:19.200
me, I go to a party and I say, who here don't I know?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.440
And people are like, you don't know me.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.240
My name is Charlie.

29:22.240 --> 29:23.680
I'm like, hold up, Charlie what?

29:23.680 --> 29:26.160
And they're like, Charlie Powell.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.440
And I say, okay, hold up.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.920
And I whip out my phone, search them, link them, sync them,

29:32.960 --> 29:35.680
hand over my phone, say, log in, accept that shit real quick.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.440
And then they say, what?

29:37.440 --> 29:40.000
I say, log into your Facebook account on my phone.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And they're like, I don't want you to have access to that.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.480
You're a big Buffalo Bills fan, huh?

29:44.480 --> 29:44.720
Huh?

29:45.280 --> 29:45.840
Oh man.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.640
I see you like books.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.600
Griffin doesn't get invited to a lot of parties in case that wasn't clear.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.200
No, but when I do, I make it fucking count.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.680
And then he steals stuff from the person's house.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.520
And I just walk to their house and take the things.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.600
They can't touch me.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.360
Actually in Texas, they definitely can.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.800
Can't run that game in Tejas.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.640
Cannot do it.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.280
Cannot do it.

30:07.280 --> 30:12.080
They have strictures written down explicitly saying, don't do this thing.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.480
Or you will be, or you can be harmed.

30:15.120 --> 30:15.920
Capitally.

30:16.560 --> 30:25.360
If you in high school start dating someone, but you're not connected on Facebook.

30:25.360 --> 30:31.520
One, two, you don't go out and hang out and do anything because she has a strict father.

30:31.520 --> 30:31.840
Yeah.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.920
How did they get dating in the first place?

30:33.920 --> 30:34.400
Yes.

30:34.400 --> 30:34.800
Yes.

30:37.040 --> 30:37.840
It was a drive-in?

30:39.440 --> 30:42.400
It was a drive-in dating scenario.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.520
I'm sure it was a drive-in.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.840
It might as well have been a spaceship, Griffin.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.960
The odds are equal that they found a drive-in.

30:50.960 --> 30:55.680
Like unless they are their parents, like their connection is that their parents are

30:55.680 --> 31:00.480
weird drive-in enthusiasts that drive across the country looking for still open drive-ins.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.120
That's the only reality in which that would happen.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.240
What's the modern day drive-in?

31:04.240 --> 31:07.200
Because in our day, you go to a drive-in with a group of your friends.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.840
You would swap hot rods, right?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.120
And you would, you know, neck.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.960
You raise for pinks.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.280
Yeah.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.720
You would neck for a solid 90 minutes, depending on the length of the movie.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.000
Sometimes you would say you would want to go to a longer movie, like remains of the day.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.240
You can get a solid two and a half hours of necking in.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.800
And what's the modern equivalent of that?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.720
What is the modern equivalent of that?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.400
I guess anywhere, anything.

31:30.400 --> 31:34.400
I often race for pink slips, just at normal movie theaters now.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.080
Outside the parking lot.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.120
I mean, that would make it so much easier.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.680
We should race our Toyota matrices at some point.

31:43.680 --> 31:44.880
What year is yours?

31:44.880 --> 31:45.440
2003.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.600
Oh, that's a slow shit.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.280
I mean, I've souped it up.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.640
I've done quite a bit of work.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.160
I have a lot of, I have a few.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.840
What kind of stuff did you add to it?

31:53.840 --> 31:54.880
Oh God, Hemi.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.960
You put Blazer, you put Blazer.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.280
You put Blazer, you put Blazers in there.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.240
Blazers, NOS, the wrapper just rides around with me.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.400
Brakes, I just took those out.

32:11.440 --> 32:12.720
Never going slow again.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.440
Griffin knows where all the mattress stores in town are now.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.480
That is one benefit of losing the brakes.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.960
Yeah, stuff like that.

32:24.960 --> 32:29.040
Six wheels, using more traction on the ground.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.960
Butter, just covered everything in butter.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.120
Just get up real, real, real slippery in there.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.200
Which makes me pretty, pretty popular to drive in.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.320
He has two steering wheels, one for left and one for right.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.200
That's right.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.120
It's basically like pod racing.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.400
It can't go in park.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.520
It's another thing.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.800
That one was tricky to figure out.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.480
Just like the physics of it is that it can't stop.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.920
And you actually can't turn it off.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.800
If I remember correctly, you just welded the key on.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.040
Yeah, you could say she's a gas guzzler.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.400
Except she's not powered by gas.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.560
Just fire.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.720
It runs on fire.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.760
So pretty fast car if you want to race them.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.440
Yours sounds more stock than mine.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.400
But there's no shame in that.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.320
It's all about the driver, not about the beast.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.440
That's what I learned from Too Fast, Too Furious.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.960
Or at least the 45 minutes of it you watched.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.880
Yeah, I couldn't finish it.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.440
One would say that movie was a little too fast and too furious

33:21.440 --> 33:23.280
for Travis's taste.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.320
The Rock never showed up and Diesel never showed up

33:26.320 --> 33:27.520
and I didn't even have my eye candy.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.320
No, but you knew.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.760
That was like three movies ahead.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.520
And you knew that eventually like, God,

33:31.520 --> 33:33.680
the Rock has got to get messy up in this shit.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.920
That's why I forced myself through the first 45 minutes

33:35.920 --> 33:38.640
just so I would understand when I got to Three Fast,

33:38.640 --> 33:39.760
Three Furious.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.960
You don't want to be lost, sure.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.400
Yeah, I wanted to know what was up.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.080
I mean, I don't think he showed up till Fast Five.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.520
But by Three Fast, Three Furious,

33:45.520 --> 33:47.040
you could already smell what the Rock was cooking,

33:47.040 --> 33:47.520
which is weird.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.280
Sorry, did you say Three Fast, Three Fergie?

33:49.280 --> 33:51.440
Three Fast, Three Furious.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.440
She was in that one, I think.

33:53.440 --> 33:54.800
What was the one where she came in?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.480
I thought there was four Fergys.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.240
Four Fergys and a Ferguson.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.080
The Hugh Grant film.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.080
I love my film.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.240
You know, if you were going to shoplift,

34:14.240 --> 34:16.960
I bet the best place to hide things would be in your butt.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.080
Because not only would no one ever find it,

34:20.080 --> 34:21.360
but even if they knew where it was,

34:21.360 --> 34:22.480
they wouldn't go looking for it.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.320
I mean, I already said that you can just walk out

34:24.320 --> 34:25.200
because no one can touch you.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.840
But I guess if you want to go the whole nine yards.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.400
Well, what if you like having things in your butt?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.200
If you want to go the Sextra Mile,

34:33.200 --> 34:34.800
there's only one way to go,

34:34.800 --> 34:36.640
and that's ExtremeRestraints.com.

34:36.640 --> 34:40.400
They've got everything you can fit in your butt.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.760
If it fits, it ships.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.240
And I bet it's like stuff that feels better

34:44.240 --> 34:46.400
to have up there than like a CD player.

34:46.400 --> 34:53.600
Like maybe the Ass-Emulator Wireless Silicone Butt Plug.

34:53.600 --> 34:54.800
Wait, it's wireless?

34:54.800 --> 34:56.960
What other butt plugs are wired?

34:58.080 --> 35:01.600
No one wants that weird cord dangling out of your khakis.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.600
Luckily, there's the Ass-Emulator Wireless Silicone Butt Plug.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.120
It's your secret.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.800
No one else in Jenny's needs to know

35:08.800 --> 35:15.280
that you've got this beautiful AAA goblin beauty.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.320
What percentage?

35:18.320 --> 35:20.640
But what does the batteries do, Justin?

35:21.920 --> 35:22.640
They play CDs.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.000
The two batteries will play MP3s

35:26.000 --> 35:27.920
that reverberate through your colon

35:27.920 --> 35:29.280
and you can hear them in your ears.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.920
Also, more importantly, it vibrates.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.120
Do you guys hear air supply?

35:33.120 --> 35:35.120
I swear to God, I hear air supply.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.040
Now that only works if you have braces.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.000
That's worth noting.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.600
That's why fucking Lucille Ball,

35:42.240 --> 35:44.000
she thought she heard radio signals all the time.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.720
It wasn't.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.960
It was Desi's radio butt plug.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.480
You can use remote control.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.000
It only has two buttons on it.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.840
I guess because the most important one is off

35:57.840 --> 36:00.160
because I can see a lot of scenarios in which,

36:00.160 --> 36:01.840
well, this is no longer appropriate.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.480
There's one that says go and one that says go hard.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.480
Don't worry.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.320
This one does come with a power button

36:10.320 --> 36:12.640
so you can't shut it off at some point.

36:12.640 --> 36:16.240
And there's 10 modes of vibrating pleasure.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.560
So you can pick that up at extremistraints.com.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.600
Now here's the thing about,

36:19.600 --> 36:21.280
and maybe use it as a space.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.720
There's lots of things you graduate up

36:22.720 --> 36:24.480
to the biggest things you can put in there

36:24.480 --> 36:25.520
until you can fit a nook in there.

36:25.520 --> 36:30.000
I have a thick colonic wall.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.000
I may be sharing a little bit too much for you guys.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.920
Let me know when it starts getting uncomfortable for you.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.080
But I have a really thick colonic wall.

36:38.080 --> 36:38.640
Will the wireless-

36:38.640 --> 36:40.240
The question at Extremistraints is

36:40.240 --> 36:41.840
when does it get uncomfortable for you?

36:41.840 --> 36:46.160
I have a thick colonic wall, as I said, a couple times now.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.320
Will the wireless signal from this remote

36:48.320 --> 36:54.640
be able to reach the device that I have installed within me?

36:54.640 --> 36:55.120
When I have-

36:55.120 --> 36:57.840
Well, you have to put the device in your butthole too.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.800
I mean, that's-

36:58.800 --> 37:00.480
Now we're dealing with a little old lady

37:00.480 --> 37:01.840
who swallowed a fly scenario.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.000
I'm gonna have to shove a horse up there

37:04.000 --> 37:07.200
to get the 20th remote that I've shoved up there

37:07.200 --> 37:10.880
to shut down the 19th remote and so on, et cetera.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.480
I'm just chock full of remotes over here.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.000
I'm just jangling around.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.360
Just a big ball of plastic and batteries.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.520
Is the remote programmable?

37:17.520 --> 37:21.520
Could I control both my butt plug and my Bose sound system?

37:21.520 --> 37:23.920
Yeah, but you don't wanna get that turned around

37:23.920 --> 37:26.480
because you're either gonna deal with really loud music

37:26.480 --> 37:28.080
or an exploded butthole.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.320
Crank it.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.040
Oh, don't.

37:31.040 --> 37:31.360
Oh, don't.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.240
Oh, no.

37:32.240 --> 37:32.960
Don't crank it.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.440
That's all extremistraints.com.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.800
Use the coupon code sexabunga and save 20%.

37:38.800 --> 37:45.120
We wanna give a message to Aaron Brown from Desiree Dupree.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.960
It says, happy birthday to you.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.400
Happy birthday to you.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.600
Happy birthday.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.240
Oh, we can't do it.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.040
No, we can't say it.

37:51.040 --> 37:51.600
Don't sing it.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.120
We'll get arrested.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.360
Sing it, but sing it to the theme of a different song.

37:55.920 --> 37:56.420
Okay.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.880
Do it to Welcome Back, Cotter.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.600
Happy birthday to you.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.280
Happy birthday to you, dear Aaron.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.880
Happy birthday to ya.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.560
Hey, you're famous.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.680
You don't have to sing this part.

38:09.680 --> 38:15.520
Hope you have a good birthday because you're the best in town.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.320
Now you're adding-

38:16.320 --> 38:21.520
According to our new rival, life is more than their survival.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.880
Yeah, they don't try to live the good life yet, Aaron.

38:24.880 --> 38:30.720
Standing tall on the wings of Aaron's birthday.

38:30.720 --> 38:35.520
Henry, we got a message to you from Elisa.

38:35.520 --> 38:42.080
She says, please wish Henry a happy 27th birthday for me.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.760
Nothing to rearrange.

38:43.760 --> 38:46.320
Show me that Henry again.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.760
Show me that Henry.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.240
Don't waste another Henry on your Henry.

38:52.960 --> 38:58.480
It's a rare condition this day and age that me and Henry have been together for 12 years

38:58.480 --> 38:59.760
of sweet delight.

38:59.760 --> 39:04.720
Yet he only cares to hear birthday wishes from the mouths of the macaroons.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.760
Love him anyway.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.400
What are the next words?

39:09.600 --> 39:14.560
There must be some magic clue inside these gentle walls.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.060
All right.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.280
I never knew the next words, but I'm glad I do now.

39:19.280 --> 39:25.760
I got a message for Angelo from Dan, Greg, Nick, and Wayne.

39:27.040 --> 39:27.540
Wayne?

39:27.540 --> 39:28.740
Wayne.

39:28.740 --> 39:35.060
Angelo, we hope you have the rudest, most hecklesome, nice and neat math filled birthday

39:35.060 --> 39:35.220
yet.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.980
I hope I didn't just say something gross.

39:37.700 --> 39:41.380
Don't let those cadavers you see on a daily basis bring you down.

39:41.380 --> 39:44.260
Here's hoping for high quality goofs on this episode.

39:44.260 --> 39:45.060
Sorry.

39:45.060 --> 39:50.100
And shit in your pants now that you heard some authentic McElroy Leo-isms.

39:50.100 --> 39:50.980
Wait, what?

39:50.980 --> 39:51.780
From your favorite.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.940
I think these guys hate Angelo.

39:53.940 --> 39:55.620
Why do you hate Angelo so much?

39:55.620 --> 39:57.380
And why are you calling him a serial killer?

39:57.380 --> 40:01.220
I mean, I guess jokes on them because they just paid like a penny to wish him a happy

40:01.220 --> 40:02.260
birthday on this podcast.

40:02.260 --> 40:05.060
So I guess good way to prank suckers.

40:05.700 --> 40:09.300
Is he seeing the cadavers on a professional level?

40:10.100 --> 40:10.980
Welcome back.

40:10.980 --> 40:11.940
Welcome back.

40:11.940 --> 40:12.980
Welcome back.

40:12.980 --> 40:13.620
Okay, hold on.

40:13.620 --> 40:19.300
Dan, Greg, Nick, and Wayne are dead bodies that haunt Angelo.

40:19.940 --> 40:20.580
No.

40:20.580 --> 40:26.420
Okay, Angelo killed Dan, Greg, Nick, and Wayne and actually wrote this message to himself

40:26.420 --> 40:29.140
from the perspective of their dead bodies.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.540
Oh, and this is like the monkey's paw.

40:31.540 --> 40:32.100
This is the-

40:32.100 --> 40:33.140
This is the monkey's paw.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.860
This is the heart beating beneath the floorboards.

40:35.860 --> 40:36.340
That's driving him insane.

40:36.340 --> 40:37.380
This is the black cat.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.860
This is the in a pendulum.

40:43.300 --> 40:48.260
This is Jesse Thorne, proprietor of MaximumFun.org and host of International Waters.

40:48.260 --> 40:51.940
International Waters pits a team of comedians in London against a team of comedians here

40:51.940 --> 40:56.660
in LA over several rounds of very stupid pop culture questions and games.

40:56.660 --> 41:01.620
We've got Paul F. Tompkins, Josie Long, Greg Proops, Claudio O'Doherty, Robin Ince, Andy

41:01.620 --> 41:07.060
Zaltzman, Paul Scheer, Izzy Sooty, Ricky Carmona, Cameron Esposito, Aaron Gibson, Brian Safi.

41:07.060 --> 41:12.580
So join me and the best comedians in the English speaking world for International Waters.

41:12.580 --> 41:16.020
Go to MaximumFun.org or look for us in the iTunes store.

41:16.020 --> 41:22.660
Farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Get your pitchfork.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.100
Justin had a stroke.

41:28.100 --> 41:28.660
Oh no.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.180
Did you know carrots?

41:30.180 --> 41:34.020
Do you know carrots and being around goats can fix strokes?

41:35.780 --> 41:38.740
Our first farm wisdom comes to us from IMDB.

41:39.300 --> 41:44.180
Says that John Dye was in touch by an angel, not James Spader.

41:44.180 --> 41:44.660
Dammit.

41:44.660 --> 41:46.100
Jesus Christ.

41:46.100 --> 41:46.980
James Spader.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.260
I know. I was surprised too.

41:48.260 --> 41:50.180
John Dye is dead now.

41:50.180 --> 41:50.980
He passed in 2007.

41:50.980 --> 41:52.740
Was he playing James Spader?

41:52.740 --> 41:55.140
He was playing James Spader playing the angel of death.

41:56.420 --> 41:57.700
And he passed away.

41:57.700 --> 42:06.820
The skin on a turkey's head and waddle can change with their mood.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.380
It can be red, pink, white, or blue.

42:10.020 --> 42:13.700
I think if they'd heard the past couple minutes of podcast, probably blue.

42:13.700 --> 42:14.500
That's from Alan.

42:15.460 --> 42:16.420
Trav, give me one.

42:16.980 --> 42:17.780
Break me off a piece.

42:19.060 --> 42:21.940
Apparently horses engage in a behavior called cribbing.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.980
Where they go to Target and just like pick shit up and leave.

42:25.780 --> 42:28.660
Where they copy each other's test answers.

42:29.380 --> 42:33.460
Where they bite down on something like a wooden post and suck in air.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.220
It can cause stomach ulcers.

42:35.780 --> 42:39.860
They may do this out of boredom, stress, or dietary imbalance.

42:39.860 --> 42:40.980
Those are both from Alan.

42:40.980 --> 42:43.220
People think we give horses a hard time.

42:43.220 --> 42:45.060
That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard.

42:45.060 --> 42:45.780
Okay, no.

42:46.340 --> 42:50.100
To be fair, it's not exactly like human beings.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.940
This shit that we do where it's like,

42:51.940 --> 42:54.420
hey, if you drink too much alcohol, it can kill your liver.

42:54.420 --> 42:55.780
Be like, yeah, but I'm stressed.

42:55.780 --> 42:57.300
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.

42:59.220 --> 43:01.060
Which is what I say every time I take a shot.

43:01.060 --> 43:04.740
If a horse gets this stupid because of boredom, stress, or dietary imbalance,

43:04.740 --> 43:06.100
that's not the horse's fault though, is it?

43:06.100 --> 43:07.060
It's the owner's.

43:07.060 --> 43:11.700
And the fact that you have this precious treasure that you're fucking in charge of keeping,

43:11.700 --> 43:16.420
not bored, not stressed, and not imbalanced, dietarily speaking.

43:16.420 --> 43:19.220
This isn't on the fucking horse, Justin.

43:19.220 --> 43:20.820
Horses are perfect.

43:20.820 --> 43:24.020
Also, if they do do this, they probably have a pretty good reason for it.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.860
Beyond the boredom or stress or diet.

43:25.860 --> 43:27.140
We can't see inside their heads.

43:27.140 --> 43:30.500
This might be a religious thing for horses.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.820
Have you bitten down on a wooden post and sucked in air ever?

43:32.820 --> 43:33.540
Have you cribbed?

43:34.820 --> 43:36.340
You will trip balls.

43:36.340 --> 43:38.420
You will fucking get so fucked up.

43:38.420 --> 43:39.780
Horses love to party.

43:39.780 --> 43:42.980
If you want to keep rodents from eating your bird feeder,

43:44.580 --> 43:46.580
I hope they mean the seeds in your bird feeder.

43:47.540 --> 43:49.060
Okay, eating from your bird feeder.

43:49.060 --> 43:49.540
There we go.

43:50.980 --> 43:53.060
Put jalapeno poppers in the mix.

43:53.060 --> 43:54.500
No, jalapeno poppers.

43:54.500 --> 44:00.660
Man, put some potato skins and some mozzarella sticks in there.

44:00.660 --> 44:01.160
Good.

44:02.900 --> 44:05.540
This is Guy Fieri's target demo.

44:06.340 --> 44:07.300
Is rats.

44:07.300 --> 44:11.620
Just take those rodents to Max and Irma's and give them a triple app of slider pack.

44:11.620 --> 44:13.940
Hey bros, got rats in your bird feeder?

44:13.940 --> 44:15.940
Buy some of my mozzarella slammers.

44:15.940 --> 44:17.780
Buy some sloppy-doppy turkey bones.

44:21.220 --> 44:23.540
We coat them in hair gel to slide right down your throat.

44:24.820 --> 44:26.980
Birds aren't able to taste the spiciness.

44:27.540 --> 44:31.060
But it does keep rats out of it.

44:31.060 --> 44:32.100
Birds are rats with wings.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.220
I don't know why we all are.

44:33.220 --> 44:35.460
That's from our dear friend Ousmane.

44:35.460 --> 44:38.100
Why are we giving them preferential treatment over rats?

44:38.100 --> 44:39.860
Rats are just terrestrial birds.

44:41.860 --> 44:42.980
Rats are birds.

44:44.260 --> 44:46.100
Rats are the birds of the ground.

44:46.100 --> 44:46.740
Think about it.

44:48.260 --> 44:50.580
I always want to try to dress professionally as possible.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.080
Work.

44:51.460 --> 44:52.180
I follow blogs.

44:52.180 --> 44:54.980
I put this on and really make an effort to dress well.

44:54.980 --> 44:59.780
Problem is I often have to attend conferences for work and have to wear some sort of name badge.

44:59.780 --> 45:00.580
Oh man.

45:00.580 --> 45:02.260
Always seems to clash with my style.

45:02.260 --> 45:05.940
Wow, how do I wear the name tag and remain stylish?

45:05.940 --> 45:08.980
That's from a lanyard hater in Little Rock.

45:08.980 --> 45:10.660
Oh, this is a great question.

45:11.540 --> 45:12.820
This is a great-

45:12.820 --> 45:14.580
This is one of those words like I wish I knew.

45:15.140 --> 45:19.300
Well, I mean, if they're not going to supply you with a fashionable name tag,

45:19.300 --> 45:21.860
you have to supply your own.

45:21.860 --> 45:26.820
Like maybe if you just had your own like a silver carved kind of thing.

45:27.620 --> 45:31.300
Well, I mean, silver doesn't go with everything.

45:31.300 --> 45:32.580
You would- I mean, if you want to-

45:33.300 --> 45:34.100
You got to have at least-

45:34.100 --> 45:37.380
What about a big diamond necklace with your name in it?

45:37.380 --> 45:39.940
See, that's the reason that those exist.

45:41.140 --> 45:43.220
Can you have a fashion lanyard with you?

45:43.780 --> 45:45.060
Just keep a fashion lanyard.

45:45.060 --> 45:47.620
You got to have one in black, one in brown to go with your accessories.

45:48.900 --> 45:54.820
And then a casual lanyard, which really is going to be seasonal.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.980
I think you're going to want some pastels for the spring.

45:56.980 --> 46:00.980
Well, you're also going to want like a utility lanyard, something that's durable

46:00.980 --> 46:04.420
and can withstand the elements for like outside conferences.

46:04.420 --> 46:04.660
Yeah.

46:06.100 --> 46:09.940
When you're at a mountain climbing conference business, what are you talking about?

46:09.940 --> 46:12.180
Or like a paintball business mixer.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.260
Maybe you could-

46:14.260 --> 46:16.180
We're up to seven lanyards now that you need.

46:16.180 --> 46:17.380
Go on, Justin.

46:17.380 --> 46:23.860
Maybe you could class out the name tag a little bit by drawing pictures of classy stuff on it,

46:23.860 --> 46:26.980
like money clips or caviar or something.

46:28.180 --> 46:30.260
So you're saying dip the lanyard.

46:30.260 --> 46:32.100
That's just a messy lanyard at that point.

46:32.100 --> 46:34.020
No, I'm saying draw pictures of it.

46:34.580 --> 46:35.860
Draw a picture of caviar.

46:35.860 --> 46:36.580
It'd be fun.

46:36.580 --> 46:39.540
My name's Brian and you can tell the things I like.

46:40.340 --> 46:42.980
I drew a picture of a sleek Lambo.

46:42.980 --> 46:43.860
Is it posh here?

46:43.860 --> 46:48.020
Wait, is this a money making thing where we could like have sticker books

46:48.020 --> 46:52.420
for adult professionals so that they just have some Lamborghini stickers already?

46:52.420 --> 46:54.900
Every meeting between two adults is a money making opportunity.

46:55.700 --> 46:56.260
Think about it.

46:56.260 --> 46:56.740
Think about that.

46:58.580 --> 47:02.100
Is it possible to have a street team that just you don't wear a lanyard,

47:02.100 --> 47:05.700
they just go around the room and go up to people and say,

47:06.420 --> 47:08.740
Brian, and then they point to you.

47:08.740 --> 47:11.460
And then nobody's going to forget your fucking name at that point.

47:11.460 --> 47:12.580
Brian's ready for you.

47:14.580 --> 47:21.140
Just hire like a Herald that they walk into the meeting room before you and say,

47:21.140 --> 47:22.820
my lords and ladies.

47:22.820 --> 47:24.180
Brian approaches.

47:25.060 --> 47:28.180
Prepare thyself for the oncoming Brian.

47:30.340 --> 47:32.900
You want to get a little hipper, you hire a hype man.

47:34.020 --> 47:37.780
They come into the meeting room, they start flipping the light switches on and off.

47:38.980 --> 47:39.940
Here he comes.

47:39.940 --> 47:40.820
Hold on though.

47:40.820 --> 47:43.060
What's the hype man going to wear?

47:43.060 --> 47:44.820
You're going to have to get him past us.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.420
You got to get a smaller hype man.

47:46.420 --> 47:51.220
You got to get a smaller hype man ad infinitum.

47:53.860 --> 47:54.660
Let's see.

47:54.660 --> 47:56.180
So many great ideas so far.

47:56.180 --> 47:57.700
Can you get a business Jersey?

47:59.860 --> 48:05.700
Sorry, that actually creates twice the problems that it's all a business Jersey.

48:05.700 --> 48:07.220
You can color coordinate that easy.

48:07.780 --> 48:09.540
And then your name is just on the back of it.

48:09.540 --> 48:10.420
Business Cape.

48:11.140 --> 48:13.620
Business Cape with your name on it is a little gauche.

48:14.740 --> 48:15.540
Business robe.

48:15.540 --> 48:17.860
That's moving in the right direction.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.540
Oh, sort of like a boxing vibe.

48:19.540 --> 48:19.700
Yeah.

48:19.700 --> 48:23.140
I'm selling like business trunks, business gloves.

48:23.140 --> 48:24.180
The champ is here.

48:24.180 --> 48:27.220
Sign your name on that.

48:27.220 --> 48:28.260
I can't gloves.

48:28.260 --> 48:29.300
Can't sign shit.

48:30.020 --> 48:33.220
Luckily my Herald is, is authorized.

48:33.220 --> 48:35.300
I have his power of attorney.

48:38.180 --> 48:40.020
I'm just waiting for him to die.

48:41.780 --> 48:42.820
I'm his lover.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.660
I'll inherit everything.

48:44.660 --> 48:48.660
I'm his lover and he won't acknowledge me publicly.

48:48.660 --> 48:50.500
At night in bed.

48:50.500 --> 48:52.980
I think about killing and becoming Brian.

48:53.860 --> 48:55.380
No one would notice.

48:55.380 --> 48:57.700
It would be a seamless transition.

48:57.700 --> 48:58.260
Hold on.

48:58.260 --> 49:00.580
I forgot to flip the lights on and off.

49:00.580 --> 49:01.380
He loves that.

49:01.380 --> 49:02.100
He loves that.

49:03.140 --> 49:04.180
Oh, Brian.

49:06.900 --> 49:09.300
Maybe sunglasses in the shape of the word Brian.

49:10.180 --> 49:10.980
I like that.

49:10.980 --> 49:15.860
Like the two that find those people that make them for the year and they had thought they

49:15.860 --> 49:21.140
had a really good scam until 2009 when they just had that meeting where they had to stand

49:21.140 --> 49:25.140
around like, okay, look, guys, I think we can work something out for 2010 pretty good.

49:25.140 --> 49:29.780
But past that, I think we're just going to be really flying by the seat of our pants.

49:29.780 --> 49:32.580
We'll see you guys again in 20,000.

49:36.980 --> 49:38.420
I just hope there's still eyes.

49:38.420 --> 49:43.460
Or that people have evolved three eyes because then we will have it made in the shade.

49:43.460 --> 49:46.660
There will be nothing but shade, though, because we'll be covered in an ash cloud.

49:47.780 --> 49:51.540
The most important part of style is to not make anyone feel uncomfortable with your style,

49:51.540 --> 49:52.040
right?

49:53.300 --> 49:57.460
It's for it's for every your style is for everyone else's benefit to look at you and

49:57.460 --> 50:00.580
be be odd, right?

50:00.580 --> 50:04.900
And I think if you show up and you're the only one with a gold plated name tag or a

50:04.900 --> 50:11.060
Herald dressed in pastels in the spring, of course, then like you're going to you're

50:11.060 --> 50:13.620
going to stick out and everyone's going to feel uncomfortable that they didn't bring

50:13.620 --> 50:15.220
their own Herald or maybe they did.

50:15.220 --> 50:17.940
Maybe that is the maybe that is the coterie in which you run.

50:19.460 --> 50:22.020
And in that case, where do I sign off?

50:22.980 --> 50:30.660
I I have to guess that if that was the norm for Brian and his business dealings, that

50:30.660 --> 50:33.140
information would have probably been included in the question.

50:33.140 --> 50:37.780
Like, I try to dress nice and I always dress my Herald in pastels when it is the spring.

50:39.220 --> 50:42.420
That's the only palette that I know, by the way, matching the season.

50:42.420 --> 50:46.260
If it's wintertime, I don't know snow colored whites.

50:46.260 --> 50:48.340
You do blues and whites in the winter.

50:48.900 --> 50:53.620
You're going to do the autumnal like some brown, some oranges, some yellow.

50:53.620 --> 50:57.620
And summer is just a fucking Jimmy Buffett orgasm explosion.

50:57.620 --> 51:02.420
But he has to maintain the same decorum and professional nature.

51:02.420 --> 51:04.740
I thought it was just pastels, but shorter.

51:04.740 --> 51:09.380
Everything's shorter, a pastel, Jimmy Buffett, pastel, like a pastel crop top.

51:10.420 --> 51:11.220
Great luck.

51:11.220 --> 51:13.220
You guys want to Yahoo, please?

51:13.940 --> 51:16.980
This Yahoo was sent in by Daniel Shires.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.540
Thanks, Daniel.

51:18.340 --> 51:22.020
By the way, and Daniel wasn't guilty of this, but I feel like it's time for me to sit down

51:22.020 --> 51:25.140
our audience and have a very stirring talk with them about the subject of the show.

51:25.140 --> 51:29.220
I mean, we can make it pretty quick, because I could come up with a bullet list of no-nos.

51:29.780 --> 51:36.340
Like number one, incest, number two, poop, number three, poop incest, very, very much frowned upon.

51:37.300 --> 51:42.260
If anything involves pooping on someone, especially a family member, you probably just go ahead

51:42.260 --> 51:43.300
and keep that one in your pocket.

51:44.180 --> 51:47.380
Especially don't send it in saying, hey, I found a real gem, because then I can't help

51:47.380 --> 51:49.540
but pass judgment on you and the type of person you are.

51:49.540 --> 51:54.660
Weirdo, weirdo, fucking weird beard, just keep those yourself and keep digging, because you'll

51:54.660 --> 51:56.900
find something not about poop or incest eventually.

51:56.900 --> 51:57.700
Just dig deep.

51:57.700 --> 51:59.460
There are Yahoo's about other things.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.260
Anyway, thank you everybody for your submissions.

52:03.140 --> 52:04.660
This is by Daniel Shires, though.

52:04.660 --> 52:05.220
He sent this one in.

52:05.220 --> 52:05.700
Thanks, Daniel.

52:05.700 --> 52:11.300
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jacqueline who asks, I just clicked a Yahoo advertisement link.

52:11.300 --> 52:13.540
Let me just go ahead and close out of that, and then I can get back to business.

52:13.540 --> 52:19.540
How do I get Jonah Hill to notice me on Twitter?

52:19.540 --> 52:21.540
I want to get noticed by Jonah Hill on Twitter.

52:21.540 --> 52:22.740
He's like my idol.

52:22.740 --> 52:23.940
I swear.

52:25.940 --> 52:27.140
I swear.

52:27.140 --> 52:29.940
If I had to die just to save his life, I would.

52:29.940 --> 52:31.940
But please help me get noticed by him.

52:32.660 --> 52:33.540
Would mean the world.

52:33.540 --> 52:35.540
Thanks, Jacquelinexx.

52:35.540 --> 52:37.540
Jacquelinexx.

52:37.540 --> 52:39.540
Thanks for the question.

52:39.540 --> 52:43.540
Would mean the world, thanks, Jacquelinexx.

52:43.540 --> 52:47.540
Jacqueline, I think if you're willing to die so that he may live, it sounds like you've

52:47.540 --> 52:50.020
already got a pretty good method of getting his attention.

52:52.020 --> 52:54.660
Do you ever hear that Eminem documentary Stan?

52:54.660 --> 52:57.060
That was the only way that Eminem ever acknowledged him.

52:57.060 --> 53:00.740
Right, and they formed a long friendship that lasted to this very day.

53:01.620 --> 53:04.420
Is this what the song Your Own Personal Jesus is about?

53:05.140 --> 53:08.340
This person wants to die for Jonah Hill.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.340
That Jonah Hill is their Jesus.

53:10.340 --> 53:13.540
No, they want to be Jesus of Jonah Hill.

53:13.540 --> 53:14.340
Right.

53:14.340 --> 53:16.660
Dying for his sins, and there are many.

53:16.660 --> 53:17.620
I saw Moneyball.

53:18.180 --> 53:18.740
He was great.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.100
Moneyball was a fine film.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.780
I know, but I couldn't think of a bad one.

53:21.780 --> 53:22.740
Hold on, give me a second.

53:22.740 --> 53:23.940
Yeah, that's a fun puzzle.

53:23.940 --> 53:28.580
Try to think of a bad Jonah Hill film before you start talking shit about him and his career.

53:28.580 --> 53:29.060
Can't do it.

53:29.060 --> 53:30.980
I don't think he's ever been in a bad film.

53:30.980 --> 53:31.300
Wait.

53:31.300 --> 53:31.540
Yeah.

53:32.740 --> 53:34.500
Okay, let me try the joke again.

53:34.500 --> 53:38.340
Griffin will just edit this, I'm sure.

53:38.340 --> 53:40.180
Oh, he's got sins.

53:40.180 --> 53:41.620
I saw The Sitter.

53:42.740 --> 53:47.940
And let me do one cold so you can just, in case the other edit's better, I'll just record this wild.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.580
The Sitter.

53:50.580 --> 53:51.060
Can I get-

53:51.060 --> 53:53.060
Can we get a Cyrus goof?

53:53.620 --> 53:53.940
What?

53:53.940 --> 53:54.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.060
Cyrus.

53:57.060 --> 53:58.180
Cyrus.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.940
All right, we're doing great here.

53:59.940 --> 54:02.020
We're doing great picking on Jonah Hill.

54:02.020 --> 54:06.980
How do you get someone like Jonah, someone of the Jonah Hill echelon to notice you on Twitter?

54:06.980 --> 54:08.740
Someone from the Brat Pack.

54:08.740 --> 54:09.380
What are they called?

54:10.420 --> 54:12.420
I think they're just friends of Judd Apatow.

54:12.420 --> 54:13.860
Aren't they the Frat Pack?

54:13.860 --> 54:15.300
The Frat Pack, I think, actually, maybe.

54:15.300 --> 54:18.980
No, isn't that, like, I don't think that's the same circuit.

54:18.980 --> 54:21.620
That's like Will Ferrell and all those guys.

54:21.620 --> 54:26.340
I think maybe it had something to do with weed, because they all seem to have quite an affinity.

54:26.340 --> 54:28.420
Did you just call him Will Ferrell?

54:28.420 --> 54:30.260
It came out wrong, I'm sorry.

54:30.260 --> 54:33.860
Did you hear the new Daft Punk?

54:33.860 --> 54:36.900
The new Daft Punk with the samples from Will Ferrell in it?

54:36.900 --> 54:37.380
It's great.

54:37.940 --> 54:40.580
Does that one impression of that guy from that thing?

54:42.020 --> 54:47.620
Jonah Hill seems to be the type of celebrity that, while, I mean, he's definitely up there,

54:49.220 --> 54:53.940
it strikes me that he's not like a Brad Pitt level kind of like-

54:53.940 --> 54:56.420
Oh, some of that did rub off during Moneyball.

54:56.420 --> 55:00.340
You're in a movie with Brad Pitt, and you get the sexiness that follows you along.

55:00.340 --> 55:03.380
And if you don't believe me, watch Jonah Hill on Moneyball, then watch him in This is the End.

55:04.020 --> 55:07.940
Dude picked up, like, dude got some shit definitely figured out between those two films.

55:07.940 --> 55:09.700
How do you get someone to mention you on Twitter?

55:09.700 --> 55:10.580
How do you get someone?

55:10.580 --> 55:12.820
I think if you just tweet at him and say,

55:12.820 --> 55:14.820
hey, Jonah Hill, I'd die for you, follow back.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.500
RT, please, for a friend.

55:16.500 --> 55:17.620
The problem is, you gotta-

55:17.620 --> 55:18.900
Rinse and repeat.

55:18.900 --> 55:23.940
What's important is you have to look at his feed, right?

55:23.940 --> 55:27.700
You look for people he has tweeted to.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.620
Has he tweeted to fans, right?

55:29.620 --> 55:36.100
Has he said, hey, shout out to my boy, this guy, or replied to anyone?

55:36.100 --> 55:40.180
And I'm looking through his feed, and I don't think he's ever replied to anyone.

55:40.180 --> 55:44.020
So I think you're wasting your time with this right now.

55:44.020 --> 55:46.500
I think you need to move on to greener pastures.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.900
Or just go directly to get him to see you in real life.

55:48.900 --> 55:54.340
The tried and true method used to be you try and kill Ronald Reagan.

55:55.460 --> 55:56.580
But that method doesn't-

55:56.580 --> 55:58.340
You can't do that method anymore.

55:58.340 --> 55:58.980
You can claim-

55:58.980 --> 55:59.780
That used to work for everybody.

56:00.420 --> 56:03.700
Or you could claim responsibility for his death on Twitter,

56:03.700 --> 56:07.940
and then that might be enough to peak his interest.

56:07.940 --> 56:12.340
Kill a Ronald Reagan, because I bet there's more than the one.

56:14.340 --> 56:17.940
I'm hoping that one of the ways to get the attention of Jonah Hill

56:17.940 --> 56:21.220
is not to make fun of a couple of bad movies he's been in, because-

56:21.780 --> 56:23.220
Yeah, and first of all, we have to think-

56:23.220 --> 56:24.820
Jonah Hill and Justin got beef.

56:24.820 --> 56:27.620
First of all, if he is listening to this, I hope he doesn't get upset,

56:27.620 --> 56:30.340
because really, how long did we have to think before we could think of a bad movie

56:30.340 --> 56:30.980
that he was in it?

56:30.980 --> 56:36.340
And really, the average length of time that it would take to think of anybody in a bad movie

56:37.300 --> 56:39.460
is much, much shorter than it took us to think of Jonah Hill.

56:39.460 --> 56:42.100
Jonah Hill, he did his time.

56:42.100 --> 56:43.140
He did his Cyrus.

56:43.140 --> 56:45.380
But he's making fucking solid goal hits now.

56:45.380 --> 56:46.660
I love that dude.

56:46.660 --> 56:48.180
Did you guys see 21 Jump Street?

56:48.180 --> 56:48.740
Yes, I did.

56:48.740 --> 56:50.580
It's a fucking great movie, Jonah Hill.

56:50.580 --> 56:51.300
I'm so sorry.

56:51.300 --> 56:53.220
Follow me on Twitter, Griffin McElroy.

56:53.220 --> 56:55.140
You know 22 Jump Street is coming, right?

56:55.140 --> 56:56.500
Oh no, is it?

56:56.500 --> 57:00.180
I just learned that from his Twitter feed.

57:01.220 --> 57:03.620
Follow back, follow back, Jonah Hill.

57:03.620 --> 57:05.140
Oh, that's a good way to get him to notice you.

57:05.140 --> 57:06.180
Be Channing Tatum.

57:06.740 --> 57:08.900
Yeah, if you can be Channing Tatum, I bet he'll reply.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.660
Pretend to be Channing Tatum.

57:10.660 --> 57:12.100
I don't think that's going to work.

57:12.100 --> 57:13.060
There's anonymity.

57:13.060 --> 57:18.580
Okay, Griffin, you were all about shoplifting, but identity theft is a sticking point for you.

57:18.580 --> 57:19.700
I mean, it's just harder to do.

57:19.700 --> 57:22.100
You can't walk in and take Channing Tatum.

57:22.660 --> 57:23.220
You know what I mean?

57:23.220 --> 57:24.580
You can't just like go into Channing Tatum's house.

57:24.580 --> 57:25.700
Wait, wait, Ocean's 15.

57:25.700 --> 57:26.580
Ocean's 15.

57:26.580 --> 57:28.420
We gotta have Channing Tatum.

57:28.980 --> 57:30.900
Oops, we stole Stockard Channing.

57:30.900 --> 57:31.700
It's okay.

57:31.700 --> 57:35.300
That's an easy mistake for anyone to make, including Griffin, constantly.

57:36.660 --> 57:38.420
Every goddamn day.

57:39.300 --> 57:42.260
I'm sorry, I skipped Ocean's 14, you guys.

57:42.260 --> 57:46.740
It's okay. Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

57:46.740 --> 57:48.740
We hope you've had some fun.

57:48.740 --> 57:50.740
We're sorry we were not with you.

57:51.380 --> 57:58.500
The funny joke about the greatest hit shows is they take infinitely longer to edit together.

57:59.140 --> 58:02.740
And also requires us to listen to when we weren't as bad.

58:02.740 --> 58:03.700
I don't know.

58:03.700 --> 58:06.340
Do you think we were better in the days or do you think we were shittier?

58:06.340 --> 58:08.180
Because I always think we're shittier.

58:08.180 --> 58:11.140
Because it takes us- I think our highs were higher and our lows were lower.

58:11.140 --> 58:15.220
We're so, so much lower because it takes us so long to find gems in the shit.

58:16.020 --> 58:18.020
But thank you for downloading that.

58:18.020 --> 58:23.460
We hope that this week, if you get a second, it would be awesome if you share the show with people

58:23.460 --> 58:24.900
or review it on iTunes.

58:24.900 --> 58:27.620
You know, something to help us spread the word.

58:27.620 --> 58:30.980
We don't have a big, you know, we don't have a big PR firm behind us.

58:30.980 --> 58:32.260
We don't have a Herald.

58:32.260 --> 58:33.540
We only have you.

58:33.540 --> 58:36.820
So we need you to help us pass the word around.

58:36.820 --> 58:42.980
And we'll do our part right now by recommending some of the other great Maximum Fun podcasts,

58:42.980 --> 58:44.740
like stop podcasting yourself.

58:44.740 --> 58:49.380
Judge John Hodgman, Jordan Jesse Goh, Wham Bam Pow, Bullseye.

58:49.380 --> 58:50.340
One Bad Mother.

58:50.340 --> 58:51.460
One Bad Mother.

58:51.460 --> 58:53.060
And make sure you check out Sawbones.

58:53.060 --> 58:54.980
It's the show Justin does with his wife, Sydney.

58:55.620 --> 58:57.380
It's mine and Teresa's favorite.

58:57.380 --> 58:58.820
We listen to it constantly.

58:58.820 --> 59:00.260
We listen to old episodes.

59:00.260 --> 59:05.060
Catch the fucking Sawbones wave that is like sweeping, sweeping the nation.

59:05.060 --> 59:08.740
Justin's too humble to talk about this, but that show is about to start doing better than

59:08.740 --> 59:09.620
this one.

59:09.620 --> 59:11.780
Yeah, it was in like the top 10 on iTunes.

59:11.780 --> 59:12.500
That's sickening.

59:13.380 --> 59:15.860
It's disgusting, but we try our best.

59:15.860 --> 59:21.140
Thank you to people tweeting about the show like Ian Dukes, Caitlin Klein, Josh, Diabolical

59:21.140 --> 59:27.300
Machines, JP, Matt Brown, Ryan Lynch, one gentleman named Comedy Podcasts.

59:27.300 --> 59:29.140
I don't think he's a person.

59:29.140 --> 59:31.140
Sam Lubega.

59:31.140 --> 59:34.900
Is it Lubega Senior?

59:34.900 --> 59:36.580
Lubega Vivo.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.460
That's Lubega's official YouTube channel.

59:39.460 --> 59:39.780
What?

59:40.660 --> 59:45.220
I don't think it is actually Lubega's Vivo channel.

59:45.220 --> 59:46.180
Still, that's a great Twitter name.

59:46.180 --> 59:46.900
It is a great Twitter name.

59:48.820 --> 59:53.220
Church's wife, her old friend, Jess Krawowsa.

59:53.940 --> 59:55.620
I'm sorry I messed that up, Jess.

59:55.620 --> 59:59.380
And thank you to everyone else listening and sharing the show.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.260
It really means the world to me.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.620
Justin, open up that mailbag.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.340
Tell us what's in there.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:03.860
Oh, crap.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.540
We got so much mail from you guys.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.220
No fewer than three wedding invitations.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.580
Can you please make sure you respond to those?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.020
Wedding is a fucking month out, and I'm still missing RSVPs from people.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.100
Are any of them near any of us?

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:20.260
Yeah.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.540
Is there any in Cincinnati?

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.820
They're actually all past because I forgot to check the mailbox for a while.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.460
You did.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.180
But I did spend.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:26.660
Okay, listen.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.220
I'm trying my best.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:31.140
Can you RSVP now at least so you don't, like, I don't want people to think that I'm a dick

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.580
just because you're a layabout.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.900
Kate and Liz sent us a horse named Orb that they got in Iceland.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:45.140
We got a note from Erica, Sam, and Kim that has pictures of gorillas on it.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:45.700
You like that?

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:51.940
Got one from China from Paden that's lovely.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.940
Is it a postcard, or do they live in China?

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.540
It's a postcard from China.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:02.340
Our uncle traveling, Matt, sent us postcards from all over, including but not limited to

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:10.740
Portland, Los Angeles, Olympia, Seattle, Chicago.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.860
He sent us one from there.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.700
Catherine and Matthew sent us a beautiful postcard from Croatia.

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.340
We got to save the date for Joanna and Kyle's wedding.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.140
Not going to be able to make that one because it is past, but gosh, I wish we could have

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.460
saved some for any parent.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.740
Hold on, fuck, we got to save the date and we already missed the wedding?

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.180
Sorry, okay?

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.220
I'm trying my best out here.

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.300
Corinne and Kevin, again, sorry we couldn't make it.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.380
That was in August, but, uh, and-

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.100
Jesus!

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:34.500
By this much!

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.380
John and Benjamin-

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:35.780
By a hair!

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.420
John and Benjamin, consider this our RSVP.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.620
Sorry we couldn't make it.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.180
Uh, sorry I didn't check the mailbox for so long.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:42.900
With regrets, I guess, kind of.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.260
With regrets, uh, I guess.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.620
Uh, I want to thank- I want Griffin to thank John Roderick and the Long Winners for the

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.420
use of a theme song.

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:52.740
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.700
Griffin, can you do that real quick?

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.180
Thanks, guys.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.140
And thanks to you.

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.340
Here's one last question.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.660
Oh, make sure if you, uh, if you want to wish someone a happy birthday or if you know someone

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.820
that's a fan of the show and you want to send out a special personal message to them, go

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.940
to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.060
Can you guys please-

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:15.540
I love you so much, but please don't email us because we have no mechanism to set it

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:15.700
up.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.380
You have to go through maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.580
No, but we appreciate your emails.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.500
If you just want to email us and just like chat.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.420
Um, guys, 20 dirt?

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.700
We're like 60 days left in it.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.460
Can you fucking believe that?

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.980
Did you get all your dirt out?

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.100
Did you dig it up?

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.820
Wash it out.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.380
Wash it out.

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.180
Rinse out those sheets.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.380
What's 2014 going to be?

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:42.580
You know, I- somebody emailed today and said, uh, go full war in 21-4, which I really kind

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.220
of liked.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:43.860
We'll figure it out.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.820
We'll get it together.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:50.100
Um, I feel like tomorrow- next year- tomorrow year is going to be a banner year for us,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.740
and it's not going to be much harder to beat this year, I think.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.180
Yeah, we'll actually do a live show.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.300
We'll actually do live shows.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.820
That's my promise to you, the listener.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.180
We'll do live shows, I promise.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.460
We'll have time on our hands.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.260
We'll have time to do it.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:04.980
And I'm going to try- I'm really going to push us to try to do something in the UK in

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.700
the next year or two.

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.020
Oh, Jesus, just don't promise that.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.540
I mean, just don't promise it.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.420
Griffin, take us out.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.060
I said push.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.100
I didn't promise nothing.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.100
Final Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:14.900
Thanks, Alan Black.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.620
It's by Yahoo Answers user Rosalie, who asks,

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.220
What the heck is masturbating?

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.540
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.420
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.540
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.900
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.860
Kiss your dad.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:47.940
Square on the lips.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.860

This is Teresa.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.180
We host a show called One Bad Mother.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.420
We're a comedy podcast about parenting.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.820
Not a parenting podcast.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.460
And for some reason, we seem to be most popular among single dudes with no kids.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.340
Weird.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:13.300
The only advice you'll get from us is when we tell you to stop feeling like shit for

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.100
being a mom.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:14.820
Or a dad.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.700
Or, you know, a single person with no children.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:28.900
