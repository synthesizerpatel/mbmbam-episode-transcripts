00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.560
It's a new craze, and good girls do you want it? Just say, hey, I wanna. Just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.560 --> 00:48.320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern

00:48.320 --> 00:52.720
era. Griffin, don't stop. For God's sake, don't stop. I'm- but my back is so tired. I've been

00:52.720 --> 00:56.880
shoveling. I've been shoveling all morning and afternoon. But we're so close. Don't stop now,

00:56.880 --> 01:04.000
Griffin. Hold on, I think I've hit- I've hit the cedar coffin within which- this is gonna sound

01:04.000 --> 01:08.880
like Justin's dead. He's not dead. No, to let you guys know what's up, um, as a publicity stunt for

01:08.880 --> 01:18.240
the Max Fun Drive, uh, Justin, uh, on his request, uh, was buried alive, um, for a week, um, to help

01:18.240 --> 01:22.720
raise awareness of the Max Fun Drive, and now, uh, it's the groundbreaking. We're gonna release

01:22.720 --> 01:32.640
him out back into, uh, Justin. Welcome back. Oh my god. We did it. We did it. We did it, man. Max

01:32.640 --> 01:38.160
Fun Drive was a huge success. They said it couldn't be done. We did it. You have no idea how many

01:38.160 --> 01:44.320
people donated and said it was just because of your brave- your brave duplication of David Blaine's

01:44.320 --> 01:50.480
bravery. Did you- did, um, did a lot of people- were a lot of people- oh, hold on. I'm just trying

01:50.480 --> 01:56.080
to get my bearings. Were a lot of people, um, moved by it? Is that why they wanted to donate?

01:56.960 --> 02:05.520
Um, did you- do you have, like, a contact list for the people that you told about being buried? Did

02:05.520 --> 02:09.360
you- do you have, like, a- did you make a list of people that you told about being buried alive?

02:09.360 --> 02:14.320
No, no, you guys were- were telling people that I was- while I was buried alive, and that you were-

02:14.320 --> 02:18.320
No, no, you were buried alive. Griffin was digging, and I made the lemonade, and then you

02:18.320 --> 02:21.920
were supposed to tell everybody. Travis did lemonade. He- look at the list here. This list

02:21.920 --> 02:26.720
says lemonade Travis digging Griffin, and then you were buried. I- I was buried! That's, like,

02:26.720 --> 02:30.720
the biggest part of the job! I don't know. No, I made a lot of lemonade. I made, like, a week's

02:30.720 --> 02:36.320
worth of lemonade. What? Okay. Yeah, and I was using a baby sand castle shovel. The last thing I said

02:36.320 --> 02:41.840
before they nailed the coffin is make sure to have- that seems excessive, didn't it? Big- it was a

02:41.840 --> 02:46.400
little bit much. Were we afraid of him getting out? Yeah, yes. Make sure to throw a big charity event

02:46.400 --> 02:50.080
and see if Little Richard could come. We did that. Because he really- you were supposed to get Little

02:50.080 --> 02:55.200
Richard! He was there, but we didn't tell anybody else. It was basically just me, Griffin, and Little

02:55.200 --> 03:01.040
Richard. He was really cool, though. He was a really cool guy. He donated. He loves the shows.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.760
He did five dollars a month. He did five, which, you know what? I think he could probably do a

03:05.760 --> 03:10.160
little bit more, but then again, maybe not. Yeah, he had not a lot of hits lately. Time's been tough.

03:10.160 --> 03:15.040
For those of you- even though you didn't know- the fact that you guys donated so much,

03:15.040 --> 03:21.840
and did not know I was locked underneath the earth, is extremely, extremely moving to us,

03:22.400 --> 03:28.320
and it is- it means the world. And I try to respond to everybody who donated and mentioned

03:28.320 --> 03:33.280
on Twitter. If you didn't- if anyone responded, let me know, and I will personally thank you,

03:33.280 --> 03:40.320
because you guys are amazing. We crushed our goal, and you really help us to keep the show going. So,

03:40.320 --> 03:47.440
thank you so, so, so much. You are- You helped Justin face his fear of claustrophobia.

03:47.440 --> 03:53.280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We are not getting into revisionist history here with the stunt.

03:53.280 --> 03:59.440
This is not a spirit journey for me. I was- this is not a sweat lodge, okay? You- this

03:59.440 --> 04:05.440
was a boner on your guys' part. You boned it. We boned it. That lemonade was fucking great,

04:05.440 --> 04:08.880
though. Thank you. Did you say- Travis puts a little cayenne pepper in there,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.320
so while you're drinking- Yeah, just a little bit of kick.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.520
Just a little bit of kick, and while you're drinking it, you're also cleansing.

04:13.520 --> 04:20.640
It's semester cleanse lemonade. Why would he drink- Hey, let's get to some advice.

04:21.840 --> 04:27.520
Our first question comes to us from our friend- oh, there's no- it's not sourced here.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.800
Our friend Gmail, the platform. Our friend Gmail platform. I am Gmail platform.

04:32.800 --> 04:39.120
Uh, I'm a single male in my mid-20s. I'm proud whenever I go on a first date with a lovely lady.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.440
I consider myself fairly forward-thinking, and I don't feel as though I should pay dinner,

04:44.400 --> 04:51.840
drinks, the movies, etc., simply because I am a man. Oftentimes, the women I'm dating are equally

04:51.840 --> 04:57.680
as forward-thinking and offer to split the bill, but sometimes that's not the case. How do I explain

04:57.680 --> 05:03.440
that I feel two adults, each gainfully employed, should share expenses without sounding like I

05:03.440 --> 05:09.040
just want to be friends? Now, this isn't the funny answer, but this is the real answer.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.720
Okay. You're looking at this wrong. How is-

05:12.720 --> 05:17.760
You're not paying for it because you are a man. You are paying for it because you invited them

05:17.760 --> 05:18.720
out. Yeah.

05:19.600 --> 05:24.400
You are paying- you are treating them to dinner. It is not- it has nothing to do with a male-female

05:24.400 --> 05:29.200
relationship. It's the same as if you took a friend out for a birthday or if you took

05:29.200 --> 05:34.880
a visiting, you know, brother, sister, parent out to dinner. You're taking them out to dinner.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.000
That's why you're paying for it. Yeah, and if you invite somebody-

05:38.000 --> 05:41.680
if you're looking for- if the question is, like, how do I get a read on the situation?

05:42.560 --> 05:49.920
I think the right move is to offer, but it's not necessarily, like- for me, at least, dating isn't

05:49.920 --> 05:57.600
it connotated on who pays. Like, when I go to dinner or lunch with a friend,

05:59.120 --> 06:03.200
we usually- each person will usually offer to pay, and then we'll kind of- I mean, because

06:04.160 --> 06:07.680
it's like a nice thing to do. I don't think there's necessarily a dating, not dating thing.

06:07.680 --> 06:13.920
I think you offer, and if they say, well, let's split it, like, I think that that is completely-

06:13.920 --> 06:17.760
I think that that's your sign right there. I think you should always be willing to pay,

06:17.760 --> 06:22.560
but that doesn't mean you have to, you know, especially on the first date, you know, be

06:22.560 --> 06:28.320
willing to, and then say, like, you know, this one's on me, with the implication being that

06:28.320 --> 06:33.200
maybe the next time you guys go out, it'll be on her, or, you know, you'll split it the next time,

06:33.200 --> 06:37.360
or once it settles into a groove, and then you don't have to discuss it every time.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.440
You know, Teresa and I, at this point, we've been together two years. We split things and

06:41.440 --> 06:47.440
each pay for things all the time, but, you know, in the beginning, I paid for things until that

06:47.440 --> 06:51.920
was kind of established, because it is still, in this day and age, a really hard conversation to

06:51.920 --> 06:56.800
have, to be like, so you're paying, right? You know what really brings a new couple

06:56.800 --> 06:59.440
together on a first date, though? What's that, what?

07:00.240 --> 07:04.400
Dining and dashing. Oh, commit a secret,

07:04.400 --> 07:09.440
commit a secret little crime. If you think about it, sorry, restaurant workers, listeners of our

07:09.440 --> 07:15.120
podcast, dining and dashing really isn't a crime. It's not a crime. As long as you leave a tip.

07:15.120 --> 07:21.440
Is it? Yeah, sure. It's as minor a crime as you can commit. So, yeah, just do that,

07:21.440 --> 07:26.960
and you guys will have a fun story for your kids about how you both went to prison.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.840
That's how Bonnie and Cly got started, though, and we all know how that ended,

07:30.560 --> 07:36.880
with an Oscar-winning movie and glory. Is that what you want? You want to be famous?

07:38.800 --> 07:43.200
I think you've got to, if you're really having a problem with this, you've got to get on

07:43.200 --> 07:51.440
OkCupid. You've got to get on Match.com because it is so codified there that the bill gets split.

07:53.120 --> 07:59.440
I think it's in the terms of service of the website. If you go on a date, you've got to split

07:59.440 --> 08:07.440
it. Just make sure that nobody locks you in their car and cuts all your skin off and then turns it

08:07.440 --> 08:11.840
into a suit, a beautiful suit for them. Yeah, so make sure that doesn't happen.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.640
Make sure that that particular, because that'll happen, and you'll say,

08:14.640 --> 08:20.800
oh, I wish I would have paid. I wish I would have listened to Griff and I'd still have my skin.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.800
I look like Inside Out Boy. Protect the skin you're in.

08:28.400 --> 08:34.080
Just don't use OkCupid. Use Match. OkCupid's a free service, and it's horrifying.

08:34.080 --> 08:40.240
It attracts a certain element as a free service. A certain, I would say, unmoneyed element.

08:40.240 --> 08:47.360
The last thing you want is an unmoneyed element in your dating pool. You want to keep it green.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.720
Or in your car or just your immediate presence because they have two to four knives on them.

08:54.240 --> 09:02.720
My friend keeps calling me her wife. I am in college with two roomies who I am good friends

09:02.720 --> 09:10.400
with. What started out as an inside joke between us has spiraled right out of the comfort zone. My

09:10.400 --> 09:18.320
one friend will refer to herself as my husband and call me wife or honey in public. She jokes about

09:18.320 --> 09:24.960
us sleeping together to others' friends and gives awkward hugs around my waist. Is there any gentle

09:24.960 --> 09:33.200
way to tell my friend she's creeping me out and that I want a divorce? That's from Miserable Misses.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.800
Oh my god. I need to like take a step back here and just pieces together.

09:40.160 --> 09:48.560
Is the emailer a guy? No, the email is a girl. Or a woman. She's of the female gender.

09:48.560 --> 09:59.360
She's of the female gender. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, man, that's a toughie. It's not.

10:00.720 --> 10:07.360
It's not? You just say, hey, just, you know, you're a great friend, but you're making me

10:07.360 --> 10:15.200
feel uncomfortable with this because I don't feel that way about you. And oh man, this is a...

10:15.200 --> 10:19.840
Yeah, right? Here's the tricky part about it. Because if she goes to her friend and is like,

10:19.840 --> 10:23.120
hey, back off this, your friend will say, what? Can't you take it? I was just kidding.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.040
It's a joke we've been playing. What's the matter? Jeez.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.360
Is that this, her friend is definitely, definitely a secret lesbian. That's what you're saying.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.400
Yeah. Sure. We know what you're saying. We've known you for like three decades.

10:34.400 --> 10:40.080
It could also be like a, what's the single white female? Is that the roommate thing?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.720
Really? No, it's the roommate. No, I'm sorry. It's swim fan.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.760
Swim fan. No, I'm sorry. I know what you did last summer.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.560
She might be swim fanning her last summer.

10:52.800 --> 10:58.880
You're saying that she loves her friends so, so, so much that she will kill her in a public pool.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.400
Yeah. It doesn't have to be like a lesbian thing. It could just be like,

11:02.400 --> 11:08.480
she's obsessed with her friend a little bit. Come to my brother and me, ask us to fix your problems

11:08.480 --> 11:11.920
and we will create much worse problems that you did not even know existed.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.080
Listen, all I'm saying is your friend's going to kill you.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.600
In a pool, a public pool. Count your blessings. It could be way worse.

11:18.560 --> 11:23.680
Well, it couldn't be way worse. It could be in a public jacuzzi, which are gross.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.840
This has nothing to do with, if your friend is making you feel uncomfortable,

11:28.960 --> 11:32.800
sexuality doesn't have to enter into it. You just tell them, hey, I wish you wouldn't do this

11:34.080 --> 11:41.040
in public. It makes me feel uncomfortable. You really don't have to approach a larger question.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.680
Just say, hey, you know, I wish you wouldn't do that.

11:45.040 --> 11:45.600
Yeah.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.120
It makes me uncomfortable. And then-

11:47.120 --> 11:52.320
Especially start, start with the jokes about like you guys sleeping together and stuff like that,

11:52.320 --> 11:56.560
and just say like, hey, that's one step too far. And then you can scale back from there

11:56.560 --> 12:01.920
instead of trying to tackle the problem all at once. Right? So then start the conversation.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.240
So you backpedal into it.

12:04.240 --> 12:04.480
Yeah.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.520
Interesting.

12:05.520 --> 12:11.520
Well, instead of just like bursting into a room, like cut out the joke, sister. I'm out.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.400
I want to be your sister now. Pretend we're sisters.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.360
We're sister wives.

12:15.360 --> 12:21.200
And if that doesn't work, you realize that that's not what sister wives are about, right?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.840
It's about two sisters that are married to each other.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.640
That's not-

12:24.640 --> 12:24.880
No.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.520
I think that's it. It's about Tia and Tamara Mowry and they're married to each other. And

12:29.520 --> 12:30.720
also that's my guys there.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.840
No, but Tia and Tamara Mowry are married to the music.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.680
It's sister, sister wives.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.640
Let's, but what is Taj Mowry's relationship?

12:38.640 --> 12:41.120
He's the guy that married them to each other against their will.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.040
What are you talking about?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.800
Travis, that's, this is horrifying.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.160
And then he sowed them to each other.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.640
You're welcome, humans in a beat three. Good work, smart guy.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.080
Yeah.

12:54.080 --> 13:00.160
You could, poor smart guy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves because his show wasn't very

13:00.160 --> 13:05.520
good. But, so I guess maybe he gets exactly. Griffin, help us out.

13:05.520 --> 13:11.520
You want Yahoo? This one was sent in by Gali Ayali. Thanks, Gali. It's by Yahoo Answers user

13:11.520 --> 13:19.680
David Barnhouse, who asks, how to convince family to become nudist? How can I convince

13:19.680 --> 13:22.240
my family to become nudist and I am 14?

13:24.240 --> 13:24.960
Oh God.

13:24.960 --> 13:32.160
Now, you want to talk about awkward conversations.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.160
Hey.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.040
It starts with one sentence. Is it hot in here?

13:37.040 --> 13:45.920
Yeah. Hey, I found a cool way for us to keep our air conditioning bill down. Get your dick out.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.240
Get your dick out, dad and little bro.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.680
Hey, little bro. Hey, teach. Why are you here, teach?

13:56.720 --> 14:01.920
You heard. Teach heard it was going to get nasty over here. Get out of here, teach. Crazy dog.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.840
Is there anything we can do for this person?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.960
It's so sad, but 14 years old might be too late.

14:10.800 --> 14:15.120
Maybe if you, oh, did you suggest cranking up the thermostat?

14:16.160 --> 14:16.400
Yeah.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.200
Did you suggest that?

14:17.200 --> 14:23.360
Yeah. I don't think this is, I don't think trickery is going to play into it.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.840
So truth or dare?

14:25.840 --> 14:27.520
No. Oh Christ.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.040
Can you, can you burn all the clothes that's in the house?

14:34.000 --> 14:39.600
They come home. You, they come home. There is a mountain of clothes in the backyard

14:39.600 --> 14:44.320
and you are standing in front of it, naked and screaming. It looks like a scene out of

14:44.320 --> 14:49.040
Lord of the Flies and it's amazing. And they're so inspired by your example. And then you,

14:50.400 --> 14:53.520
you go to them and say, I'm so cold. Please give me your clothes. I'm a child.

14:54.160 --> 14:59.440
And then they give you their clothes and you say psych and you throw them in the fire too.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.600
And you flick your lit cigarette onto the gasoline soaked clothes.

15:05.600 --> 15:10.320
Now I just free, I just freed you. We just had a near life experience.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.240
Call me Tyler Durden. Let's do this.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.560
Call me Tyler Durden. I'm 14. I'm 14 year old Tyler Durden.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.240
I can't do Fight Club. I'm too little.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.480
I'm not allowed to watch Fight Club even.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.880
Let's find it on TNT. Get that edited version.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.840
How supportive is your family? Cause that's really the, that's what's,

15:30.960 --> 15:34.240
if you go to your family and you say, listen, mom, dad,

15:34.240 --> 15:37.520
little brother, little sis and grandpa, cause let's get nasty.

15:37.520 --> 15:45.200
Um, I am, I am deathly afraid of clothes. I'm, I'm just super scared of clothes.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.560
I don't like them. I don't like seeing them. I think that they're, you know,

15:48.560 --> 15:52.400
when I wear them, it's just like trapping my soul inside my body.

15:52.400 --> 15:57.360
When I want to just astral project it into the stars and become the most beautiful thing ever.

15:58.400 --> 16:04.080
Can, can do you, can you go with me? Can you support me on this, on this vision quest?

16:04.080 --> 16:08.640
Or just take all your clothes off and then your parents come home and you're like, check it.

16:08.640 --> 16:14.320
This is me. Like who's coming with me. You can hop on, you can either get on the train or get hit

16:14.320 --> 16:19.360
by the train, but either way I'm naked now. This is who I am. This is our reality.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.720
This is who I am. I wish you, I wish you were it too.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.880
Do you know who the first nudists were? Who's that Travis? Adam and Eve Griffin.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.240
That's beautiful. Adam and Eve. There weren't no clothes in the garden

16:30.240 --> 16:35.040
until that snake came along and ruined it all. That's true. All right. What if he,

16:35.040 --> 16:45.600
if all that's returned to innocence, style fails, you take the morey mom and dad.

16:45.600 --> 16:51.520
I want to be naked, live this dream with me. Also, are you my real mom? Let's take a DNA test

16:51.520 --> 16:57.520
right now. Also, I can't stop. I can't stop being afraid of bats. Please help me, Maury.

16:57.520 --> 17:02.240
This is tied to my nudity. I saw an episode of Maury recently where Maury likes to cure

17:02.240 --> 17:05.840
people of their fears by something Maury believes in called immersion therapy,

17:05.840 --> 17:11.280
where he, uh, it's like, I know you're afraid of band-aids. It's like, we're covering you in band-aids.

17:11.280 --> 17:16.880
Wake up. You've been covered with band-aids this whole time. There was a lady who was afraid,

17:16.880 --> 17:22.320
her big fear, tigers. And Maury brought a tiger. That's a perfectly reasonable fear.

17:22.320 --> 17:29.520
Can we all keep our fear of tigers? Can we not, not be afraid of tigers? Like that seems like a super,

17:29.520 --> 17:35.360
super good one. Deborah, just keep in mind that the tiger is just as afraid of you as you are.

17:35.360 --> 17:41.840
Oh, no, no, it wasn't. Sorry, you're dead. They're acting like it's a problem because like,

17:41.840 --> 17:46.720
I can't even look at Frosted Flakes. Don't get Frosted Flakes. Don't go to Frosted Flakes.

17:46.720 --> 17:52.640
Don't get Frosted Flakes. Don't go to Frosted Flakes. Don't eat Frosted Flakes. Get the off-bland, like,

17:52.640 --> 17:57.600
you know, toasted flakes. And don't go to Exxon. And like, I think that's pretty much it, right?

17:58.880 --> 18:04.720
Don't go to any Bengals games. My day-to-day exposure to tigers is actually pretty low.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.560
Now, I don't have to see a tiger if I don't want to. You know what? Thinking about that,

18:08.560 --> 18:13.920
mine might be a little bit too low. I'm not sure I'm getting enough vitamin T. I need to see more

18:13.920 --> 18:18.880
tigers every day. You should just start wearing, like, tiger print pants. You know what? That would

18:18.880 --> 18:28.480
be good. And then go visit this woman. Grr. Look at my pants. Ah! Ah! Girl, I'm not myers.

18:29.520 --> 18:35.680
I think you just gotta, you just gotta get naked. And then, if your family really loves you,

18:35.680 --> 18:45.280
they'll get naked too. Without saying a word. Without no discussion. And no looking. No one

18:45.280 --> 18:51.440
can look at anyone else. Please don't. The weirdest Thanksgiving dinner ever.

18:52.640 --> 18:58.960
Hey, Dylan. Here's your advice from your old buddies, my brother, my brother, and me. How

18:58.960 --> 19:05.360
about you just keep your clothes on? You're 14 years old. You don't get to do anything you want

19:05.360 --> 19:11.280
to. Why is this the one? We're not gonna let you drive, but we'll let you start an incest cult in

19:11.280 --> 19:16.880
your family and upset the delicate balance your parents have worked so hard to create. I'm sorry,

19:16.880 --> 19:23.280
you're 14. You don't get to do anything, and this is no exception. It makes me so bad. These kids,

19:23.280 --> 19:28.720
these kids today. Kids and their nudism. With their inya and their pictures of tigers.

19:28.720 --> 19:35.680
Is this an epidemic that I don't, are kids really like, did this happen on Glee? And now kids are

19:35.680 --> 19:42.000
like, I wanna- They already had, they already had, they had so many gay kids, they had to have a kid

19:42.000 --> 19:46.560
who like, pushed it even further. Pushed the envelope. And that's the nudist kid. It's like,

19:46.560 --> 19:52.640
Sue Sylvester, accept me for who I am. Please let me join the Cheerios. I don't have any clothes

19:52.640 --> 20:00.480
on ever. I'm a nightmare for the censors. It's hard to get me in scenes. And then at the end,

20:00.480 --> 20:06.880
everybody's like, we're so sorry we judged you. And they sing a hip hop version of The Streak.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.160
Oh God, Ray Stevens deep cuts.

20:12.880 --> 20:17.040
And Ray Stevens, it was like there, but like, it's not him. It turns out it's just the kid

20:17.040 --> 20:23.520
in the wheelchair with a fake beard. He's like, Ethel, don't look Ethel! And then they sing it

20:23.520 --> 20:29.280
with the, it's mashed up though. It's mashed up with Madonna's new track. So it's-

20:29.280 --> 20:30.960
And that episode won an Emmy.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.960
It's an Emmy winning episode. Also starring Uma Thurman is on that one.

20:36.240 --> 20:36.880
Let's move on.

20:37.760 --> 20:38.480
Do we have to?

20:39.600 --> 20:40.640
We need to.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.080
Story, by the way, TM, story by credit, Justin, Travis, by the way.

20:44.080 --> 20:50.160
Pilot script, we're pitching it. Universal, NBC Universal, please reach out to us. Fox,

20:50.160 --> 20:52.400
Fox Universal Entertainment, please reach out to us.

20:53.120 --> 20:57.120
Come at me. Come at me with your briefcase. Full of money.

20:57.920 --> 21:05.920
Hey, I always carry cash. My boyfriend never does. If a place is cash only, I pay, which is fine.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.880
Cashier's always hand him the change and he doesn't give it back to me. When I ask for my

21:10.880 --> 21:16.000
change, he books fund me for being cheap. Probably because he comes from a wealthy family and makes

21:16.000 --> 21:20.560
more money than I do. Sometimes he'll pay for something with my change and act like he's

21:20.560 --> 21:27.840
treating me. Also cash lent, never returned. How do I gently convince my boyfriend that money matters?

21:27.840 --> 21:29.520
That's from broken, broken hearted.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.080
Okay, first off, why are you letting your boyfriend hand money to cashier?

21:34.080 --> 21:41.680
All the women, independent, throw your cash right at him. You can pay for yourself. It's 2012.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.600
No, no, no, no, no. You're, you're misunderstanding. She gives the cashier,

21:45.600 --> 21:51.360
these cashiers are some pricks because she'll give them money. And then the cashiers,

21:51.360 --> 21:54.960
when they come back to the table or something, they give it to the guy.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.400
Oh, what?

21:56.400 --> 22:00.880
Just as if to say, sorry, sir, you accidentally let your woman have some money.

22:00.880 --> 22:06.400
I can't tell you how many times this happens on a day to day basis. When I go to a restaurant

22:06.400 --> 22:12.320
and my girlfriend orders a stiff IPA and I order, you know, like a-

22:12.320 --> 22:13.360
Shirley Temple.

22:13.360 --> 22:13.920
Something.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.000
Like some sort of mild Pinot Gris.

22:16.640 --> 22:21.680
Yeah. And then they flip them and I say, I don't like, I don't like what you've done here, sir.

22:22.880 --> 22:27.120
I detract 2% from the tip right there. I have a whole conversion rate for,

22:27.120 --> 22:32.080
for social and sexual faux pas and, and how I detract from tips.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.800
This is some horse shit and you shouldn't go to that restaurant anymore.

22:37.520 --> 22:45.520
How much, how much do you detract for taking the dish of butter and jamming it into a customer's

22:45.520 --> 22:45.760
face?

22:46.640 --> 22:49.200
I get bonus for that. Cause that's my fetish.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.920
That's how you do it. Okay.

22:51.920 --> 22:56.320
Yeah. I'm a butter side upper is what we, that's what we're called on the forums.

22:56.320 --> 23:03.280
Butter side uppers. How much do you, is it better or worse when after they jam it in your face,

23:03.280 --> 23:06.240
they say sloppy boy.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.120
Way better.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.000
Is that way better? Is that the only way Griffin can finish?

23:10.880 --> 23:12.240
Oh, I wish you wouldn't say that.

23:12.240 --> 23:12.960
Oh, but I did.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.680
Say that all you want. Just don't talk about like-

23:19.680 --> 23:24.240
But if I say it too much, you may have to excuse yourself.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.040
Yeah. Pardon?

23:25.040 --> 23:26.400
Cause apparently butter is your thing.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.080
How many places in this world are cash only these days?

23:31.600 --> 23:34.160
I mean, it's getting less, but they're still there, right?

23:34.160 --> 23:34.640
And everything.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.840
Well, I guess the easy answer then is stop carrying cash.

23:37.840 --> 23:42.320
I bought some, uh, some Girl Scout cookies outside of the Walgreens and I realized they

23:42.320 --> 23:47.280
didn't have any cash on me. And their, uh, their troop leader had one of those square

23:47.840 --> 23:53.360
things like an iPhone credit card reader. And I was like, God damn it, 2012. I love you so much.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.480
You got me.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.920
You got me. Now I can buy so many more cookies.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.560
Yeah. That's a little, that's a little bit much actually.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.440
I'm not sure that you need that kind of like direct access. Is there, is there a

24:05.440 --> 24:09.120
correlation between that and the fact that you're counting your K cows now? Is there-

24:10.800 --> 24:12.080
Things got a little hedonistic.

24:12.800 --> 24:18.000
Let's just say February was a rough, rough month for the diabetes that I almost got.

24:19.280 --> 24:23.440
Come to hedonism and cookies three. There are no rules.

24:23.440 --> 24:27.760
Can we get back to the issue at hand, which is that your boyfriend sounds kind of like an asshole.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.880
Hey, the thing may not be the, the money. It may just be that he's an asshole.

24:36.320 --> 24:42.640
It's just a, that's a, that's a shitty thing. Okay. First off, it sucks that a cashier would

24:42.640 --> 24:47.280
come back and give your money to him just because he thinks that the guy paid, right?

24:48.320 --> 24:51.600
You obviously handed this cashier the money. How fucking short is his

24:51.600 --> 24:55.520
He's like a fucking goldfish memory.

24:55.520 --> 25:00.160
So that sucks. What double sucks is that he takes the money instead of saying,

25:00.160 --> 25:02.960
Oh, this is awkward. This is yours. That sucks.

25:02.960 --> 25:08.400
What also sucks is him using your money to buy you things and say, don't worry about it.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.360
You're welcome. I love you. That's for you.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.880
There are a bunch of things there for people who like,

25:16.400 --> 25:19.680
for those of us who've gone around our lives, judging people all the time.

25:19.680 --> 25:25.280
Um, this judgment is, is it, man, it seems pretty clear cut.

25:25.280 --> 25:31.200
I am the sense that bothers me is when you ask for your change back, like, like, Hey,

25:31.200 --> 25:34.640
that changed his mind. He calls you cheap because he's rich.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.240
Like that sounds like that's what the, that's what like the

25:38.800 --> 25:43.200
bad boyfriend does before like a robber Baron does.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.800
Can I please have my money? Oh, you poor person and your change.

25:48.800 --> 25:56.160
Oh, it's adorable. Maybe you can eventually just going to start throwing it at her feet.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.680
Fine. Pick it up. Pick it up.

26:00.640 --> 26:05.760
If you don't want to leave this creep, you gotta tell him like, Hey, yeah,

26:05.760 --> 26:10.000
you come from a wealthy family, but I earned this money with the fucking sweat off my back.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.480
So stop robbing me. If you could do me a favor and stop fucking burglaring me.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.360
Every time we go to Applebee's, that would be fucking great.

26:17.360 --> 26:21.680
And stop making fun of me for going to Applebee's. It's all I can afford. Asshole.

26:21.680 --> 26:27.840
Jerk. Yeah. If you say that to him once, he's going to feel very bad about it.

26:27.840 --> 26:33.120
If he does not feel very bad about it, the door is right behind you, sister.

26:33.120 --> 26:37.040
It's time to pick up stakes and roll on out of there. Cause I'll tell you what,

26:37.040 --> 26:40.800
he sounds whack. He doesn't, he doesn't sound good enough for you. That's for sure.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.080
Oh, I'm going to Sherlock this shit. You ready? You ready for the Cumberbatch?

26:44.080 --> 26:48.080
Yeah. Your boyfriend never, your boyfriend never carries cash. Huh?

26:48.080 --> 26:50.800
But he says he's from a wealthy family. I ain't buying it.

26:51.520 --> 26:57.200
I think, oh shit, your boyfriend is broke like a bad joke.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.320
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

27:00.320 --> 27:06.000
He is tower heisting you every single time you go to dinner.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
You're being grifted. You're dating Alan Alda?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.880
You aren't. Oh good. Oh good.

27:12.880 --> 27:16.720
Hold on. A tower heist joke for everyone to enjoy.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.840
Travis, you know about the transitive property, right?

27:19.840 --> 27:23.600
If you make a joke about something that's not even remotely funny,

27:23.600 --> 27:26.160
then it's not funny in exchange.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.040
But you brought up tower heist and you opened the door like

27:31.040 --> 27:32.640
a poor man in the movie Tower Heist named Lester.

27:32.640 --> 27:40.720
You are getting taken to the bank and he is driving the car and you are, hold on.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.800
You're an ATM and he's putting a card in your slot.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.000
He's putting a card in there and he, but he's saying it's your card

27:48.000 --> 27:52.320
and he's taking your money and then he's spending it on rollerblades or something.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.160
It sounds like a boyfriend Ponzi scheme.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.160
I don't know what a Ponzi scheme is. Is your boyfriend's name Ponzi?

27:59.920 --> 28:02.160
He's a cool guy, but same Ponzi.

28:03.280 --> 28:07.520
Everything about this just reeks to high heaven of grifting.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.800
Yeah, it feels like a long con. It feels like a grift.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.280
You need to protect yourself, protect your assets.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.000
Speaking of protecting your assets,

28:20.720 --> 28:23.040
we would like to protect ours right now.

28:23.040 --> 28:39.040
Make a little money in the section of the show we like to call the money zone.

28:43.040 --> 28:43.920
Oh, hey, Trav.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.680
Hey, what's the matter, Justin?

28:46.960 --> 28:49.280
It's not a big deal. I don't think you'd understand.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.960
Oh, no, come on. Let's wrap.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.600
Well, I've been going store to store.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.080
Uh-huh.

28:54.080 --> 29:00.800
I've been looking at all my normal, my normal places that I normally head to.

29:01.600 --> 29:11.600
And I, for the life of me, cannot find a leather sleep sack that properly restrains me for my erotic play.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.440
Well, you're in luck, Justin.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.120
So, what do you, wait, what do you mean?

29:15.840 --> 29:18.480
Well, this week on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

29:18.480 --> 29:21.440
there is a synergy of energies coming together.

29:21.440 --> 29:21.940
Okay.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.560
The peanut butter and jelly of podcast and sponsor this week.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.560
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me and ExtremeRestraints.com.

29:30.560 --> 29:36.320
The crossover you knew had to happen is finally here.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.520
What do you want?

29:38.240 --> 29:41.520
Do you want Japanese silk bondage rope, 10 feet of it?

29:41.520 --> 29:44.000
Oh, we can get you that. It's just $11.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.280
You want a door jam bondage accessory?

29:47.280 --> 29:52.160
Maybe spicing's up in the boudoir.

29:53.440 --> 30:01.520
I think it's good to know that some of the things on Extreme Restraints may seem unusual to you at first,

30:01.520 --> 30:02.800
the first time you head there.

30:02.800 --> 30:06.880
But it's none of it is going to unnerve you as much as the way I say boudoir.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.800
So, I reset, I'm recalibrating.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.520
Now that you've heard me say boudoir,

30:13.520 --> 30:17.520
you can go to this website and just look around.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.560
Poke around. You don't know.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.240
And you know what's awesome?

30:20.240 --> 30:23.920
Right there on the first page, there's a little select area

30:23.920 --> 30:28.240
where you can pick what area of your body you would like to pleasure.

30:28.240 --> 30:28.880
Oh, really?

30:30.880 --> 30:34.560
So you just figure out where the sensitivity is there for you.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.480
Want nipple toys?

30:36.480 --> 30:38.640
You want nipple clamps that aren't toys?

30:38.640 --> 30:39.840
Those are for grownups.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.040
These are all for grownups.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.920
I'm sorry.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.280
Do they have anything for my weenus?

30:47.840 --> 30:49.120
Oh, your weener, huh?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.320
No, no, no, no, no.

30:50.320 --> 30:50.720
I'm sorry.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.040
I'm sorry.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.720
You misunderstood my weenus.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.480
The skin on your elbow?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.440
Sure, we can get you an arm binder.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.440
Right on the crook of your elbow.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.920
We can get you a strict leather bicep binder.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.840
Those are a steal at just $45.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.960
Or leather restraints, like whatever you need.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.800
They've got you taken care of.

31:10.800 --> 31:15.440
And now, as far as your weener, they actually do not have anything

31:15.440 --> 31:18.320
that interacts with the genitals at all.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.360
That's the only problem.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.160
Hold on.

31:20.160 --> 31:20.560
Stop.

31:21.520 --> 31:25.360
That seems like a huge market that they are not tapping into.

31:25.360 --> 31:25.840
I know.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.120
It's weird, right?

31:27.120 --> 31:29.840
They're supposed to be adult toys, but no, wait a minute.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.440
I was on the wrong page.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.480
They have literally everything you could ever imagine.

31:35.040 --> 31:40.560
Masturbation toys, other things, like everything.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.360
I don't even know.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.960
You need to get here and just get.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.640
It's 2012.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.440
You can get all this stuff on the internet and just check it out.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.240
I don't know.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.400
It goes like the full spectrum.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.360
Everything you could think.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.200
It is the full spectrum.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.640
If you want something tame, if you want handcuffs, that's cool.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.360
If you want something less tame, if you want a cage that you can put your penis in

32:03.360 --> 32:07.920
because it did something illegal and now has to go to genital jail, that's cool too.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.960
Anything is cool.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.880
It's all, this is extremistrains.com, catchphrase, it's all cool.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.360
Is that their catchphrase?

32:15.360 --> 32:20.640
Now, that does not apply to their burning mat that you put on your chest to burn your

32:20.640 --> 32:21.440
chest skin off.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.400
No, that's not cool.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.040
That's not cool.

32:23.040 --> 32:23.600
That's not cool.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.400
That's very, very hot.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.560
That is actually not a real thing.

32:26.560 --> 32:32.160
But yeah, I mean, they've got all the regular stuff, the vanilla stuff.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.440
You know, you want some shackles, you want blindfolds.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.200
They've got all that stuff.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.400
Oh, and say my favorite phrase that I found as I was browsing their site.

32:40.400 --> 32:48.480
And let's say, let's say you want some lube, but there's not enough at the store.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.320
You can get some lube in bulk.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.920
Gallons and gallons of lube.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.720
Bulk lube.

32:54.480 --> 32:59.680
The snippy lady at Kroger isn't going to raise her eyebrow at you for buying this lube.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.480
You're getting this at home.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.160
So get something, you know, get something a little more regular, something a little

33:04.160 --> 33:08.880
more vanilla, and then maybe throw something a little crazy in there.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.200
See what the hubbub is about.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.080
You've earned it.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.240
And here's the exciting part.

33:14.240 --> 33:19.600
From the point of this commercial, for the next year, if you enter the coupon code MIDDLEST,

33:20.480 --> 33:21.840
you get 10% off.

33:21.840 --> 33:26.640
And for the next week, from today on for a week, if you enter it, we're going to double

33:26.640 --> 33:28.400
that and you get 20% off your order.

33:28.400 --> 33:33.200
You are going to need to build a new room onto your house to hold all the dildos that

33:33.200 --> 33:34.560
you are going to buy.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.720
Dildos, magic wands, throat gags.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.200
Hold on.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.160
Magic wands?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.320
Not that kind of magic wands.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.080
Wingardium Leviosa.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.040
Oh, yeah.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.200
Now my penis is flying away from me.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.520
No, come back.

33:50.880 --> 33:59.360
Guys, if you use the coupon code MIDDLEST to buy a vibrating cock ring, please don't

33:59.360 --> 34:02.880
tell us about it, but know that I feel it and I sense it.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.240
Somewhere in the universe.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.520
And it has made me so happy.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.240
This is probably the best thing we've ever done with this entire program.

34:08.240 --> 34:13.760
Go to ExtruderShanks.com and visit our buddy James and all the cool people over there and

34:13.760 --> 34:14.800
get yourself something fun.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.600
I'm sure it comes in discrete, discrete packaging.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.640
It's not going to you're not going to have a box sitting on your doorstep that says

34:22.640 --> 34:24.880
bulk anal lube inside open with care.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.000
Unless you want that.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.160
You can probably make a special request like draw a dinosaur on box with a speech bubble

34:30.160 --> 34:31.200
saying bulk anal lube.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.400
That is the only way.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.080
That is my particular fetish.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.000
So go for it.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.320
ExtruderShanks.com, spelled just the way it sounds.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.080
ExtruderShanks.com.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.320
I'm going to now to write a song about this.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.600
Griffin's being modest, of course.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.120
He wrote an entire album about this.

34:45.120 --> 34:45.620
Here we go.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.080
Put your dick in this cage.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.440
I'm just going to do a remix of Staxxope.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.200
Don't steal Staxxope's song.

34:57.200 --> 35:05.280
God damn it.

35:05.280 --> 35:11.120
Everybody's got some needs and everybody's got some wants.

35:12.400 --> 35:17.920
Extreme Restraints catalog of sexual products will fulfill both of those things for you.

35:17.920 --> 35:28.000
So visit ExtremeRestraints.com and get an electroshock paddle that goes on your balls.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.040
Is that a real thing?

35:32.480 --> 35:33.200
It should be.

35:34.720 --> 35:37.360
I'm going to request that you put a real product in there.

35:37.360 --> 35:46.320
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com and buy a ghost that you can fuck every night.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.400
That's not a thing.

35:50.400 --> 36:00.160
We need a site called ExtremeRestraints.com and buy a sexual fish tank.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.840
You're doing an ad for ExtremeRestraints.com.

36:05.840 --> 36:11.840
Go to ExtremeRestraints.com and learn about all the good chicken pot pie recipes.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.160
On the forums.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.840
Holy inaccurate.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.280
Everything you're saying right now is a bastardization of this product message.

36:22.240 --> 36:32.880
But go to ExtremeRestraints.com and you will find everything that you want and some things you didn't

36:32.880 --> 36:36.160
know you want and some things you might be surprised to find out that you do indeed want.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.880
How about a Yahoo?

36:38.880 --> 36:39.380
Yeah.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.360
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Mark Toretsky.

36:43.360 --> 36:43.920
Thank you, Mark.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Haley Grace who asks,

36:47.520 --> 36:51.360
My mom has changed my name four times legally since I've been born.

36:53.200 --> 36:58.960
Hello, I'm Haley Grace and I am 15 years old and my mom has legally changed my name

36:58.960 --> 37:00.800
four times since I've been born.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.960
When I was born, I was called Victoria Rose.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.480
Then when I was six months old, she legally changed it to Dracey Mae.

37:07.680 --> 37:11.680
Then when I was six, she changed it again to Rhiannon.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.880
And then she changed it again when I was 11 years old to Haley Grace.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.760
I have moved school five times and have moved house four times.

37:19.760 --> 37:23.040
My mom says don't ever say your name out in public.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.800
We never open our curtains in the house and I never have friends over to stay.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.120
I don't have any other family than my mom.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.640
Why does she keep changing my name?

37:30.640 --> 37:31.440
Is there a reason?

37:32.560 --> 37:35.680
Wait, this took a sharp left turn.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.000
Yeah.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.320
Yeah.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.680
Wait a- hold on just a one-

37:37.680 --> 37:41.200
So this isn't like crazy mom can't settle on a name.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.280
This is like they informed on the mafia.

37:44.080 --> 37:44.720
Or like-

37:44.720 --> 37:49.920
Or possibly that your mom fucking snatched you from a hospital when you were a baby and

37:49.920 --> 37:50.400
now has to-

37:50.400 --> 37:54.320
See, I was also gonna go towards they blew up like an animal testing research center in

37:54.320 --> 37:56.160
the 60s and she's on the run.

37:56.160 --> 38:01.440
No, no, I'm saying it's definite, definite baby kidnapping, keeping her head on a swivel.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.080
Could it be both?

38:02.720 --> 38:07.120
Just a really risky mom who both blew up an animal testing facility and stole a baby?

38:07.120 --> 38:09.920
It sounds like a really cool mom.

38:11.040 --> 38:11.360
Hey, cool mom you got there.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.440
Maybe they got her at the baby testing facility.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.560
Maybe they were doing-

38:14.560 --> 38:17.760
They blew up a baby testing facility, but they saved one baby.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.240
Well, you Travis, you saved the babies.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.760
Have you ever never watched TV?

38:21.760 --> 38:24.320
You get the animals out, then you blow up the building.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.840
Don't call babies animals.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.480
I'm saying in a normal thing, not like-

38:28.480 --> 38:30.320
Babies are animals though, if you think about it.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.080
At least often do tricks.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.720
Babies just remind you of your failed promise.

38:36.720 --> 38:37.840
That's not a trick.

38:37.840 --> 38:38.640
Can a person-

38:40.320 --> 38:44.080
Can a mom change their kid's name?

38:44.880 --> 38:45.360
At will?

38:46.240 --> 38:46.880
No, legally.

38:46.880 --> 38:47.280
They have to-

38:47.280 --> 38:48.880
I mean, I imagine there's some paperwork.

38:48.880 --> 38:51.600
I imagine court costs have to come into it too.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.080
But you know what?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.080
I bet in this day and age you can do it online.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.280
You think?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.240
A few clicks?

38:56.240 --> 38:57.520
Oh, I'm sure you can.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.240
Amazon?

38:58.240 --> 38:58.880
I tried to-

38:58.880 --> 39:03.680
Actually, I tried to change my AOL instant messenger name.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.800
I accidentally changed my real name to Blunt Lover.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.120
Blunt Lover 87.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.600
So that's my legal name now.

39:12.960 --> 39:18.160
If you're seen on Facebook when someone puts a really funny middle name in, that's legal.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.080
I wouldn't say funny.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.960
How shitty would it be to have a new name?

39:24.960 --> 39:25.520
Every time-

39:25.520 --> 39:27.280
Like, oh, I'm in middle school now.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.320
Time to celebrate.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.560
Now I'm called Beyonce.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.360
Fantastic.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.400
Thanks, Mom.

39:32.400 --> 39:36.400
I would love to be able to reinvent myself like that all the time.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.080
You'd be like Prince, you know?

39:40.080 --> 39:41.440
People would never know where you're going.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.680
You know what would be great?

39:43.680 --> 39:47.440
Instead of changing your name, you just add a name to your name.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.680
So like every time you move, you just add another one to the beginning.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.040
So I'm Victoria Rose, Dracey May, Rihanna, and Hailey Grace.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.240
Hi.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.280
Oh, you left.

39:58.400 --> 39:58.720
Okay.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.920
Could you be the kid formerly known as Hailey?

40:02.960 --> 40:03.760
Just go with that.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.720
An unpronounceable symbol that your mom can't pronounce on you.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.040
Now you're just an umlaut over no letter.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.880
That's your name now.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.960
Why is this mom changing the name?

40:13.840 --> 40:17.840
Why won't this mom let her say her daughter's name out in public?

40:17.840 --> 40:20.880
Because if she says her name out in public, the goblins can take her, Griffin.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.680
That's what it is.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.680
This is a Rumpelstiltskin situation.

40:24.400 --> 40:31.440
She promised her firstborn to some sort of diminutive but vengeful spirit.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.560
And now if the child's name is ever said aloud

40:34.560 --> 40:38.160
or not changed to a different Hannah Montana character every few years,

40:38.720 --> 40:42.480
then he'll come and find her and take her away on his big spoon.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.800
And you know, I see that happening more and more.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.120
Giant spoon?

40:47.120 --> 40:48.000
It's a giant spoon.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.440
He rides around on a ladle.

40:49.440 --> 40:50.080
Yeah.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.360
Rumpelstiltskin.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.680
Hold on, I gotta write this.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.240
I need to get a big spoon from Extreme Restraints.

40:57.360 --> 40:57.920
Sorry, go on.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.320
Can I tell you something, Griffin?

41:00.320 --> 41:01.440
Don't go with the fiberglass.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.200
You think the splinters aren't gonna be a problem?

41:03.200 --> 41:04.320
They definitely, definitely are.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.040
Definitely are.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.080
Gots to go with steel.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.360
Gotta go with steel.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.880
Well, careful with that, it gets cold.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.560
If it doesn't get cold, what's the point?

41:12.560 --> 41:13.440
Fair enough.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.800
So you have been kidnapped.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.680
Let's talk about-

41:18.560 --> 41:19.680
So you've been kidnapped.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.720
So you've been kidnapped.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.600
Let's talk about action plans here for a kidnapped person.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.840
One, do you like your new mom?

41:25.840 --> 41:27.200
Do you like new mommy?

41:27.200 --> 41:29.040
She may be nicer than old mommy.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.080
You don't know that.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.120
She actually kind of sounds like Anjelica Huston in every movie

41:33.120 --> 41:35.600
where Anjelica Huston plays an irresponsible mom.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.920
A wildly irresponsible mom.

41:37.920 --> 41:38.880
How many movies is that?

41:38.880 --> 41:40.240
How many movies is that?

41:40.240 --> 41:42.080
Did you confuse her with somebody?

41:42.080 --> 41:42.800
No, no, no.

41:43.360 --> 41:45.360
Several, several movies.

41:45.360 --> 41:49.200
Name one, and do not count Adam's Family Values.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.880
It is, I do not count it.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.440
How about fucking Darjeeling Limited?

41:53.440 --> 41:56.400
And how about, what was that one movie where...

41:57.600 --> 41:58.800
Oh God.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.800
There's another movie where she was a mom

42:00.800 --> 42:02.560
and she was horrible to her child.

42:03.200 --> 42:03.920
Hunger Games.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.080
I don't think that was it.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.120
I'm not sure that's what you're thinking of.

42:09.120 --> 42:09.840
X-Men 3.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.760
Fuck, what was that movie?

42:11.760 --> 42:12.400
God damn it.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.560
Is your mom Anjelica Huston?

42:15.360 --> 42:16.400
Oh, that might make sense.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.920
She might just be eccentric.

42:17.920 --> 42:20.560
Yeah, you know how those movie stars are.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.840
I don't know movie stars.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.600
One day your kid's name Apple the app,

42:23.600 --> 42:25.760
the next day he's name Henny Youngman.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.720
It's famous people for you.

42:28.720 --> 42:29.040
Choke!

42:29.040 --> 42:29.680
If anybody out there-

42:29.680 --> 42:30.480
It was choke.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.760
Everybody, it was choke.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.960
It was choke.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.440
You're right.

42:34.560 --> 42:38.320
I was, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.640
We did not plan this.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.480
This is a question from a listener.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.120
Oh my God.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.840
Hi, I was thinking I would legally change

42:47.840 --> 42:49.840
my full name after college.

42:50.560 --> 42:54.560
I've all decided my new first name to be Bishop,

42:54.560 --> 42:57.200
but I can't think of a last or middle name

42:57.200 --> 42:58.800
that sounds good with it.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.320
Do you think I should go through with this?

43:01.360 --> 43:03.840
If so, what should my new name be?

43:04.800 --> 43:06.880
That's fucking mysterious in Michigan.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.040
Are we serious with this?

43:09.680 --> 43:10.160
Is this?

43:11.680 --> 43:13.120
This is Haley Grace's boyfriend.

43:13.120 --> 43:13.620
Mm-hmm.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.000
My girlfriend keeps changing her name.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.200
I think it's a great idea.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.160
Yeah, I want to change mine to be an X-Man.

43:24.640 --> 43:25.140
Bishop.

43:27.280 --> 43:27.780
Bishop.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.120
Can I call you Bishop?

43:31.120 --> 43:32.000
Can I call-

43:32.000 --> 43:33.520
Should we goof on names to call him

43:33.520 --> 43:35.120
before I tell him not to do it?

43:35.120 --> 43:37.280
Yeah, yeah, let's get a solid,

43:37.280 --> 43:41.120
I'll say two and a half minutes of goofing on the name

43:41.120 --> 43:43.440
and then we'll get to the meat.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.880
You can stick with a chess theme

43:44.880 --> 43:46.720
and go like Bishop Rookpawn.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.220
Yeah.

43:48.320 --> 43:49.520
That's a bad name.

43:49.520 --> 43:53.680
Could you say Archdiocese as a name?

43:54.320 --> 43:55.040
Cardinal.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.720
Ooh, Cardinal's actually not bad.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.000
Bishop Cardinal?

43:58.000 --> 43:58.880
No, no, no.

43:58.880 --> 43:59.840
That's not so good.

43:59.840 --> 44:00.560
Major Major?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.600
Bishop Laser Killer.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.120
No, why would he kill lasers?

44:05.840 --> 44:07.920
No, he uses lasers to kill people.

44:07.920 --> 44:08.880
Bishop Dino Pal.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.440
He's friend of the dinosaurs.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.880
Bishop Exploder.

44:12.880 --> 44:13.440
Stop it.

44:14.160 --> 44:14.880
What's wrong with that?

44:15.840 --> 44:18.320
Bishop the Thundarian is that good.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.720
Bishop of Mars.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.760
I can't go any further.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.960
Don't fucking do this.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.240
Don't do this thing.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.680
I don't care what your old name is.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.400
It's your name.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.040
If you, you have been saving up,

44:32.400 --> 44:35.120
we're big on social currency on this show

44:35.120 --> 44:36.480
and when you change your name

44:36.480 --> 44:39.360
to to Bishop Rocketship

44:39.920 --> 44:42.080
or something even more ironic than that,

44:43.760 --> 44:44.800
you're gonna lose it all.

44:44.800 --> 44:46.560
You're gonna bankrupt yourself

44:47.120 --> 44:48.400
of all that currency

44:48.400 --> 44:49.680
and you're starting from scratch

44:49.680 --> 44:51.360
and let me tell you, you are,

44:51.360 --> 44:52.480
I don't know how old you are.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.800
You're about to graduate college.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.440
You are too old to start from scratch again.

44:58.880 --> 45:00.720
I also feel that changing,

45:00.720 --> 45:02.400
it's a lot like quantum physics.

45:02.400 --> 45:02.960
Hear me out.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.760
In, in observing the experiment,

45:05.760 --> 45:07.040
you're gonna change the outcome.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.160
So in consciously choosing your name,

45:10.960 --> 45:13.680
it's gonna be douchey no matter what.

45:14.480 --> 45:17.840
I like, if I don't think no matter what you choose,

45:17.840 --> 45:19.280
like because you chose it,

45:20.640 --> 45:22.320
it because it's a conscious effort,

45:22.320 --> 45:23.360
it's not gonna work.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.240
When I hear somebody say the name Griffin out loud,

45:26.240 --> 45:28.080
I think that it's kind of a douchey name,

45:28.880 --> 45:30.480
but I didn't give it to myself.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.480
So I haven't, I haven't actually

45:32.480 --> 45:33.840
I haven't out there.

45:33.840 --> 45:36.080
I can just say my parents gave it to me.

45:36.080 --> 45:36.880
So it's legit.

45:37.440 --> 45:40.320
But when I hear other people call themselves Griffin,

45:40.320 --> 45:41.280
I can't help but think

45:41.280 --> 45:43.520
that they are just calling themselves that as a nickname

45:43.520 --> 45:45.840
because it sounded cool that one time

45:45.840 --> 45:48.160
that they heard it on a comedy podcast

45:48.160 --> 45:49.920
or maybe back to the future part two.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.360
Mm-hmm.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.000
Exactly.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.680
Thank you for summing up exactly

45:55.680 --> 45:57.040
what I was getting at Griffin.

45:57.040 --> 45:57.280
Yeah.

45:58.000 --> 45:58.720
Concision.

45:59.600 --> 46:00.560
It's the name of the game.

46:01.440 --> 46:02.400
Bishop Concision.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.200
Bishop Concision.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.880
That's the name of the person.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.960
Don't, don't change your,

46:06.960 --> 46:07.920
don't change your fucking name

46:07.920 --> 46:09.760
because there's no name you can give yourself.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.760
This is like how you can't give yourself a nickname,

46:13.760 --> 46:16.880
but to a legal, like to the billionth degree,

46:16.880 --> 46:18.960
you can't, you cannot do this.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.720
Maybe instead of changing your name,

46:22.720 --> 46:24.400
you should change your outlook on life.

46:25.680 --> 46:26.480
Oh, wow.

46:27.280 --> 46:27.840
Whoa.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.760
We just opened up the secret in here.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.520
I look at this a lot the same way

46:31.520 --> 46:32.960
of people saying like, I want to like,

46:33.680 --> 46:35.600
get a radical hairstyle change

46:35.600 --> 46:37.920
or I want to get like a giant tattoo on my face.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.360
Like all that stuff is fine.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.840
But before you do it, really sit down

46:41.840 --> 46:44.560
and think about what's the real reason I want to do this.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.400
And I'd be willing to bet

46:46.400 --> 46:48.160
it's not because you don't like your name.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.360
What if, can we, hold on.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.160
Devil's advocate.

46:52.160 --> 47:02.880
What if his name right now is like Coney Diarrhea?

47:02.880 --> 47:04.560
We didn't consider the fact that his name right now

47:04.560 --> 47:06.080
might be Coney Diarrhea.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.240
So his name is Rock Jabroni.

47:08.240 --> 47:14.240
What if it's a real, real shitshow in there in that name?

47:14.240 --> 47:15.920
What if his name is Dennis Shitshow?

47:18.320 --> 47:20.240
I'm Dennis Shitshow, attorney of law.

47:20.240 --> 47:23.200
I'm Dennis Shitshow, third grade teacher.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.120
I'm Dennis Shitshow, plumber, get it?

47:26.480 --> 47:27.760
Late night comedy host.

47:27.760 --> 47:31.200
I'm Dennis Shitshow, your father,

47:31.200 --> 47:34.640
and you will obey me as long as you live under my roof.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.520
You are a shitshow, Daniel, and you will act like it.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.040
I think you just gotta,

47:41.920 --> 47:43.440
I think you just gotta let it ride.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.520
You gotta dance with the one who brung you, you know?

47:45.520 --> 47:48.160
And by the one, I mean your fucking legal

47:48.160 --> 47:49.440
God-given Christian name.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.080
Unless four different names brung you

47:52.080 --> 47:53.600
because your mom's a kook.

47:53.600 --> 47:54.160
Yeah, yep.

47:54.720 --> 47:57.280
And then in that case, I guess go hog wild.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.840
She raised you to change her name, so that's you.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.960
That's your identity.

48:01.680 --> 48:05.760
But I wouldn't, I don't think it's a good,

48:05.760 --> 48:09.040
I mean, I think Griffin's right that like the name is not,

48:09.040 --> 48:11.520
I mean, I think maybe this is like body modification

48:11.520 --> 48:12.560
or something, you know?

48:12.560 --> 48:15.440
You want to take ownership, but like, I don't know.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.920
It just seems like cheating, I guess, in a way.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.840
Like, I think we all wish we had names

48:19.840 --> 48:22.640
that were really, really cool.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.280
But, you know, most of us don't

48:25.280 --> 48:27.440
because we're not secret agents or whatever.

48:27.440 --> 48:28.960
Got kind of bummery in here.

48:28.960 --> 48:30.640
Yeah, how about a Yahoo answer?

48:30.640 --> 48:32.960
Yeah, let's clear out, let's open up the windows

48:32.960 --> 48:34.320
and try to sweep some of this bummer out.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.520
Don't change your name, though.

48:35.520 --> 48:36.960
Like, be proud of your name.

48:36.960 --> 48:39.040
Change your situation.

48:39.040 --> 48:43.680
Make people envious of Craig's Shitshow.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.520
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.080
Thank you, Lisa.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.560
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nathan, who asks,

48:49.840 --> 48:52.720
can I pack a toilet plunger in my airplane luggage?

48:54.160 --> 48:56.640
The question is as simple as it says above.

48:56.640 --> 49:00.080
I'm going, oh no, it is not.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.680
I am going on a trip next week

49:01.680 --> 49:03.600
and I am flying to my destination.

49:03.600 --> 49:04.480
Usually how it works.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.600
I like taking a toilet plunger when I drive

49:07.600 --> 49:09.360
so I don't have to call the hotel desk

49:09.360 --> 49:12.960
if a quote unquote bathroom issue arises.

49:12.960 --> 49:15.440
I know it sounds silly, but I truly want to know

49:15.440 --> 49:18.480
if I can pack a toilet, I think they mean a plunger.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.680
If I can pack a toilet in my luggage.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.160
This toilet's broken, I'm putting in my own toilet.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.680
Or if I can carry it on board the plane in a bag, of course.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.040
I really appreciate this.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.320
The problem with packing a toilet is that the caulk

49:32.320 --> 49:34.400
that you'll need to seal it is probably going to be

49:34.400 --> 49:35.520
over three ounces.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.120
So they're going to make you throw that away.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.840
And it's so hard to find travel size caulk.

49:39.840 --> 49:40.800
You know what?

49:40.800 --> 49:43.440
We, we, we like to have a good time here.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.880
Oh, my brother, my brother, hear me

49:44.880 --> 49:47.120
and poke fun at the occupants, guys.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.320
I like this gentleman.

49:49.040 --> 49:49.600
You like him?

49:49.600 --> 49:51.200
You think he's like industrious?

49:51.200 --> 49:53.840
I think, I think he's revolutionary, Justin.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.880
Go on.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.800
Have you never been in that situation?

49:56.800 --> 49:57.920
You've been at a friend's house.

49:57.920 --> 49:59.840
You've been at a hotel and you've clogged it.

50:00.640 --> 50:03.280
And you've had just like that horrifying moment of like,

50:03.280 --> 50:04.880
well, I have two options.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.040
I can either run away and never look back

50:07.040 --> 50:09.840
or I have to call, you know, the front desk.

50:09.840 --> 50:13.040
Or tell my friend like, hey, I'm really bad at bathroom

50:13.040 --> 50:13.760
and I broke it.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.360
It's a weird sort of like.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.560
You realize, you realize that clogging a toilet

50:18.560 --> 50:24.240
is not indicative of a deficit of bathroom skill, right?

50:24.240 --> 50:25.600
It seems pretty bad to me.

50:25.600 --> 50:29.040
Like you've been training for what, for me, 26 years.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.560
And like when I clog a toilet, it's like, hey, you failed.

50:32.560 --> 50:35.920
Griffin, if there aren't, if there aren't, you know,

50:35.920 --> 50:37.600
deficit in the bathroom skill, it's not a skill.

50:37.600 --> 50:38.640
Why do we have training pots?

50:38.640 --> 50:41.360
Exactly. You got to learn how to hold them.

50:41.360 --> 50:44.160
Know when to fold them, you know, I mean, your toilet paper.

50:45.040 --> 50:48.160
This is guy, I'm kind of, I'm kind of with you, Trev.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.000
Now, after thinking about this guy, because it's like,

50:51.520 --> 50:54.800
it seems like a crazy thing and maybe it is.

50:54.800 --> 51:01.040
But flip side, if it pays off, if he avoids a situation,

51:01.840 --> 51:04.080
he is suddenly the smartest guy in the room.

51:04.080 --> 51:04.960
That's what I'm saying.

51:04.960 --> 51:09.040
He, I mean, it's a real high bet, but it, but again,

51:09.040 --> 51:12.160
when it pays out, when that, when the, you know,

51:12.160 --> 51:16.560
comes up all cherries, it will make it seem like,

51:16.560 --> 51:18.720
well, why wouldn't you have a plunger with you?

51:18.720 --> 51:19.360
Of course you would.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.960
I can just write in my head, like the epic situation of like,

51:22.960 --> 51:25.520
as he goes through like the baggage claim and stuff

51:25.520 --> 51:26.960
and they're checking his carry on, they're like,

51:26.960 --> 51:28.160
oh, is this a plunger, bro?

51:28.160 --> 51:29.840
There's nothing illegal about it, but weird.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.280
What a weirdo, right?

51:31.280 --> 51:35.200
But then, then something occurs on the plane

51:35.200 --> 51:38.000
or the plane has to make an emergency landing on an island.

51:38.000 --> 51:38.800
Stop it, stop it.

51:38.800 --> 51:39.600
And they're like, if only someone had a plunger.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.200
There's no toilets on an island, Travis, you just.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.040
If only someone, no, they need the plunger to like,

51:43.040 --> 51:44.320
climb up a mountain or something.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.520
Why would that, what the fuck are you talking about?

51:47.520 --> 51:49.520
They use it like suction cups and they suction cup

51:49.520 --> 51:51.120
to the side of the tree or something.

51:51.120 --> 51:54.080
This isn't, this isn't an episode of Duck Man.

51:54.080 --> 51:57.920
And it stars, and it stars Morgan, Morgan Freeman's there.

51:57.920 --> 51:59.840
And he's like, oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.360
Morgan Freeman's there, and he's like.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.720
Why is Morgan Freeman there?

52:02.720 --> 52:04.240
There's no toilets on the island.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.360
He had the plunger, Griffin.

52:05.360 --> 52:07.040
He's a pilot, Travis.

52:07.040 --> 52:10.320
His friend, John Travolta, would probably fly him

52:10.320 --> 52:11.600
anywhere he wants to go for free.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.080
Maybe John Travolta's writing this question,

52:14.080 --> 52:15.440
and John Travolta wants to carry a plunger in his bag.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.600
You stupid asshole.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.160
No, you're not thinking three-dimensionally, Griffin.

52:20.160 --> 52:20.960
You're thinking very small.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.920
You're thinking inside the box.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.200
I'm thinking outside the box.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.240
There's no box.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.280
There's no toilets on islands.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.320
I'm operating on all these cylinders,

52:26.320 --> 52:29.200
and you're talking about like a tiny, tiny life.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.680
You're saying there are so many practical applications

52:31.680 --> 52:33.680
for a plunger that I can't even begin to understand.

52:33.680 --> 52:35.280
I'm just saying there's more than you think there are.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.600
Like, you have a very small plunger concept, and I think.

52:37.600 --> 52:40.880
You're saying you crash an island, you stand in the waves,

52:40.880 --> 52:42.960
and let your feet sink into the sand,

52:42.960 --> 52:43.920
and then you use the plunger.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.280
You raise the plunger above your head.

52:45.280 --> 52:48.400
You spear a fish, and then you suck into it.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.360
Okay, guys, stop.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.640
I'm putting a stop to this.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.600
There's only one way to settle this.

52:53.600 --> 52:53.840
Okay.

52:53.840 --> 52:57.040
And that is with a plunger usefulness face-off.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.080
Here are the rules.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.280
Okay.

52:59.280 --> 53:01.040
You guys are going to take turns.

53:01.040 --> 53:05.680
Each one of you has to describe a legitimate use

53:06.400 --> 53:09.920
for a plunger that might actually arise in travel,

53:10.560 --> 53:13.280
and through this method,

53:13.280 --> 53:15.520
we will decide the winner of this particular debate.

53:15.520 --> 53:15.760
Okay.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.920
Griffin, I'm going to start with you.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.720
Okay, you poop in a toilet, and you do a bad job,

53:20.720 --> 53:23.280
and you have to undo your mistake.

53:23.280 --> 53:24.320
Okay, Travis.

53:24.320 --> 53:27.360
Uh, you need it to take down a bat,

53:27.360 --> 53:28.800
so you swatted a bat with it.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.360
Okay.

53:30.160 --> 53:33.120
You have to, you get attacked by a dog,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.160
and you have to use it to fight off the dog,

53:36.160 --> 53:39.680
if that's a thing, if that's a concern.

53:39.680 --> 53:42.000
No points for creativity, but the judges accept.

53:42.000 --> 53:42.880
Travis, go on.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.480
Someone else has a plunger,

53:44.480 --> 53:46.560
and challenges you to a plunger duel at dawn.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.360
Mm-hmm.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.280
Griffin, you could challenge that.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.080
Uh.

53:50.080 --> 53:52.320
No, that's, no, that's, I'm going to let that one fly.

53:52.320 --> 53:52.880
Okay.

53:52.880 --> 53:57.680
Um, you, your traveler's checks get lost in the plane,

53:57.680 --> 53:59.120
because the TSA stole them,

53:59.120 --> 54:01.120
and so you have to sell the plunger for,

54:01.120 --> 54:02.080
to get money for food.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.960
It's also a gold plunger.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.040
The plunger's gold, I'm sorry, the plunger's gold.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.960
The plunger was given to you by an old wise man,

54:10.960 --> 54:13.600
and it's enchanted, and it saves the day somehow.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.680
It's a magic, my next, Travis,

54:15.680 --> 54:17.360
literally my next thing was magic plunger.

54:18.560 --> 54:20.640
Okay, so I think we can all agree on magic plunger.

54:20.640 --> 54:21.840
Those two cancel each other out.

54:21.840 --> 54:25.520
Um, you were too cheap to get on extreme restraints,

54:25.520 --> 54:27.280
and buy an actual sex toy,

54:27.280 --> 54:29.520
so you'd use the plunger for sex stuff.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.960
There's, it's got two, it's got two,

54:32.960 --> 54:34.720
it's got two pleasure ends, so.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.280
Heads or tails?

54:38.800 --> 54:39.280
Literally.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.640
Travis, I want to end on that one.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.560
Uh, so you concede.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.320
I do concede that you could use the plunger as a sex toy.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.640
If you're cheap, but it's not,

54:50.640 --> 54:52.320
it's not going to be the kind of high quality product

54:52.320 --> 54:54.160
you're going to find at extremerchains.com.

54:54.160 --> 54:54.640
Nope.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.840
With a coupon code MEDDLESS.

54:58.240 --> 54:58.560
Awesome.

54:59.280 --> 55:00.240
Fantastic.

55:01.040 --> 55:03.680
Helping, really helping people this week.

55:03.680 --> 55:05.680
Really building some bridges, I feel like.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.240
Out of plungers.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.040
Oh, that's another one.

55:09.040 --> 55:09.280
Oh shit.

55:09.280 --> 55:10.560
God, Travis wins!

55:10.560 --> 55:11.520
God damn it.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.600
Pulled it out at the last minute.

55:15.600 --> 55:17.280
Which by the way, by the way,

55:18.000 --> 55:19.600
if you are using the plunger as a sex toy,

55:19.600 --> 55:20.960
don't wait until the last minute to pull it out.

55:23.440 --> 55:25.920
Why would a great poster, a poster campaign?

55:25.920 --> 55:29.040
Are you afraid of getting pregnant by the plunger?

55:29.040 --> 55:29.760
I don't understand.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.160
Yes.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.840
Why am I so turned on right now?

55:35.680 --> 55:36.880
Oh God, I want to end it.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.280
Should we end the show there?

55:39.280 --> 55:39.920
Yes.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.280
Yeah, we did a great show.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.160
Great program.

55:42.160 --> 55:42.400
Thanks.

55:42.400 --> 55:43.360
I feel good about it.

55:43.360 --> 55:43.760
Thank you.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.720
Thank you guys so much for, again,

55:46.720 --> 55:48.240
for supporting us through the Max Fund Drive.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.760
You really are heroes,

55:49.760 --> 55:53.040
and we hope that you enjoyed all the bonus content

55:53.040 --> 55:53.760
and stuff you got.

55:54.640 --> 55:54.880
We really appreciate-

55:54.880 --> 55:56.160
If you donated at the last minute,

55:56.160 --> 55:59.200
like if you donated on Sunday,

55:59.200 --> 56:02.560
the bonus content is still available if you're a donor,

56:02.560 --> 56:04.160
so it doesn't go away.

56:04.160 --> 56:08.960
Yeah, so you can totally treat yourself still.

56:09.520 --> 56:13.360
And thank you to people who are tweeting about the show,

56:14.080 --> 56:17.120
the Justin, Kambo Soup, Iggy K,

56:17.120 --> 56:18.400
of course, the Real Neor,

56:19.520 --> 56:21.360
Undodly G Thomas, Nana Gross,

56:22.880 --> 56:24.880
everybody who tweets about the show.

56:24.880 --> 56:28.000
If you do, make sure you use the NBNBGAM hashtag

56:28.000 --> 56:30.240
and throw a link to our sampler in there.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.680
And if you never watched it,

56:31.680 --> 56:32.560
go check it out.

56:32.560 --> 56:35.600
HTTP colon, forward slash, forward slash.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.040
So hold on, wait, what was that again?

56:38.720 --> 56:42.000
It's bit.ly forward slash, it's my bim bam.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.840
Bit.ly forward slash, it's my bim bam.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.040
What's the protocol though?

56:45.040 --> 56:46.560
What's the hyperlink?

56:46.560 --> 56:49.280
It is a hypertext transfer protocol.

56:49.280 --> 56:53.040
So thank you guys so much for your generosity.

56:53.040 --> 56:54.400
I wanna say a special thanks to everybody

56:54.400 --> 56:58.400
who grabbed Justin or I in the hallways

56:58.400 --> 57:00.960
of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center

57:00.960 --> 57:02.880
during PAX East this past weekend.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.120
We had a lot of fun

57:05.120 --> 57:09.040
and there were so many bim bam binos there showing support

57:09.040 --> 57:12.320
and it made my weekend, so thanks guys.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.440
I also wanna say a very special thank you

57:16.400 --> 57:19.760
to Heather Marion and Abigail McCauley

57:20.800 --> 57:26.800
who brought us at PAX a signed copy of Warriors

57:26.800 --> 57:32.800
Into the Wild, the book about warrior cats,

57:33.280 --> 57:37.520
by Aaron Hunter, signed by Aaron Hunter to Bramblepelt.

57:38.560 --> 57:41.360
The signature reads, to Bramblepelt.

57:41.360 --> 57:43.280
The signature reads, to Bramblepelt.

57:43.280 --> 57:46.080
Meow, happy birthday, Aaron Hunter.

57:46.080 --> 57:51.040
Now wait, they had to tell, these fucking champions

57:51.040 --> 57:54.080
had to tell Aaron Hunter that the book is for a cat

57:55.200 --> 57:57.600
and this is what this, that's less weird

57:57.600 --> 57:58.560
than explaining the group.

57:58.560 --> 57:59.840
That's not how it panned out.

57:59.840 --> 58:03.280
They asked them, her, to sign it to Bramblepelt

58:03.280 --> 58:07.520
and Aaron Hunter made the logical leap, as anyone would,

58:07.520 --> 58:10.080
that they were getting the book signed

58:10.080 --> 58:12.320
for their cat whose birthday it was.

58:13.360 --> 58:15.840
Hey, Aaron Hunter, you're too deep in the game.

58:16.480 --> 58:18.400
You need to back up a little bit.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.240
You're too deep in the cat game, my friend.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.720
I wanna say also thanks, this is a very thankful

58:24.720 --> 58:26.880
closing segment, thank you to John Roderick

58:26.880 --> 58:28.960
and the Longwinters for the use of our theme song

58:28.960 --> 58:31.280
Into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.360
It really starts the show off with a high energy,

58:35.360 --> 58:39.600
burst of energy and I don't know what we would be

58:39.600 --> 58:42.160
without it, we would be nothing, so thank you.

58:42.160 --> 58:43.840
I'd also like to thank everybody.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.080
I've noticed a lot on Twitter and I appreciate this

58:46.080 --> 58:48.240
and I know everyone else on the Max Fund Network does

58:48.240 --> 58:51.840
but seeing someone say like, I'm a fan of MBMBAM

58:51.840 --> 58:54.400
and they mentioned throwing shade, so now I'm a fan

58:54.400 --> 58:56.080
of throwing shade or people saying, I love

58:56.080 --> 58:58.000
Stop Podcasting Yourself and they introduce this

58:58.000 --> 58:59.680
to my brother, my brother and me.

58:59.680 --> 59:02.960
So if you haven't yet, coming off of the Max Fund Drive

59:02.960 --> 59:05.360
is a great time to go check out Judge Don Hodgman,

59:05.360 --> 59:08.640
Jordan Jesse Goh, Throwing Shade, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

59:08.640 --> 59:12.160
Bullseye, all the incredible shows on the Max Fund Network.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.200
You guys ready for the closer?

59:13.760 --> 59:14.480
Oh yes.

59:14.480 --> 59:17.360
This final Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.680
It was asked by Yahoo Answers user.

59:21.120 --> 59:24.080
Oh, it was deleted, so I don't know who asked it

59:24.080 --> 59:28.160
but the question was, how would you dance

59:28.160 --> 59:31.040
to I Only Want to Be With You by Hootie and the Blowfish?

59:35.440 --> 59:36.800
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:36.800 --> 59:37.760
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:37.760 --> 59:39.120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.560
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

59:40.560 --> 59:41.280
Kiss your dad.

59:41.840 --> 59:42.960
Square on the lips.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.200
Keep your heart, three stacks.

59:49.200 --> 59:50.720
Keep your heart, hey.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.400
Keep your heart, three stacks.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.680
Keep your heart, man.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.360
These girls are smart, three stacks.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.480
These girls are smart.

59:56.480 --> 01:00:08.800
I Only Want to Be With You by Hootie and the Blowfish.
