00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:44.480
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.280
Welcome, my brother, my brother. I made an advice show for the modern era. I'm your

00:47.280 --> 00:50.320
oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.440
I'm your baby-est preteen brother, Griffin McElroy.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.920
Griffin McElroy, fresh from the land of the rising sun, back with us here in America.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.880
Fresh off the plane. Why did he come back, you ask? Well,

01:00.880 --> 01:07.680
this is an exciting time of year. Not only am I currently enjoying my first salted caramel mocha

01:08.720 --> 01:15.200
of the year. Sorry, pumpkin spice latte, you've been usurped in my heart.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.200
You know what, I like drinking them both at the same time.

01:17.920 --> 01:26.240
Yeah, and then getting just the harshest squirts. You just drank a gallon of sugar milk.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.280
Is that good for you, intestinally? It's not bad for me.

01:30.640 --> 01:37.040
But the bigger news this year, and boy, guys, I cannot tell you how exciting this all is.

01:37.600 --> 01:45.360
Monster cereals are back. Of course, monster cereals are a sort of a Halloween-time staple.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.720
As uncomfortable as I am with Christmas creep, I'm really into Halloween creep.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.000
Because if you think about it, if Halloween creep continued ad infinitum,

01:54.000 --> 01:59.920
eventually life itself would just be a nightmare horrorscape that was obsessed with death and

01:59.920 --> 02:02.320
morbidity and terror. Sure, it'll be a full-blown

02:02.320 --> 02:06.320
nightmare before Christmas where everything is all about those spooks.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.640
But I think this is a logical result of the Christmas creep, right?

02:10.640 --> 02:15.120
Because Christmas is stretching into the middle of October now, so it's obviously like,

02:15.120 --> 02:18.880
by the time you get to Halloween, you are so into Christmas that you don't think

02:18.880 --> 02:22.480
about all the spooky pumpkins and stuff. So Halloween as a natural result has to

02:22.480 --> 02:25.680
stretch back into late July. I shit you not.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.080
I was just at Hobby Lobby last weekend, and they already have their Christmas stuff up.

02:30.080 --> 02:36.000
But in a seeming fighting back kind of moment, there's a Christmas tree decorated

02:36.880 --> 02:41.680
with fall and Halloween decorations. That's just a Halloween tree.

02:41.680 --> 02:45.280
I think that's just a tree. I don't think it could be a Christmas tree

02:45.280 --> 02:48.160
without some picture of Jesus or Santa or something or candy canes.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.760
Yeah. When they say deck the halls, they mean with pictures of Jesus and Santa.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.080
What are you talking about? The inevitable conclusion is that

02:56.080 --> 03:00.480
Halloween and Christmas spread to the point where we do reach a single day

03:00.480 --> 03:07.440
that's like spooky baby Jesus in a skull mask. Or it's more like holiday equinox,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.720
where there's an equal amount of Halloween and Christmas in the same day.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.840
You get 12 hours of Halloween and 12 hours of Christmas.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.800
But this is not the most important thing. This is not why I want to bring this up.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.720
Monster cereals are back. That's thrilling. What are you talking about?

03:20.720 --> 03:23.520
Choco zombie? Okay, we got Frankenberry, Boo Berry,

03:23.520 --> 03:26.160
Count Jocula. Fruit Brute? No Fruit Brute?

03:26.160 --> 03:28.560
No, but Travis, here's the thing. Fruit Brute's been discontinued,

03:28.560 --> 03:33.600
obviously, since the 70s. This year, first time ever, Fruit Brute

03:33.600 --> 03:40.080
and Yummy Mummy fucking back on the scene. Couldn't be done? They done did it.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.280
I've never even tasted Fruit Brute. I'm so fucking excited.

03:43.280 --> 03:47.120
Fruit Brute, of course, is all about cherry frosted cereal

03:47.120 --> 03:52.240
with spooky fun marshmallows into it. Yummy Mummy, which is actually

03:52.240 --> 03:55.760
labeled the return of Yummy Mummy on the packaging.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.640
Starring Brendan Fraser. Starring Brendan Fraser, artificial

03:59.200 --> 04:04.000
orange cream flavored frosted cereal with spooky fun marshmallows,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.760
all shaped like Brendan Fraser, I would assume. That sounds disgusting,

04:07.760 --> 04:11.520
but simultaneously, I'm going to eat it. They are both back.

04:11.520 --> 04:17.040
If you go to Target, you can get retro packaging in these jams.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.080
I don't really care for what they have currently. It's kind of neo-futurist.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.080
I don't know. It's very monster movie. Very impressionist.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.440
Yeah, very cubist, I think you could say. I don't really care.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.880
What's that one with all the dots? A dotty?

04:32.880 --> 04:36.560
It looks like a dotty. Dotty, but they're back.

04:36.560 --> 04:41.360
Now, did they bring back, because they are trying to modernize it.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.560
I think I saw this in a commercial. The Target is selling Torture Killer Crunch.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.360
Torture Killer Crunch is out.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.440
Torture Killer Crunch, it's sort of the more realistic take on more modern,

04:52.480 --> 04:56.160
high tension. They made the high tension breakfast cereal and the kids,

04:56.160 --> 04:59.760
let me tell you, the kids loved that. The kids couldn't get enough of it.

04:59.760 --> 05:07.760
They don't this year have that one. They do have Unabomber Berry,

05:07.760 --> 05:14.480
which was one of my favorites in the 90s with real beard flex,

05:14.480 --> 05:18.320
which was great for me as a kid growing up because those are full of niacin,

05:18.320 --> 05:19.680
which you have to have.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.400
And tell me, does it come with lost boy milk?

05:24.560 --> 05:28.240
I don't think lost boy milk is available anymore.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.120
This is not based on the film. This is boy milk that has been,

05:33.120 --> 05:38.400
somebody misplaced it and somebody found it and then sold it in a grocery store.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.000
It's very pricey, but well worth it for the calcium alone.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.200
Boys got lots of calcium up in them.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.080
We get so many bad things in our mail, PO Box 54,

05:50.640 --> 05:53.600
Heinz, West Virginia, 2576. We get so many bad things,

05:53.600 --> 05:56.160
but no one will just send us monster cereals. That's it.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.520
That's all you have to do to get into our heart.

05:57.520 --> 06:03.840
Those are your weird clipped up psychopath letters. Just send some fruit brutes.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.200
People aren't still sending those, are they?

06:05.760 --> 06:08.400
No, not anymore. Of course, I haven't checked in a little while.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.720
If you're going to send us food stuffs, by the way,

06:10.720 --> 06:14.720
give me a heads up because I don't go by there often.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.720
Boy milk only keeps for like, I don't know, a week and a half.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.080
Yeah, 15 minutes.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.600
Once it's been extracted from the boy, it's already-

06:23.600 --> 06:27.040
It's like that midnight orchid, you know, where it just blooms for like 15 minutes.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.160
Once it leaves their nubile lactose sex.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.560
Sure. Now, the midnight orchid you're referencing,

06:32.560 --> 06:34.400
that is the one from Dennis the Menace, right?

06:34.400 --> 06:37.600
Yes. That is the pop culture reference I was making.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.240
I just assumed everyone would get it without the footnote.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.840
Sure. Yeah, I mean, I did. So that's a pretty good sample size, I guess.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.720
Listen, I'm really hungry now and I really want to find these cereals.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.520
I literally drove to Target looking for them. Not there yet.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.760
Where's the fruit brute? Sir, sir, please calm down.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.640
I'm going to Target's place of work.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.880
Excuse me, I am gasping for lost boy milk.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.160
You owe me money?

07:05.280 --> 07:07.520
What? Excuse me? Excuse me, sir.

07:10.080 --> 07:16.720
So, let's get to the helping people because I feel like we've stalled long enough.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.640
We've just been stalled because we know we're not good at it.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.200
Not good at what?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.560
Helping people.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.000
I know. With their problems.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.240
We helped if you had a problem of what cereal to go look for today and not find.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.640
If you had a problem with not enough diabetes.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.400
If you had a problem with your milk not tasting enough like lost boys.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.960
I'm a lady who's extremely skilled at ping pong.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.200
My problem is that sometimes I feel like a jerk when I'm playing with someone

07:43.200 --> 07:44.640
that is not so good at the game.

07:45.280 --> 07:51.120
How can I sustain my winning record while at the same time maintaining my opponent's dignity?

07:51.120 --> 07:53.920
That's from TT in VT.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.400
This is a, I can sympathize with this.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.160
I have this exact problem with every sport backwards.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.280
But backwards, dip, but a polar opposite.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.480
But I understand what you're saying.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.280
Ping pong is tricky.

08:10.800 --> 08:15.920
This question is coming from a very, I feel like this happens to a lot of people

08:15.920 --> 08:19.520
because either you're very good at ping pong or you're very bad at ping pong.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.520
There's nobody who's just like right there in the middle.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.320
There are echelons of how good you are once you're really good.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.240
Like I'm pretty good at ping pong and then there are people that can just destroy me.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.880
But like 80% of people, it's just shut out.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.760
It's a joke.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.120
Yeah, that's me.

08:35.120 --> 08:40.880
That's kind of my area of ping pong is like in that 80% of like,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.280
which side, hold on, I wasn't ready.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.880
Yeah, and like I feel bad for you that like just put in the work, I guess.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.480
Just put in the work to like get better at it.

08:50.480 --> 08:55.040
To be fair, there's other areas of my life in which I feel very successful and happy.

08:55.040 --> 08:59.680
So you beating me at ping pong doesn't really like take anything away from the rest of that.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.120
Gotta bring me down about this one thing.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.720
No, I'm just saying like I understand that our question asker is concerned here,

09:04.720 --> 09:08.400
but I'm betting that some other part of their life has grown to compensate

09:08.400 --> 09:09.840
for their lack of ping pong skills.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.720
I actually think that in a weird sense,

09:12.720 --> 09:24.080
that there is an element of classism attached to being good at like certain table games,

09:24.080 --> 09:27.280
like ping pong or billiards.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.840
Like you're good at this because your daddy was rich and bought you a billiard.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.920
Exactly, I feel like that's the implicate.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.720
I feel like that's the sort of, especially at a younger age,

09:34.720 --> 09:38.640
it's like there was a really clear divide when I was growing up

09:38.640 --> 09:42.800
and someone would have a pool table of like the kids who were like,

09:42.800 --> 09:48.000
it's in the way that you're using it.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.400
And me, I'm like wildly spinning a pool cue like Donatello and then falling on the table.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.360
Is this good?

09:55.360 --> 09:56.240
Did I pool?

09:56.240 --> 09:57.360
Am I doing it?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.080
Rack them.

09:58.080 --> 09:58.800
Let me rack them.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.520
I'm good at that.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.120
We're still, we're like halfway through a game.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.240
I'm just going to rack them up.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.640
We're playing, we're like playing the game right now.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.080
Like the balls have to stay where they are.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.840
I'll just be designated Racker.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.440
I'll collect them as they go in the hole.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.360
So I'll just be super ready to rack them.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.040
How many mulligans do I get?

10:14.800 --> 10:16.800
What's house rules on the mulligans?

10:16.800 --> 10:19.920
I just comment after they're broken, like, that was a good rack.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.320
I guess I really racked them good that time.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.440
I guess I'm the best Racker.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.200
Can I still, next Saturday night?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.600
Are we like, is that the plan?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.360
Is there a lean on this table?

10:29.360 --> 10:31.760
Feels like it's like a slight angle.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.720
Just a slight angle.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.200
It's throwing off all my hits, all my shots hits.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.360
Oh, I'm just used to playing on real grass.

10:37.360 --> 10:42.320
So what was the last time you got this table?

10:42.320 --> 10:42.960
Returfed.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.800
I'm used to playing on tournament ready tables.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.560
Here's the debt.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.680
There's such a huge difference though, between ping pong and pool.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.560
Cause if you're playing against someone who's just really awesome at pool,

10:55.120 --> 10:58.880
you are maybe going to have to like suck at hitting the ball like twice.

10:59.440 --> 10:59.920
You know what I mean?

10:59.920 --> 11:03.280
Cause they're just going to like run the table and just like, you know,

11:03.280 --> 11:05.920
they're going to win without you probably getting a shot.

11:05.920 --> 11:11.600
Is there any moment in games that you guys can think of

11:11.600 --> 11:13.840
that is worse than when you have to break?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.520
It's like the most hype.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.360
I'm the shittiest at it.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.640
Like I play pool, I don't know, maybe once a month or so.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.200
There's a lot of really cool pool places here in Austin,

11:23.200 --> 11:26.240
but like I'm the worst at breaking ever.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.080
And it's fucking humiliating when you hit it and like two balls on the back roll,

11:30.080 --> 11:32.240
like a quarter inch and nothing else moves.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.040
And it's like, ugh, we have to play this whole fucking game

11:35.040 --> 11:36.960
with all these balls right there.

11:36.960 --> 11:37.360
Good going, Griff.

11:37.360 --> 11:41.440
I would have played it to when you're playing beach volleyball with friends

11:41.440 --> 11:43.440
and it rotates to your turn to serve.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.680
And you have that moment of like,

11:45.680 --> 11:48.800
oh, well, does someone else want to take this?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.800
Do I need a designated hitter?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.240
Listen, man, you break.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.040
You've earned it.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.560
Listen, listen, I just, I think it'll be,

11:57.760 --> 11:59.440
I think we'll have more fun if you break.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.160
Please just break.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.600
Please just do the break.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.400
I feel it's the same.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.840
I wish that in ping pong,

12:05.840 --> 12:09.520
like if you are very clearly like the outmatched opponent,

12:09.520 --> 12:11.920
that you have the option to just stand aside

12:12.560 --> 12:14.240
while they just like bounced,

12:14.240 --> 12:16.720
you know, while they just scored points on you.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.960
Without you having to do the weird like, ugh,

12:18.960 --> 12:20.400
you know, that like jump to the left,

12:20.400 --> 12:23.120
jump to the right, like time warp of failure.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.160
Darts is really bad too.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.160
You get two people playing cricket.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.160
You get two people playing cricket on darts,

12:28.160 --> 12:30.480
like who are shitty at darts.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.680
That's your whole day.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.920
Like one of us is going to hit a bullseye eventually.

12:33.920 --> 12:34.880
I know it.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.480
I can feel it in my bones.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.240
Oh, that one went in the ceiling fan.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.240
My favorite, cause I usually try to be this guy

12:40.240 --> 12:42.080
when playing darts is like, you know,

12:42.080 --> 12:43.760
six shitty rounds in a row

12:43.760 --> 12:45.680
and then like one accidental bullseye

12:45.680 --> 12:46.960
and tried to play it off like,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.480
that's what I was aiming for.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.800
I mean, all those other times I was just dicking around.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.240
It's all about triangulation.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.280
I was honing.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.240
I mean, you just gotta focus

12:54.240 --> 12:56.960
and then go about two inches above it and aim for that.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.080
And then you hit it every time.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.480
I'm going to start in on my six beer now.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.480
It's all about expanding it in your mind's eye

13:02.480 --> 13:04.000
sort of like in three ninjas.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.880
You got to lead it.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.960
I think the problem with, with a ping pong,

13:08.960 --> 13:10.320
especially it's like, there's no,

13:11.920 --> 13:14.480
you really have no control over whether or not

13:14.480 --> 13:16.240
that person's going to return your hit.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.040
You could slow play it as much as you want,

13:19.040 --> 13:21.280
but I mean, you can confidently get it over the table

13:21.840 --> 13:23.920
and there's just no way to,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.680
there's no way to make sure they return that to you.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.400
You know, my dream would be to my dream game of ping pong

13:30.400 --> 13:32.400
would be an evenly matched player.

13:32.400 --> 13:36.240
And also both of us have infinite buckets of ping pong balls

13:36.240 --> 13:37.600
because that's what's so fucking frustrating.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.800
Like in Captain Kangaroo.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.600
One person is really good.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.400
One person is really bad.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.080
The bad person serves to the good person.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.240
The good person puts the stankiest cheddar on that ball

13:46.240 --> 13:49.200
and sends it into the goddamn like stratosphere,

13:49.200 --> 13:50.640
sends it over the county line.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.960
The other person is like, all right, I'll go get it.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.560
And then chases it down.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.240
They're back 30 minutes later.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.560
They'd fucking map quest directions to the ball

13:58.560 --> 14:01.680
and then repeat, repeat ad nauseam.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.760
Like the other person's getting a fucking workout.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.840
There's only one solution.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.760
Next time you win at ping pong,

14:07.760 --> 14:12.320
after the last hit you win, it's clear you're gonna win.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.920
Maybe you're about to win

14:13.920 --> 14:15.680
and you're about to finish them off.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.680
You gotta take the ping pong ball

14:18.400 --> 14:21.920
and jam it down your throat so you're choking on it.

14:21.920 --> 14:26.400
And then they rush over and it's like Heimlich save your life.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.960
Then it's like, well, I mean, I don't want to ping pong,

14:30.960 --> 14:34.880
but that hardly seems in any way relevant to this anymore.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.320
You're the real hero of the day, I think.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.600
Justin, I gotta say that maneuver seems high risk, low reward.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.840
Okay, let me throw this out.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.880
What about this scenario?

14:43.600 --> 14:45.520
Last point of the game, you're clearly gonna win.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.920
You start complaining about your paddle

14:48.560 --> 14:51.600
and you convince them to switch paddles with you, right?

14:51.600 --> 14:52.400
For the last point.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.320
And then you score the last point and you beat them.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.240
But then you have an associate.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.520
You have a plant, right?

14:57.520 --> 14:59.200
Who says, well, hold on one second.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.000
Let me check something.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.120
And they pull out a book that's labeled The Rules of Ping Pong.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.440
And they discover an archaic rule that says

15:05.440 --> 15:08.400
that the winning paddle is the winner,

15:08.400 --> 15:09.680
not the person holding the paddle.

15:09.680 --> 15:13.120
Are you doing some elder wand fucking Harry Potter,

15:13.120 --> 15:14.320
like chain of ownership?

15:14.320 --> 15:15.600
Then you award the person.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.120
So then you and your compatriot know that you've won the game,

15:19.120 --> 15:21.680
but the person feels some sense of triumph.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.920
By disarming the winning player,

15:23.920 --> 15:27.360
the paddle recognizes you as its natural owner,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.600
meaning you scored 20 points with it.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.400
You crack open the ping pong ball

15:32.400 --> 15:34.560
and inside is written your opponent's name.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.600
And a Phoenix feather.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.800
Seeing as Travis has constructed the situation

15:38.800 --> 15:41.200
where I'm going to have to have a book published,

15:41.200 --> 15:44.320
I think this is low risk, high shitty.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.400
Like just really don't want to do any of that.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.440
Or you could just embarrass your friend

15:49.440 --> 15:50.720
by beating him really badly

15:50.720 --> 15:52.400
and then they'll never play again.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.480
Yeah, yeah, but then you're taking someone shitty

15:56.480 --> 15:57.760
sort of out of the pool.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.440
And if we continue this filtering process,

16:01.440 --> 16:03.520
then eventually only good people will remain.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.960
It's probably more important to TT

16:04.960 --> 16:07.360
to have people to play ping pong with.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.280
They do it for the love of the game.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.120
They don't care so much about winning and losing,

16:11.120 --> 16:12.960
but if they beat everybody to the point

16:12.960 --> 16:16.240
where it's annoying to play them,

16:16.240 --> 16:18.400
then they're not gonna have any ping pong buddies.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.520
You want a yahoo?

16:19.520 --> 16:20.560
Yeah, please.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.560
Let me pick the best one.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.160
Do you want me to pick the best one?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.360
No, you don't know what they are.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.040
This yahoo was sent in by Julie Kin.

16:27.040 --> 16:27.680
Thank you, Julie.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.840
It's by yahoo answer user Rosa who asks,

16:32.160 --> 16:34.800
if you could turn your pet into a human,

16:34.800 --> 16:52.080
would you date them?

16:52.080 --> 16:56.560
Um, I, um, oh man.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.880
I like, first of all, like, okay.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.880
Well, we are all, obviously all three of us

17:02.880 --> 17:04.400
are gonna be talking in the hypothetical here

17:04.400 --> 17:05.840
because we're all pretty much happily married.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.800
I say pretty much because-

17:08.800 --> 17:10.400
Don't try to, don't try to, all right.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.240
You got a, you got a few more steps to go,

17:12.240 --> 17:15.360
both of you Pauwans, before you can get into my game.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.280
Um, I think it would be kind of weird

17:19.280 --> 17:20.880
to date somebody named Pringles.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.960
That's the, that's one thing.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.240
That's, I think-

17:26.240 --> 17:28.480
I think it would also be weird to date someone

17:28.480 --> 17:30.080
whose anus I've expressed.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.600
You've expressed, you've expressed

17:33.600 --> 17:35.680
one of your pets, ain't I?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.760
But I will let you guess which one.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.800
I don't think that game sounds like a good game.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.120
It's the worst game ever.

17:44.240 --> 17:44.880
What?

17:44.880 --> 17:46.960
Okay, let me say, okay, let me jump back and say

17:46.960 --> 17:49.120
whose anus I've had expressed.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.640
Okay, all right.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.240
I've not done it manually.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.040
Okay, that's what, that's a very important verb

17:55.040 --> 17:56.720
that you just added in there, Travis.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.120
You can understand, you can understand

17:59.120 --> 18:00.480
why I was so upset by it.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.840
How, what do you mean by expressing an anus?

18:03.840 --> 18:05.920
Like you look at the anus and you go like,

18:05.920 --> 18:08.880
he looks, he looks pretty excited today.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.240
Well, it, cat, dog, bird, what kind of human,

18:13.040 --> 18:15.520
what kind of animal would make the best human today?

18:15.520 --> 18:16.000
Lizard.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.240
I'm sorry, what?

18:18.240 --> 18:19.280
Lizard.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.800
I would fucking, are you kidding me?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.080
Chill-ass motherfucker.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.400
Just like chilling, waiting to eat some bugs.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.480
Just like chilling.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.160
Cat wouldn't do it.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.680
I feel like a cat would be too like-

18:29.680 --> 18:31.200
The worst would be a cat.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.120
A lizard would just be sitting on a rock

18:35.120 --> 18:38.240
in the sunshine, 24-7, telling you to relax.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.440
Oh my God, guys, I think Matthew McConaughey

18:41.440 --> 18:42.240
is a lizard man.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.600
I think Matthew McConaughey is a man made from lizard.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.480
Think about it.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.760
Think about it for a second.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.360
Vaguely reptilian features,

18:49.360 --> 18:51.680
especially when his hair is like swooped back,

18:51.680 --> 18:55.360
a la Ghosts of Girlfriend's Pass.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.080
Dennis Hopper in Super Mario Brothers, maybe?

18:58.080 --> 18:58.640
Yeah.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.360
That's a little on the nose because he was playing King Koopa.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.320
Yeah, a little bit.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.800
And he wasn't Matthew McConaughey in the moment.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.920
Stick with me.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.520
It was a good shot other than that.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.080
Do you have any other celebrities you want to say

19:14.080 --> 19:17.440
looks like Matthew McConaughey in a fictionalized metaphor

19:17.440 --> 19:18.560
in which he is a lizard man?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.520
And you can't say Deborah Messing, that's too obvious.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.960
Oh God.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.880
Oh, that guy.

19:28.880 --> 19:34.880
Who is that one guy, Rob Schneider?

19:35.920 --> 19:39.600
Yeah, Rob Schneider was probably a frog.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.520
Like probably a frog made human, a pet frog turned man.

19:44.800 --> 19:45.120
Really?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.840
Because he strikes me more as like a guinea pig turns man.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.160
DJ Qualls strikes me as like a frog turned man.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.760
DJ Qualls could be.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.440
Yeah, he's like frog prince material.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.640
Oh, Bushimi.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.040
Bushimi is definitely like a frog turned man.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.080
Oh, the raccoon, yeah.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.600
No, Bushimi's a raccoon.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.880
Yeah, raccoon turned man.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.280
It's because you let Steve Bushimi in your flower bed

20:05.280 --> 20:06.240
forget about it.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.600
But no one has a pet raccoon.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.680
So that's why Steve Bushimi is feral, technically speaking.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.120
Somebody probably has a pet raccoon.

20:13.120 --> 20:13.920
I shouldn't say that.

20:13.920 --> 20:18.240
There's, it would be like dating your kid, right?

20:18.800 --> 20:19.520
I mean, I get it.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.640
Like you're close to them.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.320
You're close to these animals.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.560
I mean, first of all, this is obviously somebody

20:24.560 --> 20:25.920
who wants to boogie down on their pet.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.720
We can all agree about that, right?

20:28.720 --> 20:30.320
The person who asked this question is somebody

20:30.320 --> 20:32.960
who is ready to take their pet.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.040
To the next level.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.200
To the fucking end of the road.

20:37.200 --> 20:37.760
You know what I mean?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.000
Yeah, I do, sadly.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.600
This question makes me so sad.

20:42.320 --> 20:42.880
Don't be sad.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.720
Be happy and let's try and fix it.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.440
Maybe go out there and meet some human beings.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.480
No, come on.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.080
Why would you do that when you can magically

20:50.080 --> 20:51.680
turn your pets into animals?

20:51.680 --> 20:52.640
You've got me there.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.560
Your pets are already animals.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.640
Your pets, humans are animals.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.360
Whoa.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.640
Whoa, that's a good point.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.800
Whoa, got a little metaphorical.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.960
I guess we're all, I guess we're all B-Steel.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.000
You know what I mean?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.440
I guess we're all somebody's pets.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.880
Maybe we're the aliens.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.440
Think about it.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.920
I mean, you guys think about it like cats and dogs.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.280
Really, who's the master, right?

21:11.280 --> 21:12.160
And who's the pet?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.320
Because all they do is like lay around

21:14.320 --> 21:15.840
and get fed and where are you guys?

21:15.840 --> 21:16.400
Marmaduke.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.920
The great conspiracy, the fallacy

21:21.920 --> 21:25.760
with this question is the idea that animals,

21:25.760 --> 21:29.600
if given the opportunity, would ever willingly

21:29.600 --> 21:31.120
be turned to humans.

21:31.120 --> 21:35.600
My cat has a lifestyle where it is sheltered,

21:37.040 --> 21:40.320
it is fed, it is watered.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.320
Some would say to grotesque excess.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.160
Some would say that.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.240
Judgmental people who can't see past fur.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.240
Oh, is that it?

21:48.240 --> 21:48.800
She's fluffy.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.720
Is it 56 pounds of fur?

21:50.720 --> 21:51.360
Is that what it is?

21:51.360 --> 21:51.840
Fluffy.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.200
She's got heavy fur.

21:53.200 --> 21:53.760
It's not her.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.720
It's heavy furred.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.000
She's just big furred.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.680
She's just big furred.

21:57.680 --> 22:03.600
Can you imagine the horror of becoming a fleshy mess

22:03.600 --> 22:05.840
of appendages that have to wear clothes?

22:06.400 --> 22:08.800
Like that would be horrifying.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.680
My dog gets applauded simply for sitting down.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.200
Can you imagine that life where you're just like,

22:15.200 --> 22:18.800
I sat down and everyone's like, yes, here's a treat.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.680
You did it.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.080
You did it.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.760
You sat down again, Travis.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.440
That sounds awesome.

22:23.440 --> 22:23.760
Yeah.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.480
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.040
I know.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.520
But once you turn human, you give all that up.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.160
You have to start worrying about bills and genocide

22:30.160 --> 22:32.720
and your mother-in-law in Syria.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.520
Yeah, but also you don't die when you turn 16.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.840
Like there's some pretty sweet trade-offs.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.520
No, but that's the twist.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.360
You do absolutely die when you're 16.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.680
You still like age like Jack.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.680
Pets turn human have Jack disease.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.560
Yes, thank you, Travis.

22:48.560 --> 22:48.960
Correct.

22:48.960 --> 22:49.760
You're welcome.

22:49.760 --> 22:50.720
And they age.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.360
Progenitals?

22:52.400 --> 22:54.480
No, not like literally.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.040
Yeah, they got Jack disease.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.280
No, I'm saying that I think the disease is called progenitals.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.400
I think it's called Propecia.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.240
I have another question.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.520
One of my best friends doesn't have his own car.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.960
As a result, I usually end up picking him up every day

23:08.960 --> 23:11.200
so we can go hang out.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.720
I'm getting tired of having to drive him around everywhere.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.600
It's inconvenient and he doesn't give me gas money.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.760
But anytime I ask him to be saving up to buy his own car,

23:19.760 --> 23:23.200
he gets mad since it's none of my business how he spends his money.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.000
Oh my God.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.160
I want to just stop giving him rides places,

23:28.160 --> 23:30.640
but that would mean I couldn't hang out with him anymore

23:30.640 --> 23:32.480
since he doesn't have his own transportation.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.000
What should I do?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.280
That's from the friend with a car in Indianapolis.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.760
There's a deeper question here, though, that I just realized,

23:39.760 --> 23:42.160
which is what is your friend doing with his money

23:42.160 --> 23:44.160
that he's so secretive about?

23:44.160 --> 23:45.440
Hey, are you saying Dora?

23:45.440 --> 23:46.960
No, it's none of your business.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.040
You basically find yourself driving your friend to a place

23:49.040 --> 23:50.880
where he can buy hard drugs.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.480
I didn't know that that was an option

23:52.480 --> 23:55.360
when like Griffin, you owe $3,500 in taxes.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.680
It's none of your business how I spend my money, government.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.680
Like you super owe us this money.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.720
It is kind of my biz.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.640
Yeah, because I'm driving you every day to Subway

24:04.640 --> 24:05.840
so you can hone your art.

24:07.920 --> 24:11.280
Is he like calling you to like have you pick him up from his place

24:11.280 --> 24:13.440
and drop you off at a different and drop him off at a different place?

24:13.440 --> 24:15.120
And that's the hang while you're in the car

24:15.120 --> 24:17.040
is the sweet hang that you're getting?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.480
Hey, I really need to go to Jimmy John's.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.000
You want to hang out for eight minutes?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.320
Yep, definitely.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.600
You're such a good friend.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.080
Why are you hanging out with such a fucking scrub?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.800
You are hanging out with the dictionary definition of a scrub

24:28.800 --> 24:30.400
as laid out by TLC.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.280
Yeah, I bet if he did have a shorty,

24:33.280 --> 24:36.160
he would not show him or her love.

24:36.160 --> 24:39.200
Does he often hang out the passenger side of your ride?

24:39.200 --> 24:39.920
Of your ride.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.440
And he's trying to holler at girls,

24:41.440 --> 24:43.760
but he's hollering like, hey, can I borrow like a buck 50?

24:43.760 --> 24:46.080
Don't ask me what I'm going to spend it on.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.680
Because it's none of your fucking business.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.920
I'm a block away now.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.760
I got to come up with a shorter spiel.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.680
Or you have to start driving slow.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.000
Could you run faster beside the car?

24:56.000 --> 24:56.240
Hey, keep up.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.680
Just till the pitch is done.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.040
Just till the pitch is done.

25:01.440 --> 25:04.160
I mean, it might be just your friend needs to get a fucking car.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.440
And why does it-

25:05.440 --> 25:08.560
Or like learn how the public transit system works.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.280
Yeah.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.360
There are people in this world that exist without cars

25:11.360 --> 25:13.040
and they ride bikes or they take the bus

25:13.040 --> 25:15.440
or, you know, whatever they walk, God forbid.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.160
But like, I'm not one of them because I'm an American.

25:18.160 --> 25:22.000
But I mean, your friend will find other ways to get around.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.720
He won't like die on his floor of starvation

25:24.720 --> 25:26.880
because you didn't drive him to the Paley Wiggly's.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.600
Or he might.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.080
He might.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.320
And that's just nature's way.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.520
That's nature's way of telling you

25:33.520 --> 25:34.960
you need to have a better friend.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.840
I think you need to break this cycle.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.320
Tell your friend that if it's-

25:40.320 --> 25:42.240
If you really want to get a hang going,

25:42.240 --> 25:44.400
you have to meet in a place that's

25:44.400 --> 25:45.920
equidistant from your homes

25:45.920 --> 25:47.200
and you're not going to pick him up.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.240
Triangulate it.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.120
And then you do that.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.520
It's like Waffle House is the only-

25:52.240 --> 25:54.080
There's a J Crew.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.600
I guess we'll just hang out at J Crew.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.240
But only in this one corner

25:58.240 --> 26:00.160
because if we head over towards the sweaters,

26:00.720 --> 26:02.080
then it's closer to my house

26:02.080 --> 26:03.280
and it's not really fair to anybody.

26:03.280 --> 26:07.600
Exactly 2.75 miles between both of us is a curves.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.040
I'll meet you at curves at 11.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.840
We're going to get fit.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.840
We're going to get fit, I guess.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.360
And then probably get kicked out.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.680
Probably get kicked out because I do not think that-

26:18.480 --> 26:20.800
I don't think we'll mesh very well.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.160
I don't think that we'll slot into

26:22.160 --> 26:24.000
that particular organization very well.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.160
Even if your friend doesn't want to tell you

26:26.160 --> 26:27.840
if he's saving up to buy a car,

26:27.840 --> 26:29.520
I think it's completely fair too to be like,

26:29.520 --> 26:31.760
hey, how about you toss some gas money my way

26:31.760 --> 26:33.920
since I'm your only means of conveyance.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.120
Maybe he's saving up to buy you a sweet present.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.640
Did you ever think about that, Rude?

26:38.640 --> 26:39.760
I bought you a new car.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.360
I bought you a new car.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.080
Now you have two.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.680
I don't want either of them.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.400
Can you pick me up?

26:44.960 --> 26:46.000
Can you pick me up for curves?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.280
I know we said we'd meet in the middle,

26:47.280 --> 26:49.600
but it's 2.75 miles.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.200
I'm trying to lose weight there, not on the way.

26:51.200 --> 26:51.760
You know what I mean?

26:52.800 --> 26:54.480
If I lose too much weight, I won't have curves

26:54.480 --> 26:55.840
and then they definitely won't let me in.

26:56.800 --> 26:57.600
Think about it.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.320
Think about that.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.480
There's a bell curve for curves.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.400
You're supposed to stick it right in the middle.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.760
If you land too far on either side,

27:05.760 --> 27:08.880
they're like, sorry, too curvy or not curvy enough.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.360
Get the fuck out.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.400
I want to open a gym called Bell Curves

27:14.400 --> 27:15.760
in which there are two members

27:15.760 --> 27:17.760
that are just stunningly attractive

27:17.760 --> 27:22.160
and two members that are like grossly scary obese.

27:22.160 --> 27:23.920
And then you feel more comfortable

27:23.920 --> 27:25.280
being in the middle when you're there.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.560
No, because you know the grotesquely fat people

27:28.560 --> 27:29.680
never show up.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.120
They might come for a week.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.000
No good news.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.800
They can't leave.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.800
We built it around them.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.880
Yeah, they have a thing like this called jail.

27:36.880 --> 27:41.280
Listen, guys, do we have another question on the Yahoo?

27:41.280 --> 27:42.080
What do we want to do?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.840
God, I feel like the world's our oyster.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.480
I have a Yahoo that was sent in by Chucky V.

27:46.480 --> 27:46.960
Thanks, Chucky.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.040
It's by Yahoo Answers user Neil who asks,

27:49.680 --> 27:51.120
sword making resources?

27:53.120 --> 27:55.200
I am looking into making a pair of swords

27:55.200 --> 27:56.080
for me and my friend.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.920
As a heads up, these are not wall hanger swords.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.080
They will be used for the purpose they are intended,

28:02.080 --> 28:03.200
swinging them at each other.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.400
Like God intended.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.160
I know the basics of what I am doing,

28:08.160 --> 28:09.920
but have run into a few problems.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.520
One, I do not have a forge.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.800
This means I cannot personally heat treat it.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.080
Is heat treating necessary?

28:16.080 --> 28:18.240
I know it helps make the sword harder and less brittle,

28:18.240 --> 28:20.240
but would a sword still function safely without it?

28:20.240 --> 28:23.120
If not, where could I send the steel off to be heat treated?

28:23.120 --> 28:24.320
Two, basic question.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.520
What kind of steel is good?

28:26.080 --> 28:29.920
I've heard O1 steel, tool steel is one of the best,

28:29.920 --> 28:31.280
but it is very expensive.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.880
What are some other high carbon steels

28:32.880 --> 28:34.080
that make good swords?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.680
Three, edge beveling.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.360
Like I said, I don't have a forge.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.880
This means I cannot heat the sword

28:38.880 --> 28:40.400
and bevel the edges with a hammer.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.400
There's a forge shop near me,

28:42.400 --> 28:44.160
but I am not as confident with my hammering

28:44.160 --> 28:45.920
as I would want to be for beveling.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.600
Would a belt sander be able to do it?

28:47.600 --> 28:48.800
Thank you so much for your help.

28:49.600 --> 28:49.840
Okay.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.080
I know the basics of sword,

28:52.640 --> 28:55.680
but man, do I not have fucking anything for it.

28:55.680 --> 28:56.080
Can I use an oven?

28:56.080 --> 28:58.320
You're gonna wanna use crucible steel.

28:58.320 --> 28:58.720
What is that?

28:58.720 --> 29:00.240
Step one, crucible steel.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.960
It's where you heat the steel in a crucible

29:02.960 --> 29:04.080
and it makes it so hot

29:04.080 --> 29:05.920
that all the extra particulate stuff.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.760
I just watched Legend of the Viking Sword,

29:07.760 --> 29:09.520
you guys, so I'm a bit of an expert on this.

29:09.520 --> 29:10.800
You take that molten steel

29:10.800 --> 29:12.560
and you throw it on someone you think is a witch.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.680
You gotta pour it out in kind of a sword shape.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.240
Okay.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.000
But how are they gonna super heat this fucking,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.720
they put it in a kettle and then put it on like a-

29:20.720 --> 29:22.000
On like your mom's oven.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.520
Just put it on the cleaning cycle.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.960
Toss that steel in the crock pot.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.760
That's the thing is you gotta compensate

29:27.760 --> 29:29.520
for not being able to get the heat with time.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.320
So you throw it in the crock pot for like 18 days

29:32.320 --> 29:35.120
at like 350.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.440
And listen, I had a metal molder when I was a kid

29:37.440 --> 29:39.840
and I used to make little wizards

29:39.840 --> 29:41.200
with some of those fake gems in it.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.640
That's basically the same as the sword

29:42.640 --> 29:43.680
you're gonna swing at your friend.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.280
Yeah, them shits with sword fight ready, Trev,

29:45.280 --> 29:46.960
that pewter, those little-

29:46.960 --> 29:48.720
Yeah, I mean, you had to be very dainty with it

29:48.720 --> 29:49.840
and you make sure you cast.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.360
You don't wanna like swing through.

29:51.360 --> 29:51.600
Yeah.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.680
But with your tiny wizards.

29:55.840 --> 29:56.880
Wizards at dawn.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.680
If you use stainless steel,

29:59.680 --> 30:05.920
then you don't need to like use high carbon steel.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.040
You need to heat it and heat treat it.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.360
You can just stick with stainless steel.

30:11.360 --> 30:17.760
Wouldn't essentially like a polycarbonate nonstick steel,

30:17.760 --> 30:18.960
wouldn't that just like cut,

30:18.960 --> 30:20.560
like clean through your friend's neck

30:20.560 --> 30:22.160
and like completely decapitate them

30:22.160 --> 30:24.480
and then like just like slide through like butter

30:24.480 --> 30:25.920
because it's not like sticking to anything.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.960
It's like frictionless.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.240
Does that make sense?

30:28.240 --> 30:30.080
Yeah, wouldn't it just murder your friend

30:30.080 --> 30:32.800
where one of you two say not be good at sword fighting?

30:33.440 --> 30:34.720
I think the important thing here

30:34.720 --> 30:36.560
is to start with a wooden sword.

30:36.560 --> 30:36.880
You gotta make-

30:36.880 --> 30:38.480
Or just like a wooden stick.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.560
Make a wooden stick first and say,

30:40.560 --> 30:42.320
this is a sword that I made.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.400
And then if you can say that with a straight face,

30:44.400 --> 30:46.320
you're ready for the world of sword craft.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.440
Because here's the thing,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.760
fighting with two sticks you pick up off the ground

30:49.760 --> 30:54.080
will accomplish the same thing with less negative results.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.920
Well, it makes sweet clanging noises though.

30:55.920 --> 30:56.560
Like when they do it-

30:56.560 --> 30:59.680
No, you have to do that yourself and go clang, clang.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.440
Clang, clang.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.120
On guard, clang.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.640
I just don't think-

31:04.640 --> 31:06.720
Repost, clang.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.240
It sounds like this person,

31:08.240 --> 31:09.680
maybe they can get the metal,

31:09.680 --> 31:10.640
but then they can't do it.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.640
They're just gonna have two big steel pipes.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.400
And it's like, this is a sword.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.360
It's a super non-sharp sword.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.120
But I also don't know how to tell this person,

31:19.120 --> 31:22.720
but the small, just infinitely small bit

31:22.720 --> 31:25.520
I know about like forging and like blacksmithing.

31:25.520 --> 31:29.840
You don't start off with like a sword shaped piece of metal.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.720
You start off with like a brick shape like, or-

31:32.720 --> 31:35.280
Can I get just like a piece of metal

31:35.280 --> 31:36.640
already in the shape of the sword?

31:36.640 --> 31:39.040
And can you like put it on like a sword handle

31:39.040 --> 31:40.960
and make sure it's balanced and super sharp?

31:40.960 --> 31:43.600
And then I will, I'll just take it from there.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
And then I'll just hammer on it a couple of times

31:45.600 --> 31:47.040
and proclaim it done.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.280
And then have it rise out of like a lake or something.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.720
And I'll pick it up and I'll go insane.

31:52.720 --> 31:53.520
Oh my God.

31:53.520 --> 31:58.240
Oh my God, so I was, I've been researching extensively

31:58.800 --> 32:05.040
to try to find some information about making swords.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.640
And I found this page from anvilfire.com.

32:09.440 --> 32:13.440
And they have sword myths slash fiction.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.000
So let me hit you guys with some sword myths.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.360
Yeah, what have I been getting wrong

32:17.360 --> 32:18.640
about swords this whole time?

32:18.640 --> 32:20.320
Is it actual slash fiction?

32:20.320 --> 32:22.800
Because I feel like that's really appropriate with swords.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.320
Swords myths and sword fiction.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.400
The buster sword from Final Fantasy VII

32:26.400 --> 32:29.520
and a samurai sword, they met one day.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.080
He said, you looking really good buster sword.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.040
And then they clanged.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.280
They clanged and clanged.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.400
I'm gonna clang.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.960
I'm gonna clang all over your sheath.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.160
Blood does not make a superior quenchant.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.120
This is an old myth.

32:46.320 --> 32:50.240
Neither virgins or slaves have been used to test swords.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.520
That is a children's story.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.240
That is my favorite children's story.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.040
What?

32:53.040 --> 32:53.920
Children's story.

32:53.920 --> 32:54.880
That is my favorite children's story.

32:54.880 --> 32:55.440
Gather round, gather round.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.120
Who will help me test the blades?

32:57.120 --> 32:58.560
How many of y'all fucked?

32:58.560 --> 32:59.120
None of y'all?

32:59.680 --> 33:01.760
Let me tell you, you'd be good sword fodder.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.840
You cannot chop a machine gun barrel in two

33:05.840 --> 33:07.360
with a Japanese sword.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.320
Modern myth.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.680
No, I saw that on Mythbusters.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.320
Myth busted.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.480
Ancient steels were not superior to modern alloy steels.

33:16.480 --> 33:16.720
Yeah, no shit.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.240
Another modern myth.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.080
It's cause our steels are like genetically

33:20.080 --> 33:21.920
like superior in every way.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.880
They've been modified and enhanced and chopped and screwed.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.880
Here's where things go weirdly askew.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.600
Atlantis was not in the Atlantic.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.560
The story of Atlantis was based on rumors of the demise

33:32.560 --> 33:34.880
of Minoan Island culture in the Mediterranean

33:34.880 --> 33:36.320
by volcanic eruption.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.560
The story was handed down by Egyptians to Plato

33:38.560 --> 33:41.120
who turned the little truth into a myth.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.200
Listen, Anvilfire, I'm not gonna tell you

33:43.200 --> 33:45.680
you're straying from the path of sword myths,

33:45.680 --> 33:51.760
but throw the word sword in there somewhere.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.640
Yeah, they sometimes had swords.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.680
Somebody in there.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.680
Adamantium is a fictional comic book element

33:57.680 --> 33:59.760
without any basis in reality like kryptonite.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.160
It's just another unobtanium.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.880
JFK was not actually assassinated by a sword.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.240
Like yeah, dog, like I know.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.000
I know that one.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.760
Swords are not good food.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.120
Yeah, okay, thank you, Anvilfire.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.440
Clouds are not made of small white swords.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.560
Like thanks, website.

34:14.560 --> 34:20.320
Mythril, J-R-R token, is another myth-ical metal.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.920
Myth is all caps.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.480
Thank you.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.880
Last one, you cannot, and this is the one

34:24.880 --> 34:27.600
that I find very confusing on several levels.

34:28.160 --> 34:31.120
You cannot cold forge a sword from a leaf spring.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.920
Modern web myth slash parody.

34:35.200 --> 34:38.160
What's the most hilarious parody on the web?

34:38.160 --> 34:41.600
There's a guy who cold forges a sword in a leaf spring.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.480
Everyone gets a real kick out of it.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.400
I think that's a weird idea.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.120
Does it say anything on there, Justin,

34:47.120 --> 34:49.440
about whether or not steak knives are just little swords?

34:50.640 --> 34:52.560
Aren't cocktail swords real swords?

34:52.560 --> 34:53.440
True or false?

34:53.440 --> 34:55.600
I feel like we all learned a lot about swords today.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.760
Sword wisdom, sword wisdom.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.280
Mythril is not a blade metal.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.040
It is not intrinsically sharp or hard

35:01.040 --> 35:04.320
as recent TV commercial for razor blades indicates.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.960
It's more Hollywood hype and bad science

35:06.960 --> 35:08.560
written by advertising executives

35:08.560 --> 35:10.720
that know nothing about allergy.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.400
Big corpos selling out.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.720
Well, what are you gonna tell me next?

35:14.720 --> 35:17.200
That adamantium's real?

35:17.200 --> 35:18.960
Ugh, shills.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.000
Hugh Jackman myth.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.520
You cannot cop, this is the last one, I promise.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.360
You cannot, and he has one,

35:26.320 --> 35:28.080
he has a whole section about myth

35:28.080 --> 35:30.160
and then one section about Highlander

35:30.160 --> 35:32.560
that is exactly one fact long.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.200
You cannot chop into a concrete column

35:35.200 --> 35:37.520
with a sharp sword without seriously damaging it.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.600
You cannot chop steel railings or beams

35:39.600 --> 35:41.280
into with any sword.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.800
Any sword.

35:42.800 --> 35:48.240
Swords do not make showers with sparks

35:48.240 --> 35:51.040
when slated against other items or other swords.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.800
Listen, you just spent a whole page

35:52.800 --> 35:54.400
teaching me how to make swords

35:54.400 --> 35:56.480
and then you're spending the rest of the page

35:56.480 --> 35:58.960
dissuading me from wanting to make the sword

35:58.960 --> 35:59.760
in the first place.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.160
Listen, dog, I just finished watching Highlander

36:02.160 --> 36:04.400
for the first time, do not kill my buzz.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.840
Electricity does not shoot out of someone's severed neck

36:07.840 --> 36:11.680
and empowering the person who did the severing.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.160
This is a myth, a Hollywood myth made to sell tickets.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.240
Immortals are a peace loving people.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.080
They're not violent in any way.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.000
Swords have never directly killed somebody.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.320
That is a myth, that is a myth.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.240
Every time you see someone killed with a sword,

36:26.240 --> 36:26.960
it is a myth.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.640
Guess how many people alcohol has killed?

36:30.640 --> 36:31.280
Billions.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.000
Regulate, why don't you regulate that

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
before you regulate all my swords?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Everyone you know has been killed by alcohol.

36:38.880 --> 36:43.120
It's my 30th or so amendment right

36:43.120 --> 36:45.600
to carry a sword around in public, unsheathed.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.760
Right to cut off arms.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.160
I have a concealed carry permit for my sword.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.480
It is basically just like we're talking about

36:52.480 --> 36:55.360
from my right shoulder blade down my left pant leg.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.000
That's where I keep it.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.440
Also, I'm a wandering soldier, righting wrongs.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.520
Dave walks with a really weird limp.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.400
Have you noticed that?

37:02.400 --> 37:04.080
It's almost like he's got a sword down his,

37:04.080 --> 37:07.120
shh, it's concealed, it's concealed, it's concealed.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.760
If shit goes south, he's gonna be the one

37:09.760 --> 37:10.880
that fucking saves us.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.120
Although shit, swords have never killed anybody.

37:14.400 --> 37:14.880
Fuck.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.280
Swords are actually physically incapable.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.560
If some fool comes up here with a gun,

37:18.560 --> 37:19.600
we're not gonna be able to do anything

37:19.600 --> 37:21.200
because swords are fairly normal.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.960
Don't worry, he can just cut the gun in half.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.640
Oh, no, no, no, I read on Anvil Fire

37:24.640 --> 37:26.080
that that's a myth, damn.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.040
What does he use it for?

37:27.040 --> 37:28.000
I don't know, like celery?

37:29.360 --> 37:30.800
Is there celery that needs chopped?

37:30.800 --> 37:33.600
Like that's Dave, Dave with a bullet.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.100
You know what I mean?

37:35.360 --> 37:36.160
I mean, it's sword.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.280
Dave has a gun?

37:37.280 --> 37:38.080
No, no, no, no.

37:38.080 --> 37:38.800
No, no, no, no.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.120
It's just a saying that I made up just now.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.160
Gunswords are real, and in fact,

37:44.160 --> 37:46.320
half of swords have guns in them.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.440
This is a true statement.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
But there's no way to tell if it's a gunsword

37:50.000 --> 37:51.040
just by looking at it.

37:51.040 --> 37:54.320
No, no, no, the truth will be discovered in the moment.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.640
When the time is right and you need it the most,

37:58.640 --> 38:00.240
the gunsword will present itself.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.800
Guns are basically just swords

38:02.800 --> 38:04.160
that throw little swords.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.840
They're just really bad swords.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.680
They're just bad swords, really.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.840
This gun's so, oh, I see.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.680
Yeah, your sword goes super fast,

38:11.680 --> 38:13.120
but can it cut through concrete?

38:13.120 --> 38:13.600
Nope.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.840
I read on another website that swords can.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.440
I'm getting some disputed claims

38:17.440 --> 38:18.800
about my ability to cut into concrete.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.120
Can we fact check internet, please?

38:21.120 --> 38:22.320
Let me check Yahoo Answers.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.520
All right, I'm actually literally-

38:25.520 --> 38:37.200
What can I cut with a sword?

38:41.200 --> 38:43.120
I got a message for you from Dan Ramble

38:43.120 --> 38:45.360
and Zilla's Fiesta Party on the house.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.920
I feel like it wasn't Zilla.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.640
What was it?

38:48.640 --> 38:50.560
It's not, but I think Zilla-

38:50.560 --> 38:51.200
It was Larry.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.960
Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.520
Yeah, but I think Zilla's an actual human here

38:55.520 --> 38:56.800
who's injected herself into

38:56.800 --> 38:57.840
the Fiesta Party on the house.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.840
Christine, I have no clue

38:59.840 --> 39:01.040
which wife got you for your birthday

39:01.040 --> 39:01.440
because quite frankly-

39:01.440 --> 39:03.840
Of the new Hampshire Fiesta Party on the houses?

39:04.560 --> 39:06.320
Christine, I have no clue

39:06.320 --> 39:07.600
what my wife got you for your birthday

39:07.600 --> 39:08.320
because quite frankly,

39:08.320 --> 39:09.840
this shout out is way better.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.760
We've bonded over NBNB AM

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
and I'm always pumped to text you

39:13.760 --> 39:15.520
the latest silly goof from the brothers.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.880
I hope you are paying us for those.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.760
As you know, we have a copyright on all our bits.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.640
So let's just keep this a secret.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.760
Happy birthday and good luck in university.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.680
New little sister from us.

39:29.680 --> 39:30.640
So that's lovely.

39:30.640 --> 39:31.600
This is so nice.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.760
I'm very confused as to the relationship

39:33.760 --> 39:34.960
between these two people.

39:34.960 --> 39:35.280
But it's not-

39:35.280 --> 39:36.320
Don't get too bogged down.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.440
It's very Dawson's Creek.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.320
If you think about it too much,

39:38.320 --> 39:39.280
it's just gonna get confusing.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.080
Griff, you got another message for us?

39:42.080 --> 39:42.400
I do.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.720
This message is for David Leavenworth

39:44.720 --> 39:47.760
from Jacob McClintic who says,

39:47.760 --> 39:48.960
happy birthday, Davo.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.840
What a clever nickname.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.120
Come on, Jacob.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.160
You can do better than that.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.040
You're better than that.

39:55.040 --> 39:58.160
Thanks for coming to us for critique

39:58.160 --> 39:59.200
on this nickname choice.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.000
Let me try, can I try my own here?

40:02.000 --> 40:02.240
Yeah.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.280
Happy birthday, Mr. Sweats.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.600
No, it's important that he always wears sweats.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.320
Happy birthday, Mr. Sweats.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
I hope this shout out on our favorite podcast

40:16.320 --> 40:17.120
makes up for the fact

40:17.120 --> 40:19.040
that I didn't get you anything tangible.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.240
Thanks for being there for me

40:20.240 --> 40:21.200
when times are tough

40:21.200 --> 40:23.200
and being the best friend a guy could ask for.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.640
Also, you piece of shit.

40:24.640 --> 40:25.760
I fucking hate you.

40:26.560 --> 40:27.200
Whoa.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.400
Fuck off, Mr. Sweats.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.600
That's a harsh turn.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.000
Listen.

40:30.000 --> 40:30.720
Twist.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.000
You do a lot for David.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.520
You get him through some hard times,

40:33.520 --> 40:34.240
cocksucker.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.120
Wait, David is Mr. Sweats.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.720
Wait, have you ever seen David and Mr. Sweats

40:40.720 --> 40:42.640
in the same place at the same time?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.880
Have you also noticed how much Dave perspires?

40:46.880 --> 40:47.920
It's crazy.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.800
Guys, I do not think that Unbreakable 2

40:50.800 --> 40:52.960
has the same high stakes tension

40:52.960 --> 40:55.520
with Mr. Sweats as the lead antagonist.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.360
They called me Mr. Sweats.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.200
I know that you never sweat.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.480
It is almost like you are my foil.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.960
Unmoistable was that one.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.360
That dude's been running for like two hours.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.080
Honey, have I ever been sweaty?

41:16.080 --> 41:18.240
Uh, let me think about it.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.160
I swear we have a picture-

41:20.160 --> 41:21.440
I've never done your laundry.

41:21.440 --> 41:24.000
We have a picture of you being sweaty somewhere.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.160
Yeah, it's sweet.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.680
My dad never sweats.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.720
I don't understand it.

41:30.400 --> 41:34.160
His only problem is that he can't see.

41:34.160 --> 41:34.720
He's blind.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.160
Drop it.

41:42.160 --> 41:42.880
I'm in a maze.

41:42.880 --> 41:43.600
Someone help me.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.400
Who saved me?

41:44.400 --> 41:45.920
Mr. Sweats did.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.280
That's the twist ending.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.040
Mr. Sweats hates you, but he loves you.

41:52.080 --> 41:52.960
What a twist!

41:52.960 --> 41:54.880
What a twist from the makers

41:55.520 --> 41:57.600
of that one devil elevator movie.

41:57.600 --> 41:58.800
You know what though?

41:58.800 --> 42:01.200
He could make this exact movie verbatim.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.280
It would still be better than The Happening.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.080
It's true.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.480
Well, by better you mean like quality-wise,

42:06.480 --> 42:08.320
not in terms of like enjoyment of watching

42:08.320 --> 42:10.160
because there is no more enjoyable movie

42:10.160 --> 42:11.280
than The Happening.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.000
Fair enough.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.360
Are you eyeing my lemon drink?

42:13.360 --> 42:14.000
No, I'm not.

42:14.000 --> 42:14.640
I can't see.

42:14.640 --> 42:15.680
Like I can't fucking see.

42:16.400 --> 42:16.960
I can't see.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.480
You look like you need refreshment.

42:18.480 --> 42:19.760
Obviously I don't.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.640
Clearly I don't.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.480
No way of regulating my body temperature.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.240
Travis, you got one more message?

42:28.960 --> 42:31.040
Yes, this is for Nancy from Spencer,

42:31.040 --> 42:33.520
Stefan, Sabrina, and Kara.

42:34.080 --> 42:34.960
Hey, Nancy.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.080
Hey there, Nancy.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.120
Guess what, Nancy?

42:37.120 --> 42:38.160
It's your birthday.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.160
You're the coolest gal in Birthday Town

42:40.160 --> 42:42.400
and one of a kind IRL friend

42:42.400 --> 42:45.440
with a voice made to sing and a heart made to care.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.800
Your friends all appreciate you

42:46.800 --> 42:49.200
at least $100 more than you could ever know

42:49.200 --> 42:50.800
and they want you to know that.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.280
So enjoy your strawberry-free B-day.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.080
You deserve it.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.280
A voice made to sing and a heart made to care.

42:57.280 --> 43:02.240
Is your friend, Nancy, like a heroine

43:02.240 --> 43:05.120
in a noir crime novel?

43:05.120 --> 43:06.880
I think it's Nancy Sinatra.

43:06.880 --> 43:07.600
Oh, okay.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.760
Happy birthday, Nancy.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.400
Gosh, what a storied career you've had.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.360
And I'm glad that your friends

43:13.360 --> 43:15.040
finally got rid of all those strawberries.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.080
You think she's allergic or just like...

43:18.080 --> 43:19.120
She's fucking hate them.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.280
This birthday, fuck strawberries.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.400
They're not even a real fruit.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.920
The fruit is the seed on the outside.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.120
Get that shit out of here.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.200
Listen, Nancy is turning 68 years old.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.600
She is running out of themes for her birthday.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.360
This year's theme, Nancy, we need a theme.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.560
I don't know, fuck strawberries?

43:33.200 --> 43:33.760
I guess.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.480
It's better than nothing.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.320
You've all tried Hulu.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.360
Everybody knows about Hulu,

43:39.360 --> 43:41.760
but have you guys gotten into Hulu Plus yet?

43:41.760 --> 43:42.880
You know we have.

43:42.880 --> 43:43.360
I've been trying-

43:43.360 --> 43:44.720
Plus-sized Hulu, right?

43:44.720 --> 43:46.640
I've been using Hulu Minus lately.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.200
I do not know that it is getting the job done for me.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.440
For me, there is only Hulu and Hulu Minus.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.240
Hulu Plus is Hulu, as far as I'm concerned.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.680
You can see exclusive content,

43:55.680 --> 43:58.960
like Hulu Originals The Awesomes with SNL Seth Meyers

43:58.960 --> 44:02.320
and Moon Boy starring Chris O'Dowd from Bridesmaids.

44:02.320 --> 44:02.800
That's a good one.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.680
It's a charming little Irish television program.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.640
He's a great talent.

44:06.640 --> 44:07.600
He's a great find.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.040
But listen, with all this awesome stuff,

44:09.040 --> 44:10.400
it's got to be super expensive, right?

44:11.360 --> 44:12.160
No, you idiot.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.360
It's only $8 a month.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.040
They say $7.99.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.360
I'm not going to buy into this hypocrisy.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.120
It's actually $7.99 repeating.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.400
It's $8, okay?

44:21.280 --> 44:22.640
But for $8, that's a value.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.080
You're not going to care about that extra penny.

44:24.080 --> 44:24.960
I just admit it.

44:24.960 --> 44:28.320
Because you can stream as many TV shows and movies as you want.

44:29.040 --> 44:30.320
And we're going to give you,

44:31.360 --> 44:32.960
let's call it two free weeks

44:33.680 --> 44:37.120
when you go to huluplus.com forward slash my brother.

44:37.120 --> 44:40.880
It's a special offer for listeners.

44:40.880 --> 44:44.160
Huluplus.com slash my brother.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.760
And you get a free trial

44:45.760 --> 44:48.480
and they know that we have a lot of power over you.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.120
We control you.

44:50.160 --> 44:53.520
And it's worth it just to see the hug melt moment

44:53.520 --> 44:54.320
in America's next-

44:54.320 --> 44:55.280
Oh, yes.

44:55.280 --> 44:55.840
You watched it.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.960
I really got into it now and I can't stop watching it.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.480
Did you just watch my best-selling Vine?

45:01.200 --> 45:01.760
I do love it.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.360
I also love the sorry about the clowns moment.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.560
That's just torn the internet apart.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.080
Greatest line on the TV is,

45:08.080 --> 45:09.760
I'm sorry about the clowns.

45:09.760 --> 45:10.320
I fucked up.

45:10.320 --> 45:11.680
And if you don't know what you're talking about,

45:11.680 --> 45:13.200
you need to go on Hulu Plus,

45:13.200 --> 45:14.560
watch America's Next Top Model,

45:14.560 --> 45:16.160
2.0, Boys in the House.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.800
This week was nut bars.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.560
The clothes at the end, they were like,

45:20.560 --> 45:21.360
you're out.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.000
Guess what?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.280
This person's back in.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.800
This other person's back in too.

45:24.800 --> 45:25.520
And guess what?

45:25.520 --> 45:26.720
You're also out.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.280
Fuck it.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.080
Fuck the rules.

45:29.040 --> 45:30.800
There are no rules with 2.0, baby.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.400
2.0, Boys in the House.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.680
Boys in the House.

45:33.680 --> 45:37.040
Game done changed.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.280
Hey, this is Aaron and Brian from Throwing Shade,

45:39.280 --> 45:42.160
and we would love to throw some shade on you this summer.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.560
Every Tuesday, we inject all sorts of news stories

45:44.560 --> 45:48.720
concerning ladies and gays with silliness and sexiness.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.400
Just in time for bikini season.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.960
Check us out on Max Fun under Throwing Shade.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.080
Okay, they're not stupid.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.680
I know, but yeah, they could be.

45:55.680 --> 45:56.880
Why would you spell it out like that?

45:56.880 --> 45:59.120
Because I was the spelling bee champion of the world.

45:59.120 --> 46:07.920
I have both a co-worker and a friend that are very much into creating their own music.

46:07.920 --> 46:10.320
They talk about it often and give me CDs to listen to.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.840
I do not enjoy either one's music.

46:12.560 --> 46:16.080
Strangely enough, both musicians' music reminds me of elevator music

46:16.080 --> 46:19.040
remixed with techno flair and dying cat's last howl.

46:19.040 --> 46:22.240
Needless to say, I want to avoid complimenting them on their sound crimes,

46:22.240 --> 46:25.920
but have to say something about the CD they just gave me.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.800
What is the right way to tell them the music they put their heart and soul into

46:28.800 --> 46:30.560
is not for me without hurting their feelings?

46:30.560 --> 46:32.240
And that's from Twin Cities Techno.

46:32.240 --> 46:36.480
And Twin Cities Techno, great news, there's an easy solution

46:36.480 --> 46:43.280
fresh off the assembly line at my bim bam co-industries.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.600
You lie.

46:45.600 --> 46:46.240
You're gonna lie.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.760
You're gonna lie about it.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.040
You're gonna just lie.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.160
You're gonna lie.

46:50.160 --> 46:50.960
And it goes like this.

46:50.960 --> 46:51.760
It's just as easy.

46:51.760 --> 46:52.720
Man, that was great.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.160
Thanks for letting me borrow that CD.

46:54.160 --> 46:54.640
It's awesome.

46:54.640 --> 46:56.080
Can't wait for the next one.

46:56.080 --> 46:56.400
Yeah.

46:56.400 --> 46:56.800
Done.

46:56.800 --> 46:57.760
Keep them coming.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.240
Listen, well- Just keep cranking out the jams, man.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.480
You should quit your job and just do this full time.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.080
You can just say what you told us, but like, spin it like a good thing.

47:06.080 --> 47:10.000
Like, it sounded kind of like elevator music with a techno flair

47:10.000 --> 47:11.840
with a dying cat's last howl over it.

47:11.840 --> 47:12.880
And like, I like that.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.200
Or just flip it to negative, like that mirror in Zelda.

47:17.200 --> 47:20.560
And you just sit there and just throw like, not and didn't into all of those.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.760
Like, it definitely didn't sound like elevator music

47:23.760 --> 47:26.640
remixed with the techno flair and not a dying cat's last howl.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.360
It was kind of like being in like a really cool elevator

47:29.360 --> 47:30.800
where techno music was playing.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.000
And also, there was like all kinds of sick cats around.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.440
They were dying.

47:35.440 --> 47:37.520
I don't do not enjoy either one of you.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.760
The beats are so sick that it's like the cats were like

47:39.760 --> 47:41.840
dying in this cool elevator.

47:41.840 --> 47:43.120
But they were like cool with it.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.400
Like, they kind of wanted to die.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.440
They're like Sylvia Plaskett.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.240
Yeah, it was like a bunch of-

47:46.240 --> 47:48.480
They led a good life and they were suffering

47:48.480 --> 47:49.760
and they were just happy to end it.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.840
Totally rad hospice cats in like this totally sweet elevator.

47:53.840 --> 47:57.440
And the elevator was like to heaven and like they knew that in some way.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.560
And you could just hear it.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.760
Yeah, in their chorus of meows.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.680
Oh, really good stuff.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.320
Really, really good stuff.

48:04.320 --> 48:09.920
I almost, my first listen to it was such like a profound moment for me

48:09.920 --> 48:14.960
that I'm not sure I could ever like really listen to it again.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.080
It's like Donnie Darko.

48:16.080 --> 48:17.520
You know, you watch it, you're so moved

48:17.520 --> 48:19.040
and I just don't know that I could stand it.

48:19.040 --> 48:19.520
Like, I can't-

48:19.520 --> 48:20.560
You know, the emotions.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.160
I can't watch American Beauty.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.440
Like, I can't go there.

48:23.440 --> 48:27.280
And to be like honest with you, like listening to it was such a personal experience

48:27.280 --> 48:29.120
that I don't really feel comfortable talking about it.

48:29.120 --> 48:29.620
I'm sorry.

48:30.960 --> 48:35.040
I'm sorry, it's like, why don't you ask me about my first time having sex?

48:35.040 --> 48:36.160
Why don't you have me describe that?

48:36.160 --> 48:38.400
And I would rather talk about that right now.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.120
Do you want to?

48:39.120 --> 48:40.240
Okay, so this is what it was-

48:40.240 --> 48:41.920
So I lost my virginity to your CD.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.120
It's great doing it music.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.720
Because like when I was like-

48:46.720 --> 48:48.880
I thought you meant like you fucked the CD.

48:48.880 --> 48:49.600
No, no.

48:49.600 --> 48:55.600
No, when I was making Love, it was that one track that sounded like all the hospice cats.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.240
And the person was like, I really like the sound of these hospice cats.

48:58.240 --> 49:01.520
I feel like I'm in like the coolest elevator making love to you for the first time.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.680
Oh, you want to meet this person that liked your music?

49:03.680 --> 49:05.520
Um, they don't-

49:05.520 --> 49:06.160
You shouldn't-

49:06.800 --> 49:07.920
They would be uncomfortable.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.400
I think they had such an intimate connection with you.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.160
And it's like we haven't been dating that long,

49:12.160 --> 49:15.280
so it's like I'm not really at that phase where I introduce one of my co-workers yet.

49:15.280 --> 49:20.320
But you know, it was actually so intimate and personal, this experience for me that

49:20.880 --> 49:24.960
I would prefer you not play your music for anybody.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.360
Yeah.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.520
No, that's my- it's my music now.

49:27.520 --> 49:35.120
I kind of want like a patronage style thing where like I pay you to make the music,

49:35.120 --> 49:37.280
but no one else gets to listen to it.

49:37.280 --> 49:41.280
And I may not just because it's really personal.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.120
Oh, I just had the best idea.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.800
Did you?

49:44.800 --> 49:49.040
Yeah, you need to- you need to like star-cross this.

49:49.040 --> 49:54.000
You need to like take your co-worker's CD, give it to your friend,

49:54.000 --> 49:57.120
give your friend's CD to your co-worker,

49:57.120 --> 49:59.760
then like put them together in the same room and say,

49:59.760 --> 50:02.000
oh yeah, you listen to that CD and you listen to their CD.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.520
Oh, I'm going to go grab a drink and then just let them like add it.

50:05.520 --> 50:05.920
And then-

50:05.920 --> 50:08.080
And either they're going to love each other and you're out,

50:08.720 --> 50:11.040
or they're going to be like, I kind of thought your music was dumb.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.680
Oh yeah, well your music was dumb and you don't have to say a word.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.360
And you get them caught in that feedback loop.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.800
That's how Steely Dan was formed.

50:18.640 --> 50:19.280
Think about it.

50:19.920 --> 50:21.440
I think you should say, it's pretty good.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.560
You mind if I make some edits?

50:22.560 --> 50:23.520
And they say, yeah, sure.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.960
I'd love to hear you put your own spin on it.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.320
I'd love to hear your remix.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.640
And then you just burn them a copy of Jazzy Jeff in the house.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.040
And then you give them that.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.200
And then they say, this sounds- this does sound a lot better.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.360
What if you say, I'd like to make some edits.

50:35.360 --> 50:37.200
And they say, sure, remix it.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.000
And then you just make them watch you snap the CD over your knee.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.000
There you go.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.680
That's much better.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.760
Is there any true facts that you can tell?

50:45.760 --> 50:49.360
Can you be like, I like- it's a very professional printing.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.640
I like how round it was.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.400
There were not any rough edges on the CD, which was nice.

50:54.400 --> 50:54.800
I like-

50:54.800 --> 50:57.600
I like that it was a CD-RW, which was nice.

50:57.600 --> 50:58.480
Because I reused it.

51:02.480 --> 51:11.760
I really liked how its circumference was like 3.14 the size of its diameter.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.440
I really kind of dug that about it.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.120
It was like a really clever take on it.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.560
I really like the disc art.

51:16.560 --> 51:19.840
I wrote on it with a sharp- yeah, it's like so minimal.

51:19.840 --> 51:21.360
So DIY, you know?

51:21.360 --> 51:23.040
Why did you write brain poison?

51:23.040 --> 51:23.520
It's art.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.560
It's like punk rock.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.040
You wrote brain poison.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.160
Do not listen to.

51:28.160 --> 51:28.880
Too personal.

51:30.080 --> 51:30.720
Too personal.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.760
Listen only once when you make love to your future wife.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.040
How did you meet mom?

51:37.040 --> 51:38.560
This is how I met your mother ends.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.560
You guys have eight years?

51:40.560 --> 51:41.360
Sit down.

51:41.360 --> 51:41.840
Sit down.

51:42.640 --> 51:44.960
My friend let me borrow this shitty CD.

51:44.960 --> 51:46.480
It was super round.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.120
But before that-

51:47.120 --> 51:48.400
His name is Rob Thomas.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
And now you know the rest of the story.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.920
Think about naming my band Matchbox 5.

51:53.920 --> 51:54.880
Too low.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.400
Keep going up.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.120
And listen, I say that I love Matchbox 20, you guys.

51:59.120 --> 52:00.880
So I don't want any of your hate mail.

52:00.880 --> 52:01.120
No, no, no.

52:01.120 --> 52:03.120
But you prefer Rob Thomas' solo shit.

52:03.120 --> 52:07.280
And when I say his solo shit, I mean that includes the Santana song.

52:07.280 --> 52:07.760
You can just-

52:07.760 --> 52:10.560
You can really see the Rob Thomas shining through his solo stuff.

52:10.560 --> 52:14.560
He's not as held back by the other 19 Matchbox members.

52:15.520 --> 52:16.640
That's why his second-

52:16.640 --> 52:19.200
His first solo CD was called Me and Santana, No Limits.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.240
And then he got that cease and desist letter from Santana.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.120
You'd never met him.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.960
Stop showing that video you made.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.240
I recorded this sweet CD with this guy named Satan.

52:33.040 --> 52:34.080
Did you meet him?

52:35.440 --> 52:36.400
Did you meet him?

52:36.400 --> 52:37.520
I don't think that's right.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.760
Yeah, it's called Smooth.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.600
He plays this sick electric Latin guitar riff that I've never heard.

52:43.600 --> 52:45.200
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're talking about Santana.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.680
Pretty sure his name was Satan.

52:47.680 --> 52:48.640
Satan, I think.

52:49.440 --> 52:49.680
Pretty sure.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.160
The weirdest thing, I heard this on VH1 Behind Music.

52:52.160 --> 52:55.920
During that whole recording process, Santana thought he was working with Rob Zalm.

53:01.200 --> 53:04.560
Hey man, I just wanted to say I love your work on Veronica Mars.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.120
Hey, what?

53:05.120 --> 53:05.600
You mean-

53:05.600 --> 53:06.880
No, that's the other Rob Thomas.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.160
Okay, I can see how this happened now.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.960
I really liked it when you made me that sandwich at Arby's.

53:10.960 --> 53:12.160
That was Bob Thomas.

53:12.160 --> 53:17.120
You're thinking of Bob Thomas, the Arby's attendee.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.120
I really liked when you were the president.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.160
That's Thomas Jefferson.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.680
You're getting further and further off.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.480
I like your morning radio show.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.000
Let me think.

53:30.000 --> 53:30.640
Bob and Tom?

53:34.720 --> 53:36.880
You were really off the reservations there, man.

53:36.880 --> 53:41.760
I like it when I put you at the end of my fishing line and then I can tell when I have a bite.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.440
Are you talking about a bobber?

53:45.360 --> 53:49.760
I couldn't tell if you were doing an impression of Santana or Rob Zombie for like half an hour.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.400
I really love how you govern the damned souls in hell.

53:52.960 --> 53:56.000
No, I don't think that's me, Bob.

53:57.040 --> 53:57.840
Bob Thompson.

53:57.840 --> 54:04.320
I really like how you're a merry fellow living in a small valley close to the Withlywine River.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.320
Oh, that's Tom Bombadil.

54:09.600 --> 54:10.160
Killing me.

54:12.720 --> 54:13.520
You guys want Yahoo?

54:14.160 --> 54:14.480
Sure.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.640
This one is sent in by Sean Fagan.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.120
Thanks, Sean.

54:17.120 --> 54:19.120
It's by Yahoo Insta's user, Tommy, who asks,

54:19.840 --> 54:24.720
would it be weird to wear a shirt that says full-time baller for picture day?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.320
Part-time, occasional, seasonal baller.

54:30.320 --> 54:34.080
I go to a Catholic school and we normally have to wear a uniform,

54:34.080 --> 54:36.240
but we can wear whatever we want for picture day.

54:36.240 --> 54:43.200
And my mom says it would be weird to wear a shirt with words for a high school picture day.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.480
I just want to express myself, though, so I don't know.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.840
You got to be weird.

54:49.840 --> 54:53.840
You got to be careful when you wear a worded shirt for picture day,

54:53.840 --> 54:57.040
because if it gets cut off, it could just say like, this kid's a full-time ball.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.920
What kind of cutoff would there be on that shirt,

55:01.920 --> 55:04.480
given that it's kind of like one of the corners is angled?

55:05.200 --> 55:07.440
What do you think it says ball-er?

55:07.440 --> 55:08.560
It's the top of it, right?

55:08.560 --> 55:09.440
It could just say full.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.560
This kid has been satiated by the foodie today.

55:13.840 --> 55:16.400
You should send a threatening message to yourself in the future.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.680
What if you wore a shirt that just said like, I don't have a job.

55:19.680 --> 55:20.560
Where did you go wrong?

55:20.560 --> 55:22.560
Or just a shirt that just says wasted it.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.680
You wasted it.

55:23.680 --> 55:24.720
You wasted it all.

55:25.840 --> 55:26.800
So much promise.

55:26.800 --> 55:28.000
I blame you, older me.

55:28.560 --> 55:29.760
Are we an astronaut yet?

55:29.760 --> 55:32.080
Are you an astronaut?

55:35.040 --> 55:37.920
I think full-time baller gets that job done, because then he can look back.

55:38.640 --> 55:41.840
He can look back and say like, am I still balling it?

55:41.840 --> 55:43.680
Am I still balling it 40 hours a week?

55:44.960 --> 55:46.880
I feel like I've cut back to like 31.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.600
I'm definitely not hitting that 32 to 40 range.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.560
What if it said, what if your shirt said unpaid overtime baller?

55:53.280 --> 55:54.880
It's like you need to unionize, dude.

55:54.880 --> 55:59.440
Full-time baller with benefits.

55:59.440 --> 56:03.040
I'm not even balling enough to get health care under Obamacare.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.320
There's very little balling going on in my day-to-day.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.920
Baller can mean all kinds of things, right?

56:08.960 --> 56:10.000
It's not just like-

56:10.000 --> 56:13.760
I always assumed it was from like sports stars.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.240
That like that was the origin of the word.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.600
But it can also mean like sex, right?

56:19.600 --> 56:21.040
Like you just have a lot of sex.

56:22.320 --> 56:25.120
You play basketball and that's where the ball part of it comes from.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.760
But also you can like you can like ball somebody

56:27.760 --> 56:30.000
and that's like a gross way of saying you had sex with them, right?

56:30.000 --> 56:31.840
That is a disgusting way of saying you had sex.

56:31.840 --> 56:32.240
What does that mean?

56:32.240 --> 56:33.840
You just like put your balls inside of them?

56:35.120 --> 56:36.000
Why would you do that?

56:36.800 --> 56:40.400
Or you just kind of undramatically lay your balls on them.

56:40.960 --> 56:41.600
Like a shelf?

56:43.360 --> 56:45.840
More of like just like a brief respite.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.400
These dogs I might have barking.

56:50.000 --> 56:50.880
I'm gonna prop them up.

56:50.880 --> 56:52.240
Do you mind if I just put these here?

56:52.240 --> 56:53.360
Oh, were you gonna use that?

56:53.360 --> 56:53.840
I'm sorry.

56:54.960 --> 56:56.160
Were you not done eating that?

56:56.160 --> 56:56.640
My bad.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.040
My bad.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.480
Sorry, I put my balls on your waffle.

57:00.080 --> 57:01.280
I thought that's what it was there for.

57:01.920 --> 57:03.440
I mean read the shirt, ma'am.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.760
It is 3 30 p.m.

57:07.760 --> 57:09.440
It is obviously I'm on the clock.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.440
What did you think I meant?

57:13.440 --> 57:17.040
What if my fucking supervisor saw me not balling?

57:17.680 --> 57:18.240
That's my-

57:18.240 --> 57:21.040
Do you understand how competitive this fucking market is?

57:21.040 --> 57:21.920
In this economy?

57:21.920 --> 57:22.960
You want me unemployed?

57:22.960 --> 57:26.480
I'm already scraping by on fucking minimum wage.

57:27.120 --> 57:30.320
There's 10 other people waiting to put their balls on your waffle.

57:32.560 --> 57:34.640
I have a teen daughter I have to feed.

57:37.120 --> 57:41.120
This isn't where I saw myself when I took my high school picture day photo, but so be it.

57:41.120 --> 57:43.120
You don't put your balls on shit, you're shit.

57:43.120 --> 57:43.840
You're fired.

57:46.640 --> 57:48.880
A always B, B, B balling.

57:48.880 --> 57:53.440
Do you want the sweet leaves as to what to put your balls on?

57:53.440 --> 57:57.040
Coffee is for waffle ball putter honors or something.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.000
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.400
Third knife is you still ball all the time because you're a full-time baller.

58:08.400 --> 58:09.360
I can't change that.

58:10.080 --> 58:11.280
I'm only Alec Baldwin.

58:12.240 --> 58:13.200
Baldwin.

58:13.200 --> 58:13.600
Sorry?

58:13.600 --> 58:17.520
What?

58:17.520 --> 58:18.800
Man, I'm just mad.

58:18.800 --> 58:22.320
Alan Alda probably is the biggest baller like to ever ball, right?

58:22.880 --> 58:23.840
Yeah, sure.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.040
It's not even a job for him.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.080
It's just like life.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.040
It's just like his life.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.240
He does it in his sleep at this point.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.160
It's probably easy for him to just like drape his-

58:34.080 --> 58:35.040
Stop it.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.400
I did it from over there.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.440
How did you do that?

58:37.440 --> 58:39.520
My wife will divorce me.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.720
I cannot do this with you.

58:41.520 --> 58:42.480
Thank you for listening, my brother.

58:42.480 --> 58:43.680
My brother and me, it's an advice show.

58:43.680 --> 58:44.160
We hope you've been-

58:44.160 --> 58:44.640
Got them.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.000
How'd you do that, Alan Alda?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.760
We were mid-conversation.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.040
This has been our show.

58:51.040 --> 58:51.920
We hope you liked it.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.840
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

58:54.560 --> 59:02.160
Jason O'Connor, Addie Schweiss, Slam Bam, Miriam, Steve Fallows, Cruz Flores, Cheater,

59:02.160 --> 59:09.200
Trey Smith, Corrin Porter, Krista, Cheese Mary, Nicholas, Lephart, Ian Oliver, Jake,

59:09.200 --> 59:14.640
Nate Hall, Reagan, Rogan, I guess, Samuel Newkirk, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

59:16.160 --> 59:23.280
Chris Zuback-Skies, who said very, very accurately, I'd say this episode of MBMBAM was

59:23.280 --> 59:26.320
weird, but like, what am I comparing it to?

59:26.320 --> 59:27.200
Which is accurate.

59:28.320 --> 59:32.960
If you want to tweet about the show, make sure you use the MBMBAM hashtag and follow

59:32.960 --> 59:33.920
us on Twitter if you don't already.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.560
When you do tweet about the show, try to include a link to our sampler.

59:36.560 --> 59:39.520
It's bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM2013.

59:39.520 --> 59:41.920
If you're going to tumble the show, use that hashtag too.

59:42.960 --> 59:44.880
Sometimes I look at the Tumblr hashtags.

59:45.760 --> 59:46.080
OK.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.880
It's mostly slash fiction.

59:48.880 --> 59:49.760
Catch us on Grindr.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.280
Catch us on Grindr.

59:51.280 --> 59:55.120
Use the hashtag full-bodied brothers.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.760
Full-time baller.

59:57.760 --> 59:58.720
Full-time baller, bros.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.400
Oh, also, just because it just popped into my head, this week is banned books week.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.240
What the fuck?

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.920
It's a week of, like, drawing attention to all these wonderful books that have been banned.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.000
No, I mean, everybody knows what banned books week is.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.920
Like, why are we talking about it?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.040
Because I want everyone to buy their kids some banned books.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.840
Stick it to the man.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.960
Some of those books are banned for a reason, though, Trav.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.000
They're pretty shitty.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.560
I'm not saying all-

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.480
I wish that was the only reason the books got banned.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.280
Like, no, this is pretty shitty.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.680
I'm not saying all of them are, but I am saying that, like, Fahrenheit 451 espouses

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.480
some pretty dangerous ideas.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.800
They read that one, then they're all about banned books.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.440
And then if they, like, start fighting against that, then they're going to get into some

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.720
really dangerous ideas.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.080
So, anyway.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.960
And Susan Powder's Stop the Insanity is just nonsensical.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.480
I don't even understand.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.280
Banned.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.160
Ban it.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.760
But the number one banned books right now is Captain Underpants.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.160
Yeah.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.040
Really?

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:55.520
Yeah.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.080
You want to look at some naked chubby dudes for a bit?

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.600
You want your kids to look at that?

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.200
How about you just go anywhere on the internet?

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:01.920
Just throw a dart at the internet.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.600
Just search full-size brothers.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.400
Full-buddy brothers.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:04.880
Throw a dart.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.480
I want to say thanks to Hulu Plus, where you can binge on thousands of hit shows anytime,

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:11.520
anywhere.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.920
You can get an extended free trial of Hulu Plus when you go to HuluPlus.com forward slash

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.400
my brother.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.920
I just hit this switch on my chair that made it lower, which is why there was an odd peak

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.200
in my voice there.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.200
And again, that address is HuluPlus.com forward slash my brother.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.160
You scare yourself a little bit?

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.920
I got a little scared.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.040
My heart is racing.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.400
I want to thank John Roderick.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.840
As long as we're thanking people, I want to thank John Roderick of the Long Winters for

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.960
the use of our theme song, It's a Departure, which is on the album Putting the Days to

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.440
Bed.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.000
You can find that on Amazon, on iTunes.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.080
You can purchase it for a reasonable price.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.760
It's a good listen.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.880
It's a long listen.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.520
You know what I mean?

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.360
It's got a lot of legs on it, because you can just listen to it over and over again.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.560
You can just do that.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.840
You can just go do that right now.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.520
So just go ahead and go do that right now.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.200
And then when you're done buying and listening to that album, make sure to check out all

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:11.200
the other wonderful podcasts on Maximumfun.org, including my new favorite, Sawbone, starring

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.640
Justin McElroy and Sydney McElroy.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.160
It's a it's a marital tour of misguided medicine.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.120
Did I say that right, Justin?

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:17.840
Perfect.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.600
OK, it's really wonderful.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.280
It's mine and Teresa's new favorite show.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.240
We can't stop listening to it.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:22.880
Go check it out.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.380
Woo.

And all the other ones, of course.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.400
Of course.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.760
Griffin, you got a last question for us?

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.260
I do.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.200
This one was sent in by Elizabeth Medina Gray.
