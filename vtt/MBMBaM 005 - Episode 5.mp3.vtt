00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
If you get no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

01:13.000 --> 01:16.360
I mentioned before we begin that this is an advice show for the modern era.

01:16.360 --> 01:20.960
We offer people advice for free, complimentary advice.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.580
And this first question comes in to us from Justin from West Virginia.

01:24.580 --> 01:31.360
He says, if you buy a cereal that is called Cupcake Pebbles and is based on cupcakes,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.440
how do you eat anything else until that box is empty?

01:34.440 --> 01:36.640
That's a great question.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.940
This is so funny because before we started recording the show, you were talking about

01:39.940 --> 01:41.640
the merits of Cupcake Pebbles.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.640
And also your name is Dustin and also you're from West Virginia.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
That's weird.

01:45.640 --> 01:47.320
The coincidence is overwhelming.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.320
That's weird.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.320
You're right.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
We should skip this question.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.940
I think it might be a prank.

01:52.940 --> 01:57.520
This first question comes in from Allen via Gmail.

01:57.520 --> 02:01.200
Allen asks, this year I'm running for the office of student body president in my high

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
school.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.960
I'm a popular enough guy, but my opponent has an unfair advantage.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.720
His name is Adam West.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Yes.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.080
Believe it or not, his parents named him that.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.880
How the hell could I compete against his name on the ballot?

02:17.880 --> 02:23.480
I would maybe ask his parents to adopt you and give you an equally awesome name because

02:23.480 --> 02:25.920
they sound like awesome kid namers.

02:25.920 --> 02:26.920
They know what's up.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.600
They know how to pick a good name.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.280
The only better name would have been Jim West Desperado.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.520
Rough Rider?

02:36.520 --> 02:37.520
You know what, Nana?

02:37.520 --> 02:45.040
I would say run on a very heavy Smilax based campaign.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.320
The best thing you could do is change your name to something high school kids like more

02:49.320 --> 02:51.720
than Adam West.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.640
What if you had your name legally changed to Free Milkshakes and the Calf?

02:55.640 --> 02:57.520
That's not what kids are good at.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.000
All kids, all high school kids want Free Milkshakes and the Calf.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
No, no.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
They're all about Facebook.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
How about Twilight Bieber?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.480
They're all about Facebook and Whippets now.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.800
I don't know what's going on.

03:07.800 --> 03:08.800
Free Milkshake.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.800
Let me hit you with this.

03:09.800 --> 03:14.160
Milkshake, Facebook, Whippets for your student body president.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
In the Calf.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.560
You know what, we failed to take into account that he might be running against the actual

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
Adam West.

03:20.560 --> 03:27.520
Adam West has returned to high school to beat this kid in the student body president race.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.000
Perhaps he's time traveling.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.880
Maybe if this kid becomes student body president, maybe if Allen becomes student body president,

03:33.880 --> 03:40.440
he'll, I don't know, create some sort of horrifying legislation that dooms the planet.

03:40.440 --> 03:46.440
So maybe Adam West has traveled back forward in time to beat him.

03:46.440 --> 03:51.200
To put forward, to put right what once went wrong, is what you're saying.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.560
An anonymous question from Form Spring, and it's a good one.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.560
Throughout the course of the workday, my shirt comes untucked, but only on the sides of my

03:59.560 --> 04:01.920
shirt by my hip bones.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.720
Any advice on how to keep that part tucked in?

04:05.720 --> 04:06.720
Two words.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
Shirt garters.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
Shirt garters.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
Shirt garters.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.600
I was going to say, get yourself, what were those things that fine gentlemen would wear

04:14.600 --> 04:16.880
in the 1800s?

04:16.880 --> 04:24.480
And they were, it was basically a onesie where your bloomers and your t-shirt would be the

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
same.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.480
I believe it was called a frockle.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.480
A frockle.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.320
I know exactly what you're talking about Griffin.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.040
It's called an anti-masturbation belt.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.560
Yeah, sure.

04:33.560 --> 04:38.480
Or an anti-anything you need access to your genitalia for because this whole thing would

04:38.480 --> 04:41.400
cover up your whole situation down there.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.680
My frockle has been strained lately.

04:43.680 --> 04:44.680
I meant to tell you guys that.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.680
Do you find that happening a lot?

04:45.680 --> 04:49.260
The problem is the frockle, you're putting a lot of pressure on the frockle in a lot

04:49.260 --> 04:53.120
of different places during your usual work routine.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.760
What you have to do is just consistently buy more and better frockles.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.040
And Hanes has some amazing new frockle technology that I really love.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.680
Their sport frockles are really nice.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.960
The extended leg frockles, is that what you're talking about?

05:04.960 --> 05:08.480
On another note, untuck your shirt you fucking nerd.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.480
Whoa.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.240
How about you get a bigger shirt?

05:12.240 --> 05:17.520
Be careful and make sure that your shirt is the kind that is supposed to be tucked in.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.960
If it's squared at the bottom, it's not designed to be tucked in.

05:22.960 --> 05:29.240
Or are you going to a wedding or a funeral because those are the only two sitches.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.160
Consider like the Cash Jude Law look, you know?

05:33.160 --> 05:34.160
Like the Jude Law.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
Totally Cash.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.160
Totally Cash.

05:36.160 --> 05:42.240
Got a jacket over a fine button-up, only the button-up's untucked, but the jacket is tucked.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
Okay.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.560
The untucked shirt with the tucked in jacket?

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
Yeah.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.960
It's difficult to pull off, but I mean if you can swing it.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.480
This question comes from Kevin S. on Yahoo Answers.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.760
He asks, how old do I have to be to get nunchucks?

05:57.760 --> 05:58.760
Legally?

05:58.760 --> 06:03.960
I don't know if there is actually a law.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.160
One of the answers was 21 years old.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.360
It's a very definitive and also probably not correct answer.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.960
Take a shot, buy some nunchucks.

06:11.960 --> 06:16.280
Here's the answer, 45 and still living with your mom.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.520
Another answer is old enough to not want to buy nunchucks.

06:21.520 --> 06:27.400
The moment, so it's like a, it's like a sort of recursive law that's been put in place

06:27.400 --> 06:31.680
where if you are of an age where you want to purchase nunchucks.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.360
You can now no longer buy nunchucks.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.580
You are too young to buy nunchucks.

06:34.580 --> 06:36.060
So it's constantly in flux.

06:36.060 --> 06:37.520
It changes from person to person.

06:37.520 --> 06:41.400
Like for me, I still am not able to buy nunchucks.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
Yeah.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
Because I still really, really want some.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.760
You want them too bad.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.760
I want them so badly.

06:45.760 --> 06:46.760
I want to have them.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
That's incredible.

06:47.760 --> 06:54.080
There's a ridiculously cute girl at Dylan's workplace that he's smitten with.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.020
She flirts with me constantly, he says, and it seems like a genuine interest and attraction

06:58.020 --> 07:00.540
coming from her, but there is a problem.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.540
She might be married.

07:01.540 --> 07:02.540
I know.

07:02.540 --> 07:07.040
None of my coworkers know her well enough to say if she's married and she's from another

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
department.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.040
I don't know any of her coworkers.

07:10.040 --> 07:16.240
Her desk has a picture of her in a nice dress and a guy in a tux, and she has a thin silver

07:16.240 --> 07:18.520
band on her wedding finger.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.840
What should be my first move to try and figure this out?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.120
Dylan, great news.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.200
You've already taken the first step.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.280
You've written to us who are promptly going to tell you that she's married.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.280
Yep.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.640
That's, yeah, that's too many signs.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.640
That can't just be.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
Yeah.

07:33.640 --> 07:39.280
Especially since she owns a wedding finger, and you don't get that for not being at a

07:39.280 --> 07:40.280
wedding.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.280
So.

07:41.280 --> 07:46.220
I, you, no, no, she's married.

07:46.220 --> 07:47.220
Yeah.

07:47.220 --> 07:52.120
Do you remember when Ellen went on vacation for about two weeks last month?

07:52.120 --> 07:53.600
What was that all about?

07:53.600 --> 07:58.220
That seemed like an awfully, she said it was a honeymoon, but I thought that that was like

07:58.220 --> 07:59.220
a joke.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.520
Like a joke, a private joke between her and her coworkers.

08:01.520 --> 08:06.560
I thought it was a joke because she flirts with me constantly, and I didn't get married

08:06.560 --> 08:08.400
to her.

08:08.400 --> 08:20.240
Maybe, maybe you're just a guy at the office who is in charge of pens, and she's always

08:20.240 --> 08:21.240
trying to get some pens.

08:21.240 --> 08:25.240
Hey, did you guys get that invitation from Ellen?

08:25.240 --> 08:26.240
That was funny, right?

08:26.240 --> 08:27.240
What was that all about?

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
Was that a joke?

08:28.240 --> 08:29.240
Was that all about weddings?

08:29.240 --> 08:30.240
I don't know.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.240
Her weddings?

08:31.240 --> 08:32.240
I don't know what that's all about.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
Wedding what?

08:33.240 --> 08:34.240
Who's she marrying?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.520
That's a weird theme for a Cinco de Mayo party, is a wedding.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.600
I'm not sure I get it.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.600
She's so quirky, Ellen.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.760
I love her so much.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.760
This nice dress that she's wearing, Dylan, is it white?

08:43.760 --> 08:48.000
Is it white, and does it have sort of a doily pattern?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.960
Is there a kind of a thin fabric covering her face?

08:51.960 --> 08:54.840
Yeah, like a veiled kind of look.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.440
Is all of her family there, and also her husband's family?

08:58.440 --> 09:02.120
Because that's her husband, because they're at a wedding, and that's a different question.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.440
If her husband comes into work, she isn't married.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.280
Yeah, she has a husband.

09:07.280 --> 09:12.960
If she was wed, if she took part, if she was proposed to and said yes, and then after planning

09:12.960 --> 09:17.240
a wedding, had the wedding, then she's probably been wed.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.680
She's probably betrothed, is basically the thesis.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.960
Even money, even money.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.160
Tommy Redd, good friend of the family.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
Justin's godfather?

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
Is that true?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.160
Yeah, he's my godfather.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.160
What?

09:32.160 --> 09:34.080
The godfather of your future.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.080
He's my godfather.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.520
He's your godfather.

09:36.520 --> 09:44.720
If something happens to my dad, then me, 29-year-old Justin McElroy, will be adopted by Tommy Redd.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.040
That is how it works.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.320
I will live with him.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.440
I will leave my wife to live under the care of Tommy Redd.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.440
Justin's daddy says, my seven-year-old and I spend a lot of time in the car listening

09:57.440 --> 10:01.720
to music while commuting across town to her school or mother's house.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.560
She has really impressive taste so far and claims they might be giants, binfolds, tally

10:05.560 --> 10:09.240
ball, no doubt, real big fish, and the President's as her favorites.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.120
I'd like to expose her to more artists and songs that I consider insightful and enjoyable,

10:13.120 --> 10:14.120
but they use more profanity.

10:14.120 --> 10:19.920
At what point is it okay to say, fuck it, and let your kid listen to whatever they want?

10:19.920 --> 10:20.920
Now.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.920
Fuck it.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.360
I think it's okay to say fuck it after you count to three.

10:25.360 --> 10:30.480
Justin could you perhaps give me a- One, two, three, and fuck it.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.480
Just like that.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.480
Just like that.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.480
I'll say this.

10:33.480 --> 10:37.200
They might be giants, binfolds, she's old enough to make that decision because she's

10:37.200 --> 10:38.200
awesome.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.200
She's cooler than I am.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.320
She's cooler than me.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
You know what, Tommy?

10:42.320 --> 10:48.680
I think the bigger question is, when did you forget what fuck it means?

10:48.680 --> 10:54.800
You do realize that fuck it's not like, I thought this over, and now my decision is

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
fuck it.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.160
Fuck it means like, fuck it, who cares?

10:59.160 --> 11:04.560
I've taken all the variables into account, and the only decision I could come to is fuck

11:04.560 --> 11:05.640
it.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.400
Fuck it.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.400
That's my decision.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.120
I checked the bubble box that says fuck it next to it.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.760
After weighing all my options- Yes, no, maybe, fuck it.

11:14.760 --> 11:15.760
I'm getting it notarized.

11:15.760 --> 11:21.000
At the same time, though, that's the best answer to this question of, my kid is young,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.560
should I let her listen to music with cursing in it?

11:23.560 --> 11:27.160
The absolute correct answer is fuck it, yeah, sure, why not?

11:27.160 --> 11:29.680
Let her hear those words so that she'll learn how to use them better.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.800
I don't think there's a damn thing wrong with profanity.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.800
I love profanity.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
Fucking profanity rules.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
Shit.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
Right?

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
But.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
That shit is awesome.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.400
But I think is the worst curse word.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
Poop, poop, poop.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
You know what I'm saying.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.400
Whoa.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
It's fucking douchey.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
Slow down there.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
Dick shingles.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
ICP.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.400
Shit around.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
Fucking.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.400
It's great.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.400
Okay.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
That's enough.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
Okay.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.400
I hear it a lot.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.400
Let her listen to the last 30 seconds of the show, and then she'll know exactly what

11:56.400 --> 11:57.400
she's saying.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
She can listen to whatever she wants.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.320
She covered all the bases there, son.

12:00.320 --> 12:07.160
My lady friend and I are making a mega love mix to proclaim our undying love for one another.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.400
So far we have two songs, Everything I Do, I Do It For You by Bryan Adams, and The Rose

12:11.400 --> 12:12.920
by Bette Midler.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.400
Suggestions would be greatly appreciated, but they must be held to the same standards

12:16.400 --> 12:18.640
as the tunes previously listed.

12:18.640 --> 12:24.800
By same standards, do you mean like Casey and JoJo and that kind of thing?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.600
Like beautiful, soaring.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
Yeah.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
I know what Justin's gonna say.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
I don't think you do.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.240
I think I exactly do.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.400
What do you think?

12:33.400 --> 12:34.400
I think you're probably gonna bust out.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.800
I think you need to go with On the Wings of Love by Mr. Jeffrey Osbourne, one of the

12:38.800 --> 12:41.000
greatest love songs ever written.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.100
I think that we could have a whole series of answers to this question of songs that

12:46.100 --> 12:52.160
people love as love songs that they play at weddings and stuff, but in reality those

12:52.160 --> 12:57.040
songs aren't about really love.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.040
Like Afternoon Delight?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.240
Well no, that's about a different kind of love.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.800
That's about love in the daytime.

13:01.800 --> 13:07.280
I was talking more about Brick by Ben Folds Five, which people are like, I want that to

13:07.280 --> 13:08.760
be my first wedding dance song.

13:08.760 --> 13:15.840
It's like, that song's about teenage abortion, you need to wise up.

13:15.840 --> 13:21.240
Actually Afternoon Delight would probably be appropriate for this list.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.240
Here we go.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
Can you imagine?

13:23.240 --> 13:42.200
It's the two of you looking into each other's eyes, on the bird, the sweet honey-dipped

13:42.200 --> 13:49.840
baritone of Mr. Jeffrey Osbourne, pumping from the birds, the hollow legs of the bird

13:49.840 --> 13:54.080
are echoing with the sounds of Jeffrey Osbourne, can you even imagine?

13:54.080 --> 13:55.080
I think that would be powerful.

13:55.080 --> 14:00.160
Do you realize how much we're going to have to pay to, I think that's Sony Music Unlimited

14:00.160 --> 14:01.760
Very pricey.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.760
For that one 30 second clip, it'll be totally worth it though.

14:04.760 --> 14:13.840
Hey, Yahoo Answers user Mega, in the baby names category, has a very, it sounds like

14:13.840 --> 14:20.920
an important question, because it's going to be the moniker of her child, and it's five

14:20.920 --> 14:29.240
names, and I'm just going to list them off, and you say which one you endorse.

14:29.240 --> 14:42.720
Joseph, thought, born, Travis likes it, Justin not so much, Joseph, that's J-O-S-E-P.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.480
Okay, shorter.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.160
Shorter, Travis?

14:46.160 --> 14:51.920
I like it, maybe it's, I like the first one better, but keep going.

14:51.920 --> 14:57.440
Okay, so Travis is for number one, Joseph, Justin you're for Joseph.

14:57.440 --> 15:02.440
Number three, Jessup, that's J-E-S-S-U-P, Jessup.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.440
Okay.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.320
Jessup, okay, that's my favorite so far.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
Yeah.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.320
Travis, have you changed?

15:08.320 --> 15:09.320
Yeah, I'm going to go with Jessup.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.080
What is it about Jessup that you guys like so much?

15:11.080 --> 15:12.680
He sounds like a fun guy, right?

15:12.680 --> 15:13.680
Yeah.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
What's Jessup up to tonight?

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
Jessup.

15:15.680 --> 15:21.560
So you guys like Jessup with a U-P, how do you feel about Jessup with O-P, J-E-S-S-U-P?

15:21.560 --> 15:24.160
It sounds like he's going to tell me some fables.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.200
Yeah, it sounds fable-y.

15:26.200 --> 15:33.520
You think Jessup has a more, like, archaic sort of, no, I know, like, yeah, more artsy,

15:33.520 --> 15:38.200
artsy name, while Jessup knows how to have a good time, Jessup is just, he wants to teach

15:38.200 --> 15:40.920
you about old literature.

15:40.920 --> 15:42.920
Final one being Jesse.

15:42.920 --> 15:48.320
Joseph, Joseph, Jessup, Jessop, or Jesse?

15:48.320 --> 15:49.320
Final vote.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.320
Um.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
All of them.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.320
All of them.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.760
Like, what about, what about, uh, Joseph.

15:55.760 --> 16:00.600
What about Joseph, Joseph, Jessup, Jessop, Jesse?

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
The third.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
Mega.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
Mega.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
What about Mega-Jessup?

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
Mega-Jessup!

16:05.600 --> 16:10.240
Hey, who's that who's currently destroying our town?

16:10.240 --> 16:11.240
It is Mega-Jessup.

16:11.240 --> 16:17.200
To be fair, Jessup is how he starts out, and then he becomes Mega-Jessup.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.040
He evolves into Mega-Jessup.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
Don't make him angry.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.880
You wouldn't like him when he's Mega.

16:24.880 --> 16:28.560
I'm just going to throw this out, widen your scope.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.760
Yeah, maybe try some other names.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.440
Like Adam West.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.440
Like Adam West.

16:34.440 --> 16:39.680
Zerex asks from Twitter, he says, I do not drink and I find it hard to be enthused as

16:39.680 --> 16:43.760
others during the token, as others during the token bar night.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.800
I feel like I'm missing out, guys.

16:45.800 --> 16:46.800
Help.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.200
Oh, don't feel like you miss, you are missing out.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.200
Just know it.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.200
Know that you are.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.200
Just know.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.200
No feelings involved.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.200
Just knowledge.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.200
That's a fact.

16:55.200 --> 17:00.120
Zerex, that's not good enough, man.

17:00.120 --> 17:05.800
Here's the thing, you're at a bar that you, you might as well go to the Matrix and climb

17:05.800 --> 17:12.120
underneath the seats and cover your ears and close your eyes and eat, just dump your face

17:12.120 --> 17:16.720
in a popcorn bucket and say, I'm not enjoying this movie out loud, because like, you're

17:16.720 --> 17:18.560
not, you're in a movie theater.

17:18.560 --> 17:23.120
You would also, you would look less weird doing that than you would if you were at a

17:23.120 --> 17:25.120
bar and not drinking.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.120
Yeah.

17:26.120 --> 17:32.480
Uh, the only other option I could tell you is eat like a giant meat filled sandwich

17:32.480 --> 17:34.480
and hopefully you'll get meat drunk.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
Oh.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
That's great.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.480
Yeah.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.800
I say I was pretty good myself.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800
I've never thought of that.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.080
There are some nights where I legitimately feel like getting drunk.

17:43.080 --> 17:47.720
Like I don't feel like drinking, but I want to, I want to alter my state of consciousness

17:47.720 --> 17:52.600
and you know, I've been sober from the meth for about three or four years now, so meat

17:52.600 --> 17:54.680
might be the best option.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.980
Meat is God's drug.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.160
Meat is nature's drug.

17:59.160 --> 18:04.240
Why not, uh, the next time you're out with your friends, do a tab of acid, flip the table,

18:04.240 --> 18:05.800
call them pussies, blackout.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.320
That would be awesome.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.840
If your friends are giving you shit for not drinking whenever you go to the bars, just

18:10.840 --> 18:19.160
one night, go out with them and get violently, dangerously, like horrifyingly drunk and like

18:19.160 --> 18:24.440
just crash a car and put like one of them into like a short coma, but a respectable

18:24.440 --> 18:25.440
coma.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.280
And then next time you're out and they're like, they will never be like, Hey, you want

18:29.280 --> 18:30.280
to drink?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.800
But they also will never be like, Hey, want to hang out?

18:32.800 --> 18:37.000
Next time they don't want to hang out with you because they need a DD because you're

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
crazy.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.240
It's like Jessup up in here.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.240
Like he's crazy like a Jessup is what I'm saying, but in the future, whenever you're

18:42.240 --> 18:46.600
like, I'm just going to not drink tonight, everyone's going to be like, okay, that's

18:46.600 --> 18:48.180
an idea for you.

18:48.180 --> 18:50.120
You need to stop drinking.

18:50.120 --> 18:56.040
How you operate, but seriously start drinking on a similar, on speaking of starting drinking,

18:56.040 --> 19:01.480
uh, Kyle on Gmail says it is my 21st birthday next Tuesday, May 11th.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.960
I would like to go to the bars for the first time at midnight, the Monday night beforehand

19:05.960 --> 19:06.960
to celebrate.

19:06.960 --> 19:12.840
So tonight, right tonight, however, however, I have a very difficult final exam the next

19:12.840 --> 19:15.840
day that I really should study for and be fully rested.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.840
What should I do?

19:16.840 --> 19:21.840
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots,

19:21.840 --> 19:26.840
shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots,

19:26.840 --> 19:31.400
shots, obviously Kyle, get out to that bar, put that textbook down, replace that

19:31.400 --> 19:36.440
textbook with a big stein of party liquor and then just get it done because that's

19:36.440 --> 19:37.440
what you need to do.

19:37.440 --> 19:43.440
Little known college rule, and this is in every rule book on every college campus.

19:43.440 --> 19:47.080
If it is your birthday, you automatically pass the final.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.080
You're good.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.080
You don't even have to worry about it.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.080
Just tell your teacher it's your birthday and walk out.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.960
It's like Chuck E. Cheese, you get a free token.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.520
Bring in a copy of your birth certificate and then sit there for a while like you look

19:57.520 --> 20:01.000
like you're doing the test, but then after 30 minutes, before everybody else because

20:01.000 --> 20:04.120
you still want to look impressive, you pull that copy of the birth certificate out and

20:04.120 --> 20:07.600
you lay it down on the teacher's table and you walk out of the room.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.000
Never check your grade because that'll break it.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.680
You will fail, but you've been doing pretty good for the rest of the class, so I doubt

20:14.680 --> 20:15.680
it's going to sink you.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.880
A similar rule applies at Pizza Hut.

20:17.880 --> 20:21.600
You can get a free personal pam pizza if you present your birth certificate on your birthday.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.920
College and Pizza Hut are pretty much the same thing.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.920
I went to Pizza Hut.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.920
You?

20:27.920 --> 20:28.920
I don't know about you guys.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.480
I was featured in those little pepper packets that they allow you to pour on your pizza.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
What's in those?

20:34.480 --> 20:36.480
I don't know, but it's spicy as shit.

20:36.480 --> 20:37.480
What?

20:37.480 --> 20:38.480
Burns my mouth.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.760
Griffin failed his final, so he never learned what was in those pepper packets.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.760
Right.

20:43.760 --> 20:47.720
McElroy Brothers, yes, this is all we're talking about now.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.200
McElroy Brothers, this is a theme show.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.640
Do we have a theme block?

20:51.640 --> 20:56.840
I'm turning 21 next Tuesday, okay, and I was hoping you could give me recommendations

20:56.840 --> 20:59.080
on what drinks I should order first.

20:59.080 --> 21:03.080
What drink did I order first, or what drink would I suggest he orders first?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.440
I know the first thing you got was a Southern Comfort.

21:05.440 --> 21:10.200
A tall boy of SoCo, like a bucket of SoCo.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.280
It was actually one of those buckets that you use to build sandcastles.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.240
I was in my basement, and I was drinking out of beach toys.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.880
It was pretty dope.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.680
We did a beer loose down a boogie board.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.720
He's a real jessup.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.920
He's a beach toy junk.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.920
Drinks out of beach toys.

21:30.920 --> 21:31.920
Exclusively.

21:31.920 --> 21:35.080
Exclusively out of beach toys and snorkels.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.200
Big frosty glass of moonshine.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.240
Just moonshine.

21:41.240 --> 21:45.600
The greatest gift of all you can get for your 21st birthday, lots of vision in your right

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
eye.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.640
Hey, that's not funny.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.400
Hey, that's not funny.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.160
Let's all just say our favorite that he should get.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.880
I say get a seven and seven.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.880
It is smooth.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.880
It is mellow.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.880
It is crisp.

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
It is refreshing.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.480
It tastes great, and it gets the job done.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.480
It's tough to make though.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.480
Difficult to make.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.060
The best drink you can get is the vodka gimlet.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.600
Make sure you get a decent vodka.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.200
I would say a pineapple upside down cake.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.440
It's delicious, and it'll get you effed up right.

22:15.440 --> 22:21.120
Yeah, and it'll be really double great because all your sorority sisters will be super impressed.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.560
Don't even act like you don't love yourself a pineapple upside down cake.

22:24.560 --> 22:28.560
Maybe you can get that cute boy to drink it out of your navel.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.480
Travis, I think you may have misread the question.

22:31.480 --> 22:38.240
That was my first 13-year-old shot, doing a farm and pineapple upside down cake, but

22:38.240 --> 22:39.240
he's turning 21.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.240
He's a grown ass man.

22:40.240 --> 22:44.720
So I'll give you a second chance.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.000
Troubling news from form spring, guys.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.520
One of our listeners has a meeting in an hour, but it's still hung over.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
We are probably a little late to this.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.080
Or maybe you knew exactly when the show was going to happen.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
I know.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.080
I am planning on being hung over Monday morning.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.960
In a week and an hour.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.520
A speedy reply would be appreciated.

23:01.520 --> 23:08.200
Okay, I can actually answer this one legitimately.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.620
It really isn't any great secret.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.440
The night before, you have to drink water.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.760
Have to drink water and take one ibuprofen.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.360
The next morning, wake up.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.360
Don't sleep in.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.360
Drink a giant glass of water again.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.720
Take two ibuprofen and then go back to sleep for a half hour.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.720
Wake up and you'll feel great.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.880
Justin had me on that regimen.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.760
I came in town a couple of, was it last week?

23:33.760 --> 23:38.200
It was last week, I think, and we went out to a prom and man, I got drunker than I've

23:38.200 --> 23:41.600
been in a long, long time.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.560
And Justin helped me up with a glass of water and an iView, and then in the morning another

23:45.560 --> 23:49.880
glass of water, two iViews, and then I helped dad move.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.880
Like a champ.

23:50.880 --> 23:51.880
Like a champ.

23:51.880 --> 23:52.880
What up, dad?

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
I know you're listening.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.720
I was totally hung over that morning because I got party drunk the night before.

23:56.720 --> 24:01.480
And just to clarify, they didn't impersonate 17-year-olds and go to a prom.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.340
They went to a prom-themed party.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.340
It's important to note there.

24:04.340 --> 24:05.340
Well, we went to both.

24:05.340 --> 24:06.420
Before we get to the question.

24:06.420 --> 24:08.080
We can't tell that story on the show.

24:08.080 --> 24:14.200
We got drunk at one and got lucky at the other, so good luck.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.640
Did you guys hear the rumor about Jeff's girlfriend from Gmail?

24:17.640 --> 24:18.640
I did.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.280
It's all over the Twitters.

24:20.280 --> 24:25.440
Everybody's saying, well Jeff specifically is saying, that she snores like a stuffed

24:25.440 --> 24:29.080
up Sigourney Weaver possessed by Gozer, which keeps him from falling asleep.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
What should I do?

24:30.080 --> 24:31.080
Get rid of her.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.080
She's done.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.080
Catch out.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.800
A man needs his sleep.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.800
He needs his sleep.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.800
He needs it.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.920
Maybe tell her to sleep somewhere else.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.560
This is so important.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
Your sleep.

24:43.560 --> 24:48.160
You gotta get nine to ten every day.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
Is Jeff.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.160
Jeff.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
Jeff.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.160
Jeffrey.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.160
Jeffrey.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.160
Jeffrey.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.520
Is she Gozer?

24:57.520 --> 24:59.440
Is she legitimately possessed by Gozer?

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
Because then you have-

25:00.440 --> 25:01.920
The Gozerian, I mean.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Yeah.

25:02.920 --> 25:10.560
Did she, was she, did she recently somehow become more, I don't know, skanky?

25:10.560 --> 25:13.000
Like Sig, like Sigourney did?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.640
Like kind of glowy skanky though?

25:14.640 --> 25:17.960
Like kind of glowy skanky, like deep dark circles around her eyes, and also she's

25:17.960 --> 25:20.520
boning down on Rick Moranis.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.400
Have you caught her making love to Rick Moranis sleep?

25:23.400 --> 25:26.640
I know at first you thought nothing of it, but it's a problem.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
Right.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
Cause who can blame her?

25:28.640 --> 25:29.640
Right?

25:29.640 --> 25:30.640
He's adorable.

25:30.640 --> 25:31.640
Look at him.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.640
He's teeny tiny.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.440
You want to put him in your pocket and just carry him around and say, what up, Rick Moranis?

25:35.440 --> 25:38.640
Honey, he stole my heart.

25:38.640 --> 25:43.160
My girlfriend snores, and also fucks old cast members of Second City.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.160
Can you-

25:44.160 --> 25:47.160
Dave Thomas, get out of here.

25:47.160 --> 25:53.000
Go make another strange brew Canadian roust about.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.880
Yahoo Answers user Shan says, how to turn an iPod touch into an iPhone without jailbreak?

26:01.880 --> 26:04.480
Go back in time and buy an iPhone.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.440
I really want an iPhone, but can't afford it at the moment.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.800
I have an iPod touch, and I really want to try to turn it into an iPhone, but my iPod

26:09.800 --> 26:10.800
is not jailbroken.

26:10.800 --> 26:15.360
I do not want to jailbreak it, so if anyone has any salutations on how to turn my iPod

26:15.360 --> 26:17.680
touch into an iPhone, I will be very grateful.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.680
Thank you.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.680
Wow.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.680
Wow.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.680
Wow.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.920
Future of America right here.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.440
Step one, read the instructions.

26:26.440 --> 26:31.120
Step two, maybe you, maybe, maybe it already is.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.720
Have you tried calling people on it?

26:33.720 --> 26:38.800
Attach your iPod by, with a string, to other iPods, and then it might, you might be able

26:38.800 --> 26:40.840
to get some sort of acoustic effects.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.840
Agoustic?

26:41.840 --> 26:42.840
Agoustic.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
Augustus.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.360
Agoustic glue.

26:46.360 --> 26:52.560
Maybe tape your iPhone, maybe tape your iPod to a larger cell phone.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.840
Like an iPhone.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
Maybe tape your iPod to an iPhone.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.840
No.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.240
Get like a track phone.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.520
I'm trying to find like an economical way for him to do this.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.040
No, I've got it right here.

27:01.040 --> 27:06.080
Put your iPod in your pocket, get in your car, drive to the person you want to talk

27:06.080 --> 27:10.800
to, pull your iPod out of your pocket and place it to your ear.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.000
The clarity's going to be awesome, you're going to be able to talk to that friend.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.680
Yeah, but to do that, he would need to jailbreak it, and he doesn't want to jailbreak it.

27:16.680 --> 27:17.680
Oh, that's true.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.200
Yeah, you wouldn't need to jailbreak it.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.200
Jeff from Gmail.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.400
Two Jeffs in a row?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.440
Jeff Jeff.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.840
And by the way, if you write it in the show, your name's not Jeff.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
No.

27:28.840 --> 27:29.840
It's Jeffrey.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.840
It's Jeffrey, or possibly Jessup.

27:30.840 --> 27:31.840
So Jeffrey.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.840
Or possibly Mega Jessup.

27:32.840 --> 27:36.920
Oh, Mega Jessup.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.360
So I'm accompanying my wife to visit her parents in the coming weeks, and while the visit

27:40.360 --> 27:45.140
is usually rather painless, the bed we are relegated to is very noisy.

27:45.140 --> 27:50.080
Being relative newlyweds, we still engage in the relations, if you know what I mean,

27:50.080 --> 27:54.880
and was wondering what the etiquette on fooling around in this awkward situation might be,

27:54.880 --> 27:55.880
Jeff.

27:55.880 --> 27:56.880
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

27:56.880 --> 27:57.880
It's going to be okay.

27:57.880 --> 28:02.880
You can still do it, but you got to keep it down here.

28:02.880 --> 28:06.760
I mean, keep it down here.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.760
You ready for the pleasure?

28:07.760 --> 28:08.760
You ready for the pleasure?

28:08.760 --> 28:13.000
Meemaw, Meemaw is literally, this wall is stucco.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.440
This wall is completely stucco.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.440
Anything we do, they can probably hear us whispering, going to keep it down here.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.440
But let's make love.

28:20.440 --> 28:28.800
Listen, I want to show you that our relationship is still as fiery, as fiery as it was when

28:28.800 --> 28:29.800
we started.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.800
No.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
No, Jeff.

28:31.800 --> 28:32.800
No.

28:32.800 --> 28:33.800
Jeff, no.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.800
No.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.800
No.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.800
No.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.800
I'm married, Jeff.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.800
Gross, Jeff.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.800
Gross.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.800
Gross.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.800
Jeff is a grown ass man with grown ass urges.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.800
I get this.

28:43.800 --> 28:52.440
Jeff's got to get himself sassified, and Jeff, noisy bed, adjacent Meemaw, or no, Jeff needs

28:52.440 --> 28:55.800
to get, Jeff needs to get his Jeff off.

28:55.800 --> 29:04.440
Jeff, if your urge to get your Jeff off is not so strong that you have to rent, that

29:04.440 --> 29:09.280
you can't rent a room at the Super 8 away from your Meemaw, then your urge to bed down

29:09.280 --> 29:11.000
is not so strong that it cannot be resisted.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.160
I'm saying learn how to bone down on the quiet, buy an inflatable mattress, and lay that out,

29:16.160 --> 29:21.800
because that completely obviates the whole squeaky bed issue, and carry that around in

29:21.800 --> 29:27.880
your bag, and then lay that down, and then make sweet, silent love upon it.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.480
Maybe you should approach this problem head on, right?

29:31.480 --> 29:32.640
Here's my plan.

29:32.640 --> 29:39.360
Go to your in-laws, day one, and say, listen, I appreciate you having us.

29:39.360 --> 29:44.820
The bed you've supplied us with is quite loud, and we're afraid that our noise making will

29:44.820 --> 29:47.240
be a ruckus.

29:47.240 --> 29:51.760
So what bed might be quieter that you could accommodate us with?

29:51.760 --> 29:58.560
And also, where can I put my oversized duffel bag with the words lube bag written on it?

29:58.560 --> 30:02.400
Should I put that in, it looked like some spare room in Meemaw's abode.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.600
Should I put it in Meemaw's room?

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
Will she be offended?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.480
I will need to access it at regular intervals.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.800
What's a lube bag, oh, Meemaw?

30:08.800 --> 30:10.000
Meemaw, don't be coy.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.440
You know exactly what this oil is used for, you old whore.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.480
You old racist whore.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.320
I hate Jeff's Meemaw.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.480
Jeff's wife's Meemaw, to be fair.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.480
Yahoo!

30:23.480 --> 30:26.000
Answers user Dauntang asks, what happened to all the juggalos?

30:26.000 --> 30:32.600
A few years ago, everywhere I looked, someone was wearing an ICP t-shirt or something with

30:32.600 --> 30:33.680
the hatchet man on it.

30:33.680 --> 30:39.160
Now I rarely ever see it, and I feel like the juggalo nation is starting to diminish.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.440
How many of us juggalos and juggalettes are left?

30:41.440 --> 30:44.760
And if you're a juggalo, please tell me.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.920
Shouts out.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.960
I saw my first hatchet man bumper sticker yesterday.

30:49.960 --> 30:50.960
Who is this hatchet?

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
I don't know.

30:51.960 --> 30:52.960
He's like their logo.

30:52.960 --> 30:58.400
He's got kind of the sideshow bob haircut, and he's got a hatchet, and it looks like

30:58.400 --> 31:00.240
he's sprinting.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.240
It's a nightmare.

31:01.240 --> 31:02.240
To where?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.240
It sounds terrifying.

31:03.240 --> 31:08.760
He's sprinting to the dollar store to buy as many economy-sized bottles of Faygo that

31:08.760 --> 31:11.640
he can fit in his fucking Vespa.

31:11.640 --> 31:16.680
The bad news is there's been a juggalo rapture, and you've been left behind.

31:16.680 --> 31:25.440
If you didn't believe strong enough in Shaggy 2 Dope and Murder Guy, Murder Man.

31:25.440 --> 31:31.720
You can read all about it in Juggalo Kirk Cameron's Juggalo book, Juggalo Left Behind.

31:31.720 --> 31:32.720
I'm just kidding.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.920
You can't read.

31:33.920 --> 31:40.720
Be sure to get the audiobook version read by Jeff Goldblum.

31:40.720 --> 31:45.680
Also, you're so stupid, and the band you listen to is stupid, and the society that you've

31:45.680 --> 31:47.600
created is the dumbest thing ever.

31:47.600 --> 31:51.000
All the juggalos and juggalettes have gone underground to wait it out.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.320
I don't want to ostracize any people groups that might listen to our show, but if you

31:55.320 --> 31:58.120
listen to our show and you're a juggalo, just die.

31:58.120 --> 32:01.400
Just go somewhere where you can die quickly and comfortably.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.520
Are you not down with the clown?

32:04.520 --> 32:05.520
No.

32:05.520 --> 32:11.400
No, I'm so far up with the clown that I can't even see the clown anymore because I've evolved

32:11.400 --> 32:14.600
so far above it because they're the worst band.

32:14.600 --> 32:21.080
Gryffin, as we talk about this, I've actually drawn a little Venn diagram here of our listener

32:21.080 --> 32:26.800
base and the juggalos and juggalettes, and unfortunately, those two guys in the middle

32:26.800 --> 32:29.760
are going to be really upset at what you just said.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.440
But those two guys are the guys from Insane Clown Posse.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.440
Yeah.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.440
I offended them personally on a very personal level.

32:35.440 --> 32:42.320
Thank you, Murderfella and Shaggy and Shagtooth.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.640
Murderpants and Shag- Mega Jessup?

32:46.640 --> 32:47.640
That is the only...

32:47.640 --> 32:54.080
If I ever met someone who was of the Church of the Clown and I said, oh, great, and I

32:54.080 --> 33:00.220
knew he was one of them because of the face paint and the illiteracy, then I would turn

33:00.220 --> 33:02.720
away and I would not want to talk to him until I asked his name.

33:02.720 --> 33:06.080
If he said, Jessup, I would want to party.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.080
What are you doing tonight, Jessup?

33:07.080 --> 33:08.080
What are you doing tonight?

33:08.080 --> 33:09.080
Party liquor?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.080
Party liquor.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.080
Drinking out of Beach Toys?

33:11.080 --> 33:14.080
That's what your first drink needs to be.

33:14.080 --> 33:23.720
One part Boone's Farm, one smart Faygo, and then just a bullet and a gun.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.520
And the courage to do what's right.

33:26.520 --> 33:30.880
Liam on Gmail asks, how do I find out who I am?

33:30.880 --> 33:35.580
As a teenager, I thought this question only existed as a convenient replacement for a

33:35.580 --> 33:39.920
plot and protagonist has amnesia type movies, but as I progressed through young adulthood,

33:39.920 --> 33:42.200
I've realized how important the answer is.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.240
The three of you come across as people who have gotten a handle on who you are.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.880
How the hell do I do that?

33:46.880 --> 33:49.400
Just hang out with us.

33:49.400 --> 33:54.560
Liam, maybe you got it right the first time and maybe your life is getting a little hacky.

33:54.560 --> 33:59.980
Maybe it is only a plot and protagonist has amnesia type movies and maybe the writers

33:59.980 --> 34:02.520
on your life are starting to get a little lazy.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.480
Maybe they're on strike.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.760
Did you hit your head recently after all remembering things?

34:07.760 --> 34:11.440
Do you have tattoos on your body of things that you've learned?

34:11.440 --> 34:17.160
I spent so long since I've seen that movie, I can't make jokes at its expense.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.440
So Liam, this seems like a serious question, so I want to bring it down here.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.440
It doesn't matter.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.680
It doesn't matter what you're like.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.280
Stop worrying about that.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
Get interested in other people.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.280
And don't be an asshole.

34:26.280 --> 34:33.720
Trying to figure out what you're like is not going to get you anywhere, man.

34:33.720 --> 34:38.680
Get interested in other folks and that's the best way to define yourself.

34:38.680 --> 34:39.680
Just find somebody.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.680
You know what, Liam?

34:40.680 --> 34:41.680
I like you for you.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.680
Me too.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.680
I think you're great.

34:43.680 --> 34:44.680
I just wanted to throw that out there.

34:44.680 --> 34:45.680
You've got a cool name.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
Yeah.

34:46.680 --> 34:47.680
You're right there.

34:47.680 --> 34:55.280
Hey, I've been thinking about doing this thing where I think everybody, maybe not everybody,

34:55.280 --> 35:00.760
I would say 95% of the people who listen to podcasts listen to them hoping that the people

35:00.760 --> 35:06.800
on the show will at some point just randomly just say their name and call them out.

35:06.800 --> 35:11.160
So I think it would be great if just throughout the course of the show with no explanation

35:11.160 --> 35:16.240
or pretense, we just said, like, Kyle Collis.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.920
Like Kyle Collis would hear it in his car.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.080
Andrew Bardsley.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.560
Like they're in the car right now and they're hearing it and they're with their friends

35:21.560 --> 35:24.520
and they're just like Matt McCormick and they're freaking out.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.760
Josephine Luna.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.760
What is going on?

35:26.760 --> 35:27.760
Okay.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.760
I got one.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.760
Gary Sinise.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.880
Gary Sinise is freaking the fuck out right now.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.280
We've got to give a shout out to our man Craig Bierko.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.280
Oh yeah.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.280
He's a big fan.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.240
Gave us two shout outs on his Twitter feed.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.480
We should also give a shout out to Carrie Carter.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.480
Katie Carter.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.480
Shit.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.480
Fuck.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.480
Also Carrie Carter.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.480
Good one.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.480
Rowan Berry.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.480
And also Mega Jessup.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.480
Rowan Berry.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.480
And Jessup.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
Mega Jessup.

35:53.480 --> 36:01.080
Mike Suzek from Twitter asks, as a straight man, can it be socially acceptable to compliment

36:01.080 --> 36:02.520
a lady on her shoes?

36:02.520 --> 36:04.560
Are we past gender stereotypes?

36:04.560 --> 36:05.560
I like shoes.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.560
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.160
Nothing wrong with that.

36:10.160 --> 36:15.480
Make sure that like you're ready to back that up though because if you say you like your

36:15.480 --> 36:21.560
shoes you may be opening yourself up to a good 10, 15 minute conversation.

36:21.560 --> 36:22.560
I know.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
I got shoes.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.560
That.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.560
Okay.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.560
Let's play a fun game.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.560
This will be a nice little over and under.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.560
Okay.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.880
How many pairs of shoes have I owned in my adult life?

36:31.880 --> 36:32.880
Oh god.

36:32.880 --> 36:38.760
We'll say I turned adult, we'll say since I graduated from college.

36:38.760 --> 36:39.760
Justin.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.520
My guess is going to be...

36:42.520 --> 36:45.200
I'm talking about not dress shoes don't count, sandals don't count.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.200
I'm talking about...

36:46.200 --> 36:47.200
Your go-tos.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.200
My go-to daily cash.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.200
Everyday shoes.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.200
Off court buddies.

36:50.200 --> 36:56.880
I'm going to go with three.

36:56.880 --> 36:57.880
Travis.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.880
I'm going to go with $2,685.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.520
No, no, no.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.520
Real.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.520
Okay.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.760
Real guess.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.320
I know you pretty well.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.320
One.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.320
Oh.

37:09.320 --> 37:13.760
See if we're going Price is Right rules then Travis won because the answer is two.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
Oh god.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.800
Do you remember those shoes that you got me for Christmas?

37:16.800 --> 37:17.800
Yeah.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.800
Was that 07 or 08?

37:18.800 --> 37:19.800
Because I'm having trouble.

37:19.800 --> 37:20.800
I'm having trouble.

37:20.800 --> 37:26.600
It was oh no.

37:26.600 --> 37:33.720
I want to hear Griffin's last question but first I feel like I need to tell you guys

37:33.720 --> 37:38.160
the important news about how you can get some help from us.

37:38.160 --> 37:43.120
If you're on Twitter, first off just go to mbnbam.com.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.120
All this stuff is there.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.960
You can listen to all our old shows.

37:47.960 --> 37:54.520
Let everyone you know to subscribe or just one person either way is good with us and

37:54.520 --> 37:55.880
pass this show along to them.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.240
Don't keep your light under a bushel.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.800
This show is a gift that you can share.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.840
For free.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
For free.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.840
You can email us.

38:02.840 --> 38:03.840
Mbnbam.com.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.840
At gmail.com.

38:04.840 --> 38:09.040
If you do that you'll just go to our website.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.520
I'm not so good with tech.

38:10.520 --> 38:11.520
Tech.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.520
Tech stuff.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.520
How do you science work?

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
Tech.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.520
Tech things.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.840
Any other ways that I'm not forgetting?

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
Tweet.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.360
There's Twitter.

38:22.360 --> 38:27.400
When you see the announcement go live for a new program, a new show, if you would retweet

38:27.400 --> 38:35.440
that and tell everybody that the new show is out and that we're slipping down the iTunes

38:35.440 --> 38:40.440
rankings because we get that first rush of everybody subscribing.

38:40.440 --> 38:44.040
So tell a bunch of your friends to subscribe if they'll really like it and we promise in

38:44.040 --> 38:47.040
return to only deliver quality radio.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.600
And thanks everyone for the reviews on iTunes so far.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.160
They've been really great.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.160
Really positive.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.520
So many stories in there.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.680
We really appreciate it.

38:55.680 --> 38:56.680
Thank you so much.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
Keep that up.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.680
Drop a review.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.600
Drop a subscription.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.060
Whatever you want to do.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.920
Everything helps out and you're great.

39:04.920 --> 39:11.480
We're still trying to get every mid to high range celebrity to tweet about Mbnbam.com.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.240
Craig B is a great start though.

39:14.240 --> 39:21.240
So far our list of people that we still need to get include every mid to high range celebrity

39:21.240 --> 39:27.840
except Craig B. So if you could talk to the celebrities you know, harass them into tweeting

39:27.840 --> 39:34.240
about our show, maybe listening, but probably not, that would be Gary Sinise, we're looking

39:34.240 --> 39:35.240
at you.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
We're going to get him.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.640
We're going to get him.

39:37.640 --> 39:41.280
He's so busy with CSI but I think he can break off.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.920
And t-shirts should come soon.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.480
Everyone look at that image on Justin's Twitter box.

39:46.480 --> 39:47.480
Looks real great.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.080
Keep an eye on our Facebook group and we'll talk about it there.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.080
Griffin!

39:52.080 --> 39:53.080
Hit me!

39:53.080 --> 39:56.440
Our final question of the day comes to us from Yahoo Answers user Mariah.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.120
Oh man.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.680
She asks, can you take a parakeet in the shower with you?

40:01.680 --> 40:02.680
I'm Justin McElroy.

40:02.680 --> 40:03.680
I'm Travis McElroy.

40:03.680 --> 40:04.680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

40:04.680 --> 40:14.480
And this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

40:14.480 --> 40:42.320
You will never know me.
