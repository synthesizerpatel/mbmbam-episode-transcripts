00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:49.520 --> 00:54.240
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Pupa Justin McElroy.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.520
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy. Not sure what the theme was.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.800
Not sure what that is. I'm sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary,

01:02.800 --> 01:05.120
Griffin McElroy. Justin, explain yourself immediately.

01:05.120 --> 01:15.280
I am but a pupa that is snuggling into a chrysalis right now, and have been so for 36-odd years.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.760
Why are you a French pope?

01:17.760 --> 01:22.560
Is this a slow-carb thing? Is this like one of the phases of the slow-carb,

01:22.560 --> 01:26.320
like you eat a bunch of beans, and then you turn those beans into a chrysalis,

01:26.320 --> 01:31.680
and then you become larval? He tears up strips of newspaper,

01:31.680 --> 01:36.080
smears his bean goo upon them, and they'll form his house.

01:36.080 --> 01:42.320
It's nothing like the dumb thing you guys said. Today is Friday. Tomorrow, July 8th,

01:42.320 --> 01:50.080
I'm going to go see Mr. James Buffett live in concert, and in doing so, I will have

01:50.080 --> 01:55.840
completed my development as a person, and I will emerge like a butterfly.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.480
Ah, we're going to bliss the light situation.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.400
Yeah, that's what I was just about to say. It sounds like maybe Justin's going to come back

02:02.400 --> 02:05.360
maybe a new character on the next episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

02:05.360 --> 02:08.800
which I'm very excited about. Can you tell me how you've been preparing your body?

02:08.800 --> 02:11.360
Is there some sort of powder that you apply?

02:11.360 --> 02:18.640
I went through every Hawaiian shirt I owned, and all the ones Amazon had to find the perfect one,

02:18.640 --> 02:24.320
and I've been re-listening to some tunes to try to pick out some nuance, and maybe reading up on

02:24.320 --> 02:29.120
some trivia that I can kind of spout during, like, hey, did you know he wrote this one?

02:29.120 --> 02:33.840
Wherever. Lauderdale? You know, I haven't read much yet, so there's still time.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.840
Jesus, no, Justin, there's not much time. It's tomorrow. This is like your fucking

02:38.720 --> 02:42.880
capstone project. You think you can just fucking buffalo this one in at the last minute? No.

02:43.440 --> 02:52.880
My question is this. Will James Buffett witness me? Will he witness me? Will he, since I am there,

02:52.880 --> 02:56.960
like, and this one goes out to Island Boy or something like that?

02:56.960 --> 02:59.920
Yeah. Do you want to back channel this?

03:00.640 --> 03:06.080
That's, I mean, that's kind of a, that's kind of a crest. It'll work, but I mean,

03:06.080 --> 03:11.840
you really want to leverage your limited media power for this one. But the answer is yes,

03:11.840 --> 03:13.360
of course you want to do that. Yes, obviously.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.880
I mean, I think there's also a lot of, like, tried and true standard options here.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.600
You could just try singing along with all the songs louder than anybody else, the loudest.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.880
Oh, that's a good idea.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.960
If you do it loud enough and good enough, they don't tell you this,

03:25.520 --> 03:27.920
when we're up on stage doing our jokes, when you do our jokes,

03:29.280 --> 03:33.840
the loudest and the best out of anybody, we see you. There's recognition there.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.520
Maybe if you, maybe if you yell the trivia to James Buffett and you're like,

03:39.520 --> 03:44.080
hey, you wrote this one in Key West, he'll be like, thank you for reminding me, Island Boy.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.320
You know, you know how to fly a plane. Yes, I did.

03:48.320 --> 03:53.360
I do know that. Thank you. Is that Island Boy? I recognize you. Come up here. Come up here.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.600
You do one. Island Boy, did you know I was also a restaurateur, right?

03:57.600 --> 04:01.200
Yeah, restaurateur and pilot. Yeah, an author.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.000
Now have you considered, and I hope the answer is no, but I need to know if you've

04:06.560 --> 04:11.360
seen all the angles of this thing, rushing the stage and attacking James Buffett.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.680
Now what would that accomplish? How would that get me further,

04:15.680 --> 04:18.640
how would that get me closer to the goals of my vision board?

04:18.640 --> 04:23.200
Well, he would certainly, I mean, he would definitely know,

04:23.200 --> 04:26.480
he would definitely know Island Boy. He would witness me.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.680
Well, maybe he's just been waiting for a challenger.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.520
Maybe he's ready to hand over his blown out flip flops.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.240
This is a bad plan. I'm not endorsing this plan, but it's

04:38.240 --> 04:44.960
worked in the past, that's all I'm going to say. So you're suggesting I rush up on stage, I rend my

04:44.960 --> 04:52.000
Hawaiian shirt in twain, I toss Jimmy Buffett a bat left, and I battle him for supremacy of

04:52.000 --> 04:56.320
like Island Lord. You'll lose. You'll def, def, def, def lose.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.080
But maybe he'll like Mr. Miyagi you, take you under his wing.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.480
No, he'll kill you. He'll kill you on stage. I see something in you.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.760
No, he'll kill you right there on the stage. How high up can you jump? Because I imagine

05:07.760 --> 05:11.440
this, this stage is going to be four or five feet up off the ground.

05:12.720 --> 05:16.000
It's at Riverbend in Cincinnati. Travis, I don't know. Have you ever been there?

05:16.800 --> 05:21.120
Okay. You're in an amphitheater situation then. So the stage I believe is lower and you might be

05:21.120 --> 05:24.240
able to jump. That's great. You could just parachute right down onto that thing. Bat

05:24.240 --> 05:29.120
lefts out. And it just, it just really attacked Jimmy Buffett.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.240
I want to attack Jimmy Buffett. He has to make the first move.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.160
You really need to pick the right song. What's the bet? You're at a Jimmy Buffett concert.

05:36.160 --> 05:41.680
What's the best song to get the drop on Jimmy Buffett during? Cause like, if it's something,

05:41.680 --> 05:46.560
I think like Margaritaville, I think he pretty much, that's just muscle memory at this point.

05:46.560 --> 05:50.080
Like he will definitely see you coming. Is there more of an emotional ballad where he's

05:50.080 --> 05:54.480
maybe thinking of like a long lost friend? Or maybe one of his new songs.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.520
You're thinking like one that he doesn't know how to play very good yet.

05:57.520 --> 06:02.000
Yeah. It's a new song. He's really nervous about like whether the crowd's going to love it. And

06:02.000 --> 06:07.040
he doesn't know how to like play the instrument good enough. And so he's like really focused on

06:07.040 --> 06:10.080
that. And then all of a sudden you're behind him with a baseball bat with a bunch of nails in it.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.640
And then you do toss him also another baseball bat.

06:12.640 --> 06:19.680
So you're suggesting James rips into something from the third canon, which is what we call songs

06:19.680 --> 06:26.400
after like 2005. He rips into the third canon, maybe like a math sucks or I will play for gumbo.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.680
Sorry, there's one called math sucks?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.680
Yeah, it's called math sucks.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.840
Real quick, real quick, real quick. It's with a K by the way. No C just a K.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.280
S U K S.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.280
Perfect. Perfect. Real quick, quick, quick. How much did you pay for these tickets?

06:41.120 --> 06:44.000
Like not much. We're on the lawn. So we're just kind of kicking it.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.480
All right. That's actually, that's how it should be. I would be amazed if anybody actually bought

06:48.480 --> 06:52.880
like the actual seats to sit. Like everyone's just like, oh, there's lawn. I can just sit on

06:52.880 --> 06:54.720
grass. Yes, please.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.840
That's the vibe right there. Who wants to sit in a chair? That's fine. You know,

06:57.840 --> 07:02.320
you could pay for the chair, but you're not going to need it. Once he, once he tears into the,

07:02.320 --> 07:06.560
to the, some of his first cannon hits, you'll also be too stoned to sit down.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.720
You won't remember how to do it.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.640
And that's a bad place to be because that's, that leaves you very few options.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.880
So have you considered if you do powder yourself up just right and you get,

07:17.680 --> 07:23.200
he witnesses you, however you decide to do it, what you might do because you're growing

07:23.200 --> 07:26.800
with your family, I imagine, right? As a family experience. What if he wants to kiss in my club to

07:26.800 --> 07:34.320
you because he like, there's, oh, there's, there's plenty of hours in the day. I'll make him take me

07:34.320 --> 07:38.720
to the plane first and let me fly it a little bit. Like, okay. You know, why didn't we done me,

07:38.720 --> 07:44.320
Jim? Just so you know, it's, it's real. It's, uh, listen, that's I'll report back next week.

07:44.320 --> 07:48.480
I was actually trying to engineer a way that I could record an episode at the concert.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.480
I couldn't come up with anything substantial though. You realize how shitty that would be

07:52.480 --> 07:57.280
for me and Travis though. Oh, the worst. I get my idea was like, I would barely pay attention to

07:57.280 --> 08:02.240
what you guys were saying and just check in every few minutes. Yeah. Like a live correspondent.

08:02.240 --> 08:07.360
Well, you guys kind of held out in the fort. Um, but I really want to, this isn't about work

08:07.360 --> 08:13.360
and it's, and you know what, in a way it's not even about me, this concert, it's, it's,

08:13.360 --> 08:17.920
it's about James and him connected with his fans. Um, he's getting up in years and any tour could

08:17.920 --> 08:22.240
be the last one before he retires. And I'm sure he's been saying that forever, but you know,

08:22.240 --> 08:27.520
I'm just happy to have the opportunity to finally go see Jim live. Um, please let us know how it

08:27.520 --> 08:31.680
goes. Oh, well, uh, here's our first question. Hey, but then bam, about two months ago I got

08:31.680 --> 08:37.680
pulled over during my driver's test for pulling out in front. You got pulled over during your

08:37.680 --> 08:43.840
driver's test as a bad beat as a bad, that's a whoof. Ouch. Uh, I normally don't drive this

08:43.840 --> 08:48.080
poorly, but the cop who was giving the test made me nervous. How do I stay? That's why they got

08:48.080 --> 08:53.520
pulled over. Everyone's going to be like, wow, how do I stay chill next time I take it? Wait a minute.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.600
Okay. Okay. Okay. I think the cop, the cop that was giving the test, I think made them stop the

08:57.600 --> 09:01.520
test because they pulled out in front of it. Yes. Sorry. Are there places where cops give driving

09:01.520 --> 09:06.240
tests? That's terrifying. That's a fucking nightmare. Are you kidding me? You pulled out

09:06.880 --> 09:11.440
in front of traffic doing a left turn, not a protect, I assume not a protect the left turn.

09:11.440 --> 09:16.320
There's people honking, which is just terrifying. And there's a cop that is going like, nope.

09:16.320 --> 09:21.040
The cop like, it looks like you pulled out in front of traffic also. Is that weed I smell on you

09:22.000 --> 09:27.600
from two years ago? That's right. Nevermind the barking dog in the back. Yeah. Um, that's,

09:27.600 --> 09:34.240
that's fucking terrifying. I, I like, oh man, I don't know that I could recover from this.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.800
I, I, I don't know how to stay moved. Is moving to a different, is packing your bags and moving

09:40.800 --> 09:47.040
to a state where you can just like take a test from just like some fucking who usually administers

09:47.040 --> 09:56.240
these tests. Big fucking old nerd is like, well, it looks like you didn't hit the brakes a little

09:56.240 --> 10:01.760
bit fast enough, but that's okay. Cause I'm afraid of you. And so here's your license and not a cop.

10:01.760 --> 10:08.080
And then you can move back to Arkansas, I suppose. Can you try to drive past a crime? So the cop is

10:08.080 --> 10:14.640
like, hold on, pull over partner. And he tosses you a shotgun and it's like, let's get this done.

10:14.640 --> 10:19.760
You've got to stop this crime. And then afterwards he's the rock. Yes, he's the rock. And this is the

10:19.760 --> 10:26.720
rundown too. And also like after that, there's no way he's going to fail you. No way. No way.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.920
You've been through some shit together. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Wait, marry the, you gotta marry the two

10:33.920 --> 10:38.480
situations. The next time this happens, if you pull out in front of traffic, right? You make

10:38.480 --> 10:45.280
another infraction and he's like, Ooh, that's an infraction. You say, no, I saw that person in that

10:45.280 --> 10:52.080
car was doing something bad. They were, they were going to go murder someone and I had to stop them.

10:52.080 --> 10:59.360
So what seemed like an infraction was actually me doing like a citizen's driving maneuver to stop

10:59.360 --> 11:07.360
a future crime. It was a citizen's wreck. Yeah. You don't understand. I had to do it. I had a,

11:07.360 --> 11:12.720
listen, I had a fucking premonition. Okay. Get off my case. Are you biased against psychics?

11:13.920 --> 11:20.000
Here's one you could try. Psych could talk his way out of this, by the way. Psych could do anything.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.520
Psych could talk his way out of this. With the help of his best friend, Dule Hill. So could

11:23.520 --> 11:27.840
monk and also white collar. Characters welcome. Is there ever a crossover episode between

11:27.840 --> 11:31.680
psych and monk and maybe white collar pops out at the end? Gotta be, gotta be. Oh God,

11:31.680 --> 11:36.480
I want that so bad now. Please, please bring it back. Make the psych movie. Bring monk back.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.360
Burn notice is there. At the end. Yeah. They try to solve the crime. They're like,

11:41.360 --> 11:45.680
we need one more hand. Then burn notice shows up. What's up on burn notice? Characters welcome.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.680
See you guys over on Royal pains. That's a different. Royal pains is there.

11:50.560 --> 11:55.680
Could you tell, like, I think the problem that you're having here is the pressure to succeed.

11:55.680 --> 12:00.080
You need to find a way to release that. So I would say start going to these driving tests,

12:00.640 --> 12:07.280
deciding to fail. And when you get into the car, tell the cop, hey, this run, this is a burner

12:07.280 --> 12:12.160
test. I ain't going to pass this one. Hang on. I've already got a second appointment scheduled.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.520
It's a confidence booster. I'm going to do. So I'm really going to explore the space out there.

12:16.080 --> 12:20.080
And then you pop in your headphones, you play some music, baby driver, this shit,

12:20.080 --> 12:22.960
which I still haven't seen, but I assume this is what happens.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.600
There's all seem like good options. I'm glad we could help so much.

12:29.360 --> 12:33.600
Or just like when you fuck up, just look at him and go, Poban, he's nerve and go for a high five.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.520
And like, he'll be like, oh, you know, you fucked up, but that's really charming. Okay.

12:37.520 --> 12:43.360
You're fine. You're fine. You still failed. I have a Yahoo here. It was sent in by a couple

12:43.360 --> 12:47.520
people. Level 9,000. Yeah. Drew, Drew, Drew Davenport and Nick Potter. Thank you. Thank you.

12:47.520 --> 12:57.200
Both. It's from Yaja answers user questions lost in time. The question is true or false.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.080
You have fully explored your entire body at least once.

13:05.040 --> 13:08.880
I will say, can I just say right off the bat? Yeah. Really think about it.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.280
No, I'm just going to say just form out of the question. I'd like a Yahoo answer. That's like,

13:13.280 --> 13:19.040
listen, you only got two answers. You don't got to get eloquent here. This is a yes or no,

13:19.040 --> 13:26.560
true or false question. It really makes you confront like, this is my body. Obviously

13:28.320 --> 13:35.840
we've been through a lot together. Swimming, walking, scrubbing, scrubbing it in the shower,

13:36.640 --> 13:42.720
but is there parts of it I just don't know about. It's like when you're out in the woods and you're

13:42.720 --> 13:48.080
like, you know, you think like this, this square foot of land I'm standing on, has any human ever

13:48.080 --> 13:53.600
stood here before? Yeah. You know, has anyone walked, has a foot trod this, this mountain

13:53.600 --> 13:57.440
or am I the first? And I think about that every time I touch the back of my knee,

13:57.440 --> 14:00.720
have I touched this inch of my body? That's what I'm saying. I don't think,

14:00.720 --> 14:03.840
I don't know that I have. I'm thinking there's probably untread ground somewhere.

14:03.840 --> 14:12.080
There, uh, my body is like, uh, an urban area by and large. There's a lot of culture and

14:12.080 --> 14:18.960
exciting development, but there are some places, uh, in town that you just don't go. There's some

14:18.960 --> 14:24.560
places in my body I'm just not, forget places, there's angles of my body. I'm like, ah, I don't

14:24.560 --> 14:30.720
know. I don't know if that's, that one's for me. Mine has a lot of sprawl.

14:30.720 --> 14:35.200
Let me say this. There's bodies, there's parts of my body that are so mixed areas that Roman

14:35.200 --> 14:42.000
Mars has done an episode about them. Like it's, it's pretty, it's pretty well hidden from the, the,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.080
it's like it's, it's at least 75% invisible. I would say that it's, it's, it's rough out there.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.200
I just think about it. Hey, here's something weird. You guys ever think,

14:53.200 --> 14:59.520
I was thinking about this yesterday that there's organs in your body that you won't see,

14:59.520 --> 15:04.240
but like you've been carrying them with you forever, but like you will never see

15:04.240 --> 15:09.280
your heart or whatever. Like maybe through x-rays or MRIs or whatever, but like you,

15:09.280 --> 15:14.800
like you're just been hauling those things around with you and they could be weird or cool and you

15:14.800 --> 15:19.760
just don't know. They're just kind of along for the ride with you forever locked away.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.440
This is a, this is a thing I've thought about before, Justin, where like I've never had any

15:23.440 --> 15:27.840
kind of, uh, like open my body surgery. I've never had any surgery. And I thought like,

15:28.480 --> 15:32.080
what if they were to cut me open at like 45 and be like, what is that?

15:32.080 --> 15:37.760
Yeah. And I just like, I, I'm like an ex man. Dude, your liver's all weird. Oh man.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.280
I've got a whole nother organ in there that they've like never seen. It's just like,

15:41.280 --> 15:46.960
well, this is new. He's got stomach too. The sequel, the stomach.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.720
This is why you could eat all those bagel sandwiches. That don't make sense.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.720
It's like a cow stomach in here. It's a lot of chambers.

15:56.080 --> 16:01.120
I can have a perfect liver. I might have like the perfect liver and I'd never know.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.200
I don't know. You like Hennessy a lot. That's true. No, I mean, not anymore.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.920
The slow carb business, it's not compatible with pounding the Hennessy every night.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.360
Now, Justin, I'm pretty sure at this point, as long as you've been doing slow carb,

16:13.360 --> 16:17.680
if you ever did have some sort of surgery, it would just sort of be like a beanbag situation.

16:17.680 --> 16:22.080
Just like a lot of pintos would just come just spilling, spilling out of you.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.600
I hear the pintos shuffling around when you walk. I'm just saying.

16:25.600 --> 16:31.200
It's gotten a little distracting for sure. A little bit. It's sort of a maraca situation.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.560
Are there parts of your body you haven't explored?

16:34.560 --> 16:37.760
Listen, we're all thinking about it. We're all dancing around it,

16:37.760 --> 16:39.360
but there's probably a part of the...

16:41.360 --> 16:42.480
I mean, the taint, right?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.960
The taint, the gooch region, the back of it. Everyone's thinking about the taint.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.080
Everybody's thinking about it. Here's something kind of fun.

16:48.080 --> 16:55.600
I would be willing to bet $100 that 100% of the people listening to this episode have,

16:55.600 --> 16:58.640
in the past three minutes, visualized their own taint.

16:58.640 --> 17:03.680
And they have probably thought about the last taint experience that they had,

17:03.680 --> 17:05.840
and they're all visualizing their own taint.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.360
If you've visualized your own taint in the past three minutes, please tweet,

17:09.360 --> 17:12.720
I just visualized my own taint. Hashtag MBMBAM.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.360
If you want to throw a link to the iTunes page, all the better.

17:15.360 --> 17:18.960
Oh, this will also be fun, because we also often get questions about this.

17:18.960 --> 17:24.000
If you're in a public setting, maybe on the subway,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.520
or you're just walking down the street, right now, if you visualize your own taint,

17:27.520 --> 17:31.040
just raise your hand, and if you see someone else,

17:31.040 --> 17:34.560
like, oh, they raised their hand for no reason, just walking down the street, you'll know.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.840
That's how they'll know.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.200
Yeah, you'll know, like, oh, okay, you're listening to my brother and my brother and me right now,

17:39.200 --> 17:41.840
and you thought about your taint. Cool. And maybe high-five them.

17:41.840 --> 17:48.480
And not only visualized it, thought about your history with it.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.520
Yeah, for sure.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.280
Have I been all over that? Have I Magellaned my taint?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.160
Thought about the intricate setup of mirrors you once did.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.520
It's gotta be, it's gotta, you know what? No.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.000
I've seen everything my body has to offer.

18:06.800 --> 18:07.680
Next question.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.600
I picked up a pair of jeans one day and couldn't remember where I had bought them,

18:11.600 --> 18:14.400
but they quickly became my favorite pair of jeans.

18:14.400 --> 18:18.240
After wearing them a few times, it hit me that there's a chance they were my roommates,

18:18.240 --> 18:20.480
and they ended up in my laundry by accident.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.800
She hasn't said anything, and there's a chance I just forgot I bought them.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.520
I checked, and we don't wear the same size,

18:27.520 --> 18:30.400
but I also know that those are just justifications I'm using

18:30.400 --> 18:33.600
to avoid possibly having to give up my favorite pair of jeans.

18:33.600 --> 18:39.600
What should I do? That's from Potential Denim Deviant.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.080
You're good.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.560
You're fine.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.080
I really don't know what else to say.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.600
It's good jeans, roommate doesn't care, it's not even the same size, you're good.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.160
Traveling pants is the way to go though, Trav.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.560
If you are ever caught, like I thought we were in the sisterhood together,

18:54.560 --> 19:01.280
and they may travel back to you at some point if I get some cheese stains on them,

19:01.280 --> 19:04.160
but right now they've wandered long enough,

19:04.160 --> 19:07.840
and they've found respite and shelter, and we gotta let them embrace that.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.480
This is something I wish you could do with a roommate,

19:10.480 --> 19:15.440
which is like, I'm traveling to Italy to go to a friend's wedding,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.200
and it's going to be a difficult time for me,

19:17.200 --> 19:22.560
so I stole some of your fucking pants because these are my traveling jeans.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.360
I think that's what that movie, I think that's how it starts.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.080
And this is our traveling wallet that I stole from you.

19:28.080 --> 19:33.440
Yeah, guys, the sisterhood of the traveling identity.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.560
The traveling social security number, what's the problem?

19:36.560 --> 19:38.720
Listen, I'm going to a wedding, it's going to be tough.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.760
I bought a bunch of shit with your Amazon account, I had to deliver to my dad's place.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.400
So they're fine, right?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.520
Like, this is an easy one.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.720
But I also think that there's a third more mysterious possibility here of like,

19:52.720 --> 19:55.440
you don't remember buying them, but they're not your roommate's size,

19:55.440 --> 20:01.520
so like, there is a third option that it's neither yours nor your roommate's,

20:01.520 --> 20:03.360
and like, where the fuck did they come from?

20:03.360 --> 20:06.640
Sentient alien pretending to be jeans to get a bunch of bucks.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.360
Oh my god.

20:07.360 --> 20:07.680
Thank you, Justin.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.040
These fucking perverts.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.800
I'm so sick of these genomorphs.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.960
Thank you, and thank you, Philip K. Dick, for giving aliens the idea to do that.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.080
I want to go ahead and give Griffin a bit of a moment here,

20:18.080 --> 20:22.240
because usually it's mine, but Griffin did just say genomorph,

20:22.240 --> 20:25.040
and like, I really want to hang a lantern on that.

20:25.040 --> 20:25.600
Nothing.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.520
I've been there, Griffin.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.800
I know how that feels.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.080
I know, Trav, and I just, it felt bad.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.680
I'm sorry I do that to you so often.

20:35.680 --> 20:41.600
You put up pearls before swine so frequently, and it just felt so shitty.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, no, that was, genomorph was great.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.480
And don't get me wrong, I'm gonna keep doing it to you,

20:46.480 --> 20:49.920
but like, in that envious moment, it just like, is weird.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.160
No, when you got a rhythm like we have, it's okay if you shit on me from time to time.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.920
Oh, by the way, genomorph is a really great roller derby name,

20:57.920 --> 21:00.720
if anyone wants to use that and be kind of like, alien themed.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.760
I mean, I already TM'd it, so.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.280
Oh, well, never mind.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.640
How about another question?

21:06.640 --> 21:10.160
Yeah, I recently discovered that my brother eats toaster waffles weird.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.880
Instead of eating both waffles separately with some kind of spreadable food stuff or syrup,

21:14.880 --> 21:17.600
he immediately takes the waffles after they've popped out from the toaster

21:17.600 --> 21:20.960
and eats them without any accompanying butter, jam, marmalade, etc.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.440
Furthermore, he holds them together as if they're sandwich slices

21:23.440 --> 21:27.520
without any actual filling, taking large bites out of both dry waffles at a time.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.600
How do I communicate to him that he's doing this wrong,

21:29.600 --> 21:31.760
or is it weird that I find this weird?

21:31.760 --> 21:34.080
And that's from Whacked Out by Waffle Weirdness.

21:34.640 --> 21:38.720
When y'all started this show, when we started this show,

21:39.280 --> 21:44.560
did you think it would turn into a internet forum

21:44.560 --> 21:48.400
for us to learn about all the different types of perverts that there are in the world?

21:48.400 --> 21:54.720
Because I didn't think it would be that, but that's certainly where we are.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.200
I'm into this.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.440
I've done exactly this.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.760
I enjoy, if I'm going to make a toaster waffle,

22:01.760 --> 22:04.080
I just want to wrap it in a paper towel and go to town.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.080
I don't want a bunch of accoutrement.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.120
Here's what it is.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.800
Here's what it is, Justin, because I felt this way as well,

22:10.800 --> 22:15.600
which is I think the brother in question here has recognized like,

22:15.600 --> 22:18.160
I'm not having a gourmet dinner.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.640
I am getting two frozen toaster waffles because if I don't eat, I'll die.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.000
And this is function more than form.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.040
I just need to consume this food as quickly as possible

22:29.040 --> 22:34.000
so I can continue on with my day so that I don't get cranky around 1130.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.200
Now I want to hit you with this Griffin,

22:35.200 --> 22:37.360
because you were sort of turning your nose up at this.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.680
Does it change the math at all for you?

22:39.680 --> 22:41.280
I don't eat plain waffles.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.280
If I'm going to eat a toaster waffle, I like them with some fixings.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.680
So right now I've got Spiderman waffles

22:47.680 --> 22:50.400
and they have blue and red berries in them and they're shaped like webs.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.040
And full of spiders, just like lots of spiders.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.640
One bite, spiders in your mouth.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.680
It's fantastic.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.800
Spider in every bite.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.840
Guaranteed.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.480
Guaranteed.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.840
So does that change it for you?

22:59.840 --> 23:03.920
If it's like a sweet treat with berries in it to just eat it dry,

23:03.920 --> 23:04.720
does that bother you?

23:07.200 --> 23:12.880
I wasn't imagining just like a flax fucking plain flavorless waffle.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.320
I'll tell you what freaks me out.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.960
It's the combination of no accoutrement, no syrups,

23:18.960 --> 23:22.000
no peanut butters or jellies or jams or butters,

23:22.960 --> 23:25.120
and also eating them two at a time.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.400
Like to quote this amazing turn of phrase from the question,

23:28.400 --> 23:29.600
sandwich slices.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.160
I just like that.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.200
Doing both to me,

23:33.200 --> 23:35.520
eating it like it's a sandwich with nothing in the middle

23:36.960 --> 23:38.480
is ludicrous to me.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.840
It's beyond the pale.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.560
I cannot forgive it or get over it.

23:42.560 --> 23:47.760
What if I told you that this brother Griffin was an EMT

23:48.400 --> 23:50.240
who had to get out there and save lives

23:50.240 --> 23:54.320
and doesn't have time to put butter on the waffle and syrup

23:54.320 --> 23:55.920
and enjoy it like you.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.720
Like you, they're out there saving lives.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.280
If you're gonna eat two waffles and you can eat them both

24:05.280 --> 24:09.200
in a time it takes you to eat one through stacking technology,

24:09.200 --> 24:12.640
it seems irresponsible not to.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.080
Yes, I mean, you're fucking,

24:14.080 --> 24:17.680
but now you're on some like bullshit Silicon Valley stuff

24:17.680 --> 24:19.440
of just like, you don't have got time to eat.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.120
You got to program Facebook too.

24:21.120 --> 24:24.080
So here's a protein slurry that we can shoot into your mouth

24:24.080 --> 24:24.880
with a big gun.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.520
No, you gotta take time and enjoy your life.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.640
You're an EMT, that's fine.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.840
You get out there and save lives,

24:29.840 --> 24:31.440
but save your own life first

24:31.440 --> 24:32.800
because what's life worth living

24:32.800 --> 24:35.040
if you don't eat your waffles one at a fucking time

24:35.040 --> 24:36.800
with the syrup and stuff.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.520
Aren't there some days where a scientist like knocked

24:39.520 --> 24:41.920
on your door and said, eat this pill

24:41.920 --> 24:44.160
and you won't need to eat for the next 24 hours

24:44.160 --> 24:45.520
and you'll get all the nutrients you need

24:45.520 --> 24:47.600
and you'll feel totally full and satisfied

24:47.600 --> 24:50.080
and you'll like be able to like really focus

24:50.080 --> 24:52.080
on getting shit done today.

24:52.080 --> 24:52.720
What the fuck?

24:52.720 --> 24:55.040
Not every day, not every day.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.440
Eating's the best.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.440
Eating's my favorite.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.280
I saw that in an episode of Garfield

25:01.280 --> 25:02.800
when we went to the future

25:02.800 --> 25:04.880
and everybody was eating food pills.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.840
And what was the lesson you learned?

25:05.840 --> 25:06.560
What was the lesson you learned?

25:06.560 --> 25:09.440
Because I bet he was like, what about my lasagna?

25:09.440 --> 25:10.480
That's what he was like.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.480
He was like, fuck this, I'm going back to the past.

25:12.480 --> 25:16.640
It was the first time that the F word was used on TV.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.480
And it was very unscripted.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.360
It was live.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.480
Griffin, you have to remember,

25:20.480 --> 25:22.160
and I don't know if you're old enough to remember this.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.840
I grew up in a house where I once watched my dad

25:25.840 --> 25:27.680
eat a pop tart with butter on it.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.600
Like he put butter on a pop tart.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.320
So it's like very hard to sort of trip me out

25:32.320 --> 25:33.840
with breakfast methodology.

25:33.840 --> 25:37.840
I guess it's just, it's just slow down y'all.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.960
You only get one go, put some syrup on some shit.

25:40.960 --> 25:41.760
That's it.

25:41.760 --> 25:42.800
That's all I'm gonna say.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.760
We get one go, yolo, syrup your shit up.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.560
What if it was a syrup sandwich?

25:48.560 --> 25:49.840
What is that?

25:49.840 --> 25:50.960
What have you just said?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.800
Two waffles, syrup in the middle,

25:52.800 --> 25:54.960
squish it together, syrup sandwich.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.440
It's gonna be a mess, but it's better than nothing.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.560
What if you made like syrup infused butter?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.160
I don't do that much syrup on my shit anymore.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.040
Actually, I'm more of a peanut butter and jam kind of man

26:05.040 --> 26:09.120
because one time it was just when we had gotten Cecil,

26:09.120 --> 26:11.920
our cat, I put some syrup on a waffle

26:11.920 --> 26:12.880
and it slipped off my plate

26:12.880 --> 26:14.720
and landed on the cat syrup side down.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.520
I hate that.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.840
Sticky kitty.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.920
That cat fucking hates my guts still.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.200
And it's because of that.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.480
And I don't blame him.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.760
I don't blame him.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.040
What a shitty day.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.720
Waffles are kind of bullshit.

26:26.720 --> 26:30.560
The first time the inventor of the waffle, Ed Waffle,

26:30.560 --> 26:35.600
invented it, the first time he tried to spread butter on it,

26:35.600 --> 26:38.080
he should have gone back to the fucking drawing board

26:38.080 --> 26:40.240
and just said like, this didn't work out.

26:40.240 --> 26:43.440
I just tried it and like, this didn't work.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.200
You guys, are you ready?

26:45.200 --> 26:46.480
Are you ready for my new invention

26:46.480 --> 26:47.440
that I've just come up with?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.560
Waffle iron, smooth on one side for the butter,

26:50.560 --> 26:52.080
waffled on the other for the syrup.

26:52.080 --> 26:52.880
Oh my God.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.280
Holy shit.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.200
Oh my God.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.400
It's just like, yeah, choose your own adventure.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.920
That's so good, Trav.

26:59.920 --> 27:04.400
You spread the butter onto the flat side

27:04.400 --> 27:07.120
and then you flip it and dip it

27:07.120 --> 27:09.360
and then you fill every one of those crannies

27:09.360 --> 27:10.800
with that golden juice.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
Oh my God, this is good, Travis.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.640
I'm so, wow.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.800
Wow, that's good.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.320
Name it so you can TM it real quick.

27:20.160 --> 27:20.720
Falafel.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.360
Okay, it's a flat waffle.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.720
No, you fucked up.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.520
Oh, damn it.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.600
Can I just, breakfast friend.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.640
Breakfast friend.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.080
The name of the tool is the breakfast friend.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.040
A little general.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.680
If I buy something called a breakfast friend

27:35.680 --> 27:39.120
and it does this one thing, it's not a great friend.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.480
It's just sort of like a very single-minded friend.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.080
Future waffle love sounds.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.160
Travis McRoy presents waffle friend.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.840
A Travis McRoy joint.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.920
So what about waffle box, the pancake below?

28:00.480 --> 28:03.360
Yeah, waffle box, the pancake below is really, really good.

28:03.360 --> 28:03.840
Okay.

28:03.840 --> 28:04.960
Spider-Man waffles.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.200
Those are used.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.280
Groot waffles.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.480
I am Groot waffles.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.760
Everybody loves that little guy.

28:12.800 --> 28:13.440
Groffles.

28:14.080 --> 28:14.560
Groffles.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.600
Janine Groffles.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.960
And it comes with a cereal like Cheerios

28:20.960 --> 28:22.560
and that's the O's that you pour on top.

28:22.560 --> 28:26.000
Why didn't Janine Groffle ever get her own cereal?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.200
It's not too late.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.160
Janine Groffle's tasty waffles.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.280
And it's just like it's waffles with her Cheerios.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.200
Can we call him Mark Groffle-O's?

28:35.200 --> 28:37.040
She's just wearing a chef's outfit.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.200
Hi, I'm Mark Groffle-O and this is my partner Janine Groffle-O

28:41.200 --> 28:44.640
and we want to present to you Groffle-O and Groffle-O's waffles.

28:44.640 --> 28:50.320
Coming, coming this fall.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.040
Look forward to it.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.720
It's my new potato chip brand.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.480
It is just called Groffle-O's.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.360
It's not as good.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.800
I came up with it early and I'm in debt.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.960
We need to talk about it.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.320
I think that's all the jokes.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.720
We're going to have to fund these new inventions somehow.

29:04.720 --> 29:18.000
So let's take a trip on down to the money town.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.800
I would like to tell you all about our sponsor this week.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.960
One of them, Squarespace.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.120
I have on Squarespace right now,

29:25.760 --> 29:28.400
I think four or five different websites I've set up there.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.160
It's so easy and convenient.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.560
Just started a new project with my friends here in Cincinnati

29:32.560 --> 29:35.680
where we're doing like a puzzle bar crawl

29:36.480 --> 29:38.640
where you move from bar to bar and get different puzzles

29:38.640 --> 29:39.840
to tell you the next place to go.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.800
That sounds fun.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.800
Yeah, and I set up a website on Squarespace

29:42.800 --> 29:44.160
with the registration.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.080
You can pay the registration fee through there,

29:46.080 --> 29:46.960
find all the information.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.720
I even was able to set up puzzles

29:48.720 --> 29:51.840
where you have to enter the answer to get to the next page.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.080
It's really cool and it's so user-friendly

29:56.080 --> 29:57.920
and their support is amazing.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.840
You have 24 seven customer support.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.640
There's nothing to install, patch, upgrade ever.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.880
It's just amazing award-winning templates

30:04.880 --> 30:06.240
and an all-in-one platform.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.960
I highly recommend you can also get your domains

30:10.960 --> 30:12.880
right through Squarespace.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.280
So it's an all-in-one experience.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.240
And for a free trial and 10% off your first purchase,

30:18.240 --> 30:22.080

30:22.080 --> 30:24.240
That's squarespace.com slash my brother.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.040
Go check it out.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.320
I'm a huge fan.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.120
I also wanna say I went to roundzone.com once.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.240
To try to get a website, gave my computer a big virus.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.000
You may not spend a lot of time thinking about your taint,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.040
but your taint knows you so well.

30:39.040 --> 30:39.680
You know why?

30:39.680 --> 30:44.080
Because you take the time to give it the very best

30:44.080 --> 30:46.320
when you go to MeUndies.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.280
MeUndies is sustainably sourced and made from micromodal.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.920
It's a fabric that's three times softer than cotton,

30:53.920 --> 30:56.960
which your taint certainly appreciates.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.160
You know, I'm gonna put a limit, four more times.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.360
Four more times.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.760
You can try MeUndies today, and you should.

31:03.760 --> 31:06.400
Go get the celebrate pattern before they're all gone

31:06.400 --> 31:09.120
at MeUndies.com slash my brother.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.280
I should mention the celebrate pattern,

31:11.280 --> 31:13.760
it looks like confetti and it's fun.

31:13.760 --> 31:14.880
It's real fun.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.320
It's fun.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.440
If you go to that address I gave you,

31:17.440 --> 31:19.200
MeUndies.com slash my brother,

31:19.200 --> 31:22.000
you'll save 20% off your first pair.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.640
So that makes affordable undies even more so.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.360
You can get 20% off your first pair plus free shipping

31:27.360 --> 31:30.480
at MeUndies.com slash my brother right now.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.760
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.320
I'm wearing those,

31:34.880 --> 31:36.320
I don't know if y'all are down on this experience,

31:36.320 --> 31:38.160
those MeUndies lounge pants right now.

31:38.160 --> 31:38.880
Fuck me.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.200
It's just like a big pair of MeUndies that are pants also.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.560
And I gotta get into those.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.200
They're real good.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.320
Hey, can I tell you about wink?

31:44.320 --> 31:44.800
Please do.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.160
I'm gonna do it real quick.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.920
Do you hear that?

31:47.920 --> 31:49.040
That was the sound of my,

31:49.040 --> 31:50.720
that's the sound I make when I wink.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.520
Oh God.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.760
Yeah, they say to do it.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.560
Huh.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.360
Do that.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.320
Go to a doctor.

31:57.680 --> 32:01.440
Formerly, you may know this project formerly as Club W.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.280
It gives you access to exceptional wines

32:03.280 --> 32:04.960
from around the world.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.040
They base the wines that they send you

32:07.040 --> 32:08.400
on your taste preferences

32:08.400 --> 32:10.080
and will introduce you to new custom wines

32:10.080 --> 32:11.680
that are not available anywhere else.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.080
We've gotten a few bottles from them before

32:14.080 --> 32:17.440
and I'm not like a huge wine drinker.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.560
I enjoy drinking wine.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.880
I just like don't know how to get good stuff.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.480
Like I don't know what is good

32:22.480 --> 32:24.000
because I'm a child.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.880
But all the stuff they send

32:24.880 --> 32:26.000
has been like really, really great.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.680
You can join for free,

32:27.680 --> 32:29.520
skip any month of deliveries that you want

32:29.520 --> 32:30.240
and cancel anytime

32:30.240 --> 32:32.160
and they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.840
So you never pay for a bottle you don't like.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.200
You can just go to trywink.com

32:37.200 --> 32:41.280
and that is spelled T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.760
It's wink with a C.com

and take a brief palette profile quiz

32:46.160 --> 32:47.680

That's trywink again.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.760
We got some personal messages here.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.560
First is for Geekly Con.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.760
It's a weekend long gathering of friends

33:15.760 --> 33:18.960
who love podcasts, tabletop gaming, video games.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.240
I like those things.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.680
And generally having fun.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.960
In 2017, Geekly Con will be in St. Louis

33:26.160 --> 33:29.360
from July 20th to the 23rd.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.480
Geek me in St. Louis, Louis.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.120
It's a little joke.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.440
Very little.

33:35.440 --> 33:39.600
Geekly Con is an open-minded and welcoming group

33:39.600 --> 33:42.400
and we invite you to come and meet your new best friends.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.400
Now tickets are selling fast

33:44.400 --> 33:46.800
so you're gonna wanna go to geeklycon.com

33:46.800 --> 33:50.240
to order one before they are sold out.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.240
This will be a great event

33:54.320 --> 33:55.760
and I think everybody should go.

33:55.760 --> 33:59.120
Michael, the guy who's done so much web design for us

33:59.120 --> 34:02.400
over the years, puts it on and he's a real sweetheart.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.200
So you should go check it totally out.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.360
Geeklycon.com.

34:08.240 --> 34:10.560
I have a personal message here and it's for Adam.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.640
Happy birthday to my favorite husband.

34:12.640 --> 34:15.040
And it's from Tabitha, your favorite wife.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.920
This is the first time I think anybody using a Jumbotron

34:17.920 --> 34:21.360
has ever snuck a secret message into the name field.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.200
It's like that great 1-800 collect commercial

34:23.200 --> 34:25.360
where the guy's like, we oughta baby it's a boy.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.080
You remember that one?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.320
Yeah, I do actually.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.720
Oh God, why do I remember that?

34:31.360 --> 34:32.880
We oughta baby it's a boy.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.720
I can't remember my wife's phone number

34:34.720 --> 34:36.000
but I can remember that commercial.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.640
What's wrong with me?

34:36.640 --> 34:37.600
Same dude, same.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.480
So funny.

34:38.480 --> 34:41.200
Anyway, Adam, Tabitha has this message for you.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.080
Thanks for sticking with me through all my podcast obsessions

34:44.080 --> 34:45.600
and even joining me in some.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.960
I couldn't think of anything better

34:48.160 --> 34:50.320
than to have the brothers wish you a great year.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.720
You're always supportive and kind

34:52.720 --> 34:55.440
even with a grumpy, that's just my face, face

34:55.440 --> 34:57.200
and a sigh, winky emoticon.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.680
That's the sound it makes again, I'm sorry.

34:59.680 --> 35:04.000
PS, I'm buying this on my bday since they opened 2017 today.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.960
Now that's love.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.640
What a love.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.480
What a love.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.240
What an exceptional love.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.200
Buying somebody a birthday present on your dang birthday.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.040
That is such an amount of foresight

35:15.040 --> 35:17.440
that I cannot even comprehend.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.480
I do it every year.

35:19.520 --> 35:23.760
We oughta baby, it's a boy.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.320
So good.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.520
I'm so glad we could bring that great gag to a new generation.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.640
Hello, Amita Patel.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.400
Hello, Sean David Johnson.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.520
What's going on?

35:33.520 --> 35:34.880
I think a friend of mine may have

35:34.880 --> 35:37.360
chronic pop culture deficiency syndrome.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.480
Oh no, PCDS, what are the symptoms?

35:40.480 --> 35:43.040
Well, she doesn't know Wakanda from Westeros.

35:43.040 --> 35:43.680
Shameful.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.040
And she keeps confusing Aziz Ansari and Riz Ahmed.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.320
Oh my gosh, so sad.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.760
Kinda racist too, but what did you tell her to do?

35:51.760 --> 35:55.200
I told her to listen to our podcast, Inside Pop, of course.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.640
Fantastic idea.

35:56.640 --> 35:59.280
A weekly dose of Inside Pop will help anyone discover

35:59.280 --> 36:01.600
the best in TV, film, and music.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.920
Suffer from PCDS no more.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.480
Inside Pop has you covered every Wednesday on Max Fun.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.800
How about a Yahoo, please?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.440
This one was sent in by Level 9000,

36:11.440 --> 36:13.440
Yahoo Drew, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.520
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Max Tyler.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.240
Sometimes I can sense a smile in you

36:18.240 --> 36:20.960
when you begin to read these, and I always get very excited.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.080
They're just really good.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.200
In a war between sin towers...

36:25.920 --> 36:27.040
Why did I say it like that?

36:28.320 --> 36:31.280
I figured it was misspelled, and you were giving the person shit.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.320
Sin towers.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.280
Sin towers.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.840
You're saying them sin towers in Munich.

36:35.840 --> 36:40.880
In a war between sin towers and men on horses, who would win?

36:40.880 --> 36:42.800
By the way, it would be in a fantasy world

36:42.800 --> 36:45.280
with swords, spears, bows, and arrows,

36:45.280 --> 36:46.960
and such like, thanks in advance.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.560
This question is fucking on point.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.280
Okay, I really, I'm not gonna just start.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.440
Let's not do the thing we always do

36:53.440 --> 36:55.600
where we just start running our fucking mouths

36:55.600 --> 36:57.200
before we actually think about it.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.960
We're gonna take, I'm sorry, listener,

36:58.960 --> 37:02.720
perhaps you have a 15 second skip button on your player.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.480
Let's give ourselves 15 seconds

37:04.480 --> 37:06.800
to just fucking think about this for a second.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.960
I have a bit of filler for the audience

37:08.960 --> 37:10.880
to think about while we think about it.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.280
Do you think the first time a centaur

37:13.280 --> 37:15.920
sees a person on horseback get off the horse,

37:15.920 --> 37:17.600
they just start screaming in terror?

37:17.600 --> 37:18.560
That would be very scary.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.360
All right, shut your fucking gob and think about this.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.560
Think about it, ready, go.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.160
I've got my, I got my answer.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.200
Okay, okay, I think I'm ready.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.400
I'm ready too.

37:33.760 --> 37:38.160
Three, two, one, men on horses.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.440
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.200
And here's how I came to this conclusion.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.360
Centaurs is one big, beautiful beast,

37:45.360 --> 37:48.320
and don't get me wrong, big, beautiful beast, love it.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.600
And there's certainly a thing you can put in the pro column

37:51.600 --> 37:55.280
of just like full synthesis.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.720
Full integration.

37:56.720 --> 37:57.920
Full integration.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.760
You're gonna have, there's going to be,

37:59.760 --> 38:02.560
even the most beautiful domesticated horse

38:02.560 --> 38:05.920
with the most beautiful connection with a jockey,

38:05.920 --> 38:07.920
even if they're in the fucking drift together,

38:07.920 --> 38:08.720
there's gonna be some.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.880
Yeah, you've petted them every time they've turned left

38:10.880 --> 38:12.240
or stopped for you at the right time.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.520
You know what I mean?

38:13.520 --> 38:15.520
All the hearts exploded around their heads.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.120
There's a break point there

38:17.120 --> 38:19.680
of just how good that relationship can be.

38:19.680 --> 38:23.040
There's a loss of control there somewhere.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.960
But the thing I just can't get over

38:25.600 --> 38:27.200
is centaurs have one hit point

38:27.200 --> 38:28.880
and a man and a horse have two.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.240
Yeah, it's hard to deny that if you take out

38:32.240 --> 38:35.360
a centaur's legs, then it's done.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.080
If you take out the man on a horseback's legs,

38:38.080 --> 38:42.560
he's got another sort of methodology he can employ.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.160
I was thinking of spears, right?

38:44.160 --> 38:45.840
You throw a spear through a centaur,

38:46.400 --> 38:48.240
you've hit the centaur.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.960
You would have to throw that spear really good

38:50.960 --> 38:53.360
to get it through dude and horse.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.400
You know what I mean?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.320
Now here's the question though, Griffin.

38:56.320 --> 39:00.080
In that case, if the centaur takes out person,

39:00.640 --> 39:02.800
is the horse like, I'm gonna keep fighting?

39:02.800 --> 39:05.200
Or is the horse like, thank God, bye.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.200
Wow, this is actually a fucking great point

39:07.200 --> 39:13.200
because this gets back to that animal rider synthesis.

39:13.200 --> 39:18.000
If the man is killed, does horse continue the fight?

39:18.000 --> 39:20.320
I think that takes a special kind of horse.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.440
So like a really, just a murder sea biscuit,

39:23.440 --> 39:25.360
a murder biscuit, if you will.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.040
What is the horse gonna do?

39:27.040 --> 39:30.480
Like, oh, well, Daryl's down.

39:30.480 --> 39:33.200
I guess I'll go eat all their oats

39:33.200 --> 39:35.200
so they won't have any for later.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.040
I'm gonna burn their homes.

39:37.040 --> 39:37.920
Whoa, horse.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.600
What you just said is racist.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.800
That centaurs would eat oats.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.240
Actually, you know it's not

39:42.240 --> 39:43.440
because I eat oats sometimes.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.480
Yeah, thank you.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.040
Yeah, everybody likes oats except for me

39:47.040 --> 39:48.080
who only eats beans.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.960
Now if the horse ate all my beans,

39:52.960 --> 39:54.320
then we'd have a fucking issue.

39:54.320 --> 39:55.360
Yeah, you'd have a real problem.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.480
This is a fucking good point.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.400
I think this might change the equation a little bit.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.440
If you get a centaur and the horse meat,

40:06.240 --> 40:07.360
then I think they might be able

40:07.360 --> 40:08.960
to keep going a little bit, right?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.920
There's very little meat I have

40:11.920 --> 40:13.920
that if attacked with a big spear,

40:13.920 --> 40:16.000
I could keep the fire.

40:16.000 --> 40:16.880
You know what I mean?

40:16.880 --> 40:20.800
But a centaur, there's a lot of extra stuff on there.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.160
Shit, because if you take me out,

40:22.160 --> 40:23.120
my horse is done.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.440
My horse isn't gonna do anything to a centaur.

40:25.440 --> 40:25.940
Yeah.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.620
And also, you do have to get into the question

40:29.620 --> 40:32.740
of where the centaur is keeping their vital organs.

40:32.740 --> 40:37.220
Because if it's all in the human section,

40:37.220 --> 40:38.900
then you could just keep taking arrows

40:38.900 --> 40:41.620
to the horse meat and like brush it off.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.740
Your horse takes one arrow.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.540
He's gonna be like,

40:43.540 --> 40:45.140
actually, I've thought about it.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.740
Um, fuck all you guys.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.020
I'm actually leaving.

40:48.020 --> 40:48.740
Goodbye.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.300
I'm sorry.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.020
I know we're two souls intertwined

40:52.020 --> 40:54.340
in the most magical relationship possible,

40:54.340 --> 40:55.380
but I actually am gonna go ahead

40:55.380 --> 40:56.900
and dip because this sucks.

40:56.900 --> 40:57.460
This sucks.

40:57.460 --> 40:58.260
I'm out of here.

41:00.420 --> 41:02.420
Here's a Yahoo Answers user, Robin,

41:03.060 --> 41:07.700
whose profile image is just the word Irish says,

41:08.260 --> 41:10.500
centaurs would win because they can use

41:10.500 --> 41:12.740
the bow and arrows better than humans can.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.380
That's if there was a real war

41:15.380 --> 41:16.740
between centaurs versus human,

41:16.740 --> 41:17.540
they would all be dead.

41:18.900 --> 41:19.780
Don't even think about the fact

41:19.780 --> 41:20.820
that centaurs would be better

41:20.820 --> 41:21.700
with the bow and arrows.

41:23.380 --> 41:24.820
You cannot bring in those facts.

41:24.820 --> 41:26.740
We do not know what kind of training

41:27.300 --> 41:28.820
anybody has in this.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.660
That has to be a zero something.

41:31.460 --> 41:33.220
Is there something about the integration

41:33.220 --> 41:34.500
of human and horse that makes them

41:34.500 --> 41:35.780
inherently better at archery?

41:35.780 --> 41:36.580
I'm confused.

41:36.580 --> 41:40.020
I know that lore wise,

41:40.020 --> 41:41.460
centaurs are amazing archers,

41:41.460 --> 41:42.420
but I'm talking like,

41:46.180 --> 41:47.780
we're talking about a real war here.

41:47.780 --> 41:48.260
You know what I mean?

41:48.260 --> 41:49.140
Not some fantasy war.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.540
We're talking about real centaurs, okay?

41:51.540 --> 41:52.040
Yeah.

41:52.040 --> 41:55.720
Yeah, I think I've changed my answer.

41:55.720 --> 41:56.440
Okay, wait a minute.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.200
We're talking about a war,

41:58.200 --> 42:00.520
not a battle, not a skirmish, a war.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.400
Look at the Civil War, right?

42:05.400 --> 42:08.120
Look at how important predicting

42:08.120 --> 42:10.280
troop movement was in that war,

42:10.280 --> 42:12.840
and it led to several lopsided battles

42:13.560 --> 42:15.480
and predicting where the enemy was gonna be.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.680
I'm sure that's true for any war.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.600
I've just read more books about the Civil War.

42:18.600 --> 42:24.440
So if you can assume that centaurs are going to be more mobile

42:24.440 --> 42:30.520
and going to be able to sort of be in other places

42:30.520 --> 42:32.200
like faster than the humans,

42:33.800 --> 42:36.040
like in terms of troop formation

42:36.040 --> 42:38.520
and sort of moving your resources around,

42:38.520 --> 42:41.720
the centaurs might actually have an advantage there.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.200
Oh shit, not only that, Justin,

42:44.200 --> 42:45.960
but speaking of resources,

42:45.960 --> 42:47.800
you only gotta feed a centaur once.

42:47.800 --> 42:48.760
Yes, exactly.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.520
You gotta feed a dude and a horse separately.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.640
That's double the food.

42:51.640 --> 42:51.960
Fuck.

42:51.960 --> 42:52.520
Okay.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.840
And centaurs are probably just eating apples, so.

42:55.480 --> 42:55.980
Whoa.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.440
Whoa, I mean, yeah.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.840
And terrain, I was gonna say something

43:00.840 --> 43:03.240
about terrain being an issue for a centaur,

43:03.240 --> 43:05.080
but you've gotta bring your horses,

43:05.080 --> 43:07.640
so it can't be, that's equal.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.960
But there is the issue.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
Now, okay, you do have to imagine though

43:11.960 --> 43:14.600
that the caloric load of a centaur-

43:14.600 --> 43:15.560
It's tremendous.

43:15.560 --> 43:16.280
It's tremendous.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.240
I mean, it's not gonna be one-to-one,

43:19.240 --> 43:21.720
but there are certainly some efficiencies there.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.160
Strike it from the pro list.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.440
It's gone, it's gone.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.400
Is there something to be said about the styles of combat

43:27.400 --> 43:32.920
that humans beings have that centaurs do not have, right?

43:34.520 --> 43:37.880
Centaurs essentially, it's all cavalry, no infantry.

43:37.880 --> 43:41.720
And so the human beings dismount the horses

43:41.720 --> 43:44.680
and you put those poles to the spikes on the ground

43:44.680 --> 43:45.880
sticking out towards the horses.

43:45.880 --> 43:50.760
You could build like a centaur barricade pretty well,

43:50.760 --> 43:51.720
I feel like.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.280
Another thing is that centaurs,

43:54.280 --> 43:56.680
very little stealth capabilities, I feel like.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.320
Very little guerrilla combat available to them.

43:59.320 --> 44:02.280
You go into a woods and they're playing on an ambush

44:02.280 --> 44:05.080
and all you hear is like, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.520
You're like, there's fucking centaurs here.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.880
Everybody stay frosty.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.120
Let's just open up the big book

44:10.120 --> 44:11.640
that nobody is willing to look at,

44:11.640 --> 44:14.520
but I'm gonna pull it off the shelf, blow the dust off.

44:14.520 --> 44:16.840
And it's a big book labeled espionage.

44:16.840 --> 44:21.560
And that's gonna be extremely difficult for a human,

44:21.560 --> 44:22.840
but feasible.

44:22.840 --> 44:26.440
If you got the right costume, you could maybe pull it off.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.880
If you're a centaur double agent, no one is fooled.

44:29.880 --> 44:30.440
There's just no-

44:30.440 --> 44:33.960
Fuck that, no, you just drape some fucking jeans

44:34.680 --> 44:36.920
around your torso and it'll be like,

44:36.920 --> 44:38.280
that's a weird way to ride a horse.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.360
Don't you judge me, me and this animal.

44:40.920 --> 44:41.880
Where's your horse's head?

44:41.880 --> 44:42.520
Don't worry about it.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.720
It's in the jeans with me.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.360
And Justin, I'm sorry, but I'll tell you who's fooled.

44:46.360 --> 44:47.320
A horse.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.120
Yep.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.440
The human might not be, but the horse is like,

44:50.440 --> 44:52.440
hey, I'm gonna come hang out with you guys here.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.480
You're all horses.

44:53.480 --> 44:54.120
What's that?

44:54.120 --> 44:56.200
Tranquilizer, tranquilizer, tranquilizer.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.240
Let's go, right?

44:57.240 --> 44:58.280
And you're in there.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.320
Also, here's the thing.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.560
We can't separate.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.720
I don't think it's fair in this discussion

45:03.720 --> 45:07.400
to talk about humans separate from horse versus centaur.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.360
Because like, that's not the question.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.160
It's person on horse.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.080
That has to be it, that's our own thing.

45:13.080 --> 45:15.400
That's the only fucking thing we got going for us

45:15.400 --> 45:15.800
in this fight.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.160
You want to tie a hand behind our back?

45:17.160 --> 45:18.040
No way.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.480
It's a plus and a minus.

45:19.480 --> 45:21.400
Well, but then the centaurs are going to partner

45:21.400 --> 45:22.680
with some fairies and shit.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.040
And like, they're in there.

45:24.040 --> 45:24.520
No, come on.

45:24.520 --> 45:27.480
You're confusing this fucking conversation for no reason.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.720
My ability to get off a horse is the only thing

45:29.720 --> 45:31.640
separating me from centaurs.

45:32.920 --> 45:34.840
This is their ability to factor in.

45:34.840 --> 45:37.080
And their connection, their deep connection

45:37.080 --> 45:38.440
is the advantage over us.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.960
It's the one defining factor.

45:39.960 --> 45:43.640
Now, I will grant, Travis, that I think that

45:44.280 --> 45:48.120
allowing for humans to sort of build traps

45:48.120 --> 45:51.320
and what have you is against the spirit.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.120
I think it's against the spirit of the question.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.800
I think the assumption has to be anytime

45:55.800 --> 45:58.360
these two are fighting, it is definitely man on horse.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.440
Whose fucking side are you on in this thing?

46:00.440 --> 46:03.640
Because it sounds like you're anti-human now.

46:03.640 --> 46:06.280
I'm just torn about it, Griffin, because the thing is,

46:06.280 --> 46:08.440
if they do separate and can separate,

46:08.440 --> 46:10.760
it also lends the centaurs an advantage

46:10.760 --> 46:12.680
because if they get the drop on the humans,

46:13.640 --> 46:14.760
it could be a massacre.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.120
I mean, it could be-

46:16.120 --> 46:17.720
I could fuck up a centaur right now.

46:17.720 --> 46:18.520
I'm not afraid.

46:18.520 --> 46:19.320
This is fucked up.

46:19.320 --> 46:20.120
Can we agree?

46:21.800 --> 46:24.520
I think what we have to all accept now

46:25.240 --> 46:29.640
is the ultimate is a person centaur team up.

46:29.640 --> 46:30.680
Whoa, hold on.

46:31.400 --> 46:31.880
Right?

46:31.880 --> 46:34.760
Whoa, I did not expect this West Side story bullshit.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.640
This is a love story that blossoms here.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.240
But imagine that.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.320
Think about riding a horse and being able to

46:41.880 --> 46:44.840
also strategize with them and be like,

46:44.840 --> 46:46.040
you go left, I'll go right.

46:46.040 --> 46:47.720
You pick me back up and then we're gonna-

46:49.400 --> 46:52.440
I have a short, I have a very short list of people

46:52.440 --> 46:55.400
in my life where if I was a centaur,

46:56.760 --> 46:58.680
I would be okay with them riding me.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.720
It's very short.

46:59.720 --> 47:02.280
And boys, I don't know if you're on it.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.400
It's really short.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.320
Give me a bit more time on the slow carb diet.

47:05.320 --> 47:05.800
We'll see.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.720
It may be a little more validable.

47:07.720 --> 47:08.360
It's not a weight thing.

47:08.360 --> 47:08.920
It's not a weight thing.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.600
Because first of all, if I was a centaur,

47:10.600 --> 47:12.600
I would have the most beautiful, strong, proud back

47:12.600 --> 47:13.720
and I can carry anybody.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.440
Why do you not think that your centaur form

47:18.440 --> 47:20.520
would be a reflection of your current

47:21.640 --> 47:24.520
uber fragile, no hot food allowed human state?

47:24.520 --> 47:28.040
I don't see why you're granting yourself immunity

47:28.040 --> 47:30.040
to stomach acid all of a sudden.

47:30.040 --> 47:31.400
Big, beautiful, proud, strong back.

47:31.400 --> 47:33.080
I can carry anybody.

47:33.080 --> 47:35.800
It is not a, it has nothing to do with you.

47:35.800 --> 47:40.040
It has everything to do with my pride, I guess.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.440
You never just see like, wait, who would you?

47:42.440 --> 47:43.720
Well, who's at the top of your list?

47:43.720 --> 47:44.680
Who's number one?

47:44.680 --> 47:45.720
Yes, yes, yes.

47:45.720 --> 47:46.760
I mean, it was in our vows

47:46.760 --> 47:47.640
and you guys were at the wedding.

47:47.640 --> 47:48.440
So, you know, Rachel.

47:51.480 --> 47:54.200
I mean, my son, but after, I mean, it's dangerous up there.

47:54.200 --> 47:57.080
Big, strong back and he can't really sit up so good yet.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.720
I'm gonna say Joe Biden's at the top of mine.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.000
Joe Biden's up there for me too.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.040
I mean, that goes without saying,

48:02.040 --> 48:03.480
just because I think he probably does have

48:03.480 --> 48:05.080
some sort of equestrian experience.

48:05.080 --> 48:06.600
And he'll call himself Joe Ryden,

48:06.600 --> 48:10.040
which is like, oh, Joe, yes, so good.

48:10.040 --> 48:12.760
Now, are we assuming that the first time they meet,

48:12.760 --> 48:15.880
there is no period in which the centaurs

48:15.880 --> 48:18.280
are sort of swept up, or sorry,

48:18.280 --> 48:20.040
the humans are sort of swept up

48:20.040 --> 48:23.080
in the majesty and beauty of seeing centaurs for real.

48:23.080 --> 48:24.120
We're gonna lose a lot of humans

48:24.120 --> 48:25.800
just from that sort of shock factor.

48:25.800 --> 48:27.400
Oh, see, I think the opposite.

48:27.400 --> 48:30.600
I think humans, what we know about humans in,

48:30.600 --> 48:34.360
you know, now is like the immediate distrust of like,

48:35.000 --> 48:37.960
no, we're just gonna go ahead and just start the war.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.080
I think humans start the war.

48:39.080 --> 48:41.560
I think centaurs start the war, yeah.

48:41.560 --> 48:45.400
The humans will be more upset

48:45.400 --> 48:49.320
by the sort of like fear of the outsider here

48:49.320 --> 48:52.200
than centaurs are gonna be about the blasphemy

48:52.760 --> 48:54.280
of humans riding horses.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.800
That will disgust them.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.640
Here's a fact that we've never considered

48:57.640 --> 48:59.000
in this argument yet.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.600
One makes us think this war gets going.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.960
This war is popping off.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.120
One makes us think that the horses

49:06.120 --> 49:08.120
are gonna stay on our fucking side.

49:08.120 --> 49:08.920
Oh, fuck.

49:10.200 --> 49:10.680
You're right.

49:11.320 --> 49:14.200
I think that's the deciding factor here.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.200
I think maybe they'll stick with us for a while, right?

49:16.200 --> 49:17.160
Just cause it's what they know.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.080
We give them sugar cubes.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.080
But after a minute, they see this other way of living

49:23.080 --> 49:25.080
and they're like, hey, you know what?

49:25.080 --> 49:28.760
You keep me in a big jail and feed me sugar cubes only.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.080
Bye.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.360
If that happens, we're fucked.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.720
If that happens, we're done.

49:33.720 --> 49:34.440
We're done.

49:34.440 --> 49:36.760
And the only way to get a grasp on the situation

49:36.760 --> 49:38.200
is to tighten the grip.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.800
And I'm fucking uncomfortable with that.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.640
I don't wanna win like that.

49:41.640 --> 49:44.680
No, Griffin, I think we need to build more trust

49:45.720 --> 49:48.600
with our horses now.

49:48.600 --> 49:49.560
Start now.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.520
We've gotta promise them liberty.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.200
We've gotta promise them freedom

49:54.840 --> 49:56.520
if they help us win this war.

49:56.520 --> 50:00.840
Is this like the beginning of a Planet of the Apes movie

50:00.840 --> 50:02.600
where like us working with horses

50:02.600 --> 50:04.680
is what leads to centaurs

50:04.680 --> 50:06.840
and then we have to fight our own,

50:06.840 --> 50:08.760
like that's the future that centaurs have.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.600
Okay, Travis, are you suggesting,

50:10.600 --> 50:12.840
and I think you are and I'm just gonna pretend you are

50:12.840 --> 50:13.880
if you aren't,

50:13.880 --> 50:18.200
are you suggesting that this war takes quite a while

50:18.200 --> 50:22.920
and in an underground bunker hidden from the eyes of centaur

50:22.920 --> 50:25.960
and more faithful humans alike,

50:25.960 --> 50:28.280
scientists decide that we have to,

50:28.280 --> 50:32.120
the only recourse is to breed our own race of centaurs

50:32.120 --> 50:34.920
in the exact way that you think that that would happen?

50:34.920 --> 50:36.920
Yes, and then we send them back

50:36.920 --> 50:40.360
to start to like fight the war for us at the beginning.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.280
This is like a Terminator situation.

50:42.280 --> 50:45.960
Boys, I am thinking about those early centaurs.

50:47.640 --> 50:50.040
There's gonna be some whoopsies in there, huh?

50:51.320 --> 50:51.800
Wait a minute.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.920
It's just a fucking horse body, four hooves,

50:54.920 --> 50:57.000
and then just like at the armpits,

50:57.000 --> 50:59.480
it starts right at the end of the top hooves

50:59.480 --> 51:02.440
and the dude's arms and head just hanging down like,

51:02.440 --> 51:04.760
oh yes, oats me, dog.

51:06.200 --> 51:10.120
Can you imagine a centaur with horse body,

51:10.120 --> 51:11.720
horse neck, human head?

51:11.720 --> 51:14.840
No torso, just human head on horse neck.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.160
Imagine horse body, no neck or head,

51:17.160 --> 51:19.800
but then the human torso and arms and human head

51:19.800 --> 51:22.520
are coming out of the side of the horse body.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.880
Oh no.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.840
He's just always stunting off the side.

51:29.880 --> 51:30.680
This is true.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.640
Centaurs are always seen with like upright spine

51:33.640 --> 51:34.840
from where the neck would be.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.920
What if it's just straight out continuation,

51:37.560 --> 51:39.720
just flat looking downward?

51:39.720 --> 51:42.360
I, Travis, I'm gonna go with your plan.

51:42.360 --> 51:46.520
We send the centaurs back in time to begin the war,

51:46.520 --> 51:48.760
but we send them back too far.

51:48.760 --> 51:49.560
And what do they do?

51:49.560 --> 51:51.160
They continue to breed.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.600
And then what do we find out?

51:52.600 --> 51:53.480
That's right.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.360
The centaurs that we're fighting in present day

51:56.360 --> 51:58.360
are the descendants of the centaurs

51:58.360 --> 52:00.520
that we ourselves invented and sent back in time.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.040
When will we learn?

52:02.040 --> 52:03.480
It was our own hubris.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.080
Someone needs to stop us.

52:08.440 --> 52:13.720
We need to stop making mix ups in God's Chipotle

52:13.720 --> 52:16.520
and just kind of accept what we have on Earth.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.360
Stop throwing the beans and rice around

52:18.360 --> 52:20.840
in the good Lord's Chipotle.

52:20.840 --> 52:23.000
And just kind of be satisfied with what we get.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.920
Appreciate every day.

52:24.920 --> 52:25.720
Every day is a gift.

52:25.720 --> 52:26.840
That's why it's called the present.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.040
Maybe the centaurs deserve to win.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.040
I think the centaurs deserve to win.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.720
I think it's time to give someone else a shot.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.000
Give someone else a chance.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.040
Good house we screwed.

52:36.040 --> 52:37.640
We've already screwed this pooch.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.320
I think it's time to give somebody else a chance

52:39.320 --> 52:39.960
running things.

52:40.680 --> 52:41.800
I'm talking about these centaurs.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.560
I cannot stop thinking about a side saddle centaur.

52:45.560 --> 52:51.480
That is the most grisly life I could ever, ever envision.

52:51.480 --> 52:52.680
Horsehead human body.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.560
I mean, good.

52:56.120 --> 52:57.000
That's good.

52:57.000 --> 52:57.560
It's good.

52:58.280 --> 52:59.480
Yeah, you never really think about that.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.480
The perfect blend probably took quite a few generations

53:03.480 --> 53:04.440
of experimentation.

53:06.440 --> 53:10.200
Well, folks, that's going to do it for us.

53:10.200 --> 53:10.520
Oh, shit.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.360
That was like 25 minutes of horse talk.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.440
That's our whole episode.

53:14.440 --> 53:15.800
We hope you enjoyed this discussion

53:15.800 --> 53:17.240
because it was half the show.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.240
And the ones before it also were there.

53:20.040 --> 53:24.440
Hey, listen, I'm going to be doing Sawbones live

53:24.440 --> 53:25.480
in Philadelphia.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.400
And I would really like it.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.560
It's going to be next or this coming weekend,

53:29.560 --> 53:30.600
I guess, by the time you listen to this,

53:30.600 --> 53:32.040
if you would come out and check that.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.240
What day is that?

53:33.240 --> 53:35.400
That is going to be Sunday.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.920
And you can get tickets.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.120
The 16th or the 9th?

53:40.120 --> 53:41.800
Because this is coming out on the 10th.

53:41.800 --> 53:42.840
Yeah, it's the 16th.

53:42.840 --> 53:43.640
Sunday the 16th.

53:43.640 --> 53:44.360
Okay, okay.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.760
It's going to be at 2 p.m. at the Trocadero Theater.

53:46.760 --> 53:49.480
Tickets are like $24.50, I think.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.720
Sunday, July 16th.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.560
That's part of the Philly Podcast Festival.

53:53.560 --> 53:55.160
Sawbones is going to be live.

53:55.160 --> 53:58.680
And you can get tickets at bit.ly forward slash Sawbones Philly.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.360
Come out and say hi.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.080
It should be fun.

54:01.080 --> 54:01.960
It's in the middle of the afternoon.

54:01.960 --> 54:02.920
It's an all ages show.

54:03.800 --> 54:06.360
No swearing to the best of our ability.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.720
And Flophouse is going to be there too.

54:09.720 --> 54:11.720
So get tickets to see them.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.120
And come out and see me.

54:15.960 --> 54:20.920
We are also, of course, doing our live shows at San Diego Comic Con

54:20.920 --> 54:22.360
coming up in just a couple weeks.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.840
So if you have questions for the My Brother, My Brother, and Me show,

54:24.840 --> 54:29.240
make sure to send them in with the subject SDCC live show.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.760
And maybe we'll see you there as we're walking around and stuff.

54:33.480 --> 54:35.160
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

54:35.160 --> 54:37.000
for these for our theme song, It's a Departure,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.240
which is a song off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.600
It's a very, very good song.

54:40.600 --> 54:41.160
Very good album.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.800
We're very grateful that we're able to use it here on this show.

Right and hi, Zoe Kinski.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.320
It's from Yahoo Answers user Christian who asks,

55:15.560 --> 55:17.960
Is Minecraft based on a true story?

55:21.000 --> 55:22.520
My name is Justin McElroy.

How many times has this happened to you?

55:53.240 --> 55:57.480
Oh man, if only I knew whether it was better to be too hot or too cold

55:57.480 --> 56:01.000
or who the best James Bond was, that girl would have gone out with me.
