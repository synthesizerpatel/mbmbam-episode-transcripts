00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:16.000 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:47.840
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern

00:47.840 --> 00:54.960
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm your

00:54.960 --> 01:00.480
sweet baby brother, Griffin McGregor. Uh, welcome. We made it. First of all, if you're listening to

01:00.480 --> 01:13.200
this, we made it. I 12 o' one a.m. All my skin fell off. New skin, 2017, new fresh skin. We cannot

01:13.200 --> 01:21.200
begin this episode in earnest without talking about earnest scared new year. Scared new year?

01:21.200 --> 01:26.400
Is that what you said? That's one of the ones that didn't come out, but it was filmed and edited

01:26.400 --> 01:31.680
and just had some posts, some like color correction to do, but they just didn't make it out in the

01:31.680 --> 01:36.400
theaters because there wasn't a marketing budget for it. And also his dick was like all over this

01:36.400 --> 01:44.880
new year. Yeah, we, uh, so we need to talk about, uh, what this year is called. We've had many

01:44.880 --> 01:50.080
different suggestions and we need to settle it before we can begin our episode proper.

01:50.080 --> 01:56.080
Okay. Okay. I have some here that I've jotted down. Um, let me give them to you.

01:56.640 --> 02:03.520
Okay. Uh, I'll just run through them and then we can discuss them all ad nauseum. Um, 20 even teen

02:03.520 --> 02:10.240
restoring balance. 20 given teen. Okay. Well, hold on. Let's talk about, let's talk about the

02:10.240 --> 02:14.640
discreet ways in which the, your suggestions are bad before we move on to like another one.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.720
I can't holistically talk about how they're bad. I need to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I see. All right.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.160
Yeah. Yeah. Let's tear me down bit by bit. New year, new year. Uh huh. Uh, 20 even teen

02:25.120 --> 02:31.120
is it's was the, I don't think the last year was imbalanced as much as it was just extraordinarily

02:31.120 --> 02:36.800
bad. And I don't even think that suggesting that like if there had been good stuff ticket to like

02:36.800 --> 02:44.240
for each bad for every, you know, famous Harry Potter diehard character actor who passed away.

02:44.240 --> 02:49.760
Hey, if you received a $100 check in the mail, I don't think, I don't think that the balance was

02:49.760 --> 02:54.320
the issue last year. I think it just stunk. That's fair. That's fair. And that was one of

02:54.320 --> 02:59.120
the more esoteric ones. I realized that because restoring balance was that me. I get that. What

02:59.120 --> 03:04.800
about 20 given teen helping when you can? Still doesn't rhyme with seven, does it?

03:04.800 --> 03:08.800
Well, we got to get away from the rhymes with seven because then our options are 20 heaven teen,

03:08.800 --> 03:14.960
which may be it or 20 Kevin teen or 20 Devon teen. Well, this one, this one was, uh,

03:14.960 --> 03:19.360
suggested by a listener named Rachel. And I really liked it. 20 Reven teen. Reven on the end.

03:19.360 --> 03:24.480
Kick it into high gear. Yeah. I feel like we need to get,

03:25.680 --> 03:32.240
last year's was a fucking disaster building bridges. I think it was too esoteric. It was

03:32.240 --> 03:36.560
too abstract. And so people didn't know how the fuck to do it. Even though I thought it was pretty

03:36.560 --> 03:42.880
clear. Just like be cool for once. I thought it was pretty clear, but apparently not. I think

03:42.880 --> 03:47.600
our instructions can't just be like, rev it up. It has to be like, go donate your money and time

03:47.600 --> 03:55.760
to this place. Like go treat your body right with this specific like juice cleanse. What about this

03:55.760 --> 04:01.200
one? And this, if you have problems with rhymes, this might bother you, but 20 sweating teen

04:01.200 --> 04:08.560
getting fit. That's not even a thing. It's close though. Also, I don't have sweat glands in my body

04:08.560 --> 04:14.720
and you know that I have a special spray bottle I carry around a spritz myself with. So thank you,

04:14.720 --> 04:19.760
Travis. Now I'm thinking about my spritz bottle and all the many, many sort of like social snafus

04:19.760 --> 04:28.400
it's gotten me into. Joseph Gordon Levitan celebrating the works of JGL. Yeah, we're getting

04:28.400 --> 04:33.280
closer. That's what I thought. I wanted something that was like, yeah, you could mark that off a

04:33.280 --> 04:37.760
list. You know what I mean? Like I did watch the complete third rock from the sun today and I feel

04:37.760 --> 04:42.160
great. Yeah. Well, Travis, this means that you would have to watch and like Looper and I don't

04:42.160 --> 04:47.920
think that's, yeah. Well, maybe it's time to, you know, give it a second chance and appreciate the

04:47.920 --> 04:54.640
amazing work that JGL does in it, even if I don't like the massive plot holes. Well, I have one to

04:54.640 --> 05:03.200
suggest. How about this? Hey, all right. 20 raven teen. We've all got ravens. Now here's what I said.

05:03.200 --> 05:10.320
Here's the thing about it is by the end of the year, everybody's got a sort of pet raven.

05:10.880 --> 05:16.960
So we're talking about a one to one human raven ratio. Yeah, we got to find a lot of ravens. We

05:16.960 --> 05:24.000
have to bond with them. We have to train them in the ways of old. The bonding has to take place.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.720
But 20 raven teen subtitle, everybody's got ravens. Everybody's got ravens. I like it. I'll tell you

05:30.720 --> 05:37.600
why. They got long, smooth beaks. Now, the problem, Justin, is going to be educating the masses on the

05:37.600 --> 05:42.560
difference between ravens and crows. Yeah. Because I think that that's probably a very common issue

05:42.560 --> 05:47.120
with me and everyone else. Well, it's pretty, actually, it's pretty easy to tell the difference.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.600
If you see a crow, you think there's a black bird. If you see a raven, you think, oh, God,

05:51.600 --> 05:56.400
something's terribly wrong. Oh, if you see a raven, it's like, oh, oh, no. Oh, no. What's happened

05:56.400 --> 06:03.040
here? This is very, very bad. I'll tell you what, this is going to be very confusing for raven Simone,

06:03.040 --> 06:07.840
isn't it? Yeah, a little bit. Because she's going to be very motivating. This is my impression of

06:07.840 --> 06:14.720
her in this year at Trader Joe's. Yeah. What did you? Oh, was it? Okay. Sorry. I thought you were

06:14.720 --> 06:19.920
talking to me. It was the bird again. It's okay. It happens a lot this year. Thanks McElroy brothers.

06:19.920 --> 06:27.120
What if in the process of 20 raven team, we discovered that there is actually one raven for

06:27.120 --> 06:34.000
every human, but you have to find like your one, like maybe your raven lives in like Africa. And

06:34.000 --> 06:39.440
it's like, well, there aren't, I don't know where my raven is. Where's the raven for Travis? The

06:39.440 --> 06:44.640
raven that is meant to be with you will have to find you because it can fly. Oh, right. I mean,

06:44.640 --> 06:50.480
the burden is on the raven for sure to find it's human, but it's not 20 human team. Everyone gets

06:50.480 --> 06:58.000
humans Justin. No, that's not, that's no good. That's no good. What about, what about 20 Bevan

06:58.000 --> 07:04.480
team? I like 20 Bevan team. 20 Bevan team is very good because it can be, it lends itself to a party

07:04.480 --> 07:09.440
atmosphere. You know, of course. Yeah, but there's people out there who don't, who don't like to

07:09.440 --> 07:17.120
enjoy, but there's a flip side. Nobody's drinking enough water. 20 Bevan team. Are you, are you

07:17.120 --> 07:24.000
watching your water intake? Hey, is it time to cut out those sugary sodas? 20 Bevan team is not

07:24.000 --> 07:31.040
about indulgence. It's about analyzation and awareness of your beverage consumption. 2017

07:31.040 --> 07:39.600
Standrated. How about this one? 20 Serpentine. Stay, stay frosty. Like stay on your, kind of stay

07:39.600 --> 07:44.160
on your toes a little bit. Like keep them, it can be a lot of different things, but like keep them

07:44.160 --> 07:48.880
guessing. Like they're going to be, they're going to be looking at where you're going and you've got

07:48.880 --> 07:54.480
to juke that expectation at every point. So it's not, it's not even like, it doesn't even have to

07:54.480 --> 08:00.960
be associated with like a, a particularly, you know, paranoid worldview or whatever. It's just

08:00.960 --> 08:05.760
like, keep them guessing. Keep, keep fucking surprising them. Yeah. Put that, put that into

08:05.760 --> 08:11.360
like a four or five word kind of summary, Griffin. 20 Serpentine. Keep them guessing.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.640
Keep them guessing. I like that. 20, cause this, it could be so many different parts of your life.

08:16.640 --> 08:21.520
First of all, if, if the authority's trying to keep you down, you can keep them guessing like

08:21.520 --> 08:25.920
that, but it can also just be like, if things are feeling a little bit stale and you're in a rut,

08:25.920 --> 08:32.160
it's because you've been zagging for too long. It is time to zig. What about weaving and or bobbing?

08:33.040 --> 08:37.920
I mean, I guess if you're playing paintball, I guess if you're playing paintball, then yes,

08:37.920 --> 08:43.680
it's like a very good year name. Cause you're like, hmm. Sorry, I was just going to suggest a

08:43.680 --> 08:48.320
different one. No, I mean, I feel like I nailed it, but let's see what you've got. We'll come

08:48.320 --> 08:54.480
back around, Griffin. Yeah. What about, I know I've seen like, I, this is going to seem like

08:54.480 --> 09:01.680
I'm in a bit of a rut, but what about 20 Rivendine? Let's all appreciate the excellent sequel to Mist.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.800
Yeah. Now here's the thing about 20 Rivendine. Riven's a great game. Sure. Sure. Everybody

09:06.800 --> 09:16.080
knows that and appreciates it. But did you know, but did you know 1997 was the original release of

09:16.080 --> 09:22.800
Riven? That's right. We would be marking the 20th anniversary of the excellent sequel to Mist, Riven.

09:22.800 --> 09:29.840
Yeah. And that's something we can do. Yeah, we can do that. That's something we can fucking,

09:29.840 --> 09:36.400
nobody can build a bridge, but maybe we can all get on fucking Steam or GOG or some shit and just

09:36.400 --> 09:41.600
download Riven and appreciate it. I love this, Justin, because there is a very quantifiable

09:41.600 --> 09:49.200
success rate here, and that is if by the end of 2017, we effectively get greenlit a sequel to

09:49.200 --> 09:54.000
Riven. If suddenly the sales on Steam- They've made like 50 other Mist games. So many other Mist games have happened.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.320
Yeah, there's a lot of Mist games. But is there a Riven 2 where it's just like R and then

09:58.320 --> 10:04.960
Roman numeral I I V E N? But then somebody sees it and they're like, Riven? Well, yeah, because it's a

10:04.960 --> 10:10.560
combination of Riven and Soul Reaver. I mean, they're back, Rand Miller's back in the mix. He

10:10.560 --> 10:16.800
made a production this year, so he's still in the game. And they did just release a masterpiece

10:16.800 --> 10:23.440
edition of Mist, like real Mist, a few years ago. Riven's on your iPad now, by the way.

10:23.440 --> 10:28.400
Shit, yeah. Just go get it. Just go play Riven. Oh boy, have I got it.

10:28.400 --> 10:38.480
20-sextenteen. Time to bust one.

10:40.160 --> 10:45.600
We don't need more excuse to talk about sexual things on this program. How about 20-sextenteen?

10:46.160 --> 10:50.480
Navigating by the stars. Navigating by the stars while busting one.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.480
No.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
No.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.480
No.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.480
20, 20-serv-en-teen.

10:54.480 --> 11:05.920
And this can be like, go serve your community, but also like diss somebody out on the playground

11:05.920 --> 11:07.280
when they got served.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.280
Ooh.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.280
Hmm.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.280
20-serv-en-teen's interesting.

11:10.280 --> 11:15.120
Because it also sounds like you're saying it with some sort of untraceable accent.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.120
20-serv-en-teen.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.120
I kind of like that.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.480
20-serv-en-teen, let's all talk with accents.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
I love this, Griffin.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
Right?

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
20-serv-en-teen, yo.

11:25.480 --> 11:29.120
I love 20-serv-en-teen.

11:29.120 --> 11:34.700
I love this, Griffin, because we've never before had a year where you can pick and choose

11:34.700 --> 11:39.880
whether you want it to be a helping others or insulting others year.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.960
Yeah, you're either serving people or serving people.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.400
Okay, but I don't want that level of, I don't want it to be binary like that.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.160
You introduced it, though, Griffin.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.240
You can't put that tiger back in the cage.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.680
As a joke, because I thought we had nailed it with 20-serv-en-teen, and so I thought

11:58.680 --> 12:00.720
all these other ones were just gonna be goofy-goofy-mops.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.720
Hmm.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.720
Here's the-

12:02.720 --> 12:04.520
I mean, we're just brainstorming right now.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
This is just spitballing.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.240
I don't care if it takes a full hour.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.680
I'll do this for an entire hour.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.680
Yeah, fuck it.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.680
I don't give a shit.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.680
Hey, listen to this.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Let me hit you guys with this.

12:12.680 --> 12:16.160
Like, 20-serv-en-teen, Travis, can you make a Google Doc?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.360
Can you just open a Google Doc, Travis?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.360
Sure.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.360
Sure.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.880
I'll just make a Google Doc, Justin.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.640
Okay, so I should do it?

12:27.640 --> 12:28.640
Yeah.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.640
Is that what you're telling me?

12:29.640 --> 12:30.640
Yeah.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.640
Yeah, okay.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.680
Let me just call, let me just call Sergey and have him launch a Google Doc for us, I

12:35.680 --> 12:36.680
guess.

12:36.680 --> 12:41.280
Okay, so I'm opening up a Google Doc.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.280
Hmm.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.920
And put at the top in bold, 20-serv-en-teen, keep them guessing.

12:45.920 --> 12:50.480
I have another one that I came up with, we put out a tweet too, but I came up with one

12:50.480 --> 12:51.480
out of my brain.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.800
Is it in the Google document?

12:52.800 --> 12:57.100
Because if not, it will not be officially considered for consideration.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.480
I'm going to type it in as I say it.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.240
Well, that doesn't sound like an audio product that we can all believe in.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.240
It's 20-slev-en-teen.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.800
I thought Lucky Number Slevin was an okay movie.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.800
It was a good flick.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.800
It was a good flick.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.920
Josh Hartnett did a good job in that flick, and you know who else did?

13:10.920 --> 13:11.920
Yeah.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.920
Bruno.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
Hello.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
Just subtitle, it was a good flick.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
It was a good flick.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
It was a good flick.

13:16.920 --> 13:22.520
A bit confusing there at the end, and I thought Lucy Lou was a little bit underutilized, but

13:22.520 --> 13:26.400
Lucky Number Slevin, also maybe a bad name for a picture.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
Yeah.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.000
And via the transitive property, a bad name for a year.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.360
Or is it such a bad name for a movie that it's a great name for a year?

13:35.360 --> 13:36.360
Oops.

13:36.360 --> 13:41.880
Now, I want to throw something out there and just let me know if this is grabbing you guys

13:41.880 --> 13:42.880
at all.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.480
It's about 20-elven-teen.

13:47.480 --> 13:55.280
So that's about just embracing nature, living forever, and sweet bow tricks.

13:55.280 --> 14:01.080
So those are the three things, is embrace nature, live forever, sweet bow tricks.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Oh, hold on.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
Wait.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
What was that middle one?

14:04.080 --> 14:05.080
Live forever.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.080
Wait.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.260
Hold on.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.120
Do elves live forever?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.120
Fuck yeah, dude.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.120
They're not real, Travis.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.120
They live as long as I fucking say they do.

14:12.120 --> 14:20.680
Like, I can get a good looking windswept blonde braided hair and clothes made out of leaves

14:20.680 --> 14:24.800
and shooting a bow extremely good and never dead.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.800
Ooh.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
Never die.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.800
That's the life.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
I like this one.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.800
That's the life for me.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.800
I like this one.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
We put out the tweet.

14:31.800 --> 14:37.320
So Amy suggested, and I like this, 27 clean, cleanse us, wash away the trash here.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.400
But that can be any, that could be like 25th clean, 29th clean.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.400
Yeah, fair.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.400
That's fair.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
But I like it.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
I do like it.

14:44.400 --> 14:51.720
Um, here's, somebody named Tab1Lamo on Twitter just said, dust off them old boots.

14:51.720 --> 14:59.720
Which, let's, don't fucking, don't fucking laugh at our fucking listeners.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.600
Dust off them old boots.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.800
It's not, what year is it?

15:03.800 --> 15:07.320
Dust off them, it's, it's January 2nd.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.680
Dust off them old boots.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.440
I'm not, like, I cannot consider 27 clean.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.560
I'm sorry, Travis.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.580
I'm removing it for consideration because it does not play on seven.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.360
You can't just leave seven in there.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.360
Okay.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.400
How about Kelsey said, 20 never teen, no teens allowed.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.160
I am, they get everything else, so.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.160
Yeah.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.960
I do like 20 never teen, no teens allowed.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.920
I do think, because I think that's fun because I feel like we've bent over backwards in our

15:34.920 --> 15:37.640
six years to try to bring the teens in.

15:37.640 --> 15:41.240
And I think it's fun to finally turn our backs on them.

15:41.240 --> 15:46.680
You can attract teens to your comedy podcast in one hand, and you can shit in the other,

15:46.680 --> 15:51.040
and at the end of the day, not many teens are gonna, you will not get that demographic,

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
unfortunately.

15:52.040 --> 15:57.840
How do you, how do you guys feel about 2011 teen, the year of baking?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
Because I, my, here's my fear.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.120
Here's pluses and minuses.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.680
One, I got a bread machine for Christmas.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.680
Hello.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.680
That, that's a plus.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.680
Okay, that's huge.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.560
I've already made a crunchy loaf, okay.

16:09.560 --> 16:14.280
I made a good loaf, and you know what, this afternoon, I've got a big block of my Google

16:14.280 --> 16:18.920
Cal, my Gcal, and it just says cinnamon raisin bread, because that's how it's gonna go.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.720
Did Sergei set that up for you, or?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.040
Yeah, Sergei set that up for me.

16:22.040 --> 16:28.040
Now here's the flip on this one, is I feel like Great British Bake Off pretty much kicked

16:28.040 --> 16:35.200
off like the biggest baking year ever, like probably 2015, is when that hit in a major

16:35.200 --> 16:36.200
way.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.200
I feel like I missed the zeitgeist in a major way.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.920
I feel like I missed the zeitgeist on that one, so I'm, maybe 2011 teen, the year of

16:41.920 --> 16:44.720
baking is like not great.

16:44.720 --> 16:52.400
Aaron Keyes suggested 20 Estefan teen, Rhythm is Gonna Get You, which I, I like this, this

16:52.400 --> 16:58.200
could just be like, listen to more, listen to more music, especially this specific, very

16:58.200 --> 17:02.160
specific music, listen to it, please.

17:02.160 --> 17:08.800
Without any clarification, Zach suggested 20 Schlepping teen, which I like, because

17:08.800 --> 17:13.480
like, does that mean like, we're moving this year, or is it just like, get out there, walk

17:13.480 --> 17:17.240
around, I'll move this from place to place all year long.

17:17.240 --> 17:25.360
Aitsgray suggested 2016 too, which I'm not very happy about, I'm not excited about that

17:25.360 --> 17:28.320
as an opportunity.

17:28.320 --> 17:36.640
Jared suggested 20 Kevin clean, so this is the year where we get all our Kevins, our

17:36.640 --> 17:40.760
Kevin hearts, our Kevin Arnold's fictional man, and we get them together and we just

17:40.760 --> 17:43.760
scrub them all down.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.400
Becky suggested 20 Jepsen teen.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.960
That's, that's every year for me, thank you.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.760
Also, I very much doubt that she's gonna put anything out this year.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.040
I would be overjoyed if she did, but I'm just saying between emotion and then the b-sides,

17:56.040 --> 17:58.400
it is unlikely.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.960
20 Shaven teen?

17:59.960 --> 18:00.960
Like get rid of the beards?

18:00.960 --> 18:01.960
That's from you?

18:01.960 --> 18:02.960
No.

18:02.960 --> 18:03.960
No, Travis needs that beard.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.760
That's my brand.

18:05.760 --> 18:10.840
Well, I think that's all the suggestions we got, so this was not as rich and deep a vein

18:10.840 --> 18:13.400
as we thought it was going to be.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.280
20 17 Magazine?

18:16.280 --> 18:19.280
That's from Trey Smith.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.960
Okay.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.960
I feel like...

18:24.960 --> 18:28.760
Somebody said 27 B's.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.560
Well, so...

18:30.560 --> 18:31.560
Fine.

18:31.560 --> 18:32.560
Like there's...

18:32.560 --> 18:35.840
That's from a radiated snake on 27 B's.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.800
I feel like some people aren't taking the exercise very seriously and some of those

18:38.800 --> 18:41.240
people are on our podcast.

18:41.240 --> 18:46.120
Oh, I like it.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
I don't know.

18:47.120 --> 18:52.360
Okay, so let's look at what we have on the official list right now.

18:52.360 --> 18:58.280
We have, and we may be able to eliminate some of these as we go, 20 servant teen, serve

18:58.280 --> 19:04.120
your community or serve your community, Joseph Gordon Levitt teen, I feel like it's not going

19:04.120 --> 19:05.120
to fly.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.120
Well...

19:06.120 --> 19:07.120
Are we agreed on...

19:07.120 --> 19:08.120
All right.

19:08.120 --> 19:12.000
Yes, I will sacrifice George, but everyone can celebrate it in their own way.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.200
It's just not the official year.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
I understand that.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.320
Do we need to settle on one?

19:15.320 --> 19:18.400
Can we just let people sort of embrace whichever sort of...

19:18.400 --> 19:21.520
I feel like this is something that people really rely on.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.520
You're right.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
You're right.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.720
To help set a path for them.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.440
And that's why it's so important to have something that is...

19:27.440 --> 19:35.920
The problem with, okay, let's review, just do a quick recap to bring us up to speed here.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.360
The first was Zolo, right?

19:38.360 --> 19:39.360
Yes.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.360
Zolo was 2010.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.280
Zolo was 2010 and that was other people called it Zolo first.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.460
That was not in any way ours.

19:47.460 --> 19:53.120
And I guess that just meant like Yolo, like go do the damn thing.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.240
Now in 20...

19:54.240 --> 19:55.680
Did we have a 2011?

19:55.680 --> 19:59.280
I thought we called it Zol, but I don't remember having like a specific...

19:59.280 --> 20:01.800
I remember calling it Zol at least once, but I don't think...

20:01.800 --> 20:03.680
I don't remember if we had...

20:03.680 --> 20:05.480
I don't remember.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.640
Now I do remember...

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
Now 2012.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.640
Get it.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.640
Right?

20:10.640 --> 20:11.640
Get it.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
That was...

20:12.640 --> 20:13.640
Was that get it?

20:13.640 --> 20:14.640
Doing it in 20 does.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.640
20 does.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.640
That's right.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.640
We do it.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.640
We do it.

20:18.640 --> 20:22.840
Then it was 20 dirt, dig it up, get it out there.

20:22.840 --> 20:27.360
I feel like we didn't 20 dirt it very well, but that was what it is.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.360
That was what it was about.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.760
That was what it was about.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.760
2014...

20:31.760 --> 20:32.760
Was 2014.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.200
No, it couldn't have possibly been...

20:35.200 --> 20:37.840
We couldn't have done that if not for 2013.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.240
2014 was 20 forward.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.240
Right.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
That was just about...

20:42.240 --> 20:43.240
All about momentum.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.240
Momentum.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.240
Keeping up.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
That was the theme.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.240
That was the theme.

20:47.240 --> 20:50.720
2015 was probably the best.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.720
If I could say...

20:51.720 --> 20:52.720
Yeah.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.720
Yeah.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.720
That was the best.

20:54.720 --> 20:59.000
2015 was just about grifs.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.920
2015, 2015 the con is on.

21:01.920 --> 21:02.920
Right.

21:02.920 --> 21:07.120
And what I loved about that year was it definitely was going to happen.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.080
So it did provide a little...

21:09.080 --> 21:14.000
It lets you get your own grifs and then acknowledge other grifs that were happening all around

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
you.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yes.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.840
And I remember I married an old person and I got all their rubies and emeralds.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.280
So it was a very successful year for me.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.280
Yeah.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.000
20 grif team was great.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.840
2016 is where things start to go awry, I think.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.720
It was well intentioned building bridges, but the problem was nobody did the dag gun

21:36.720 --> 21:37.720
thing.

21:37.720 --> 21:48.040
You know the problem with 2016 building bridges is that before grifs, momentum, getting it,

21:48.040 --> 21:51.520
digging it up, digging the dirt out, those are all individual activities.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.520
Right.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.560
Which I think you can do on your own as like a guiding principle for yourself.

21:56.560 --> 22:02.920
2016 was like look around, like you have to have another willing participant to build

22:02.920 --> 22:03.920
a bridge.

22:03.920 --> 22:04.920
Yeah.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.560
You need to build a bridge from both sides.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.560
You know what I mean?

22:07.560 --> 22:08.560
Here's-

22:08.560 --> 22:09.560
Yeah.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.560
I don't know if that's how bridges work.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.560
I think it is.

22:11.560 --> 22:16.400
I think they start in the middle actually and then they go out to the side.

22:16.400 --> 22:20.600
So here's all I'm saying because we're also getting a lot of suggestions from people who

22:20.600 --> 22:23.760
are like the apocalypse and it's like no we don't, no come on.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.360
You know we don't fuck with that.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.600
You know us better than that.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.060
And we know you better than that.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.320
And that's a narrative construct guys.

22:31.320 --> 22:34.900
Stop thinking of things in storybook terms, okay?

22:34.900 --> 22:38.960
Live in the real world here with us where we're all just like trying to get fucking

22:38.960 --> 22:39.960
through it.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.960
We're all just trying to get through it.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
Okay.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.760
And so I don't think there's anything wrong with having a little bit of that, well

22:45.760 --> 22:53.700
last year didn't work out so great so let's just be a little bit on the fucking balls

22:53.700 --> 22:58.800
of our feet, on our fucking toes, ready to just oop, ah, oop, tried to get me didn't

22:58.800 --> 22:59.800
you?

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
Tried to fuck me again didn't you?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.720
Well 2016 taught me a valuable lesson about getting fucked and oop, oop, you missed me

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
a little bit.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.160
That's why serpentine pattern baby.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.520
Keep them guessing.

23:09.520 --> 23:13.760
Okay I'm going to, I want to say I'm on board with 2017.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.840
One, I think it is the most clever wordplay we've done so far.

23:17.840 --> 23:26.460
And two, I like the idea of encouraging dodging rather than like you know like digging in

23:26.460 --> 23:27.760
for a fight.

23:27.760 --> 23:33.160
It's like it's, if I might reference the Kingkiller Chronicles, it's you know it's

23:33.160 --> 23:35.000
the leaf on the wind.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
What's it?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
That's Firefly.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.560
You're doing a bunch of nerdy stuff right now and I'm into all of it but.

23:40.560 --> 23:44.600
But it's that idea of rather than like standing your ground just like be the willow, you know

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
what I mean?

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Yes.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.960
Like flow with the wind and like just avoid the, it's that Neo shit.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.360
It could reference another nerdy property.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.160
Just do like, do the Matrix.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.240
Watch all the Matrix movies.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.360
It's that idea of like rather than having to fight you just don't have to, you don't

24:01.360 --> 24:02.740
have to dodge bullets.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.740
But it's not just that.

24:03.740 --> 24:04.800
It's not just about the fight.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.720
It's about trying new things because maybe you'll be into it.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.720
Keep them guessing.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.360
Like yesterday I watched all of an anime in one day.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.200
That ain't me but everybody's talking about this, this Yuri on Ice, ice skating anime

24:17.200 --> 24:20.480
and I was like I'm gonna watch this whole thing even though it's not my thing.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.480
And now it is my thing.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.480
I incorporated a new thing.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.480
Keep them guessing.

24:23.480 --> 24:27.520
Go left when they think you're gonna go right because they try, they're gonna try to fuck

24:27.520 --> 24:28.520
you again.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
They are.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.520
I promise.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
I don't want to.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.520
You tried to meet them halfway last year.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.520
No.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.520
That's the thing.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.800
You tried to meet them halfway last year and this year they're gonna expect that again

24:37.800 --> 24:39.600
and they ain't gonna get it.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.280
Just watch an, watch an anime.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.640
Kiss it, kiss somebody under a bridge.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.600
That's not you but do it.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.240
I'm gonna take horseback riding lessons this year.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.720
Travis is gonna ride a fucking horse.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.720
What the fuck?

24:49.720 --> 24:54.680
I'm gonna take Taekwondo, there's a Taekwondo class place near my dojo.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.680
I don't know.

24:55.680 --> 24:56.680
I'm not in it yet.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.680
Yeah.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.360
But there's a, there's a place near my house that does Taekwondo classes and I think you

25:01.360 --> 25:04.800
get two geese for like 30 bones is a pretty good deal.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.840
I think I'm just gonna do that.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.840
Nobody would expect that.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.840
Keep on guessing.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.840
I'm gonna do Taekwondo to a horse.

25:10.840 --> 25:16.800
I'm gonna invite a horse to the, to my dojo and then I'm gonna spar with him in the Taekwondo

25:16.800 --> 25:18.960
tradition.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.960
Keep on guessing.

25:19.960 --> 25:20.960
I'm always gonna see that.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.520
What the fuck is a horse doing in here?

25:22.520 --> 25:23.520
Uh huh.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
Uh huh.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.280
I zigged when you thought I was gonna zag, didn't I?

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
Taekwondo!

25:27.280 --> 25:31.160
And that's the noise I make when I do my kicks, my Taekwondo kicks.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.160
I love, okay, I'm totally into this.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.600
I feel like after 2016, this is the year we need.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
Yeah.

25:38.600 --> 25:45.000
20 Serpentine is the year that we, and, and it's, 20 Serpentine, keep on guessing.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.880
I'm not saying, I'm not, I don't want to embrace a policy of distrusting everyone.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.400
I'm just saying, keep on guessing.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.400
Make yourself untrusted.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.280
No, look, here's what I like, here's what I like about this though.

25:57.280 --> 26:02.280
Maybe the guessing, it could also be like, you've always argued with your aunt about

26:02.280 --> 26:07.120
politics and at like, you know, the next big gig together, your aunt brings up politics

26:07.120 --> 26:10.800
and you just say, oh, it's a very interesting point, I'll have to consider that.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.280
And your aunt's like, uh, uh, uh, my whole thing.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.240
I thought we were going to argue about this for two hours.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.320
Uh, I didn't prepare anything else.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.400
Now we have to just like talk like humans.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.400
Boom.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.400
And then.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400
Keep on guessing.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.880
And then you do Taekwondo to your uncle right, right there in the room.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.560
What are you doing, Jeremy?

26:28.560 --> 26:34.160
Jeremy stop that zigzag, you eat a bunch of peanuts, but they thought you were allergic

26:34.160 --> 26:35.160
to peanuts.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.160
Boom.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.160
Keep them guessing.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.160
That's right.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.160
I am.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.160
This is the year I get over it.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.160
Hospital.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.160
Zigzag.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.160
Keep them guessing.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
I like this.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.160
20 Serpentine.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.160
Keep them guessing.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
Delete the rest of the list.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.160
Erase it.

26:48.160 --> 26:51.160
I feel like we all keep coming back to 20 Riven team.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.920
Let's appreciate Riven.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.920
And that, it is such a good game.

26:54.920 --> 27:02.320
And I, Justin, if I may, I think that what we should do is we have 20 Serpentine as the

27:02.320 --> 27:10.680
official year, but Joseph Gordon Levantine and 20 Riven team as the unofficial like media

27:10.680 --> 27:12.740
representation years.

27:12.740 --> 27:18.440
So it's like a play Riven while you watch third rock from the sun and keep them guessing.

27:18.440 --> 27:24.160
Um, I guess, uh, you can still participate in 20 Riven team.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
Okay.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.160
Okay.

27:26.160 --> 27:33.480
Now Griffin, I think in an effort to keep us guessing, just dropped a giant picture

27:33.480 --> 27:35.760
of Colin Mochrie into this G doc.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.760
Yeah.

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
Zigzag, baby.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.760
Y'all just got zagged on.

27:38.760 --> 27:43.760
Hey, are you guys hungry?

27:43.760 --> 27:49.240
Here's a zag nut bar.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.200
Didn't see that Colin Mochrie coming, did you?

27:52.200 --> 27:56.760
I guess Colin Mochrie is a good, the other thing I like about that and our years so frequently

27:56.760 --> 27:59.600
lack this is iconography.

27:59.600 --> 28:04.080
Just having Colin Mochrie is like a visual representation of keeping people guessing

28:04.080 --> 28:10.200
because I did not expect him to pop up, but when he did, I was very, very pleased.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.200
Okay.

28:11.200 --> 28:18.320
Now Colin Mochrie, a different picture of Colin Mochrie has now been inserted into the

28:18.320 --> 28:20.360
name of play Serpentine.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.320
I accidentally spliced the name, uh, so it says 20 Serpentine.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.320
Keep them guessing.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.320
Colin Mochrie.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.320
In.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.320
All right.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.320
This is good.

28:29.320 --> 28:33.360
Just tweet this exact screen cap right now and just tell people it's over.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.360
Yes.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.360
Yeah.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.360
All right.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.360
This is how we announce it.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.360
All right.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.360
Well, wait, no, this will spoil the whole episode.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.360
I feel like, or at least the first half of it.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.360
Okay.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.360
Well, that's fair.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.360
Sit on it.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.360
So it's a screen gap.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.360
Crap it.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.360
Crap it.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.360
But let's hold onto it.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.360
Let's go to the money zone.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.360
We got our year.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.080
We got our year folks, but let's get into the hard.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.080
It's important.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
Yeah, it's really important.

28:53.080 --> 28:56.100
It's basically one big piece of advice for the next 52 episodes.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.560
So, um, let's, let's do our damn thing.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.940
Oh, that's a picture of Colin Mochrie as a baby.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.800
Travis, you zagged on me, dog.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.820
All right.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.920
That's baby New Year.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.540
That's going to be the baby New Year for this year.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.540
Oh, yeah.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.080
Colin Mochrie is the baby New Year of this year.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
To the money zone.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.080
Let's go

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
Hey, you're hungry

29:28.040 --> 29:34.200
As it wasn't it wasn't rhetorical Griffin, okay, then no I just ate a big bowl of checks. Oh

29:35.320 --> 29:38.240
Well, could you foresee yourself getting hungry by this evening?

29:38.240 --> 29:43.560
No, do you know how like right after you eat a big bowl of checks you just have like a sour tummy? I don't know

29:43.560 --> 29:45.600
Why I keep eating these fucking things. I know I don't know

29:45.600 --> 29:48.960
I fucking keep eating it's cinnamon checks, and I see it on the shelf, and I think mmm

29:48.960 --> 29:53.080

29:53.080 --> 29:58.280

31:19.520 --> 31:25.080
Turned it off for like three or four weeks because we have a newborn and didn't think I was guy

31:25.080 --> 31:28.080
We didn't think we were gonna be cooking very much and our friends were gonna bring us a bunch of meals

31:28.880 --> 31:31.080
And now that we're getting back into it

31:31.080 --> 31:35.020

31:35.020 --> 31:40.880

34:21.540 --> 34:25.700
There's literally no way of knowing where we are in relation to his birthday

34:25.700 --> 34:29.940
It's impossible to tell but hey happy birthday whenever it is J-Dog

34:29.940 --> 34:38.780
I'm also boys have you been watching a ntm cycle 2.3. I think boys not in the house boys gone boys banished from house

34:40.080 --> 34:45.000
I have not I'm not interested without tie-tie, baby. Not and not interested at all

34:45.000 --> 34:49.080
It's pretty fucking fresh how how present is Tyra?

34:49.320 --> 34:55.440
She's in the first episode and she bounces on him pretty fucking hard, but then Rita Ora shows up along with a

34:55.440 --> 35:01.800
Man named law roach, and he's like he just he is just

35:03.280 --> 35:09.200
Unreserved with his criticism, but everybody's doing their absolute best there are no boys in the house

35:09.200 --> 35:14.160
It is missing a certain heat. I heard that they're there in the judgment room

35:14.560 --> 35:20.060
It's all glass windows, and there's just boys with their faces pressed up against it

35:20.060 --> 35:27.700
Like a like an impoverished child staring in a bakery window. Oh wait what crumbs is that accurate more or less?

35:27.700 --> 35:30.540
Yes, they all want to get a sniff of this fashion

35:30.980 --> 35:36.540
But they can't because boys have been banished from the house except for law roach law roach is the only boy in the house

35:37.100 --> 35:44.480
Griffin do you anticipate like a midseason twist where somebody finally checks like the crawlspace of the house and they've had a bad boy

38:50.080 --> 38:55.400
Hey, hey Deborah. These boys aren't doing any advice at all. This is a weird podcast

38:55.800 --> 39:03.160
Wendy's new spice of sriracha chicken sandwich takes sriracha to a whole new level this fucking thing, huh?

39:05.240 --> 39:12.200
No, I'm just like all I know about this is these dumbass commercials where it's like sriracha, how do you even say it? It's sriracha

39:12.520 --> 39:17.560
It's been around for a hundred years. What the fuck are you talking about? People started putting this on everything in like

39:17.560 --> 39:19.560
1991 sriracha

39:21.120 --> 39:28.120
So this one is a very special twofer and here's why it's so special in an in an attempt to build

39:28.320 --> 39:31.580
excitement about the spicy sriracha chicken sandwich

39:34.440 --> 39:36.720
Wendy's released put out to press release

39:38.440 --> 39:42.720
It's like Pokemon like Pokemon Sun and Moon one's got different words in it collect them all

39:42.720 --> 39:50.080
This is the first calling all sriracha lovers when he's gone all in sriracha on the debut of its new spicy

39:50.840 --> 39:57.320
Sriracha on the light on the what if it's what on the debut of its spicy sriracha chicken sandwich available for I know I said

39:57.320 --> 40:00.680
It with a T earlier get this is how this person would say it this character

40:01.040 --> 40:07.400
Available for a limited time the entire sandwich included the bun the cheese and of course the sauce is infused with sriracha

40:07.400 --> 40:13.640
Satisfying even the most die-hard fans of the flavorful red sauce in a way that only Wendy's can what starting with?

40:14.160 --> 40:18.960
Let me finish starting with the toasty sriracha infused bun a dollop of sriracha

40:18.960 --> 40:27.280
They only custom sriracha jack cheese and then sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha

40:27.280 --> 40:31.880
sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha and there's like

40:32.280 --> 40:36.360
That's the end of the fucking press release. You said it enough that it started to sound like Rochester

40:36.360 --> 40:37.480
so

40:37.480 --> 40:39.000
then

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
Sorry, was that a goof that it spiraled into madness or that was you know, that's literally what it says

40:45.200 --> 40:52.340
Okay, that was a 730 December 5th 9 a.m. December 5th 90 minutes later

40:52.720 --> 40:56.700
The fucking that the veil of that hilarious bit

40:57.320 --> 41:02.380
Is pulled away. Oh, I need I love it when they have to explain the joke of it

41:02.380 --> 41:07.860
Earlier today as we were overcome with excitement about our new

41:08.460 --> 41:11.340
spicy sriracha chicken sandwich and bacon sriracha fries

41:11.900 --> 41:18.420
Wendy's got carried away and issued an alert that looked more like the obsessed ramblings of a sriracha fanatic

41:19.060 --> 41:23.340
Anyone with similar love for sriracha can understand. It's just that good

41:23.700 --> 41:29.780
We've since pulled ourselves together and have provided all the details about our newest creation below

41:29.780 --> 41:32.500
Thanks for understanding because there's nothing

41:33.220 --> 41:34.740
funnier

41:34.740 --> 41:37.860
Than doing a bit and then 90 minutes later

41:38.580 --> 41:44.060
explaining what the bit was right so like now this this was so confusing because I was on as

41:44.460 --> 41:48.040
The weekend editor at snack attack sack

41:49.180 --> 41:52.620
Gov when this press for this first press release came out. It was like

41:53.220 --> 41:56.980
Jerry I don't know should I write it up as is because there's lots of key details missing

41:56.980 --> 42:00.300
I think it might be a joke, but I think somebody there might have some serious problems

42:00.300 --> 42:04.380
And then luckily I didn't publish it and then that second one came through and it was like whoof

42:04.500 --> 42:09.660
Thank God, but it was really unprofessional like they've lost the plot of her at Wendy's. I mean now

42:11.340 --> 42:15.020
Justin I would like to offer a different explanation

42:15.960 --> 42:17.060
Okay

42:17.060 --> 42:25.420
picture someone much like yourself working at Wendy's and your job is the social media outreach and then you get handed this press release that

42:25.420 --> 42:29.800
No joke has sriracha like just as a descriptor

42:30.700 --> 42:37.460
67 times. Yeah, and this is the last straw for you and you just you just fucking lose it

42:39.660 --> 42:43.780
This is the Wendy's version of all work and play me out a doll boy, okay

42:43.940 --> 42:49.460
That's very that's very possible and they were trying to run interference. Uh-huh. There's a funny joke

42:49.460 --> 42:53.600
Uh-huh, so don't take it from me

42:54.420 --> 42:58.740
Let's check in with Munch Squad patron saint Carl Laredo

42:59.380 --> 43:02.260
Vice president of marketing and advertising at Wendy's

43:04.220 --> 43:09.560
What's he named as a baby like this guy's gonna run a fucking dirty ass fast-food company someday

43:09.580 --> 43:16.180
We got a column Carl Laredo like there's no way around it this I believe is Carl Laredo second appearance on the squad

43:16.180 --> 43:21.460
Mm-hmm. Don't correct me if I'm wrong sriracha lovers having a rational love for this sauce

43:21.460 --> 43:27.540
So we knew we had to find a way to properly honor that devotion with the spicy sriracha chicken sandwich

43:28.380 --> 43:35.420
Says Carl Laredo vice president of marketing and advertising Wendy's we did more than just spread or drizzle sriracha on a chicken sandwich

43:36.420 --> 43:39.660
Went all in and infused sriracha in the entire sandwich

43:39.660 --> 43:46.940
Delivering the maximum amount of flavor from the first bite until the last now. Here's what's enjoyable to me

43:47.220 --> 43:49.980
about the spicy sriracha chicken sandwich

43:51.260 --> 43:59.940
There's sriracha in the aioli. There's sriracha in the bun. There's sriracha in the cheese. There's sriracha in the chicken now the one thing

44:01.700 --> 44:07.500
Sidebar if I could with you the one thing they left some out put on it. Yeah leave one

44:07.500 --> 44:13.860
There's one element that you missed. I think it it wasn't that that good old-fashioned applewood smoked bacon

44:14.420 --> 44:16.820
Cuz that's in that's that's in it. Yeah

44:17.700 --> 44:23.760
The one thing about it is the sriracha fucking sriracha. Is that right?

44:28.100 --> 44:30.100
What is this stinky ketchup

44:30.100 --> 44:36.860
It's fun rooster sauce. What is this rooster sauce? It doesn't smell shit

44:36.860 --> 44:39.420
It's got lumps in it unlike smooth. Ketchup

44:40.660 --> 44:42.340
sriracha

44:42.340 --> 44:44.340
idiots

44:44.500 --> 44:49.780
People love this stuff. Should we put it on a sandwich? No, no, we should put it around a sandwich

44:50.340 --> 44:55.460
We should put it sandwich adjacent. We should put it inside the concept of a sandwich

44:55.460 --> 45:03.340
Let's let's harness the power of sriracha but not include any of it

45:04.620 --> 45:07.500
We will tease a sandwich with sriracha

45:09.440 --> 45:12.660
We will tell a sandwich the stories of sriracha

45:13.020 --> 45:19.580
The tales of its adventures and hope that its legacy is somehow passed through the sandwich

45:19.580 --> 45:26.980
We will not apply the sauce. Can we talk about a sriracha bun cuz god forbid what if you get in a car accident and

45:27.060 --> 45:33.500
The chicken and the bacon and the aioli go flying out the window, but the only thing you're left with is hot bread

45:33.500 --> 45:35.500
How's your hot bread?

45:35.820 --> 45:42.780
Hey, this bread's hot. It sucks. I know it's spicy bread. I'm sorry. I got in a car accident. I lost the chicken

45:42.780 --> 45:50.420
I'm upset with this whole thing because it feels like Wendy's is trying to dunk on sriracha lovers and say

45:50.420 --> 45:52.220
How about this? Is this enough?

45:52.220 --> 45:59.720
Do you like that take that like they're trying to burn out your enjoyment of sriracha by giving you so much of it

45:59.860 --> 46:01.860
That you don't want it anymore

46:02.180 --> 46:05.240
But also none of it and also none of it

46:05.420 --> 46:10.660
This is not a thing you do with anyone else like they're not like oh what you like tomatoes

46:10.660 --> 46:15.660
The buns got tomatoes in it. The meats got tomatoes in it. The lettuce has tomatoes in it. Go fuck yourself

46:16.620 --> 46:20.160
it really is by not including sriracha, but also like

46:21.340 --> 46:22.660
absolutely

46:22.660 --> 46:24.660
conceptually destroying sriracha

46:24.740 --> 46:30.540
It's like the in it should be called like sriracha is over this. Yeah, it's done

46:30.660 --> 46:33.980
We're like taking the concept of it and not applying any of it

46:33.980 --> 46:37.340
Do you think that they had a point where they're like, well, we gotta put sriracha on the fucking thing

46:37.340 --> 46:40.860
and then someone's like you do realize that's actually a

46:41.940 --> 46:49.360
Condiment with flavor and I don't think our process can be trusted in applying unless it's like

46:49.980 --> 46:51.980
single serve packets

46:51.980 --> 46:53.620
That are being distributed like this

46:53.620 --> 47:00.880
I don't trust our people to directly apply actual flavorful common too many pranks too many pranks can be made with a sriracha packet

47:00.940 --> 47:02.460
No, thanks

47:02.460 --> 47:10.060
Somewhere there is a there's a Venn diagram that perfectly captures someone who really loves the idea of sriracha

47:10.260 --> 47:14.900
But you're not actual sriracha who's going to just love this

47:15.300 --> 47:20.820
Who's gonna be so excited that they get all of the flavor without having to deal with actual sriracha?

47:20.820 --> 47:24.940
I don't want to meet that person, but I guarantee they exist

47:25.500 --> 47:29.100
Hey, can we please do this first advice question?

47:29.100 --> 47:32.460
Because if we don't do any advice this episode we're gonna lose our license, but not only that

47:32.500 --> 47:37.540
This first question on this list that Travis has put together that Travis worked so hard to put together for us is such a banger

47:37.540 --> 47:43.060
And we would be remiss if we let it fall through the wayside Travis just recite. We'll ask these questions next week

47:43.060 --> 47:49.020
There I do want to say this is a perfect 20 serpentine question for my brother my brother. Yes

47:49.020 --> 47:56.580
Okay, this is our this is our first and only question of this episode the first of 20 serpentine

47:56.580 --> 48:04.180
One of my friends is a contact juggler. He hasn't performed for money in years. That's not an option. I don't think that's an option

48:07.700 --> 48:09.700
$20 please

48:12.020 --> 48:18.900
I only do it for the art now. I don't perform for money anymore. That'll be five bucks

48:21.140 --> 48:23.180
One of my friends is a contact juggler

48:23.180 --> 48:30.180
He hasn't performed for money in years, but recently the company that makes fushigi balls reached out to him apparently

48:30.180 --> 48:32.180
They're planning on relaunching fushigi

48:36.100 --> 48:43.100
And they want this is just that was the best news I could for my brother my brother made that is pretty much the best

48:43.100 --> 48:45.100
Like and I did not expect it

48:45.300 --> 48:47.300
But big ups, I didn't see that coming

48:47.300 --> 48:52.260
They want him to be in their commercials again. Yeah, this

48:54.300 --> 48:58.980
Man is the face by which I mean the weirdly moving hands of fushigi

49:00.100 --> 49:06.620
Problem is the last time he performed in a fushigi commercial. He got called a sellout by all the other contact jugglers

49:11.340 --> 49:14.460
How can I convince him to ignore the haters and get that paper

49:14.460 --> 49:16.460
All

49:16.740 --> 49:18.180
20 of them

49:18.180 --> 49:21.420
That's from fushigi enthusiasts from Boca Raton, Florida

49:22.180 --> 49:24.180
You're out of the gang damn

49:24.860 --> 49:26.260
so

49:26.260 --> 49:28.260
There are certain

49:28.820 --> 49:30.820
There are certain careers

49:31.340 --> 49:36.340
Where the window of success it's so limited right like you two were theater majors

49:36.340 --> 49:42.160
you remember that feeling when you saw somebody go off and then they made it on a fucking episode of psych and you're like

49:42.160 --> 49:49.200
Damn it Jeremy and you got so angry and jealous because there's only like two paying roles on psych that you can sort of slot into

49:50.120 --> 49:52.960
If you wanted to eat what Justin I work in the games industry

49:52.960 --> 49:58.720
There's not many paying gigs in the games industry. And so there's there's a lot of beef that arises there

49:58.720 --> 50:04.320
I am going to make an estimation here that the number of paid

50:05.440 --> 50:07.920
positions for fushigiists is

50:07.920 --> 50:13.200
Is one and it is the one who is in the commercial for fushigi

50:13.200 --> 50:18.360
I don't think anybody picks up fushigi thinking like I'm gonna make money. This is my dream now

50:18.360 --> 50:20.440
I'm gonna make money doing this someday. Well

50:21.520 --> 50:26.080
Griffin do you think that the same person who's the face of the commercials is also like goes to the trade shows

50:26.760 --> 50:33.440
Goes to like, you know the contact juggling like conferences and like demonstrates the new line

50:33.440 --> 50:38.480
or do you think that they have like a team of people that they have like

50:38.800 --> 50:45.920
You know different people that they send to like the Southwest fushigi conference and like the northeastern fushigi conference

50:47.080 --> 50:49.200
the Japan fushigi conference

50:51.360 --> 50:53.360
Fucking shit. Oh, I

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Just had the first

50:56.240 --> 50:59.840
Great idea of 20 serpentine. Okay, you better zag on us

50:59.840 --> 51:05.680
Yeah, I'm about to zag on you guys and and please seriously. I'm very serious about it

51:05.680 --> 51:07.680
So please brothers let me know if you're okay with this. I

51:08.960 --> 51:10.280
would like

51:10.280 --> 51:12.280
this year for us to become

51:13.600 --> 51:22.120
Patrons of fushigi now. Here's what I'm suggesting. Oh boy. Oh boy. We we take when when we get paid in January

51:22.640 --> 51:28.400
We will take the first $500 that we make this month and we will set it aside

51:28.400 --> 51:29.880
for

51:29.880 --> 51:34.520
Fushigi patronage and here is what I'm suggesting to you. Uh-huh. What I'm suggesting to you is

51:35.400 --> 51:39.160
People will make fushigi art. Yeah, I did it to us

51:39.440 --> 51:44.440
We will assign a dollar value on the quality of the fushigi performance and please actually

51:44.680 --> 51:49.420
Do some sick fushigi shit because if it's if there's nothing there will you will get nothing

51:50.080 --> 51:54.400
But you will make actual fushigi art and if it is special

51:54.400 --> 51:59.400
We will PayPal you from the fushigi budget that we have set aside

52:00.080 --> 52:02.080
For 2017 which is in total

52:03.240 --> 52:07.200
$500. Yes, we are fushigi patrons

52:08.760 --> 52:10.760
Patrons of fushigi and

52:10.880 --> 52:17.340
If you do some sick-ass fushigi art, yeah, you will and and you can either let's see

52:18.040 --> 52:23.480
Probably the best thing is to put it on our Facebook page or tweet at us with hashtag fushigi art

52:23.480 --> 52:25.480
Yeah, that's probably the best

52:25.600 --> 52:29.720
And then we will award this grant. We probably won't do a lump sum

52:29.720 --> 52:35.200
We'll probably try to space out a little and also will not be very much money because I really I it won't make sense if

52:35.200 --> 52:41.320
We give like 200 bucks to somebody who makes something totally baller. I want to get this shit popping off across the world

52:41.320 --> 52:46.060
I want recognition from the fushigi company. I do want to be taken to the fushigi nationals in Japan

52:46.800 --> 52:51.960
And yes, we cannot stress enough once that 500 is gone. It's gone

52:51.960 --> 52:54.840
It's gone. Don't send us this in like December of 2017

52:54.840 --> 53:00.800
Don't get all pissy at us if you work hard on our routine and we decided it is not it is not worthy of our

53:00.800 --> 53:03.280
I feel like if you have a contact juggling routine

53:04.560 --> 53:08.420
Made for us specifically you will probably get some

53:10.600 --> 53:13.400
I'm gonna kick you a little bit but like

53:13.920 --> 53:16.160
Yeah, if you have a sick-ass routine

53:16.160 --> 53:19.440
That's just for us and it has to be clear like in the video

53:19.440 --> 53:23.860
Like I don't know if you have to say something about our show or some sort of you know, it has to be clear

53:23.860 --> 53:29.900
It's made boutique content for the my brother my brother me fishy patrons of fushigi

53:30.060 --> 53:32.900
Now I will say if you want to score bonus points with me

53:33.100 --> 53:39.100
Some kind of like cool runnings ask backstory as to why your contact juggling story

53:39.300 --> 53:42.860
Is like you had to overcome some kind of contact juggling

53:43.100 --> 53:48.100
like issue or sell like your friends always told you you could never be a contact juggler because

53:48.100 --> 53:50.580
That's gonna score extra points with me

53:50.580 --> 53:55.980
What I like is if at the end of your routine you destroy your fushigi balls. Oh, yes

53:56.180 --> 54:01.140
Just so I know that you did this thing for us and then you have walked away from the craft

54:01.140 --> 54:07.420
In fact, if you want to add a little clip at the beginning just a short blip of you buying the fushigi ball

54:07.580 --> 54:12.980
Then do the trick and then destroy it. So we know that it was like bespoke just for this

54:12.980 --> 54:16.180
Yeah, that's probably gonna get a couple a couple checkmarks

54:16.180 --> 54:20.340
Um, so please create fushigi art for us

54:20.820 --> 54:25.340
we're gonna just gonna get some fushigi art into the world five hundred dollars is a

54:26.300 --> 54:31.260
Ton of dough though. We should boy. I wish you'd set a lower number to start with

54:32.980 --> 54:38.380
Walked it up a little bit, but that's an annual budget. I mean that has to last us all year, right?

54:38.780 --> 54:43.300
Does this count as a charitable donation? Yeah, can I can we can we write this off?

54:43.300 --> 54:48.480
Now I know there might be some of you who have who donate to the maximum fun Network

54:48.540 --> 54:52.620
So some portion of your donation will go to fushigi art

54:53.460 --> 54:59.340
I don't know how you feel about that. But if you feel bad about it, I don't know what fucking podcast you've been listening to

55:01.340 --> 55:04.860
I don't know what you think we're good with we're good with bucks

55:04.900 --> 55:11.660
we're good with your dollar bills if the idea of a few cents of your donation going to fushigi art doesn't fill you with

55:11.660 --> 55:18.460
Excitement and delight then I'm not sure that you're a great fit for our business. Okay, this isn't this is a pretty enormous zag

55:18.460 --> 55:20.460
Do we still fucking hate jugglers?

55:21.180 --> 55:23.180
No

55:23.420 --> 55:30.100
No, we've been very clear about this contact jugglers are okay. We've always been clear about this. Okay, the fish the fushigi arts are fine

55:30.900 --> 55:32.900
Then that's why we're not

55:33.180 --> 55:39.020
More is the contact juggling fushigi arts are like that's something we want to try to get out more

55:39.020 --> 55:45.340
There's hundreds of videos of juggling. I want contact juggling fushigi art art

55:45.860 --> 55:51.720
Please yeah, you don't mind. Oh, oh, oh, if it could be set to music

55:53.660 --> 56:00.380
A silent contact juggling routine with the fuck you talking about the problem is that you're gonna get that copyright infringement

56:00.380 --> 56:03.740
You got it. It's got to be copyright free. You gotta get some some

56:03.740 --> 56:08.700
Farmer that's out in there. Yeah. Happy birthday fushigi

56:08.700 --> 56:12.980
I do like Justin that you keep referring it to as fushigi art

56:13.100 --> 56:18.060
Because I like that because it implies don't just like film yourself in silence doing a single trick

56:18.100 --> 56:21.580
You know what? I mean? Like I want some kind of artistry to it

56:21.660 --> 56:27.900
You know a little story maybe or maybe it's an allegory of fushigi allegory for something

56:27.900 --> 56:29.180
I don't want to put too many

56:29.180 --> 56:32.580
Restrictions on people because I think that they're gonna do a lot better with this than we will

56:32.580 --> 56:38.160
The one sort of cholera will add on this is we will make the amount that we award you

56:38.580 --> 56:44.820
Extremely public so like do be aware of that going in that that will be made extremely public

56:45.140 --> 56:49.180
That that the amount that you will be gifted from the fushigi arts patronage

56:50.020 --> 56:52.960
And you know, this is successful. Who knows 20

56:54.740 --> 56:56.340
2018 maybe it's

56:56.340 --> 57:00.540
$515, you know, it could go the sky's the limit. We'll have to check with our accountants. Oh

57:00.540 --> 57:05.420
No, they can't ever know. Please don't tell our accountants, please. Please don't tell Barry

57:05.420 --> 57:11.140
Please don't tell Barry Barry's so mad at us all the time for the bad decisions. We made now Justin

57:11.140 --> 57:17.620
What's this receipt for $500? You've submitted here on a piece of paper. You've just written for fushigi arts

57:18.620 --> 57:20.620
Right. It's a gift of the arts

57:21.380 --> 57:23.380
It's an artistic gift

57:24.620 --> 57:26.620
You put you plebeian

57:26.620 --> 57:32.340
Yeah, I'm gonna need to I just need that to be and probably put like

57:33.100 --> 57:38.500
Fushigi art in the title of the YouTube video or like hashtag fushigi art just to make it like really easy

57:38.500 --> 57:42.100
I want to just be able to like look at all these and review all of them and enjoy them

57:42.100 --> 57:48.240
Yeah, sure in my own time. Let's wrap up because I don't think I can hear that. You say the words fushigi art anymore today
