00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:52.000
Hello, heroes. Those who have followed us through the veil, through the void,

00:52.000 --> 00:58.560
and have come out on the other end as champions, you have completed the Maximum Fun Jar for 2011,

00:58.560 --> 01:04.480
and we reached our goal with the help of you, and you, and you, and you, and you.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.000
But not that guy in the back. Fuck that guy.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.240
God damn it, Tave. Just once. Just once pitch in.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.800
Did you say- Did you say Tave?

01:14.800 --> 01:16.880
Tave. My friend Tave.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.120
Is that short for Taven?

01:19.120 --> 01:22.720
It's short for Tavian, actually. Tave-tion. It's like a-

01:22.720 --> 01:26.240
I'm actually- I can't be mad at that guy. That poor guy with that poor name.

01:26.240 --> 01:31.360
And listen, the English- the teacher at the community college isn't paying the bills like

01:31.360 --> 01:36.400
it used to, and Tave-tion just likes to listen to the show. Who can blame him?

01:36.400 --> 01:40.400
This is my brother. My brother meets a device show for the modern era. He's listening to us,

01:40.400 --> 01:46.960
so he knows how to improve his own situation, so he'll be fiscally in a position to help out

01:46.960 --> 01:52.240
next year when we call upon his aid. But let's not dwell on that. Let's dwell on

01:52.240 --> 01:56.960
right now when I am Justin McElroy. And I am Travis McElroy.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.320
And right now, I am Griffin McElroy. For the foreseeable future,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.520
this is my brother, my brother, and me. So let's get right to the wisdom.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.960
So if I, a dude, goes into the bathroom and all the urinals are taken, socially acceptable

02:08.960 --> 02:11.680
in working order or otherwise, what am I supposed to do?

02:12.720 --> 02:18.320
Wait around for a urinal to become available? Go outside again and try later? Take a stall?

02:18.320 --> 02:25.120
If I take a stall, should I close and or lock the doors? Much obliged. Potentially harm.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.000
Why wouldn't you close the door?

02:29.040 --> 02:35.360
I don't know, because it's like you're sort of claiming that as your own, as your property.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.400
You're, you're, you're staking your claim, and maybe you feel like you don't have a right to.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.640
You take a wide dominant stance.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.800
You're saying, hey, this is mine now.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.480
I mean, there's, there, there's, if you'll forgive the pun,

02:46.480 --> 02:50.640
there's, there's squatters rights that you have in a, in a bathroom stall.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.560
If you post up in a bathroom stall, that's,

02:52.560 --> 02:58.640
that's basically your apartment for the duration of your, your onesie or doosie.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.240
Like I think, I think the moment though, that you're afraid of, if you're peeing in a bathroom

03:02.240 --> 03:08.000
stall and then you walk out and in the time that you were in the stall, all the urinals cleared out,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.320
you look like a douche when someone's waiting to poop.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.000
And also everyone just thinks you're trying to hide your tiny dick.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.680
Yeah. Why? What do you, what's your shame? What's, what's wrong with you?

03:17.680 --> 03:20.960
As you walk into the stall announced, listen, this isn't because I have a tiny dick.

03:20.960 --> 03:21.760
This isn't a shame thing.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.800
All the urinals are taken.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.160
And my dick's not even big. Like it's average.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.760
I don't, I, listen, I have an average dick, but I need to, I like to say-

03:29.760 --> 03:30.880
I just really need to pee.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.880
Why don't you just wait it out?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.160
Like what's the rush?

03:34.160 --> 03:39.520
I think if somebody wants to shoot one, they will wait, they'll go around you.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.800
It's not a big deal.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.520
I used to be afraid of using the urinal, not because I have a tiny dick, but just because I

03:45.520 --> 03:47.680
don't, I just don't want anybody to see my dick.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.360
I'm like, that seems like if there's any, any given point during my day,

03:53.120 --> 03:56.320
that I were to highlight as most likely to get my dick seen,

03:57.120 --> 04:02.480
I would say that using the urinal is, is like number one, maybe number two on that list.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.360
Right. And also you, you run the risk of splash damage.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.360
Splash damage is bad.

04:07.360 --> 04:12.320
And also I might see other dude's dicks and that, psychologically, that's, that's even worse for me.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.480
So I used to use the stall.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.840
I'm, I've gotten over that fear, but I'm sure there are other people who still suffer from it.

04:17.840 --> 04:22.960
And to those people, I'm saying that you're, you're completely within reason.

04:23.520 --> 04:23.760
Yeah.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.440
The stall or just wait and use the bathroom at home like a normal person.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.280
But like a human being.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.880
Let's throw, slap a motto on this bitch.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.000
Let's make it marketable.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.640
Okay.

04:32.640 --> 04:32.880
Yeah.

04:32.880 --> 04:37.440
Go your own way.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.720
I gotta get some rights.

04:38.720 --> 04:39.280
What about this?

04:39.280 --> 04:40.400
What about this?

04:40.400 --> 04:42.160
If there's no stall, you need to stall.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.520
Okay.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.400
Is that, is that, does that have some possibilities, you think?

04:46.400 --> 04:48.080
That definitely has some possibilities.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.080
I think no matter what, it's an intimate moment.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.160
What you, what you do in a bathroom.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.400
I can't think of an un-intimate thing that one would normally do in a bathroom.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.480
And it's uncomfortable sharing that moment with other people.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.920
So just, you know, it sucks.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.200
You gotta get through it.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.160
But stalls, I think, are the best place to do it.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.440
Guys, I was lying in bed with, laying in bed with my girlfriend.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.480
Sorry, Griffin.

05:08.480 --> 05:14.000
And I asked her the age, if you could have sex with anyone, who would it be?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.920
Oh, the age old, if you could have sex with anyone.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.920
There is an age that you can have sex with people.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.320
What is the age of anyone you could have sex with?

05:21.600 --> 05:22.640
18, by the way.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.080
Young enough to be legal, still in the prime, obvious.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.160
Her answer was XBF or 50.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.200
Because what's up?

05:29.200 --> 05:32.880
Her answer was her XBF because it was so good and passionate.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.680
I got cranky, rolled over and went to sleep.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.840
She's now angry at me, saying it doesn't mean anything and it was no big deal.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.400
Help.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.600
Terry, Terry.

05:42.160 --> 05:47.040
Is Terry asking how to get over this girl that he just broke up with because she said that thing?

05:47.040 --> 05:49.600
This girl that he definitely, definitely just dumped.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.840
See, the answer to that question is supposed to be like Shakira or Natalie Portman.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.560
It's not supposed to be your friend Jeff.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.760
Your fucking brother.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.240
Like, no.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.480
You're not allowed to do that.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.560
And note to guys, if your lady asks you this question, the answer is her.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.960
The answer is always her.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.080
Can I get-

06:08.080 --> 06:08.400
Crap.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.440
Can I get you with red hair?

06:11.440 --> 06:11.840
Is that-

06:13.760 --> 06:17.280
Can I get you minus, let's call it eight pounds.

06:17.280 --> 06:21.360
Like, I think right there would get you in the sweet spot for me.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.560
You on a good day.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.360
Yeah, no, she done fucked up, Terry.

06:25.360 --> 06:31.760
And might I say, Terry, as one man speaking to another, what a moment this is for you.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.200
Because it's rare that girls fuck up this clearly.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.120
Like, this obviously.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.480
Guys, all the time.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.600
Like, if we get this question from a girl, I think the-

06:41.600 --> 06:42.800
I don't think we'd be so-

06:42.800 --> 06:44.560
It probably wouldn't be worth reading.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.760
Her answer was a one-two punch, fuck you.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.320
Because it like, it was so bad.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.680
Fuck you, because it like, it was so good.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.400
Like, number one, it was so good.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.880
Like, fuck, I can't fuck like that.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.160
Like, I can't fuck like Jerry.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.040
I can't fuck like Jerry.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.920
Like, I'm pretty good, but I'm not Jerry good.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.800
Not only was it fucking good, it was passionate.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.040
Those are the two key elements to good, good fucking.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.120
Because it's gotta, like, there's gotta be technical ability behind it.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.600
There's also gotta be a little something, a little extra spice, a little love.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.120
A little bit of dance, you gotta know the craft, but the heart's gotta be there, too.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.800
He was good at loving me.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.440
Jerry was.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.520
Back in the long, long ago.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.200
Terry, I don't know what to tell you, man.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.080
You done been wronged.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.000
You've been wronged.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.520
You need to be angry at her for the foreseeable future.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.600
Yeah, why the fuck is she angry at you?

07:37.600 --> 07:40.480
Why are you even thinking about this?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.480
Jerry, Terry, Terry, Terry.

07:44.480 --> 07:49.920
Oh, for the rest of your relationship, which I imagine will be about two weeks,

07:50.960 --> 07:55.920
whenever you guys get into a fight, just yell at her about her mind fucking her ex-boyfriend.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.480
Yeah, and you're with Jerry right now, aren't you?

07:59.120 --> 08:01.040
In your heart, you're with Jerry still.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.840
Not Terry, me Terry, not me, but Jerry.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.040
I know it's confusing.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.200
I know it's confusing, but you're with Jerry in your heart.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.400
Recently, I was-

08:10.400 --> 08:12.800
You want a yahoo instead of the thing you're doing?

08:12.800 --> 08:15.920
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's why I started reading it.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.080
This one was sent in by Nick Jensen.

08:18.080 --> 08:18.880
Thank you, Nick Jensen.

08:18.880 --> 08:19.360
Hey, Nick.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.840
Hey, it's by Yahoo Answers user, Dean Windass, all right, who asks,

08:26.960 --> 08:31.200
girls, what would you do if you accidentally sat on your ex?

08:33.120 --> 08:37.440
If it was your worst ex and you went to sit down on a chair

08:37.440 --> 08:41.520
and it was your ex's face that had been transformed into the seat of the chair

08:41.520 --> 08:47.120
by some magic experiment gone wrong, when you sat down,

08:47.120 --> 08:50.800
his nose went up your bum like this, and then-

08:50.800 --> 08:51.920
Like what?

08:51.920 --> 08:55.920
And then Dean Windass has included two parentheses,

08:55.920 --> 08:57.600
marks that are facing inward to each other,

08:57.600 --> 08:59.520
which I guess is supposed to be a butt crack.

08:59.520 --> 09:04.800
My butt crack doesn't, I don't know, it's not beveled.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.680
Is that the right word?

09:06.720 --> 09:09.520
Although my butt crack is where I keep asides.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.320
Yeah.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.800
So there were like parentheses in that sense.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.480
Well, what would you say when you realized it was him?

09:16.480 --> 09:17.440
This is a survey.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.040
Cool, cool.

09:19.040 --> 09:19.280
Cool.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.040
Hey, did you guys recognize this as a survey?

09:22.400 --> 09:25.120
2010 census, I must have missed this one.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.200
What would you do if your face was-

09:27.200 --> 09:27.920
Like this is-

09:29.120 --> 09:32.000
First off, I don't know where the first off is.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.320
Your boyfriend's face was transformed.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.800
Was the rest of him transformed into a chair too?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.000
I mean, is that what we have to-

09:38.000 --> 09:39.920
This is a left, right?

09:39.920 --> 09:40.960
This is a person chair.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.040
I'm thinking about that old lady from Doctor Who

09:45.040 --> 09:46.400
who gets her face stressed out.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.520
I think just that and let's just throw that on a love seat.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.160
This chair looks like Jerry.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.680
Terry, did you turn Jerry into a chair

09:55.680 --> 09:57.040
and trick me into sitting on it?

09:57.040 --> 10:01.040
I like that he had to add the extra component of

10:01.040 --> 10:04.560
it's your worst ex as though if it were anyone else,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.160
that would be completely fine.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.120
Hey, honey, hey, sweetheart, if you could sit on anyone's face

10:09.760 --> 10:12.240
who was turned into a chair by some magic experiment gone wrong.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.360
And also their nose would go up your butt like this.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.120
And you make parentheses with your hands.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.560
Mine is George Lopez.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.360
I like his comedy, but he also seems like a really good dad.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.640
Yeah, and his skin is taut and leathery.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.560
And I like a chair with some firm support.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.800
George Lopez, your face is very comfortable to sit on.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.200
Yeah, I'm not a fan of your work,

10:37.200 --> 10:39.440
but I am enjoying sitting on your face.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.000
It's like massage beads that taxi drivers use.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.480
If I had a chair that the seat of which was composed

10:44.480 --> 10:45.520
of George Lopez's face,

10:45.520 --> 10:47.920
can I call it Beverly Hills Chair Wawa?

10:48.640 --> 10:49.600
I think so.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.960
I think that that would be more than acceptable.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.360
Can I make a movie called Beverly Hills Chair Wawa

10:55.360 --> 10:57.920
that's just a bunch of chairs instead of dogs?

10:57.920 --> 10:58.420
Yeah.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.720
I can do both of those things, but will I?

11:02.720 --> 11:03.360
Probably not.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.880
I'm a busy guy.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.160
I'm afraid Stuart getting transformed

11:06.160 --> 11:08.240
into a chair would actually be a bump for him.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.240
That would be a big up.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.720
To go from whatever he's doing now.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.280
Whatever the fuck it is he's doing to be a chair.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.520
So I guess that answers that.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.280
What a fucking weird...

11:21.280 --> 11:21.920
How about this?

11:21.920 --> 11:23.760
How about this Yahoo answer?

11:23.760 --> 11:25.440
What do I do when I read a question

11:25.440 --> 11:27.280
from someone who's obviously insane?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.880
Like obviously mentally unstable

11:28.880 --> 11:30.080
that this is what they're pondering.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.720
Diamond Mayweather responded and said,

11:32.720 --> 11:35.200
I'd jump up, apologize, then move to another seat.

11:38.080 --> 11:38.960
Well, of course.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.400
Being more careful this time to check

11:40.400 --> 11:42.000
to make sure it's not a person.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And then send them a polite sympathy note.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.600
Jerry.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.640
Cherry, I'm so sorry.

11:47.520 --> 11:47.920
Cherry.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.200
Please forgive me.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.960
I'm gonna move over to that seat.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.640
It's got George Lopez's face on it.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.520
Which I believe my tuchus will prefer.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.920
9 out of 10 tuchuses prefer George Lopez's face

11:59.920 --> 12:01.200
to Terry or Jerry.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.480
See, Jerry?

12:02.480 --> 12:05.200
That's an area that Terry can compete with Jerry in.

12:06.000 --> 12:06.960
Face comfort.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.080
I have a friend named Badkins.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.600
I think he's probably listening to this right now.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.080
And he has this great pickup line

12:12.080 --> 12:15.600
where whenever he's at a bar or a party

12:15.600 --> 12:16.480
or something like that,

12:16.480 --> 12:17.600
he doesn't do this all the time.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.880
I don't want to make him sound like a grosso.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.920
But if a girl comes over and is like,

12:21.920 --> 12:22.960
hey, can I have a seat?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.160
And he says, sure.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.440
He takes his glasses off and wipes his face down.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.800
I have to say, here you go.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.880
This is where it goes.

12:30.880 --> 12:31.680
Pretty good.

12:31.680 --> 12:32.400
That's pretty good.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.840
It probably never panned out.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.800
It's still just rife with comedy.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.040
Yeah.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.720
Never worked.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.200
Someday.

12:40.320 --> 12:40.880
Keep the faith.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.840
Recently I was volunteering at an event.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.600
I hit it off with a girl I was working with.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.440
I decided to ask her out to coffee

12:47.440 --> 12:49.200
but put off to the last minute.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.200
By the time I was going to ask her,

12:51.200 --> 12:52.240
she was with a friend

12:52.240 --> 12:54.640
and it felt weird asking her around her friend

12:54.640 --> 12:57.280
and even weirder calling her away from her friend.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.880
I didn't end up asking her out.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.000
My question is,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.760
were those even borderline reasonable

13:01.760 --> 13:03.600
or just poor excuses and bad habits?

13:03.600 --> 13:04.160
Thanks, Mitch.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.240
I believe that.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.240
Thanks, comma, Mitch.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.840
Thanks, Mitch.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.560
I think that those,

13:15.120 --> 13:16.800
they seem like good excuses at the time

13:16.800 --> 13:19.600
but I think that it would be just absolutely like bawling

13:19.600 --> 13:21.120
if you just walked up and said,

13:21.120 --> 13:22.400
listen, sorry to interrupt

13:22.400 --> 13:24.160
and just asked her right in front of a friend.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.960
I think it would show like huge confidence

13:26.960 --> 13:29.840
and like, I think it would be a great start.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.840
She would, if you got the guts to do it,

13:31.840 --> 13:33.600
she's going to look awesome in front of her friend.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.920
What person doesn't want that?

13:36.720 --> 13:38.080
I disagree.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.320
Uh-oh, that's rude.

13:40.320 --> 13:40.960
What are you going to do?

13:40.960 --> 13:42.400
Roll up there, be like, clam up.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.880
It's me time.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.000
Maybe not that,

13:49.200 --> 13:52.160
but you know, just walk over and say,

13:53.280 --> 13:54.640
I'm about to take off.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.520
I'm sorry to interrupt.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.480
I just wanted to see

13:56.480 --> 13:58.480
if maybe you wanted to grab coffee sometime.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.200
Who wants to be pursued demurely though?

14:01.200 --> 14:03.280
Who wants, who doesn't want that passion,

14:03.280 --> 14:04.160
that fire there?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.960
So maybe just like run up and yell,

14:06.960 --> 14:08.800
clam up and push her friend out.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.760
I've been trying to wait.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.280
I can't risk, you know, losing this opportunity.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.040
I love you and I want to get married to you.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.600
And then if she says no,

14:19.600 --> 14:20.880
turn to her friend and say,

14:20.880 --> 14:21.840
how about you?

14:21.840 --> 14:22.320
How about you?

14:23.280 --> 14:26.640
Yeah, maybe just the old eeny meeny miny moe.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.920
I'm just laying them out on the table.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.120
As long as they're out here,

14:29.120 --> 14:30.480
would you like to pick them up?

14:30.480 --> 14:33.120
I mean, as long as I'm laying them out for you.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.600
Trying to catch a sweet baby by the toe over here.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.320
Eeny, meeny, miny.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.920
Who gives a rat's ass?

14:39.920 --> 14:40.800
Let's both do it.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.840
Let's go, ladies.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.440
You and me, arm and arm.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.200
Sex party, my place.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.720
Show you my eeny, meeny.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.760
You want to hook up to,

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
you want to hit up with CJ Maggies?

14:49.760 --> 14:50.880
Let's hit the O'Charlies.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.040
Get some, get some onion fringes.

14:53.040 --> 14:53.760
Just get down.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.480
But at the end of the day,

14:56.480 --> 14:59.760
don't ever call someone away from their friend

14:59.760 --> 15:00.400
to ask them out,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.480
because you look like an absolute creeper.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.720
Excuse me, just come,

15:04.720 --> 15:06.000
just step over here real quick.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.320
I have something private to ask you.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.000
I'm not sure you look like a creeper, though.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.360
I don't think that's fair.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.000
I think that it just makes you seem like

15:14.000 --> 15:15.120
asking a man out is something

15:15.120 --> 15:16.880
you're incredibly embarrassed about,

15:16.880 --> 15:19.040
and something that you wouldn't ever want anyone

15:19.040 --> 15:20.000
to know you were doing.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.800
I think it's creepy.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.440
Hey, I have hemorrhoids,

15:23.440 --> 15:24.320
and also I like you.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.000
I like you very much.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.040
Don't tell Debra.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.080
Don't tell Debra over there.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.840
Don't tell Debra, but we're in love.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.960
She's got judgey eyes.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.840
I hang out with six to seven people

15:33.840 --> 15:35.200
every Saturday night.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.480
It's a busy night.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.080
We all go over to someone's house,

15:38.080 --> 15:38.880
and then have dinner,

15:38.880 --> 15:40.320
and play games and whatnot.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.240
Two of these people are vegetarians.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.360
When I go to their houses,

15:43.360 --> 15:45.440
I don't mind eating their vegetarian nonsense,

15:45.440 --> 15:46.880
but when they're coming over to my house,

15:46.880 --> 15:47.840
should I have to go out of my way

15:47.840 --> 15:49.520
to make some sort of vegetarian dish?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.200
Or should I tell them to fend for themselves

15:51.200 --> 15:53.600
as they would have done in the olden timey days?

15:53.600 --> 15:54.100
Ryan.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.740
It sounds like he should revise

15:56.740 --> 15:58.020
the beginning of his question and say,

15:59.860 --> 16:03.460
I hang out with four to five friends

16:03.460 --> 16:04.420
every Saturday night,

16:04.420 --> 16:08.340
and one to two vegetarian acquaintances.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.980
Occasionally, after dinner,

16:10.980 --> 16:12.260
they join with us.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.740
What I love about this is the idea

16:14.740 --> 16:17.860
of some sort of vegetarian dish.

16:17.860 --> 16:19.540
Do you know what's a vegetarian dish?

16:19.540 --> 16:20.580
Vegetables.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.860
Like a salad.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.460
That's vegetarian right there.

16:23.460 --> 16:23.960
What?

16:24.260 --> 16:24.760
What?

16:25.380 --> 16:26.180
First of all,

16:26.180 --> 16:27.540
that's wildly wrong.

16:27.540 --> 16:28.580
Everything you just said.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.780
There's so much other food that vegetarians eat.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.220
You're disqualifying yourself.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.420
Do you eat salads?

16:34.420 --> 16:35.060
Not everybody.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.020
Yeah bitch, but like bread too, stupid.

16:38.020 --> 16:39.220
Like what are you talking about?

16:40.340 --> 16:42.180
Travis puts like chorizo sausage

16:42.180 --> 16:44.020
on like two out of three meals of the day.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.660
Your opinion when it comes to vegetarian matters

16:46.660 --> 16:47.700
just don't count.

16:47.700 --> 16:48.200
True.

16:49.220 --> 16:51.060
What I'm curious about is

16:51.060 --> 16:52.980
is how telling them to fend for themselves

16:52.980 --> 16:53.620
in your apartment.

16:53.620 --> 16:54.120
Like,

16:54.980 --> 16:56.660
like hey there's some compost out back.

16:56.660 --> 16:57.620
Like go nuts.

16:57.620 --> 16:58.740
Go wacky back there.

16:58.740 --> 17:01.540
Maybe grow some some bok choy.

17:01.540 --> 17:02.820
You're gonna love it.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.580
You're gonna love the fertile soils back there.

17:05.380 --> 17:06.580
I think that if you're,

17:06.580 --> 17:09.060
if you're picking a dinner

17:09.060 --> 17:10.580
that you're gonna make for people,

17:10.580 --> 17:12.420
I think that you shouldn't go out of your way

17:12.420 --> 17:13.860
to make something for them,

17:13.860 --> 17:14.820
but I think you should go out of your way

17:14.820 --> 17:15.860
to make something,

17:15.860 --> 17:16.580
not go out of your way,

17:16.580 --> 17:17.460
but try to choose a dish

17:17.460 --> 17:20.100
that would be easily convertible.

17:20.100 --> 17:20.580
You know what I mean?

17:20.580 --> 17:22.660
Don't serve meat noodles, for example,

17:22.660 --> 17:23.780
would be right out.

17:24.340 --> 17:24.900
That's a thing?

17:25.700 --> 17:26.180
Yeah, sure.

17:26.180 --> 17:26.900
Honestly, yeah.

17:26.900 --> 17:27.860
Build your own,

17:27.860 --> 17:29.060
like do a pasta thing

17:29.060 --> 17:31.300
where you like you add whatever you want to it.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.940
That way people could do like,

17:33.940 --> 17:34.740
you know, meatballs

17:34.740 --> 17:36.020
or they can just do the sauce

17:36.020 --> 17:36.820
or whatever they want

17:36.820 --> 17:38.900
and that way it fits everybody's lifestyle.

17:40.420 --> 17:43.540
Do you think that Travis calls sausage meat noodles?

17:45.140 --> 17:46.580
That's basically what they are

17:46.580 --> 17:47.620
in a mind like his.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.380
A beautiful mind.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.340
Beautiful mind.

17:50.340 --> 17:53.380
Like Russell Crowe on Russell Graham's movie.

17:54.180 --> 17:54.420
What?

17:55.060 --> 17:55.860
He did a movie,

17:55.860 --> 17:57.300
it's called Beautiful Mind.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.340
Oh, that one.

17:58.340 --> 17:59.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:59.060 --> 17:59.860
I didn't see it.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.260
Yeah, somebody did.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.180
Yeah, so I would serve something

18:06.180 --> 18:07.140
that's like convertible,

18:07.140 --> 18:09.860
that's easy to take the meat out.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.580
Something easy to remove the meat from.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.540
And I'd go with a syringe or whatever.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.780
Don't like chicken cordon bleu

18:17.780 --> 18:20.900
and just give him a pile of breadcrumbs

18:20.900 --> 18:21.620
and some cheese.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.180
You guys eat croutons, right?

18:24.180 --> 18:27.140
Here's a bowl of croutons.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.420
It's what you people eat, right?

18:29.300 --> 18:31.140
Travis told me you guys just eat vegetables.

18:31.140 --> 18:31.620
That's it.

18:33.940 --> 18:34.740
But yeah, I would.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.660
That's the way I would go.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.100
Hey, Griffin.

18:40.100 --> 18:40.600
Hey, Will.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.660
You ready to take a trip with me?

18:44.500 --> 18:45.540
I mean, I just,

18:45.540 --> 18:47.940
I've still got the stink of the sky on me

18:47.940 --> 18:49.220
because my plane just landed.

18:49.220 --> 18:50.020
Your sky stink?

18:50.580 --> 18:52.740
I've got a bit of sky stink still left on me,

18:52.740 --> 18:54.260
but yeah, sure.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.380
Let's go on a trip.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.260
Where to?

18:56.260 --> 19:15.860
The money zone.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.360
Okay.

19:20.980 --> 19:21.780
So we're there?

19:21.780 --> 19:22.100
Is this-

19:22.100 --> 19:22.820
We're there.

19:22.820 --> 19:23.220
We're here.

19:23.220 --> 19:23.380
Are we there?

19:24.500 --> 19:25.220
This is nice.

19:25.220 --> 19:25.940
This is nice.

19:25.940 --> 19:26.580
I'm comfortable.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.740
The chairs are much more expensive here.

19:30.740 --> 19:31.140
Is this-

19:31.140 --> 19:32.980
I believe it is George Lopez's face.

19:35.780 --> 19:38.100
So what we want to talk with you guys about

19:38.820 --> 19:41.460
is something that is close to mine and Griffin's hearts

19:41.460 --> 19:42.660
and Travis, I suppose.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.020
That's video games.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.700
It's so rare we get to talk about video games here.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.820
My brother and my brother and me.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.860
And today we're talking about one called Kingdom of Loathing

19:49.860 --> 19:52.420
or KOL if you're down.

19:52.420 --> 19:56.980
Or KOL if you pronounce your O's weird.

19:56.980 --> 20:00.260
If you pronounce your O's wrong, then it's KOL.

20:00.260 --> 20:04.180
Now this is made by our friends at Asymmetric Publications,

20:06.020 --> 20:09.140
including the creator Zach Jick Johnson

20:09.140 --> 20:12.340
and the writer Josh Mr. Skullhead Knight.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.380
Josh Knight, I don't think you needed a nickname,

20:15.380 --> 20:17.060
but I think it's all right that you chose-

20:17.060 --> 20:17.620
No, no, no.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.140
That's his Christian.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.580
That's his proper name.

20:20.580 --> 20:23.460
His mom and dad named him Josh Mr. Skullhead Knight.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.620
Josh Mr. Skullhead, all hyphenated first name.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.380
That was his baptismal name.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.540
That's the name he was given upon confirmation.

20:29.540 --> 20:30.180
Sure, sure.

20:30.180 --> 20:32.180
He was named after Pope Mr. Skullhead.

20:33.380 --> 20:39.860
I don't think this is a hand-drawn stick figure graphics.

20:39.860 --> 20:40.100
Right.

20:40.100 --> 20:44.340
It has some surreal humor, some word play.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.180
Don't let the stick figure thing turn you off

20:46.180 --> 20:48.340
because these are some high quality stick figures.

20:48.340 --> 20:51.620
Yeah, I mean, you could tell the definitions there.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.500
Even though they may be stick figures,

20:54.500 --> 20:56.100
you feel the emotion, you feel the passion.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.700
How many pixels does it support?

20:59.700 --> 21:00.820
Easily a billion.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.340
How many megs of RAM car mine?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.300
There's probably a lot.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.500
They have tons of players.

21:08.580 --> 21:11.300
I was turned on to this game and played it for a while

21:11.300 --> 21:12.580
in college way back when.

21:12.580 --> 21:15.700
It's been around for like eight years.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.540
And it's still going strong.

21:17.540 --> 21:20.260
Now, Griffin, I like online multiplayer RPGs,

21:20.260 --> 21:21.780
but I don't have a lot of cash.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.900
Is that going to be a problem?

21:23.620 --> 21:25.860
It is going to be a problem with other parts of your life

21:25.860 --> 21:27.220
because you need cash.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.300
We exchange cash for goods and services

21:31.300 --> 21:35.620
in this capitalist society that we all live in.

21:35.620 --> 21:39.140
But to play cool, or if you want kingdom of loathing,

21:39.140 --> 21:44.500
you don't need a goddamn motherfucking penny, bitch.

21:44.500 --> 21:50.900
It's a free to play, a free as shit, I think should be the name.

21:50.900 --> 21:51.940
Free as shit.

21:51.940 --> 21:54.740
And it's free as fuck, like so free.

21:55.460 --> 21:56.980
It's been in development for eight years

21:57.940 --> 22:01.140
with literally, we're told, tens of thousands of dumb jokes.

22:01.140 --> 22:03.060
We have not counted them ourselves,

22:03.060 --> 22:04.820
but that is what we are led to believe.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.260
I have played it before.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.300
It is, it's funny.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.140
And it's not funny in that way of like,

22:09.140 --> 22:10.740
it's not like internet meme funny.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.900
It's like, it's just funny.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.020
Like it's a funny game.

22:14.020 --> 22:14.740
And you know what?

22:14.740 --> 22:17.060
Not only is it free, you play it in your web browser.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.540
Like they could not have made this game easier to access

22:20.020 --> 22:21.860
unless they came to your house

22:21.860 --> 22:23.620
and put it in some sort of syringe

22:23.620 --> 22:25.940
and like jam it in your eyes.

22:25.940 --> 22:26.740
Johnny Mnemonic.

22:27.860 --> 22:29.060
It's got a cool community

22:29.060 --> 22:31.060
and you filled with a lot of neat people

22:31.060 --> 22:32.740
and you can join them right now.

22:32.740 --> 22:35.220
You can just push some buttons on your keyboard.

22:35.220 --> 22:38.020
You will be whisked away to said kingdom.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.900
Tell us the exact sequence of buttons, please.

22:40.900 --> 22:49.220
K-I-N-G-D-O-M-O-F-L-O-A-T-H-I-N-G, period.

22:49.220 --> 22:51.540
C-O-M, enter key.

22:51.540 --> 22:54.580
Or kingdomofloathing.com would also work

22:54.580 --> 22:56.260
if you're not into putting letters together.

22:56.820 --> 22:58.340
But go check them out.

22:58.980 --> 22:59.780
Yeah, totally.

22:59.780 --> 23:02.740
And as a special treat for anybody

23:02.740 --> 23:07.220
who decides to do a promotion on our show,

23:07.220 --> 23:08.660
which if you want to do one,

23:08.660 --> 23:10.500
email Teresa at maximumfun.org

23:10.500 --> 23:11.780
and she'll give you the hot deets.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.580
You get a jingle.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.860
All the best jingles have an intro, right?

23:17.860 --> 23:23.140
Which all the best jingles have a smooth, smooth segue,

23:23.140 --> 23:24.660
which this is one of.

23:27.780 --> 23:28.340
Let's see.

23:29.620 --> 23:30.900
I didn't pre-pro this one.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.740
This is not going good, I don't think, Griffin.

23:32.740 --> 23:39.300
K-I-N-G-D-O-M-O-F-L-O-A-T-H-I-N-G, period.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.540
I need adventure and sticks.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.620
I don't have money to acquire the adventure and sticks

23:47.620 --> 23:48.820
I talked about.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.140
I'll go to cool.com.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.940
I can't go to cool.com

23:59.940 --> 24:03.380
because that is something else I'll go to kingdomofloathing.com.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.900
Kingdomofloathing.com.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.820
Check it totally out.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.780
So, wait, wait, wait.

24:15.780 --> 24:18.580
Yes, one of my closest friends is full of hatred.

24:18.580 --> 24:21.700
She's a really great person and I just love her guts,

24:21.700 --> 24:24.900
but it's hard to constantly be around such negativity.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.100
Stay posy, our friend Justin Russo always says.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.700
But anyway, don't get me wrong.

24:29.700 --> 24:33.060
Every now and then it's nice to have someone to vent with,

24:33.060 --> 24:35.860
but believe me when I say nobody wants that all the time.

24:35.860 --> 24:38.580
I don't know if she gets off on bitching about people or what,

24:38.580 --> 24:40.020
but lately I've taken to saying,

24:40.020 --> 24:42.100
can we just not talk about this right now?

24:42.100 --> 24:44.260
And it's like she doesn't even hear me.

24:44.260 --> 24:45.620
She completely ignores it.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.940
I've explained it to her before.

24:47.940 --> 24:49.780
She just doesn't seem to realize that it's exhausting

24:49.780 --> 24:51.220
to be around someone so angry all the time.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.300
Like I said, she's a valued friend

24:53.300 --> 24:54.980
and I just wish this one thing was different.

24:54.980 --> 24:56.100
Suggestions, how to with hate.

24:56.980 --> 24:58.260
Wait, no, no, let me try again.

24:58.260 --> 25:01.700
Suggestions, suggestions, how to with hate.

25:03.140 --> 25:04.100
This is rough, man.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.220
I can think of one or two friends off the top of my head

25:07.220 --> 25:08.900
that I just stopped hanging out with

25:08.900 --> 25:12.420
because they just brought me down all the time

25:12.420 --> 25:14.260
because it's all they talked about was negative shit.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.260
That's not just one thing that's wrong with them.

25:18.260 --> 25:22.100
Like if you are a categorically negative person,

25:22.100 --> 25:24.820
that affects every single aspect of your life

25:24.820 --> 25:27.940
and it makes you not pleasant to be around generally.

25:27.940 --> 25:30.660
Yeah, a lot of times I think the only way to go

25:30.660 --> 25:32.580
is like intervention kind of thing

25:32.580 --> 25:34.260
because I don't think there's anything,

25:34.260 --> 25:36.660
it doesn't sound like there's anything you're doing

25:36.660 --> 25:37.940
that makes her hate everyone.

25:37.940 --> 25:40.180
So it's not like a behavior you have to change,

25:41.060 --> 25:42.900
but maybe going to where I'm like-

25:42.900 --> 25:43.940
I don't wanna sound like a downer,

25:43.940 --> 25:45.460
but I don't know how you intervene with that.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.900
Like how do you tell somebody like,

25:46.900 --> 25:50.900
hey, completely change your whole worldview, please.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.500
You know how you got this worldview?

25:52.500 --> 25:53.860
Can you just flip that?

25:53.860 --> 25:55.380
Just put that to R for me.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.620
Can you bust that worldview out and flip it

25:57.620 --> 25:58.820
and then reverse it?

25:58.820 --> 26:00.900
Well, I think it's a matter of saying to her like,

26:00.900 --> 26:02.740
hey, listen, you might not see it

26:02.740 --> 26:04.100
because you're so close to it,

26:04.100 --> 26:05.860
but you complain all the time.

26:05.860 --> 26:09.380
You might wanna take a look at like your mental process

26:09.380 --> 26:11.140
and figure out why you're so unhappy.

26:11.140 --> 26:13.300
And once you do, get back to me.

26:14.020 --> 26:15.220
It's hard to be with you right now.

26:15.220 --> 26:16.500
It's hard to be around you right now

26:17.060 --> 26:18.660
because you are such a negative person.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.020
And I think you probably owe them that.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.260
I think you owe it to them to say,

26:22.260 --> 26:24.260
listen, I just can't take the negativity all the time

26:24.260 --> 26:26.420
because that'll get up in you.

26:26.420 --> 26:29.460
That will affect you and affect your day-to-day.

26:29.460 --> 26:30.660
It'll build a home inside you.

26:31.620 --> 26:32.340
Absolutely.

26:32.980 --> 26:34.580
It's like that giant song,

26:34.580 --> 26:35.780
make a little bird house in your soul,

26:35.780 --> 26:36.820
except it's not a bird house.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.420
It's like a shit house.

26:38.420 --> 26:39.540
It's like an outhouse.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.140
She's pooping in your heart is what I'm saying.

26:41.140 --> 26:43.540
And you'll get septic if you let her keep doing it.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.500
Especially if like everybody else sees that too

26:46.500 --> 26:48.980
and all of a sudden now you're also getting associated

26:48.980 --> 26:51.140
with the negativity because you're with her all the time.

26:51.700 --> 26:52.820
So there's a certain amount of like,

26:52.820 --> 26:55.780
it just seems like a really like negative influence

26:55.780 --> 26:57.300
in your life on a lot of levels.

26:58.020 --> 26:58.820
In fact, you know what?

26:58.820 --> 26:59.540
It's so negative.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.620
I say, let's go on the next question

27:01.620 --> 27:02.980
because it's bringing me down.

27:02.980 --> 27:03.460
Yeah.

27:03.460 --> 27:06.420
I feel like I'm getting my heart shit in now.

27:06.420 --> 27:06.580
Yeah.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.820
Why are you shitting in Ditto's heart?

27:08.820 --> 27:09.460
Come on.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.500
Don't shit in his heart.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.780
Look what your friend is doing now.

27:11.780 --> 27:14.340
You need better reason to cut ties?

27:14.900 --> 27:15.780
Shitting Griffin's heart.

27:17.060 --> 27:20.660
That heart's already full of blood and egg yolk.

27:20.660 --> 27:22.180
Griffin, you got a Yahoo for me?

27:22.180 --> 27:23.220
I got like four.

27:23.940 --> 27:24.420
How about this?

27:24.420 --> 27:28.260
I guess this one was sent in by Metal Gear Jim,

27:28.260 --> 27:29.540
which wasn't his Twitter name.

27:29.540 --> 27:31.540
That was his actual name on like on the email.

27:31.540 --> 27:36.420
So maybe it's by Yahoo Answers user John who asks,

27:36.980 --> 27:38.420
could I take Tyra Banks?

27:41.220 --> 27:44.580
John is five foot five, 130 pounds.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.380
And I don't work out.

27:45.940 --> 27:49.140
My GF just said that I wouldn't have a chance against Tyra.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.340
Hmm.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.460
What's the scrappiness?

27:53.460 --> 27:54.660
Is his scrappiness?

27:54.660 --> 27:56.260
It doesn't include his power rating.

27:57.140 --> 27:57.620
Yeah.

27:57.620 --> 28:00.420
Or anything like his special abilities or anything like that.

28:00.420 --> 28:04.340
But I gotta say, even if you were about six inches taller

28:04.340 --> 28:07.060
and like 20 pounds beefier and you did work out,

28:07.700 --> 28:10.580
have you seen how fierce Tyra Banks is?

28:10.580 --> 28:11.780
And look in her eyes.

28:13.460 --> 28:17.860
Plus, there's just her large like collection of knives

28:17.860 --> 28:19.780
that she carries on her person at all times.

28:20.340 --> 28:20.980
Well, yeah.

28:20.980 --> 28:23.060
But we're talking about modeling.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.740
You're just like hand to hand like.

28:24.740 --> 28:25.380
Yeah, yeah.

28:25.380 --> 28:28.660
We're talking about a backstreet brawl.

28:29.380 --> 28:31.700
No chains, no pipes.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.260
Just the fists of a man named John

28:34.260 --> 28:36.660
and the fists of a supermodel named Tyra Banks.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.020
Are there any holds barred?

28:39.860 --> 28:40.340
Let me check.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.940
There is one hold barred.

28:43.940 --> 28:44.260
Okay.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.220
You can't say anything mean about her eyelashes.

28:47.220 --> 28:47.460
Oh.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.780
Actually, that's her weak point.

28:49.780 --> 28:50.740
She's really sensitive.

28:50.740 --> 28:54.340
You also can't bring up the time she spent in Paris

28:54.340 --> 28:57.300
modeling with her mama, going from agency to agency,

28:57.300 --> 28:59.380
trying to find someone who will take her under her wing

28:59.380 --> 29:01.460
because she gets very emotional about that.

29:01.460 --> 29:04.020
She went through some shit in gay Paris

29:04.660 --> 29:07.780
and I think that that hardened her to like-

29:07.780 --> 29:08.580
People tell her,

29:11.140 --> 29:12.740
I've heard her say that, just like that.

29:13.940 --> 29:14.660
Can you translate?

29:14.660 --> 29:16.420
Can you just click Google translation?

29:16.420 --> 29:17.940
I used Google translation that said,

29:19.540 --> 29:20.340
you can't do this.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.540
We don't believe in you.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.380
You have bad eyebrows.

29:23.380 --> 29:25.220
You have bad eyebrows?

29:25.220 --> 29:26.020
Was that the word?

29:26.020 --> 29:27.220
Listen, I know.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.500
That's how they say it in Paris.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.300
The eyebrows, I love your ears.

29:34.500 --> 29:38.580
Listen, Tyra Banks will come at you like a fucking Wolverine.

29:39.300 --> 29:40.660
Not like Wolverine from X-Men,

29:40.660 --> 29:42.100
like a rabid Wolverine

29:42.100 --> 29:44.820
and also kind of like Wolverine from X-Men.

29:44.820 --> 29:46.500
Like both Wolverine from X-Men

29:46.500 --> 29:50.180
and like a rabid fan of Michigan.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.300
But on the bright side,

29:51.300 --> 29:53.060
like the next day when you see your friends

29:53.060 --> 29:54.980
and they're like, oh my God, what happened to you?

29:54.980 --> 29:57.780
You be like, oh dude, Tyra Banks fucked me up.

29:57.780 --> 29:58.900
She's got reach.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.500
First of all, she's got reach on you

30:00.500 --> 30:02.500
because she's a tall, beautiful lady.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.860
Her being beautiful has nothing to do with her reach.

30:05.860 --> 30:08.820
I just wanted to go ahead and put out the opinion

30:08.820 --> 30:10.580
that she is in fact an attractive woman.

30:11.380 --> 30:13.700
She's got nails probably, right?

30:13.700 --> 30:15.060
That's safe to assume.

30:15.060 --> 30:18.580
They're probably sharp and just the fierceness.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.340
We can't stress the fierceness enough.

30:21.940 --> 30:23.460
Once you're down on the ground bleeding

30:23.460 --> 30:25.300
like a bloody heap, she's not gonna stop.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.740
She will literally kill you.

30:26.740 --> 30:28.980
Do you think that he could take Tyra Banks

30:28.980 --> 30:30.260
if she were in her fat suit?

30:31.380 --> 30:32.740
Oh, no way.

30:32.740 --> 30:33.700
Are you kidding me?

30:33.700 --> 30:35.220
You could kick her down a flight of stairs

30:35.220 --> 30:36.100
she wouldn't even notice.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.460
Could you take her in her hobo suit?

30:38.420 --> 30:40.020
Yeah, her hobo suit, yes.

30:40.020 --> 30:42.020
Tyra also should be noted has a weave,

30:42.020 --> 30:44.660
which is basically bionics, right?

30:44.660 --> 30:45.060
Unfair.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.020
Man-made integration.

30:46.660 --> 30:47.780
Good news, John, you won.

30:47.780 --> 30:48.900
She got disqualified.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.220
She got disqualified for the use of bionics.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.940
I like my best friend's girlfriend.

30:53.940 --> 30:54.820
I'm not a total douche,

30:54.820 --> 30:56.500
so I'm not gonna try to steal her or anything,

30:56.500 --> 30:58.740
but I wonder how I could stop being interested in her.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.180
I can't talk to her just like another friend

31:02.180 --> 31:04.580
and I can't stop seeing her because of my friend,

31:05.380 --> 31:06.260
says Salazar.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.900
Why are you cheating on your best friend?

31:09.700 --> 31:10.980
Why are you such a...

31:11.540 --> 31:12.660
No, no, no, I see what he's saying.

31:12.660 --> 31:13.220
I get it.

31:13.220 --> 31:14.340
And I don't hear what he's saying

31:14.340 --> 31:15.940
because it sounds to me like he's inception cheating

31:15.940 --> 31:16.500
on his best friend.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.460
Like if you're dreaming about her,

31:17.460 --> 31:19.700
like that shit's in your mind and that counts.

31:20.260 --> 31:21.140
You lost already.

31:22.020 --> 31:24.420
Salazar, I have a suggestion for you,

31:25.140 --> 31:27.380
and that is to try to find faults with her.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.420
Like focus on the bad stuff.

31:30.420 --> 31:30.740
Out loud.

31:30.740 --> 31:32.820
Because sometimes out loud,

31:32.820 --> 31:33.460
try to say like,

31:33.460 --> 31:35.460
hey, you got shoulders like a quarterback to her

31:36.020 --> 31:37.140
and you can just really,

31:37.140 --> 31:39.060
just sort of throw a pipe bomb in there.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.260
Not literally, of course,

31:40.260 --> 31:42.820
although, I mean, problem solved.

31:42.820 --> 31:45.860
You've got, you've got eyebrows just like Tyra Banks.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.060
You've got T Banks,

31:47.060 --> 31:49.940
I brushes and that's not a compliment.

31:49.940 --> 31:50.740
I don't know what your,

31:50.740 --> 31:52.340
your eyebrow culture is in your area,

31:52.340 --> 31:54.420
but it is not a positive.

31:54.420 --> 31:55.540
I hear what you're saying,

31:56.100 --> 31:57.780
but unfortunately she has no faults.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.420
Oh, so she's so perfect.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.420
And Salazar is in love with her

32:02.420 --> 32:03.860
and maybe she's in love with him too.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.460
And maybe they have to break that sacred bond

32:07.460 --> 32:09.620
so that they can be happy for the rest of their lives.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.940
Or maybe he could imagine her pooping

32:11.940 --> 32:13.780
because maybe you can imagine her pooping.

32:13.780 --> 32:14.740
See, I didn't want to say that

32:14.740 --> 32:16.100
because we have a pretty strict

32:16.100 --> 32:18.500
non-scatological rule for our show.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.020
But if you can,

32:20.740 --> 32:23.060
if you think I will break that rule to help someone,

32:23.060 --> 32:23.940
but guess what, dog?

32:24.500 --> 32:24.980
What if it,

32:24.980 --> 32:26.820
what if you flip it and you imagine her pooping

32:26.820 --> 32:27.780
and then you love it?

32:28.740 --> 32:29.700
Oh God.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.140
Now you have a crush on your boyfriend

32:31.140 --> 32:32.100
and you're dirty.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.940
No one likes you anymore because you're dirty.

32:36.900 --> 32:39.140
Salazar, you're, you're on a tightrope.

32:39.140 --> 32:40.500
I think you should just keep on walking

32:40.500 --> 32:42.900
until you make it to the other perch.

32:42.900 --> 32:43.780
I think you're doing it.

32:43.780 --> 32:44.580
You're already,

32:44.580 --> 32:46.020
well, you're already ahead of the game

32:46.020 --> 32:47.380
because you've already like made the decision

32:47.380 --> 32:48.260
that you're not gonna,

32:48.820 --> 32:50.580
you're not gonna try anything,

32:50.580 --> 32:51.380
which is great.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.740
So, you know.

32:52.740 --> 32:53.220
That's good too.

32:53.220 --> 32:54.500
But if you've like,

32:54.500 --> 32:56.180
the harder you try to not be in,

32:56.180 --> 32:58.500
like, have you never seen a Renee Zellweger movie?

32:58.500 --> 33:01.140
Like the harder you try to not be into her,

33:01.140 --> 33:02.900
the harder you're gonna be into her.

33:02.900 --> 33:03.860
The best thing to do,

33:03.860 --> 33:05.940
and it sucks because it sounds like,

33:05.940 --> 33:07.220
you know, a non-starter,

33:07.220 --> 33:09.620
but you need to just stop thinking about her.

33:09.620 --> 33:12.580
You need to just, it's not gonna happen.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.020
It's not a thing.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.460
He loves her, Travis.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.500
Listen, Salazar,

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
have you considered going to her front door

33:18.500 --> 33:19.460
and ringing it?

33:19.460 --> 33:20.900
And also the boyfriend lives there too.

33:20.900 --> 33:23.140
And she comes down and you have a boombox

33:23.140 --> 33:23.540
and you're like,

33:23.540 --> 33:24.500
say it's Carolers.

33:24.500 --> 33:24.980
And she's like,

33:24.980 --> 33:25.860
it's Carolers.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.220
And you hold up signs

33:27.220 --> 33:29.220
that actually tell her how you feel.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.260
And then when you walk away,

33:30.260 --> 33:31.780
she runs up and she kisses you.

33:31.780 --> 33:32.180
And she says,

33:32.180 --> 33:32.820
Merry Christmas.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.500
She runs back inside and you're like,

33:34.500 --> 33:37.220
okay, I guess I'm not in love with her anymore.

33:37.220 --> 33:38.020
Hey love, actually,

33:38.020 --> 33:39.780
that's a stupid fucking conceit,

33:39.780 --> 33:40.580
by the way.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.660
That's a dumb part of your fucking stupid movie.

33:43.220 --> 33:43.940
I love you so much.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.220
Here's this big romantic gesture.

33:45.220 --> 33:46.020
All right, kiss you.

33:46.020 --> 33:46.980
I don't, we're done.

33:47.860 --> 33:48.660
I'm out.

33:48.660 --> 33:49.300
Peace, dip.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.380
I'm out, 2011.

33:51.380 --> 33:51.940
I'm out.

33:51.940 --> 33:52.820
I'm done.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.020
Salazar, do all those things

33:54.020 --> 33:55.140
and maybe it'll work.

33:55.140 --> 33:57.140
Yeah, if you learn how to control the human heart,

33:57.140 --> 33:58.980
you get right back to us, friendo.

33:58.980 --> 34:00.260
Hey, would it be out of line for me

34:00.260 --> 34:01.540
to ask your girl for her number

34:01.540 --> 34:03.380
after only the first time I meet her?

34:03.380 --> 34:04.580
What's happened to me a few times

34:04.580 --> 34:05.460
is that I'll ask the girl

34:05.460 --> 34:06.980
if she wants to grab lunch sometime

34:06.980 --> 34:08.660
and then give her my number without asking for her

34:08.660 --> 34:09.700
since I feel like I'm putting her

34:09.700 --> 34:11.220
in a less awkward position.

34:11.220 --> 34:12.420
But most of those times,

34:12.420 --> 34:13.620
they never get back to me,

34:13.620 --> 34:14.500
waiting by the phone.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.660
If you feel like you're putting her

34:18.660 --> 34:20.180
in an awkward position,

34:20.900 --> 34:22.420
why are you speaking to this person?

34:23.060 --> 34:24.500
Like it should be a pleasant thing

34:24.500 --> 34:27.300
to like plan dates and exchange phone numbers.

34:27.860 --> 34:28.500
Waiting by the phone,

34:28.500 --> 34:29.460
you got something to offer.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.380
This isn't a two-way street.

34:31.380 --> 34:32.660
You're not putting anybody

34:32.660 --> 34:33.860
in an awkward position,

34:33.860 --> 34:35.860
offering a chance to go out on a date with you.

34:35.860 --> 34:36.660
You're fun.

34:36.660 --> 34:40.740
It is the year of our Lord, 2011.

34:40.740 --> 34:41.300
Yeah.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.580
Everyone's already connected as fuck, right?

34:44.580 --> 34:47.300
I'm connected to every single person

34:48.020 --> 34:48.980
in some way,

34:49.460 --> 34:50.980
some ways more tangential than others.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.620
Just ask for a fucking number.

34:55.620 --> 34:56.660
It's not like you're asking her

34:56.660 --> 34:58.020
to like move in with you.

34:58.020 --> 34:58.900
You're not asking her

34:58.900 --> 35:00.900
to like get life insurance policies together.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.580
Is that a thing you can do?

35:03.140 --> 35:03.540
Yes.

35:03.540 --> 35:04.500
I don't know.

35:05.140 --> 35:06.180
Just ask for a number.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.540
What's the big deal?

35:07.540 --> 35:08.660
Maybe you'll call her.

35:08.660 --> 35:09.220
The thing is,

35:09.220 --> 35:12.420
is like giving her your number is really passive.

35:12.420 --> 35:15.460
Like it doesn't cause anything to happen, you know?

35:15.460 --> 35:18.020
But getting her number is an active step

35:18.020 --> 35:19.060
that shows interest

35:19.620 --> 35:21.540
and that you then, you know,

35:21.540 --> 35:22.740
can control the situation

35:22.740 --> 35:23.620
instead of sitting at home

35:23.620 --> 35:24.660
waiting for them to call you.

35:25.860 --> 35:27.540
If she doesn't want to give up your number,

35:27.540 --> 35:29.780
then if she doesn't want to give her a number,

35:29.780 --> 35:30.820
she's not down.

35:30.820 --> 35:31.300
Yeah, she ain't down.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.900
She's just trying to get it to end,

35:32.900 --> 35:34.020
get the time to end.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.940
And so then you don't have to worry about it.

35:35.940 --> 35:38.100
Like if it's okay to ask her for it or not,

35:38.100 --> 35:39.380
because if she's not down,

35:39.380 --> 35:40.660
then you don't lose anything.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.060
Like you're not going to fail

35:43.060 --> 35:44.660
because she said no.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.180
And you go, okay, well, I tried

35:46.180 --> 35:46.980
and you walk away

35:46.980 --> 35:48.660
and you move on to the next attempt.

35:49.220 --> 35:51.300
There is not everybody right now

35:51.300 --> 35:53.300
go into your mind Inception style.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.220
Get rid of the fear of being turned down

35:57.220 --> 35:58.020
because you know what?

36:00.340 --> 36:01.300
That can't hurt you.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.420
Nobody ever died from it.

36:02.420 --> 36:03.860
You get tougher and cooler.

36:03.860 --> 36:04.820
I'm still afraid of it,

36:04.820 --> 36:06.820
but that's only because I'm batting a thousand.

36:06.820 --> 36:08.500
I'm pitching a perfect game.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.100
You've never been rejected so.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.740
I've stolen every base I've tried to steal.

36:12.740 --> 36:15.380
I've baseball metaphored every baseball metaphor.

36:16.020 --> 36:18.900
And I'm afraid that one errant pitch,

36:19.540 --> 36:21.780
one errant baseball

36:21.780 --> 36:23.620
will fuck up my whole streak.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.660
Yeah, I understand that completely.

36:26.660 --> 36:27.540
I get it.

36:27.540 --> 36:29.060
And also I'm just like a really polite,

36:29.060 --> 36:30.500
like nice guy.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.620
I'm not saying that to my own horn

36:31.620 --> 36:32.980
is just the real talk.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.060
And I don't want to put a lady in a position

36:35.060 --> 36:36.180
where she has to come up with an excuse

36:36.180 --> 36:37.540
not to give me her number.

36:37.540 --> 36:38.660
That's fucked up.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.460
When I say it out loud,

36:39.460 --> 36:41.540
it sounded more fucked up than it was in my head.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.420
Well, then I don't want to be like,

36:44.420 --> 36:46.100
I'm just so busy with work right now

36:46.100 --> 36:47.460
that I can't give you my phone number.

36:47.460 --> 36:48.820
I think we should all just enter into

36:48.820 --> 36:50.180
a social contract with each other

36:50.180 --> 36:52.020
that it's okay for a guy to say,

36:52.020 --> 36:53.220
hey, can I get your number?

36:53.220 --> 36:54.980
And it's okay for the girl to say no.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.460
Yeah, see if the girl said no,

36:57.460 --> 36:58.580
if the girl said no,

36:58.580 --> 37:01.140
then I would be like happier than she was like,

37:01.140 --> 37:01.700
well, I don't know,

37:01.700 --> 37:04.020
because my aunt bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop,

37:04.020 --> 37:05.940
like lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.

37:05.940 --> 37:09.940
If you lie to me, I just feel bad

37:09.940 --> 37:10.900
because I made you lie.

37:10.900 --> 37:11.540
I made you say it,

37:11.540 --> 37:12.500
and now you have to go to hell.

37:12.500 --> 37:12.980
Peace out.

37:12.980 --> 37:13.620
Waiting by the phone,

37:13.620 --> 37:15.620
I think you should also probably get a little bit better

37:15.620 --> 37:16.900
at figuring out people are in,

37:17.540 --> 37:18.820
if people are into it,

37:18.820 --> 37:20.180
if people are feeling your flavor,

37:20.180 --> 37:22.660
because I'm not sure you are super great at that yet.

37:23.220 --> 37:24.180
You'll get there.

37:24.180 --> 37:24.900
You'll get there.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.500
Also, girls don't call guys.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.900
Sorry, that's society.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.100
You got to get on the hunt,

37:30.100 --> 37:32.100
get on the hunt, pursue,

37:32.100 --> 37:34.100
pursue a figure and passion,

37:34.100 --> 37:35.940
and don't wait for her to finish her conversation

37:35.940 --> 37:36.500
with her friends.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.980
Also, asking someone if they want to grab lunch

37:38.980 --> 37:40.660
is a passive thing that friends do.

37:40.660 --> 37:41.540
Ask her to dinner,

37:41.540 --> 37:42.420
ask her to a movie,

37:42.420 --> 37:43.540
ask her on a real date.

37:43.540 --> 37:46.020
Ask her to hold lunch.

37:46.740 --> 37:50.660
Hold, ask her to have sex with you today.

37:50.660 --> 37:51.700
Hey, I've got a Yahoo answer.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.180
Do you want to hear it?

37:52.900 --> 37:53.300
Sure.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.260
Yeah, of course.

37:54.260 --> 37:54.980
It was sent in.

37:54.980 --> 37:55.780
This is incredible.

37:55.780 --> 37:58.180
It was this exact question was sent in

37:58.180 --> 38:01.220
by both Mike Bachman and Jacob Locker.

38:01.220 --> 38:01.620
You two get married.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.460
Two heavy ass hitters

38:04.420 --> 38:06.420
in the Yahoo answer submission game

38:07.060 --> 38:08.260
that we all met.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.660
We met both of them at Praxis this past weekend.

38:10.660 --> 38:12.500
And I suspect they love juicing.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.780
They're probably juicing.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.700
They're probably on a little bit of some

38:15.700 --> 38:18.660
anabolic steroids just to get their humor muscles toned up.

38:19.940 --> 38:22.020
They are as handsome as their submissions.

38:22.020 --> 38:22.820
I will say that.

38:23.860 --> 38:24.660
This question,

38:24.660 --> 38:27.700
it was, it's written by Panda Coley who asks,

38:28.500 --> 38:30.100
is this weird for brothers?

38:31.940 --> 38:33.620
It's right in our wheelhouse, right?

38:33.620 --> 38:34.580
No, sure, I guess.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.540
I'm going to say that now.

38:36.340 --> 38:38.260
My twin brother and I take baths together

38:38.260 --> 38:40.100
because my mom wants to save money.

38:40.100 --> 38:40.900
Smart, right?

38:41.460 --> 38:44.100
We are 17 and it seems a little weird now

38:44.100 --> 38:45.220
compared to when we were young.

38:45.220 --> 38:46.500
Do you think this is weird or not?

38:48.260 --> 38:49.460
What are those ages again?

38:50.500 --> 38:51.220
They're twins.

38:51.780 --> 38:54.180
So we're assuming that they're the same age.

38:54.180 --> 38:56.100
Although it would be even weirder if they weren't.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.780
Like I'm 20 and he's eight.

38:58.740 --> 38:59.380
They're 17.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.900
Why is it taking you this long to wonder if that's weird?

39:04.900 --> 39:05.460
Hey, mommy.

39:06.180 --> 39:07.060
Hey, mommy.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.980
We both can't fit in the bathtub anymore

39:08.980 --> 39:11.940
because we have grown human adult bodies, mommy.

39:12.660 --> 39:15.220
Hey, mommy, we're full grown humans.

39:15.220 --> 39:18.900
There's no way that you can stack us in here

39:18.900 --> 39:21.540
like Tetris blocks that we're not going to touch.

39:21.540 --> 39:24.100
Your, our parts will touch.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.860
There's no bathtub big enough to have a naked shower

39:27.860 --> 39:29.140
with your 17 year old brother.

39:29.140 --> 39:30.020
That's fat.

39:30.020 --> 39:30.900
That's a fat.

39:30.900 --> 39:31.860
It's not a shower.

39:31.860 --> 39:32.580
It's a bath.

39:34.660 --> 39:36.340
When you, when you take a bath,

39:36.340 --> 39:40.980
you're making soup out of your, out of your grossness.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.660
You're making soup out of your-

39:42.660 --> 39:46.180
If I ever open like a, like a bathroom fixture store

39:46.180 --> 39:46.820
and I sell like-

39:46.820 --> 39:47.940
Or a soup store.

39:47.940 --> 39:48.820
Or a soup store.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.820
I'm going to advertise my large tub

39:50.820 --> 39:54.100
as big enough for two full grown 17 year old males.

39:55.140 --> 39:58.180
The problem is when you're in a, when you're in a bath,

39:58.180 --> 39:59.380
which is already pretty gross,

39:59.380 --> 40:00.660
you're just making broth.

40:00.660 --> 40:04.500
You're making Todd broth or Zach broth.

40:04.500 --> 40:04.980
I'm making-

40:04.980 --> 40:06.500
You're making your own gravy.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.980
When you get, when you get Tony up in there,

40:10.420 --> 40:15.060
that's officially a stew and that's unacceptable.

40:15.060 --> 40:16.260
Okay, wait, wait.

40:16.260 --> 40:17.460
I have this all figured out.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.700
The mother is not a weirdo.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.900
The mother started selling Todd and Tony stew.

40:22.900 --> 40:23.620
Yeah.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.460
Like when they were little kids

40:25.460 --> 40:27.860
and now she doesn't know how to cut off that revenue stream.

40:27.860 --> 40:28.580
This is oaky.

40:28.580 --> 40:30.180
Somebody's been playing soccer.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.780
This is getting better with age.

40:31.780 --> 40:32.900
I love this stew.

40:33.780 --> 40:36.180
You have to give me your secret recipe, Tammy.

40:36.180 --> 40:36.900
I can't.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.780
It's a dash of Todd, dash of Zach,

40:40.980 --> 40:43.780
and just like a whole bunch of weirdness

40:43.780 --> 40:45.700
that they are never going to recover from.

40:46.740 --> 40:47.940
Just can't recover from this.

40:47.940 --> 40:50.900
You can, you can really taste the scarring.

40:50.900 --> 40:53.380
The two things that aren't going to recover from the stew

40:53.380 --> 40:55.460
are your hunger and Todd and Tony.

40:55.460 --> 40:58.260
Those are the two parts that will,

40:58.260 --> 40:59.780
that will never make a comeback.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.580
What's the age?

41:00.580 --> 41:01.220
What's the cutoff?

41:01.220 --> 41:02.340
Can we come up with this right now

41:02.340 --> 41:03.620
and then we can send it to Panda Coley

41:03.620 --> 41:04.340
and just be like,

41:04.340 --> 41:06.660
you need to turn your mom into the fucking police.

41:08.500 --> 41:08.980
Five.

41:09.780 --> 41:10.900
Yeah, five.

41:11.540 --> 41:13.220
You think once you come off the T,

41:13.220 --> 41:14.180
like once you come off,

41:14.180 --> 41:15.780
I would say once you're off the T,

41:15.780 --> 41:18.100
not that I was on the T at five, come on.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.620
I'm saying like off the T,

41:19.620 --> 41:22.980
off the brothers lap in the bathtub,

41:22.980 --> 41:24.020
you fucking weirdo.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.260
Get off of there.

41:26.260 --> 41:28.260
I would say that as soon as you're old enough

41:28.260 --> 41:30.420
to no longer need a spotter,

41:30.420 --> 41:32.660
like if you're afraid of like drowning in the bathtub,

41:32.660 --> 41:34.020
make sure there's someone else in there.

41:34.740 --> 41:36.020
Okay, but wait a minute.

41:36.020 --> 41:39.060
Wait just a second because that life is like a recursive.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.340
It's like a snail shell.

41:40.340 --> 41:41.780
And once you get to be like 80,

41:41.780 --> 41:42.820
you need a spotter again.

41:42.820 --> 41:44.820
Can we start throwing 80 year olds in the same bath?

41:44.820 --> 41:45.380
Yeah.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.300
Yeah, and they shrink too.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.660
Like they get better.

41:48.660 --> 41:49.220
They do.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.780
Old people are basically Shrinky Dinks

41:51.780 --> 41:53.220
that you put in the bathtub

41:53.220 --> 41:54.100
and then you got a full-

41:54.100 --> 41:55.460
And you look at their Shrinky Dinks.

41:56.100 --> 41:59.300
I can debate the number as far as age a little bit.

41:59.300 --> 42:02.100
I can give you some wiggle room, no pun intended.

42:02.100 --> 42:05.700
But if, I have to put a firm wall on pubes.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.300
In fact, the T-shirt says,

42:07.860 --> 42:09.780
if you see a hair, you can't be there.

42:09.780 --> 42:12.180
That's the rule for me on bathtubs.

42:12.180 --> 42:15.940
Like you can't, at that point, no dice.

42:15.940 --> 42:20.820
What about, can we put an old dude

42:21.620 --> 42:24.500
and like a baby in the same bathtub?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.100
Like an 85 year old.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.580
Well, but then I feel like that's unfair to the baby

42:28.580 --> 42:30.020
because if the old man goes down,

42:30.020 --> 42:31.540
what's the baby supposed to do?

42:31.540 --> 42:32.900
Baby can't save that old man.

42:32.900 --> 42:35.220
He doesn't have the lung strength.

42:35.220 --> 42:39.460
What if we get a baby, an old man,

42:39.460 --> 42:42.260
and a 17 year old all up in the same bath?

42:42.260 --> 42:44.980
And then you gotta get them all across the river

42:44.980 --> 42:46.500
from one bath to the next.

42:46.500 --> 42:49.300
The baby, the old man will eat the baby.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.900
Yeah, no question about that.

42:50.900 --> 42:51.780
He's confused.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.780
The 17 year old will eat the grain.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.620
You have two rafts, go.

42:55.620 --> 42:56.980
Go, solve it.

42:56.980 --> 42:59.380
Hey, I wanna hear Griffin's last question.

43:00.260 --> 43:02.260
But first I wanna say thank you

43:02.260 --> 43:05.460
to everybody we met at PAX East this weekend.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.300
You were total sweethearts.

43:07.300 --> 43:09.620
We saw so many My Brother, My Brother, Me shirts.

43:10.260 --> 43:12.100
We saw our friend Brentalfloss was there.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.180
He put on a great show.

43:14.180 --> 43:17.780
And you guys were all so nice and genuine.

43:17.780 --> 43:21.460
It made me really look forward to April 17th.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.180
What up?

43:22.180 --> 43:23.540
Because it's my birthday.

43:23.540 --> 43:27.700
We'll be in Chicago and we'll be doing

43:27.700 --> 43:29.460
My Brother, My Brother, Me live

43:29.460 --> 43:31.300
opening up for Jordan and Jesse Go.

43:31.300 --> 43:32.340
What's up?

43:32.340 --> 43:32.900
Are you there?

43:32.900 --> 43:33.860
Yeah, I should say so.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.260
Tickets are gonna be way affordable.

43:36.260 --> 43:38.580
They're gonna go on sale soon, I would imagine.

43:38.580 --> 43:39.700
We'll let you know.

43:39.700 --> 43:40.420
We'll let you know.

43:40.420 --> 43:42.820
Follow us on Twitter and keep checking Maximum Fun.

43:44.340 --> 43:45.940
That really is my birthday, by the way.

43:45.940 --> 43:52.100
And we are gonna go out afterwards and get silly.

43:52.100 --> 43:53.380
We're gonna get slizzard.

43:54.340 --> 43:58.340
We are gonna get our wastey faces on.

43:58.340 --> 44:00.580
We're gonna get our dicks wet.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.540
I don't know, because we're on a water slide.

44:03.540 --> 44:05.300
We're gonna make it so wet.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.260
We're gonna go to the old town ale house

44:08.260 --> 44:09.860
and we're gonna go on a water slide

44:09.860 --> 44:11.700
because those are all over the place here in Chicago.

44:12.420 --> 44:14.020
Yeah, just streets are littered with them.

44:14.020 --> 44:16.900
I rode a water slide all the way from O'Hare to my apartment.

44:17.460 --> 44:18.500
Keep it, keep it.

44:19.380 --> 44:21.060
Keep your focus on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

44:21.940 --> 44:25.220

44:25.860 --> 44:27.620
and we will let you know about tickets and everything

44:27.620 --> 44:32.260
but it's gonna be off the chain, off the hook, off the chuck.

44:32.260 --> 44:32.760
So right.

44:33.460 --> 44:34.900
If you wanna get in touch with us,

44:34.900 --> 44:37.780

44:37.780 --> 44:39.540
You'll see our email address.

44:39.540 --> 44:41.300
We have a voicemail that you can call.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.020
What's that number, Griff?

44:44.740 --> 44:46.900
It's 203-nbnbam1.

44:46.900 --> 44:47.400
Yep.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.180
And you can call us for questions and stuff.

44:50.180 --> 44:52.820
Again, we can't thank you guys enough

44:53.460 --> 44:55.140
for your support with Maximum Fun Drive.

44:55.700 --> 44:56.260
Holy shit.

44:57.060 --> 44:58.820
We had a couple of people who, you know,

44:58.820 --> 44:59.780
groused a little bit.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.820
Most of you were just so generous

45:02.820 --> 45:06.420
and gracious about the whole thing.

45:09.060 --> 45:10.260
Seriously, it's the best.

45:10.260 --> 45:12.340
If you donated and you haven't listened

45:12.340 --> 45:13.700
to all the other shows,

45:13.700 --> 45:14.980
now is the best time to do so

45:14.980 --> 45:16.340
because you're supporting them.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.380
They're your shows.

45:18.100 --> 45:19.060
They're your shows.

45:19.060 --> 45:19.700
Go listen to them.

45:19.700 --> 45:20.660
Go give them a listen.

45:20.660 --> 45:21.860
Subscribe and shit.

45:21.860 --> 45:22.980
I don't know how podcasts work.

45:24.020 --> 45:24.740
I just make them.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.020
That's all there is to it.

45:26.020 --> 45:27.300
Hey, Griffin.

45:27.300 --> 45:27.800
Hey.

45:28.580 --> 45:29.140
I'm ready.

45:29.140 --> 45:31.300
Oh, one more time just to remind you.

45:31.300 --> 45:32.980
Go check out kingdomofliving.com

45:32.980 --> 45:34.020
if you haven't.

45:34.020 --> 45:35.140
Go do it right now.

45:35.140 --> 45:36.020
It's free.

45:36.020 --> 45:37.780
It's free as fuck.

45:37.780 --> 45:38.980
So fucking free.

45:39.860 --> 45:40.360
Do it.

45:43.540 --> 45:44.040
Oh, man.

45:45.060 --> 45:45.940
How about this?

45:45.940 --> 45:51.380
So this one's sent in by Jackie or Jaqui Ronan.

45:52.260 --> 45:54.020
There's a Q and a U in there.

45:54.020 --> 45:55.380
I'm just spitballing.

45:55.380 --> 45:57.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Zoraz.

45:57.780 --> 46:03.220
Who says Quidditch for dogs?

46:03.220 --> 46:04.180
Is this true?

46:07.300 --> 46:08.500
This is Justin McElroy.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.100
This is Travis McElroy.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.780
This is Griffin McElroy.

46:11.780 --> 46:14.020
This is my brother, my brother and me.

46:14.020 --> 46:15.540
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

46:19.380 --> 46:21.140
Keep your heart, three stacks.

46:21.140 --> 46:22.100
Keep your heart.

46:22.100 --> 46:24.260
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

46:24.260 --> 46:25.300
Keep your heart.

46:25.300 --> 46:27.300
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks.

46:27.300 --> 46:28.980
These girls are smart.

46:28.980 --> 46:58.740
Play your card.
