WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.640 --> 00:50.000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's pretty hot out there. Check the thermostat, rising the mercury,

00:50.000 --> 00:56.960
squeezing up like so much red toothpaste out of a tube. Who's ready to party with summer jams?

00:56.960 --> 01:01.440
Welcome to MBMBAM, home of the worst metaphors in town.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.720
K-M-M-B-M-B-A-M, your one stop shop for summer classics.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.040
Hey Beach Babies, how's your bikinis?

01:10.480 --> 01:13.680
Hey Beach Babies. How's your termites?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.360
You guys like CeeLo Green?

01:16.480 --> 01:21.360
Tune in as we workshop new characters like Hey Bikini Babies, how's those bikinis guy?

01:21.360 --> 01:26.640
Nothing but coolers and babes, that's all.

01:26.640 --> 01:34.240
Crack open a nice cold beer, and we'll find a butt like Shalala.

01:38.240 --> 01:43.440
Make sure to join us at McGillicuddy's deck for party on McGillicuddy's deck.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.680
To the sequel.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.640
Party your deck off at McGillicuddy's.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.880
Get your deck wet.

01:50.880 --> 01:55.520
Come get your deck wet with $2 smushers plushes all night long.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.840
The hottest babes, the hottest guys, the drunkest children.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.680
The wildest monkeys.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.880
The craziest poop throwing monkeys you've ever seen.

02:08.880 --> 02:14.160
And good news ladies, margaritas are just $3 all night long.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.080
Monkeys getting free till midnight.

02:16.080 --> 02:23.120
Hey monkey it's 1230, come on in anyway, it's McGillicuddy's.

02:23.120 --> 02:27.520
21 and up for male monkeys, 18 for female monkeys.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.480
I don't even know if monkeys live that long, what the fuck?

02:31.280 --> 02:37.600
Half man half monkeys will be submitted for study at research institutes nationwide.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.840
So Summer's here, Summer's here again.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.000
Summer, my worst enemy.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.480
Do you know what doesn't go well?

02:50.480 --> 02:54.080
Two chemical compounds that in nature just do not collude.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.280
What's that Griffin?

02:55.280 --> 02:56.960
That's Griffin McRoy in shorts.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.840
They are magnetically opposed.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.200
You know what I think that is, in my opinion?

03:05.200 --> 03:09.840
It's a mental block that you're having because no one looks good in shorts.

03:09.840 --> 03:15.760
That's not entirely true, early 2000s Jessica Simpson.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.920
Well that's different.

03:17.920 --> 03:23.200
She had like a, there was a three month window where one person looked good in shorts.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.640
That's not, that's the exception that proves the rule, please.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.040
So shorts, I'm with you on that, but I've given up.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.920
That's the thing, that's the thing you have to do.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.760
So now you wear a utilikilt, which is I think the sartorial,

03:37.760 --> 03:40.400
the sartorial equivalent of giving up.

03:41.360 --> 03:46.480
Listen, I don't want to be, I don't want to come down and get on people in utilikilts

03:47.520 --> 03:49.920
that those people have had enough to deal with.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.920
But they probably could have come up with a better name to not make it so ridiculous, but go on.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.520
Yeah, I think that's the point though, isn't it?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.400
What about dirty skirts?

03:59.200 --> 03:59.840
What don't they call that?

03:59.840 --> 04:01.040
Dirty skirty.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.240
Dirty skirt.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.720
What about just like cargo pants, but without the thing in the middle?

04:06.720 --> 04:08.800
Yeah, legless cargo pants.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.320
Plaid legless cargo pants.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.400
One big pocketed leg.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.000
So as you've certainly guessed, this is My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.400
and it's an advice show for the modern era.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.120
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.360
I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.840
I am your youngest brother, Griffin McElroy.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.880
And we're here to dole out the advice to you, take your queries,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.760
and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

04:37.760 --> 04:38.960
So let's just dip in.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.680
I order Chinese food from the same place every other week or so.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.440
Every time it comes, it's the same guy delivering it to me,

04:47.440 --> 04:53.120
and recently I've noticed my order has had more things like fortune cookies and all in it.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.080
Recently, I even found a bottle of juice I didn't order.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.920
He's really cute and is usually friendly and chatty when he delivers the stuff.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.720
Is this sudden extra food his way of flirting, and how should I respond?

05:04.720 --> 05:07.520
For the record, I am gay, so no problems there.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.720
Why did you have to read that last part like that?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.200
There's an exclamation point at the end.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.080
So that's, I'm just, I'm just reading with the text.

05:16.080 --> 05:20.000
But you didn't think that all homosexual people talk like that all the time?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.680
No, no, I wouldn't say that.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.960
That's from Hungry and Awkward.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.600
So can you guys help, you guys know I'm gender blind.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.800
Can you guys help me understand the genders in this situation?

05:28.800 --> 05:30.480
They're both men.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.360
They're both gentlemen.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.440
Well, I don't think I'll say gentlemen.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.840
I don't know, you know, their habits and proclivities.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.880
I know that they are men.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.800
Are, do we know that the question asker is a man?

05:40.800 --> 05:41.120
Yes.

05:41.120 --> 05:41.360
Yeah.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.480
How do you know?

05:43.760 --> 05:48.480
Because, so man, I kind of took it to read, no, no problems there.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.080
Like, nothing can come of it.

05:50.080 --> 05:54.720
Oh, see, I know that they are a man because I read all the emails and I know that this had

05:54.720 --> 05:56.160
a male name attached to it.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.280
Okay, let's roll with that.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.040
See, that's the kind of context clues I really like.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.000
Now wait, are you sure that it was a male name?

06:02.640 --> 06:04.720
A male name applied to a male.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.440
Ooh.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.960
I have to assume so.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.520
All right.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.960
You don't have to assume anything.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.600
Assuming makes an ass out of you and Ming the Merciless.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.800
This is so sexy already.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.480
This is getting really hot in here.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.280
A few things to consider.

06:19.280 --> 06:25.280
First off, you are entering into a dangerous situation because in wanting to see this gentleman

06:25.280 --> 06:29.520
more, you're going to order more Chinese food and that's not going to help you get your health

06:29.520 --> 06:29.840
right.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.800
Yeah, and that's also not really sexy for this dude.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.480
Like, he's like, you eat Chinese food like nine times a day.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.160
I can barely care for myself.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.280
I'm basically Meals on Wheels over here.

06:45.040 --> 06:53.040
I mean, don't we have a strict anti-workplace to customer dating rule against that thing?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.640
Especially with, well, no.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.480
Not in 2012.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.920
I was about to say, especially when that person is forced to come to your house.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.680
He knows where you fucking live, dog.

07:01.680 --> 07:07.680
Like, if this goes down and he goes full-blown swing fan, you will have no recourse.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.920
I have a question for you.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.080
How much do you like this Chinese food?

07:12.080 --> 07:16.880
Are you willing to risk having a relationship with this person and then not being able to

07:16.880 --> 07:19.440
order your favorite black pepper chicken anymore?

07:21.440 --> 07:23.520
What is important to you?

07:23.520 --> 07:25.360
Like, where are your priorities at?

07:25.920 --> 07:29.600
Maybe this place is the only place that makes, like, every other place makes a crab rangoon

07:29.600 --> 07:30.080
too sweet.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.120
And this is the one that's always a problem.

07:33.120 --> 07:33.520
It is.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.160
That's a problem.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.360
Here's the thing.

07:35.360 --> 07:40.480
What I love is, if this is the case, if this gentleman is flirting with you, I love that

07:40.480 --> 07:43.440
he's like, I'm just going to slip a bottle of juice in there.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.240
He'll know what's up.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.400
That's a weird, it is a weird flirt.

07:48.400 --> 07:54.400
Although I've been ordering from the same Chinese place, the China Garden on 8th Street,

07:55.520 --> 07:59.840
right across the street from the former biker bar, the Valhalla Club.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.720
Oh, and a catty corner to Jeff's bike shop, if I remember correctly.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.080
Yeah, right around that neighborhood.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.000
So if you're ever in Huntington, now you know where all those things are.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.960
Yeah, if you need a bike fixed or a place that used to be a biker bar and now isn't.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.600
It's a block and a half down from City Hall.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.880
Right, exactly.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.840
That helps you place it.

08:19.280 --> 08:23.120
I order from this place and I'd say seven out of ten times when we order,

08:24.480 --> 08:29.120
there is a tub of brown chicken-y something.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.560
And on top-

08:30.560 --> 08:31.520
Question sauce.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.040
The word, no, no, no, there'll be stuff in it.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.120
And on the top is written the word free.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.760
Hey, this is free.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.320
I'm not going to tell you about the contents of it.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.520
It's free.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.280
This hate meat is priced to move.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.840
By which we mean nothing.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.960
Did you want to eat this?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.000
These are our drippings.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.960
They're all yours.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.160
I got you some chicken cracklins and they're free.

08:58.160 --> 08:58.960
Don't question it.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.240
So that is to say, I don't know.

09:00.240 --> 09:06.080
I used to order the Chinese and get, he would bring like in a paper bag and

09:06.080 --> 09:10.960
when I dig to the bottom of the bag, there are always two cans of soda in there that I did not

09:10.960 --> 09:17.840
like ask for, but like it was part of like a meal deal and it was always like diet cherry seven up.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.440
Yeah, nothing you would ever consider.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.560
Yeah, my fridge-

09:20.560 --> 09:21.920
Coffee flavored Faygo.

09:23.120 --> 09:28.320
My fridge is littered with a bunch of like diet tangerine Fanzas.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.280
And it's like, I don't know, maybe someday someone will come to my home

09:31.280 --> 09:32.320
who will want to drink this.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.680
I feel bad just chucking it.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.000
Now it's a collector's item.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.560
There's a, the place I, this is embarrassing, but the place I order from China Garden again,

09:43.440 --> 09:45.680
the same guy is always there.

09:46.320 --> 09:54.000
And this guy has a, I would say, let's say fundamental understanding of the English language.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.400
But here is the one thing that he does really, really well is his spiel when you order.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.520
So it gets to this point where it is so practiced and rehearsed.

10:05.520 --> 10:13.600
This man says the exact same things with the exact same intonation every single time.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.560
And while at first it was very strange, it became-

10:19.120 --> 10:19.840
Comforting.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.960
Weirdly, it became weirdly comforting.

10:22.960 --> 10:23.600
That's like a level-

10:23.600 --> 10:26.320
To know that in this crazy world, there's always that one pillar you can rely on.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.240
There's this one guy I can call.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.640
I can call, and then it became even worse.

10:30.640 --> 10:35.840
Like then I started feeling really guilty because it's like I'm, my main thing I like

10:35.840 --> 10:39.200
about this guy in the way, is the way in which he is kind of like a robot.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.960
He's a serve, like a serve, serve machine.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.040
And it's not, it's not fair of me.

10:45.040 --> 10:50.400
I have felt that level of trust and familiarity that one might feel for a lover for maybe

10:51.680 --> 10:54.480
one restaurant my entire life.

10:54.480 --> 10:59.200
It was Hot Locks Cool Sushi in Chicago.

10:59.200 --> 11:03.440
And it was right across the street, down the corner, around that corner, and then down

11:03.440 --> 11:04.320
a little bit more.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.520
And it was so good.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.640
It was the best food.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.800
And I, they were family to me, you know?

11:10.800 --> 11:15.200
And I just don't, I don't think I could ever jeopardize that for any reason.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.800
Guys, I shit you not.

11:16.800 --> 11:23.280
In my phone, I have countless friends and family, and I have one restaurant number saved

11:23.280 --> 11:23.920
in my phone.

11:23.920 --> 11:24.880
Can I guess?

11:24.880 --> 11:25.280
Yeah.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.320
Is it Gino's?

11:26.320 --> 11:28.720
No, it's China Garden Buffet.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.000
And I haven't lived in Huntington for three years.

11:32.000 --> 11:32.480
Yeah.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.560
I've changed phones twice.

11:34.560 --> 11:41.200
And also, just so I'm clear to visitors of Huntington, future visitors of Huntington,

11:41.200 --> 11:45.600
China Garden's probably like the, like the fourth best.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.040
Yeah, I saw you leaning towards third and I was gonna nudge you back.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.080
It's not good.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.840
Like, you wanna go to, if you want buffet, you're gonna go and wanna go out to Barbara's

11:53.840 --> 11:55.040
Building and get a super China buffet.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.520
Or you can hit Taste of Asia.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.880
Taste of Asia has Thai and Japanese and Chinese.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.200
Or Thai House, if you just want, if you just want Thai.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.560
If you want something fancy, go Hibachi.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.600
Yeah, yeah, it's the fifth, okay, I'm sorry.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.840
It's the fifth best place you can go.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.960
But they're the only place that delivers to me, and I really like this guy.

12:13.600 --> 12:13.840
I mean-

12:13.840 --> 12:17.200
Okay, so here's the thing, question, ask her to jump back.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.280
I've been thinking about it while we've been BSing.

12:19.280 --> 12:25.760
And I would say that if, here's like a little addendum to our, you know,

12:25.760 --> 12:31.200
don't flirt with someone at a place of business, especially if it involves tipping.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.960
Because you can confuse how much they like, how well you tip and give you extra stuff

12:36.960 --> 12:40.880
and like sneak you extra drinks and stuff for flirting.

12:41.680 --> 12:46.320
But they're playing up the tip, and it's ambiguous enough that I would say don't risk it.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.240
Don't risk it, because I feel the same way at a bar, you know, where it's like,

12:50.240 --> 12:52.560
I tip well so the bartenders are all really like me.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.000
That doesn't mean they're craving my wave, you know?

12:56.560 --> 12:57.280
Sure, sure.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.720
Do you guys want a Yahoo answer?

13:02.000 --> 13:02.320
Yes.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.040
Yeah?

13:03.040 --> 13:08.080
This one was sent in by T-Dollar Sign, which I pronounce T-Money.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.600
I thought it was T-Dollar.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.640
T-Dollar!

13:10.640 --> 13:11.360
Thank you, T-Dollar.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.960
It's by Yahoo Answers user, oh, Ned has a big penis.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.840
Oh Ned, you are such a character.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.440
Can I high five a driver in an oncoming vehicle?

13:26.160 --> 13:29.600
Sometimes when I drive with my windows down, I have an uncanny urge to high five

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
other drivers with their window down.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.400
Let's say we're traveling around 35 to 40 miles an hour.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.560
If I were to extend my hand out for this celebratory gesture and engage the driver

13:38.560 --> 13:40.320
traveling in the opposing direction.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.920
Oh, I love these kinds of questions.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.880
Also traveling around 35 to 40 miles an hour, would said hands break leaving us to be exchanging

13:46.880 --> 13:49.280
high fives with our right hands in the emergency room?

13:50.240 --> 13:54.960
Okay, this is one of those circumstances in which we have to talk about the difference

13:54.960 --> 13:56.880
between can and may.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.320
Right.

13:58.320 --> 13:58.880
Can you?

13:59.520 --> 13:59.920
Maybe.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.200
May you?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.000
No, you may not.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.880
No, I'm sorry.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.320
I think this, I don't think there's like a safe speed for this.

14:10.320 --> 14:17.520
Like part parked, I guess you could do high fives there, but what's the point?

14:18.240 --> 14:18.960
Yeah, right.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.240
That's not like exciting.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.200
The impact has got to be crazy, right?

14:25.200 --> 14:30.720
In high school, when we were in driver's ed class, they told us that they told us that

14:31.280 --> 14:40.080
if you had a tissue box in the back of your car and you were in a and you ran into a white

14:40.080 --> 14:46.560
a wall at going 35 miles an hour, that you would, that you would die.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.720
Because the tissue box would become a fly.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.520
Are those two things connected or is it like, oh, what you're saying is it's like an omen.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.120
There's a tissue box in the car.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.280
It's like seeing a raven, you're going to die.

14:57.280 --> 15:02.320
I'm saying that they told us the tissue box would fly forward with such velocity that

15:02.320 --> 15:04.560
it would kill you, that it could kill you.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.440
So this was your driving teacher slash gym instructor, right?

15:09.440 --> 15:11.280
This was a man who sat outside the school.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.360
This is something an old boy would do.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.760
Beware the tissue box, kids.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.600
It's how we lost my second and fifth wife.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.920
We can all agree that high fives are, you rate them.

15:25.920 --> 15:32.960
The metric for the value of a high five is how like hard, hard you do it and how loud

15:32.960 --> 15:33.680
the smack is.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.040
Yeah, it's how epic the smack is.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.920
I literally, the other day I high fived my friend Linnea and the smack, the high five

15:39.920 --> 15:45.200
was so like loud and thunderous that we high fived again to celebrate that high five.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.760
It's hard to high five Travis because he has, I would say a beefy hand.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.920
Oh yeah, this thing, oh God.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.560
It's very, it's deep.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.240
It's enriched, you know?

15:58.880 --> 16:03.360
It's hard to get a satisfying smack with you because usually I pull back a little bit in

16:03.360 --> 16:04.160
fear.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.600
That's fair, that's fair.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.120
Sure, you're terrified.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.240
You fear the power.

16:08.240 --> 16:13.520
Can we also agree that going 35 miles an hour and high fiving somebody else going 35 miles

16:13.520 --> 16:18.400
an hour, that smack, that smack could cleave the world in two.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.160
Like it's gonna be amazing.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.640
You can see the sound waves coming off of it.

16:22.640 --> 16:27.280
Are you suggesting that it would be worth it to lose your hand to create a high five

16:27.280 --> 16:28.080
heard around the world?

16:30.080 --> 16:33.200
I'm all about like doing something that nobody on the planet has ever done.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.840
I don't know that anybody's, somebody's probably done this before.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.680
This seems like something like Travis Pastrana and Johnny Knoxville have done.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.320
Yeah.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.640
Those kinds of stupid morons.

16:42.640 --> 16:47.120
Or two rural kids who watch a lot of Jackass.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.240
After ghost riding the whip, they then high fived each other.

16:50.240 --> 16:50.740
Sure.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.120
I don't know if it'll break your hand or not.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.760
Well yeah, I think it'll definitely break your hand because you'll want to move through.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.440
Even at like 10 miles an hour?

17:01.440 --> 17:05.520
Yeah, I think so because you're still going.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.360
Like that's the thing is it doesn't stop there.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.600
You're not gonna have time to hit and pull back.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.080
You know what I mean?

17:10.080 --> 17:11.920
I think it's exponential though, right?

17:11.920 --> 17:18.800
Like if I'm running at you at 10 miles an hour, that's about my speed.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.280
And you're running at me 10 miles an hour.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.360
You think you run at 10 miles an hour?

17:23.360 --> 17:25.360
That's not a very good speed, Justin.

17:25.360 --> 17:25.860
What?

17:26.320 --> 17:28.000
I think you can probably run faster than that.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.080
Babies run at 10 miles an hour.

17:30.080 --> 17:36.160
But I'm saying if you are doing a running high five and you high five somebody, that would be safe.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.600
Why would it be different in the car?

17:37.600 --> 17:42.400
Aside from the fact that like you are definitely engaging in some unsafe driving practices.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.320
Yeah, that's the other thing.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.240
Okay, they don't tell you in driving school to put your hands out the window,

17:48.240 --> 17:49.840
slapping another man's hand and two.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.720
So hold on one second.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.480
I need to pause the episode so I can watch an episode of Beakman's World to find out if this

17:56.480 --> 17:57.600
is a good idea or not.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.400
Hold on.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.640
All right, we'll catch up with Travis in 30.

18:01.520 --> 18:06.320
Nope, a man in a giant rad suit just told me this is a fucking stupid ass idea.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.760
Are there any responses?

18:07.760 --> 18:11.520
Did anybody weigh in?

18:11.520 --> 18:12.480
Some science teacher?

18:12.480 --> 18:15.760
There's always, I find that whenever somebody has a question like this on Yahoo Answers,

18:15.760 --> 18:20.400
there's typically, not always, but typically some self-important science teacher that feels

18:20.400 --> 18:24.560
like he has to, like this is the kids in his class to listen to him.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.920
So maybe the kids on Yahoo Answers will dig his facts.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.520
Like, hey, this is kind of a relevant example, the kids of today.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.880
That makes science cool.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.640
And somebody's linked to like the St. Petersburg Herald or something of like,

18:36.640 --> 18:39.280
man loses arm in tragic high-fiving accident.

18:39.840 --> 18:45.760
Actually, in this case, we get a Yahoo Answers user, I'm really tall, account two.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.120
Apparently account one was compromised.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.120
No, he's so tall he needs two accounts.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.040
He says, stretch out.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.000
Nope, I've done this before.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.080
If you're both doing it at 40 miles an hour, then it will just sting.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.840
If you both throw your hand forwards while you're driving 40 miles an hour,

19:03.840 --> 19:05.120
then you might break your hand.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.760
Source, high fives oncoming cars.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.640
Wait a minute, hold on.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.400
The 40 miles an hour you're driving in a car won't break your hand.

19:14.400 --> 19:20.960
But if you give it that extra umph of your own body, that's like, that's a thin line, right?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.480
Well, I guess it's the give, right?

19:22.480 --> 19:26.720
Because you can high five somebody and then let your arm just sort of like go back.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.760
Here's the problem.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.080
Once this gets solved, it's going to escalate.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.760
And pretty soon kids will be trying to do a thumb war at 40 miles an hour.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.600
Yeah, that, I mean, that's the fear, isn't it?

19:35.600 --> 19:38.480
You go up to high five somebody, but they grab onto your hand.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.520
You're both pulled through your windows as your cars fly out.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.720
You do kind of a windmill action.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.160
Yeah, you spin around in the air.

19:46.880 --> 19:51.600
Guys, I just got the best idea for Wanted 2, the movie.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.400
I'll be right back.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.240
I have to, I have to update my spec script.

19:58.160 --> 20:03.200
Angelina Jolie and oncoming Brad Pitt.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.080
Yeah, we got him.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.320
Slow down momentarily as they grasp hands.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.760
Their eyes meet.

20:09.760 --> 20:17.200
They are wrenched from their vintage 1962 car.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.280
There is a, there is a WordPad document open on Justin's computer right now

20:21.280 --> 20:22.640
that just says vintage on it.

20:25.040 --> 20:30.800
I'll wake up out of this, out of the heroin induced haze that I'm in right now

20:30.800 --> 20:34.480
in 72 hours and think, why did I write vintage?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.440
That doesn't make sense.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.960
I just typed vintage and then there's a picture of Angelina Jolie

20:38.960 --> 20:41.920
pasted into Microsoft Paint.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.640
What was I doing?

20:43.280 --> 20:46.080
Guys, I don't know if you know this, but we have a very, very special sponsor this week.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.120
It's the IFC.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.280
They're promoting their new show, Comedy Bang Bang.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.280
It starts this Friday, June 8th at 10, 9 central on the Independent Film Channel.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.720
Check your TV guide, find it.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.880
The first episode has Amy Poehler.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.320
The show is hosted by Scott Aukerman, who is absolutely hilarious.

21:00.320 --> 21:04.560
You can watch the first episode before it goes live on IFC.com right now,

21:04.560 --> 21:08.080
or just go to the Comedy Bang Bang IFC Facebook page and see it there.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.840
It's comedy so nice, they banged it twice.

21:11.840 --> 21:16.320
And it's going to have people like Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, Seth Rogen,

21:16.320 --> 21:17.280
just to name a few people.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.720
So, so go check it out.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.320
I just started at uni.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.000
God, guys, come on.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.600
You are going to college.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.440
This is an American show for everybody in the world.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.560
So can we please call it what everybody in the world calls it, college.

21:31.120 --> 21:31.840
Adult school.

21:32.480 --> 21:37.040
I just started at big boy school and I'm trying to make new friends there.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.440
But I feel like if I try approaching any girls, they would feel creeped out

21:41.440 --> 21:42.720
or like I was hitting on them.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.360
I have a long-term girlfriend, so I'm not even interested in that way.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.720
Should I be worried about this?

21:48.720 --> 21:51.120
And if not, how do I shake this feeling?

21:51.680 --> 21:54.080
That's from girlfriends, not girlfriend.

21:56.400 --> 22:00.400
Number one, you're in college now and that makes them women.

22:01.280 --> 22:01.600
Yes.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.360
So say it like that.

22:05.360 --> 22:05.840
Don't.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.000
And then they'll know you're not hitting on them.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.120
Hello, women or ladies.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.720
Hello, ladies.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.120
Women.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.160
Are there any females?

22:16.160 --> 22:18.080
Are there any women here?

22:19.600 --> 22:23.360
I'm just a 21st century man looking for some women.

22:24.160 --> 22:29.200
My friend Daniel said, hey, Dylan, go talk to those girls.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.160
And I said, Daniel, those are not girls.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.760
They are women.

22:34.960 --> 22:38.480
So women, anyone care to prove me right?

22:39.040 --> 22:42.720
So women, anyone seen the latest episode of Doctor Who?

22:42.720 --> 22:45.520
I think-

22:45.520 --> 22:48.320
Isn't it a shame what they're doing to community?

22:48.320 --> 22:49.680
Let's be best friends.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.760
Does anyone want to try some absinthe?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.800
We are in college after all.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.120
Definitely not uni.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.040
Can I interest anyone in an orgy?

23:01.840 --> 23:05.120
You're gonna have a problem not creeping anyone out.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.840
It's like you talk like that.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.600
Why are you talking like that?

23:09.600 --> 23:14.240
I feel like all college freshmen are just big balls of creepo.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.480
And they don't know how to talk to people.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.120
And it's not a personal problem as much as it is a community's problem,

23:23.120 --> 23:24.320
a social problem.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.280
Because everybody's like just as terrified as you are.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.240
And you know, here's the thing.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.120
Like I'm a person who is not terrified and very outgoing.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.520
And I'll like walk right up to someone and start a conversation.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.680
And I did that in college and thought I was just killing it.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.240
And everyone's like, oh, Travis, he's annoying.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.840
He's really, really weird.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.520
It's on everybody's nerves.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.000
Yeah.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.560
So like you literally can't win.

23:44.560 --> 23:47.040
Like either you're sitting in a corner afraid to talk to everyone,

23:47.040 --> 23:49.280
or you're talking to everybody and you're an asshole.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.240
So it's like it's so hard to walk that fine line.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.440
But I think what will help is that you have a girlfriend.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.480
You literally are not interested in them in that way.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.240
And if they're willing to like even give you a chance,

24:02.240 --> 24:04.560
that kind of thing comes across really quickly.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.840
And I don't think you have to worry about it.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.120
Here's the problem though.

24:07.120 --> 24:11.760
He's in a committed relationship with a long-term girlfriend,

24:11.760 --> 24:16.400
which makes him irresistible to women.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.680
I don't think that's true.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.800
Well, we've talked about this before though.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.280
That's because he's not trying.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.600
That's because there's like no stakes.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.600
And that is very attractive when someone is not putting it out there.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.960
But that's the problem though.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.200
This guy's walking into these situations, right?

24:33.200 --> 24:36.480
With the confidence of somebody who is already in a relationship.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.040
Which is making him irresistible.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.640
This guy's basically asking,

24:40.640 --> 24:46.720
how do I get put into the quote unquote friend zone?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.560
As distasteful as I typically am.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.000
That's not a real thing.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.600
But that's a really great thing because we get asked all the time,

24:53.600 --> 24:55.760
like how do I get out of the friend zone?

24:55.760 --> 24:56.560
I love this.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.040
Like how do I put myself in it?

24:59.040 --> 25:02.080
How do I not get all the pussy is what he's asking.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.480
Guys, I'm just going to be inundated with all of these vaginas.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.000
They got so much trim.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.080
They got it to give, but I don't want it.

25:10.080 --> 25:10.960
Don't need it.

25:10.960 --> 25:11.360
Know how.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.080
Keep it ladies.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.520
I don't think it's that ubiquitous.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.880
I think this is a bigger problem other than just genders.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.000
And it's how do you make friends with anyone ever anywhere on the planet?

25:23.760 --> 25:26.320
I don't think you should flatter yourself so much by saying,

25:26.320 --> 25:29.840
I don't want all these women to think I'm trying to, you know,

25:29.840 --> 25:32.800
Dr. Suave on them and then they know they like they,

25:33.520 --> 25:36.160
I'm afraid that they're just going to come at me too much.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.240
If that's a problem, it's probably not a problem.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.360
No, I think he's saying that he's afraid that they're going to think

25:41.360 --> 25:44.320
he's creeping on them when really he's just trying to make friends.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.760
But I would say that that is once again, as you said, Griffin,

25:47.760 --> 25:49.840
universal and not just for one gender.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.840
I think anybody, if you just roll up and you're like,

25:51.840 --> 25:53.440
hey, let's be best friends now.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.200
They're going to be like, uh, no.

25:55.200 --> 25:59.760
The only way you make friends in college is A, you have classes with them.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.760
And then you just sort of bond there.

26:01.760 --> 26:08.960
Or B, you have like this friend with this impossibly magical charm to them

26:08.960 --> 26:12.480
who brings you friends, like some sort of loyal dog.

26:12.480 --> 26:12.880
Yes.

26:12.880 --> 26:19.040
So if you can hang out with Michael Bradbury or Trevor David or me, you'll be fine.

26:19.040 --> 26:19.920
I, well.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.320
Yeah, no, I'm very charming.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.680
It might surprise you to learn, Griffin,

26:23.680 --> 26:25.360
that I'm actually a very charming person.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.480
That's something all charming people say.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.040
We're all very self-aware.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.840
Now, usually we don't pull back this curtain and tell everyone about it,

26:31.840 --> 26:35.760
but I got special permission for this occasion to let you guys know.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.800
Is it like a curse?

26:37.520 --> 26:38.160
Is it like-

26:38.160 --> 26:39.440
It's a blessing and a curse.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.000
You know how like-

26:40.000 --> 26:42.480
We talk about it at all the meetings at Charming Anonymous,

26:42.480 --> 26:45.120
which I really shouldn't be telling you about because it defeats the purpose.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.480
It's like if you say Rumpelstiltskin's name, he loses all of his power.

26:48.480 --> 26:53.680
It's like if you ever see Travis eat anything, then he loses his magic charm.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.520
Yeah, that's why I eat so quickly to try to get it over with as fast as possible.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.840
I don't actually think that's why you eat so quickly.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.440
I'm almost certain it is.

27:01.440 --> 27:05.360
I think you eat so quickly because you're excited to have the food and you don't-

27:06.400 --> 27:09.440
And that is also why if you try to take my plate away, I will bite your hand.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.320
Yeah, sure.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.400
Sometimes Griffin has to put this rubber ball in my food so I don't gulp it,

27:14.400 --> 27:15.920
because then I'll get a tummy ache.

27:15.920 --> 27:22.240
Hey, that was funny when you guys were talking just now.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.320
Justin, you gotta step-

27:24.320 --> 27:25.680
Welcome back to the show, Justin.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.000
You gotta step on board.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.040
I really did.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.960
For the last two minutes, I've been a listener of My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.920
Actually, to be more technical, My Brother, and Me,

27:37.920 --> 27:41.920
not to be confused with the hit Nickelodeon kid-com, My Brother, and Me.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.880
So welcome back.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.840
So I'm back now.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.160
How about a Yahoo?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.200
I just thought that part was funny.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.080
I'm gonna tell people about that part.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.600
Guys, you gotta listen to this bit on my favorite podcast that I happen to be on.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.040
Here's a Yahoo answer.

27:59.040 --> 27:59.840
Okay.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.680
This Yahoo was sent in by David Myers.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.720
Thank you, David.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.680
Hey, thanks, David.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nosy C, who asks,

28:06.640 --> 28:10.480
I am telling my dad the truth about my boyfriend's age on Sunday.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.160
How can I start the conversation off?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.800
I am 17, and he's 23.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.720
My dad thinks he is 20.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.960
What can I say to him to start the conversation off?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
What?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.960
What?

28:22.960 --> 28:29.360
There's a three-year age difference, and you're worried about, I mean, is that a massive difference?

28:29.360 --> 28:31.840
No, no, there's a six-year, there's a six-year age difference.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.920
No, no, but there's a three-year difference in your dad's perception and reality.

28:35.920 --> 28:40.880
I like that this person is 17 and started dating this 23-year-old, and she was like,

28:40.880 --> 28:43.680
okay, I'm going to have to lie to my dad about the age.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.920
He's never going to buy 18.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.280
Let's split the difference.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.240
Yeah.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.280
What's the most believable lie I could possibly...

28:51.280 --> 28:58.880
He's not going to buy 17, because my boyfriend has a full beard for that job, so 20?

28:58.880 --> 29:02.480
The dad probably knows already, the dad was probably like,

29:02.480 --> 29:05.120
hey, can you rent me a car in a couple of years?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.560
I'm thinking of going on a trip.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.160
Like, oh, yeah, no problem, Mr.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.120
God damn it.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.880
God damn it.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.680
God damn it.

29:11.680 --> 29:14.240
The dad was talking, he was like, hey, how about Smurfs, son?

29:14.240 --> 29:15.280
He's like, yeah, I love those.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.160
I knew it.

29:16.160 --> 29:16.880
Yeah.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.680
Damn it.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.320
Gargamel always getting into it.

29:20.320 --> 29:28.080
He would give him the first half of Great Bits from Cheers, and he would finish them.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.280
Sam and Diane, huh?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.040
When are they ever going to get together?

29:31.040 --> 29:32.240
I know, right?

29:32.240 --> 29:33.920
I think you got to...

29:33.920 --> 29:37.920
I mean, all right, first off, you got to lie.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.560
You got to lie.

29:40.560 --> 29:45.120
That's such a stupid thing to lie about, that it's going to be not only frustrating for your dad,

29:45.120 --> 29:48.080
it's going to be embarrassing for you.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.280
You got to lie.

29:49.280 --> 29:53.200
Can you say that he went on some sort of time travel adventure,

29:53.200 --> 30:01.680
and while we were stuck in time, moving along the time stream, normally he aged super fast?

30:01.680 --> 30:04.400
Now, you can do that, but it's going to take some commitment.

30:04.400 --> 30:08.000
You got to start with, my boyfriend has decided to join the Air Force.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.960
Then you work your way up to, he's become an astronaut.

30:10.960 --> 30:16.960
Then he gets shot into space, and breaks the speed of light.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.880
And then when he returns, he's aged three years.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.680
So it's going to take you two or three years.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.080
All those AP physics classes really paid off for you.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.720
Do we do more believable and maybe topical?

30:26.720 --> 30:29.040
Like maybe he gets involved with the SpaceX program.

30:29.840 --> 30:34.000
He goes up in Dragon, Jesus sees that someone besides the government

30:34.000 --> 30:40.480
is using time travel, and he punishes them by making them age faster than normal.

30:40.480 --> 30:44.560
He got a weakened case of progeria.

30:45.120 --> 30:45.360
Right.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.440
He beat it though.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.720
He beat the progeria.

30:51.440 --> 30:56.080
What about like a whimsical scavenger hunt that ends with parental disappointment?

30:58.160 --> 31:01.840
Like you leave clues, and the dad has to follow the clue to the next clue,

31:01.840 --> 31:06.000
and then at the end is just a picture of the boyfriend's driver's license.

31:06.000 --> 31:11.760
That's good, because most scavenger hunts are engines for the child's disappointment,

31:11.760 --> 31:14.400
and it's nice to pass the buck for once.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.040
Is the dad going to care?

31:19.040 --> 31:20.480
I mean, if I was a dad.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.480
You are not the dad of a teenage girl.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.720
I'm sure it makes you crazy a little bit, turns you into a crazy person.

31:26.720 --> 31:34.400
Wouldn't it be great if these two crazy kids had been together for like five years?

31:35.200 --> 31:38.080
No, that would be very highly unpleasant,

31:38.080 --> 31:42.320
because at that point you're talking about an 18-year-old dating a 12-year-old.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.160
Oh no, oh no, I didn't do the math.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.760
I was thinking of 20, and oh no.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.560
Yeah, no, you did bad.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.000
I've done this poorly.

31:48.000 --> 31:48.800
I did it bad.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.080
I did math in a bad way.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.040
I used math for evil.

31:53.040 --> 31:58.800
I used math for evil.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.400
I mean, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, right?

32:03.280 --> 32:03.840
Yeah.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.360
Talk to everyone in prison.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.240
Why does your dad ever need to know how old this person is?

32:09.920 --> 32:11.280
Is it because they're out of school already?

32:11.280 --> 32:12.320
Doogie Howser.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.480
Whatever, just keep the lies coming.

32:14.480 --> 32:19.360
If you're married, if they get married, and they live together, and they stay married,

32:19.360 --> 32:25.280
and then he dies pretty early, and your dad, who is inexplicably still alive,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.800
it's like, man, I thought he had a few more years left in him.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.240
And you're like, what, three years?

32:30.240 --> 32:31.520
I've got a big secret, dad.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.360
Daddy, I'm sorry.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.240
Get ready.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.120
Get ready, dad.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.720
He was actually 97.

32:36.720 --> 32:37.220
Fuck.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.040
You're 133.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.440
I did math bad.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.080
I'm so glad you're still alive, Megadad.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.560
Get over here, Psydad.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.840
Come here, Methusadad.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.240
I love you.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.640
Come here, bicentennial dad.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.560
I love you so much.

32:54.320 --> 32:54.820
Shit.

32:55.280 --> 32:59.520
Why do all of our goons have to terminate with references to Robin Williams 2?

32:59.520 --> 33:04.800
Because he's a robot, Justin, that gets operations done so he can fuck humans.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.720
That's the best movie ever made.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.160
It's Robin Williams as a super boned out robot.

33:13.360 --> 33:17.120
His metal flange ain't gonna cut it no more.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.960
Put a human dick down there, please.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.560
I don't see why that was acceptable.

33:22.560 --> 33:27.920
Yet my spec script for Small Wonder got me summarily laughed out of Hollywood.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.640
I don't understand why that wasn't okay, you know?

33:30.640 --> 33:31.360
She's a robot.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.080
She doesn't have an age, technically.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.680
Did yours have Oliver Platt in it?

33:36.400 --> 33:36.960
It did not.

33:36.960 --> 33:37.440
Well, there's your problem.

33:37.440 --> 33:43.360
Maybe just have her boyfriend reference Small Wonder and then the dad knows that he's old as shit.

33:43.360 --> 33:43.840
Yeah, sure.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.000
What does the dad care?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.680
The dad's gonna fucking care.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.080
If I was a dad of a girl, of a woman.

33:50.080 --> 33:50.960
Nope, she's 17.

33:50.960 --> 33:51.520
Still a girl.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.000
Not yet a woman.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.400
Not yet, not even yet a woman.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.800
And she was dating an 18 year old.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.440
I think the high school college split is a big deal.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.400
I would say 20 is a big deal because soon he's gonna be drinking,

34:04.400 --> 34:07.840
buying all kinds of Smirnoff ice at Boon's farm for my sweet princess.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.120
23?

34:09.680 --> 34:11.680
They have been drinking Boon's farm.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.680
They are familiar with all the flavors.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.120
Could you do it incrementally?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.320
I'd be like, hey, dad, really?

34:16.320 --> 34:17.680
He's 20 and a half.

34:17.680 --> 34:18.400
Okay.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.280
And then like the next day be like, he's 21.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.040
The next day, like he's 20 in two months.

34:23.040 --> 34:26.400
A good thing to do to old people is to say like,

34:27.360 --> 34:33.760
is to reveal your lie by the fact that they were confused.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.760
So he'll say, I thought he was, I thought Jeremy was 20.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.840
You say, nah, he's 21.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.120
Like he's always known that.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.040
Or maybe, oh fuck, I've got it.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.200
I've got it, I've got it.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.400
Frequent birthdays.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.400
Dad was having the same idea.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.120
21 in April, 22 in June.

34:51.680 --> 34:52.180
Yeah.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.960
Your dad will never be able to keep track of that.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.000
He can't even like keep up with his fantasy football team.

34:58.000 --> 34:58.400
I guess he's like-

34:58.400 --> 35:01.040
No, you're gonna have to change all the clocks and calendars in the house.

35:01.040 --> 35:01.520
Wow.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.880
It's gonna take a lot of commitment.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.000
No, like he'll have a birthday in April.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.120
He'll turn 21.

35:07.120 --> 35:07.760
Okay.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.040
And then in September, he has birthday too.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.360
Where he turned and he'll turn 22 and your dad would be like,

35:13.920 --> 35:15.520
didn't he just have his birthday?

35:15.520 --> 35:16.480
No, September 11th.

35:16.480 --> 35:16.800
Remember?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.000
He was born on September 11th.

35:18.000 --> 35:18.480
It's like a thing.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.440
You said you wouldn't forget.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.960
You said you wouldn't forget his birthday.

35:20.960 --> 35:21.680
That's not good.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.080
And then the next birthday, the final birthday is April 1st.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.440
You're like April Fool's Day.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.160
Don't you remember?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.360
You're so stupid, dad.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.320
That's so stupid.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.280
You're the April Fool.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.560
Hey, get out of my life.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.880
But then you forget that he has a real birthday.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.800
You gotta sneak it in one week after.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.360
You gotta sleep your dad like three or four Ambien.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.280
So he just like wanders through the day in a haze.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.480
He clunks out.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.280
This sounds totally healthy.

35:43.280 --> 35:43.840
Hey.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.040
This sounds like the movie Click.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.480
Is this what that movie's about?

35:48.480 --> 35:49.360
This movie is Click.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.280
This movie is Click.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.160
That's the tagline for Click.

35:54.160 --> 36:02.960
Well, if you like that ad, you're going to love the money.

36:14.560 --> 36:18.640
This message is for Alex Long from Christina Elias.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.440
Here's the message.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.720
Their anniversary is May 27th.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.400
And they have, which is today, right now as we're recording this,

36:26.400 --> 36:28.160
and they've been together for two years.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.640
He's made a huge impact on my life.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.560
And since we listed the show together every week,

36:32.560 --> 36:36.480
a shout out from the brothers is the best anniversary present I could think of.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.720
So happy anniversary, Alex.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.760
I love you so much.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.520
You need to say, Alex, I love you too.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.960
Alex, I'm in love with you.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.280
Alex, I'm 23.

36:50.480 --> 36:51.120
I'm sorry.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.080
I'm sorry.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.840
So happy anniversary, you two.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.680
I'm so glad that, hey, Alex, go ahead and make an honest woman out of her.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.400
Whoa.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.600
I love how this is what it always becomes.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.640
Great taste in pie.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.600
That's married people.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.120
Married people want everybody to get married.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.240
Does that like lower the rates?

37:08.240 --> 37:09.040
How does that work?

37:09.600 --> 37:14.400
Yeah, you get a discount at a married restaurant.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.080
At Bed Bath and Beyond.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.120
Let's be honest.

37:17.120 --> 37:17.680
Let's move on.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.960
Travis, tell me about Mob Rules games.

37:20.960 --> 37:25.360
Well, Mob Rules games, as you know, like we're ending our month long sponsorship with them.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.080
We've come a long way, baby.

37:29.360 --> 37:29.860
Ew.

37:30.320 --> 37:30.820
Yep.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.960
Well, how about we've come a long way, baby.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.720
We've come a long baby way.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.220
Yeah.

37:37.440 --> 37:37.940
Okay.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.960
And so they're still working on their Kickstarter over at mobrulesgames.com.

37:42.960 --> 37:43.680
Go check it out.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.440
We're about halfway there.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.680
So make sure you're still giving to them.

37:47.680 --> 37:51.280
Five dollars gets you a code to download the game when it's complete in October.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.200
It's incredible looking.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.720
So make sure you check it out.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.000
Also, we want to make sure that we mentioned before we left off with them.

37:58.720 --> 38:04.160
They're doing a podcast called I believe it's the Pod Macabre.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.680
So make sure that you check that out on their website.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.600
And so head to Mob Rules.

38:10.240 --> 38:15.280
Basically, it's a diary of what they're doing and all the horror movies that influence the game.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.080
So make sure you check that out on their website.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.400
Their Kickstarter is like only halfway done.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.280
So go help them meet.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.000
It's like that one.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.160
What's that one game that just got all the money?

38:26.160 --> 38:27.680
Like all the games that are on Kickstarter.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.760
I want this to be a success story because it looks really cool.

38:31.760 --> 38:32.240
And I would like to play it.

38:32.240 --> 38:32.800
It looks cool.

38:33.760 --> 38:37.040
And when you go to mobrulesgames.com, you will need to scroll down past the first post to get

38:37.040 --> 38:37.760
to the Kickstarter.

38:39.200 --> 38:39.920
Actually, you know what?

38:39.920 --> 38:41.840
It's still on the right hand side of the page.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.480
You'll see a box that just says Haunts Kickstarter.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.760
So you can go there and we'll try to tweet it out tomorrow to make it even easier for

38:47.760 --> 38:49.920
you to go donate and get a copy of the game.

38:49.920 --> 38:53.200
For like for five bucks, you can have a copy of this game.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.280
And for every five bucks you donate, you get another copy.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.160
You can sell to friends.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.320
Profiteering.

38:58.320 --> 38:58.880
We love it.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.360
Hey, guys, can I tell you about another show on the on the IFC?

39:01.920 --> 39:03.120
Yeah, please do.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.160
It's called Bunk.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.480
It comes on it's not to be confused with Monk.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.280
It's called Bunk.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.360
It's at 1030 right after Comedy Bang Bang, which you should also definitely be watching.

39:11.360 --> 39:16.080
It is a game show where improv comics play for inane prizes and non charitable causes.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.760
It's got categories like whose crotch is hotter?

39:19.760 --> 39:20.720
Shame that puppy.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.560
Give that bitch some arms and un-stamp the tramp.

39:24.560 --> 39:28.560
That's Bunk, 1030, IFC, where comedians come to play.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.920
I have to know what shame that puppy is.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.920
Griffin, did you write that tagline?

39:33.920 --> 39:35.840
I may have.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.920
It's like the new jingle.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.920
I put a little put a spin on a tagline.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.520
This game show is click.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.720
So wait a minute, Griffin.

39:46.480 --> 39:50.240
OK, Travis, I think you maybe missed the utility of your own tagline.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.040
I'm not sure you quite.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.920
It works for literally every occasion.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.440
This birthday is click.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.560
This funeral is click.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.960
So happy anniversary to Alex and Christina.

40:00.960 --> 40:05.120
And go to mobrulesgames.com right now and watch Bunk at 1030.

40:05.120 --> 40:05.680
I'm not kidding.

40:05.680 --> 40:07.120
I want to play that fucking game.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.080
So go fund serious.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.160
Don't you guys let me down this time, Internet?

40:10.160 --> 40:11.200
Like you do everything else.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.280
Hey, I work in an office that enjoys pranks.

40:16.960 --> 40:22.560
This sounds like a bad, bad setup for amateur pornography.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.160
But I'm going to go on.

40:24.160 --> 40:29.840
Most recently, we gave a guy a cubicle lawn with real grass while he was away on his honeymoon.

40:30.640 --> 40:31.360
And it's beautiful.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.880
They attached a picture to the email.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.880
It they did a really great nail it.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.360
OK, that's where the issue is.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.040
Can you put it on the forums or something, Travis?

40:39.040 --> 40:39.840
I totally will.

40:39.840 --> 40:40.080
All right.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.440
Totally maximum fun.org.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.480
That's where the issue is.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.800
Another coworker got married when on his honeymoon.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.280
We found out yesterday that when he returns, he's going to be fired.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.160
Oh, no.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.840
But he's totally expecting a prank when he gets back.

40:54.880 --> 40:55.520
Oh, no.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.520
This is what do I do?

40:58.080 --> 41:01.520
He might think that being the firing is actually a goof

41:01.520 --> 41:04.320
and it could lead to a seriously awkward situation.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.000
Maybe I ought to prank him anyway,

41:06.000 --> 41:10.960
so that when he gets called into his boss's office, he knows it's legit.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.920
That's from you got punked and also fired.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.040
Oh, my God.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.320
Oh, no.

41:16.320 --> 41:20.880
Can you imagine working in an office where upon returning from like a weeklong vacation,

41:21.440 --> 41:26.320
not finding your cubicle covered in wrapping paper or like full of balloons

41:26.320 --> 41:28.160
was a sign that there was trouble?

41:28.160 --> 41:30.160
Like, wait, guys, where's the flamingos?

41:30.720 --> 41:31.600
Oh, no.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.480
Am I fired?

41:32.480 --> 41:33.680
Is something wrong?

41:34.640 --> 41:38.480
The only thing I can think is that you have to you have to punk him

41:38.480 --> 41:45.360
and the punking has to be so heinous that when he gets fired,

41:45.360 --> 41:48.160
he's like, well, good, because I could never come back here anyway.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.600
Like you got it on his desk.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.760
You got to get like four people to hold him down while you like staple his balls to his leg.

41:54.960 --> 41:55.280
Right.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.800
And then, like when he gets fired, he's like,

41:56.800 --> 41:59.280
oh, thank God I could never look those people in the eye again.

42:00.640 --> 42:01.140
Oh.

42:01.140 --> 42:09.780
Oh, I unlet maybe or maybe maybe you let him think it's the long con.

42:10.660 --> 42:15.060
Maybe you let him think it's the long drift until that paycheck stop showing up.

42:15.060 --> 42:16.980
But that could be part of the goof.

42:16.980 --> 42:19.460
Like, oh, so you're like, I can't believe you fell for it.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.380
Yeah, that's where my key card doesn't work anymore.

42:21.380 --> 42:22.980
Man, they're really serious about this goof.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.180
It's been a couple of months without a paycheck.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.580
And by that point, you already forgot this dude existed.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.860
And could you punk him after he gets fired?

42:32.500 --> 42:35.780
Like as he walks out of the office, a bucket of water falls on his head.

42:36.980 --> 42:38.580
He's like, was this whole thing?

42:38.580 --> 42:38.820
Nope.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.660
Just the water bucket was.

42:40.660 --> 42:42.420
But you you have been relieved.

42:43.860 --> 42:46.420
But we do need you to collect your things and go.

42:46.420 --> 42:48.340
And could you clean up the water, please?

42:48.340 --> 42:50.340
Maybe security will be here in 30 minutes.

42:50.340 --> 42:52.420
Could you please towel up the mess you made?

42:52.420 --> 42:54.340
Probably a pretty good joke would be after he gets fired.

42:54.340 --> 42:57.540
You asked him like you pretend like you're going to Jerry McGuire with him.

42:57.540 --> 43:00.340
And the two of you are going to go off and start your own agency.

43:01.060 --> 43:02.900
And then it's your first meeting with Cuba.

43:02.900 --> 43:04.180
You just don't show.

43:04.180 --> 43:05.300
You're back at work.

43:05.300 --> 43:06.740
This agency doesn't exist.

43:06.740 --> 43:08.260
And this meeting isn't with Cuba.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.380
It's with Frank, the guy who runs the Starbucks down on 13th.

43:13.780 --> 43:15.300
Also, I got you a job at Starbucks.

43:17.620 --> 43:19.380
Just hug him and be there for him.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.460
Just remember it's not your problem.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.820
And then just be there for him.

43:23.540 --> 43:24.740
Maybe take a sick day.

43:24.740 --> 43:27.540
Maybe take a sick day the day you know this thing is happening.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.460
They did what?

43:31.060 --> 43:32.420
They did who?

43:32.420 --> 43:33.940
Are you sure this isn't a goof?

43:35.940 --> 43:37.220
Are you goofing me?

43:37.220 --> 43:38.500
Are you goofing me?

43:38.500 --> 43:39.540
Is this a goof right now?

43:39.540 --> 43:41.220
Are you double goofing on me?

43:41.220 --> 43:42.180
I don't believe it.

43:42.180 --> 43:47.300
I still love the idea of like this guy tapping into his kid's college fund to pay the mortgage.

43:47.300 --> 43:50.820
Like man, this goof is going on like really far.

43:50.820 --> 43:55.300
Maybe you goof the whole office and like after this guy gets fired, you come in the next day

43:55.300 --> 43:58.420
and you set up his cubicle like he's still there.

43:58.420 --> 44:04.660
And like from time to time, just move things around and like change the desktop and do stuff

44:04.660 --> 44:06.740
and try to convince people that he still works there.

44:06.740 --> 44:10.500
Can you find a guy that looks exactly like him to do his job?

44:10.500 --> 44:11.460
Holy shit.

44:11.460 --> 44:13.540
And see if you can't collect two paychecks.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.580
Well, wait a minute.

44:14.580 --> 44:16.740
No, because once he gets fired, he's gonna be like,

44:16.740 --> 44:17.700
I'm gonna go to work.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.660
I'm gonna go to work.

44:18.660 --> 44:21.940
Well, no, because once he gets fired, you know, once someone gets fired,

44:21.940 --> 44:23.220
they don't get paychecks anymore.

44:24.260 --> 44:26.900
But maybe if you convince him that the guy's still there.

44:27.700 --> 44:30.340
This is a terrible thing that's going to happen to this person.

44:30.340 --> 44:33.860
Have you considered talking to the bosses and saying like, please not him.

44:34.420 --> 44:35.860
He's on his fucking honeymoon.

44:35.860 --> 44:36.500
That's that's.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.340
Yeah, that is really shady.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.140
That's really shady.

44:39.140 --> 44:40.580
Maybe you should consider quitting.

44:41.540 --> 44:43.620
By which I mean before this guy gets back.

44:43.620 --> 44:46.020
I mean, unless this guy is just a terrible guy.

44:46.020 --> 44:49.060
Terrible people don't get married, though, is the problem.

44:49.060 --> 44:51.620
But I'm saying like, this is his fourth honeymoon in two months.

44:51.620 --> 44:52.580
Oh, okay.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.900
Well, that's incredibly improbable.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.580
No, in which I'm not referring to Bigamy.

44:56.580 --> 44:59.620
I mean, with the same person, he's taken four honeymoons.

44:59.620 --> 45:02.100
They're just living a different lifestyle, Travis.

45:02.100 --> 45:06.580
Like, your problems with Bigamy are really dragging the show down.

45:06.580 --> 45:07.700
No, I'm not knocking Bigamy.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.300
I don't understand why you have to be such a big'em.

45:09.940 --> 45:12.500
Big'em makes, Bigamy makes, I fucking hate you.

45:13.700 --> 45:15.220
Big'em reminds me of the dig'em problem.

45:15.220 --> 45:16.740
Big'em is my favorite cereal mascot.

45:18.420 --> 45:21.220
But Bigamy totally makes financial and fiscal sense.

45:21.220 --> 45:24.660
I'm saying that maybe this guy just really likes taking vacations.

45:24.660 --> 45:28.100
What doesn't make sense to me is that the Sugar Smacks Frog is a big'emist.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.540
Is that what you're saying to me?

45:29.540 --> 45:30.260
Yes.

45:30.260 --> 45:30.980
Dig'em Frog.

45:32.260 --> 45:35.300
He's married to Lucky and the Sugar Bear.

45:36.740 --> 45:38.660
Okay, see, this has always been confusing to me.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.980
Sugar Smacks and Golden Crisp are the same cereal, right?

45:41.860 --> 45:43.620
Wait, which one's Sugar Smacks?

45:43.620 --> 45:45.060
Is that the one with Dig'em Frog?

45:45.060 --> 45:46.660
Sugar Smacks has Dig'em Frog.

45:48.420 --> 45:52.740
Golden Crisp also, which is also, is also Sugar Crisp.

45:53.940 --> 45:56.900
Oh, that's, I can't get enough of that, Sugar Crisp.

45:56.900 --> 45:58.580
Right, but Honey Smacks are the same.

45:58.580 --> 46:02.260
I mean, they're basically just puffed wheat with sugar.

46:02.260 --> 46:05.300
Wait, you might've just blown the lid off Big Cereal.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.660
Is all cereal the same?

46:06.660 --> 46:09.540
It's some form of wheat or rice covered in sugar?

46:09.540 --> 46:11.540
Well, I mean, that is 100% accurate.

46:11.540 --> 46:16.020
I'm saying to you right now that it's been way too long

46:16.020 --> 46:19.540
since I've eaten Golden Crisp or Sugar Smacks

46:19.540 --> 46:20.420
or anything like that.

46:20.420 --> 46:21.940
I really like those cereals.

46:21.940 --> 46:22.980
What have I been waiting on?

46:23.620 --> 46:24.180
I don't know.

46:24.820 --> 46:25.380
Live your life.

46:26.420 --> 46:27.220
Griffin, you like those?

46:28.260 --> 46:29.860
I can't eat cereal anymore.

46:30.660 --> 46:31.700
What? Why not?

46:31.700 --> 46:33.300
It gives me fart butts.

46:34.580 --> 46:35.700
I can't eat it either.

46:35.700 --> 46:39.300
I like, I'm on that low carb lifestyle.

46:39.300 --> 46:40.820
I'm just thinking about how good it would be.

46:40.820 --> 46:42.980
Ever since they discontinued French Toast Crunch,

46:42.980 --> 46:44.500
it's like, what's the point?

46:45.140 --> 46:46.660
Can you even get Waffle Crisp anymore?

46:46.660 --> 46:47.300
Nope, gone.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.140
Son of a bitch.

46:50.100 --> 46:52.180
Hey, let's talk about something else.

46:52.180 --> 46:54.180
You know what the best part about Waffle Crisp is?

46:54.180 --> 46:56.580
You will smell like Waffle Crisp for the next six days.

46:56.580 --> 46:56.740
Yeah.

46:58.100 --> 46:59.460
That is the best thing about it.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.580
Makes your hands feel like spider webs too.

47:03.380 --> 47:05.380
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Brent Black.

47:05.380 --> 47:06.580
Thank you, Brent Black.

47:06.580 --> 47:08.900
Brentel Floss of the internet.

47:08.900 --> 47:11.780
It's by Yahoo Answers user CBKitty who asks,

47:11.780 --> 47:14.260
does your spouse ever smile during sex?

47:15.380 --> 47:17.460
Me and my husband were having sex the other night

47:17.460 --> 47:20.340
and I looked up at him and he was giving me this wide grin.

47:22.100 --> 47:22.820
Oh no!

47:22.820 --> 47:26.900
I immediately thought it was very creepy and told him so.

47:26.900 --> 47:29.060
Of course, immediately I was completely turned off

47:29.060 --> 47:30.100
and told him to finish.

47:30.900 --> 47:33.540
I was a little harsh, I know, but it really creeped me out.

47:33.540 --> 47:36.500
I'm expecting a look of pleasure on his face, but not a grin.

47:36.500 --> 47:40.340
Does your spouse ever do this?

47:40.340 --> 47:41.860
My spouse is going full Joker.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.540
It's like fucking the Cheshire Cat.

47:45.540 --> 47:46.580
Will you please just finish?

47:46.580 --> 47:49.860
My spouse has been hit by smilex and it's creeping me the fuck out.

47:50.900 --> 47:55.780
I think the creepier part is something happened during your lovemaking sesh

47:55.780 --> 48:00.420
and it turned you off and you were like, just finish.

48:00.420 --> 48:02.660
Just finish already, Randy, and let's get this over with.

48:02.660 --> 48:06.660
Flip the orgasm button and just go, please.

48:07.540 --> 48:09.220
Just stop holding it back and let's roll.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.500
Let's just roll on this.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.220
Open it up.

48:12.340 --> 48:13.220
Just open it up.

48:14.100 --> 48:18.900
I think it's a pretty cool wife that the big turn off for her

48:18.900 --> 48:21.140
is my husband enjoying himself.

48:21.140 --> 48:21.780
But it's not-

48:22.340 --> 48:26.020
No, I want him to quietly and enjoy himself,

48:26.020 --> 48:27.060
but I want him to hide it.

48:27.060 --> 48:30.020
I want his face to be a mask or maybe a literal mask.

48:30.020 --> 48:32.820
Yeah, your face when you're making love should always look like you're

48:32.820 --> 48:35.140
in the finals of some sort of math league.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
You've got to look very consternated.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.620
You've got to look like you're really just giving it your all.

48:41.620 --> 48:45.780
And when you're grinning, a grin is not a good bedtime look.

48:46.660 --> 48:50.020
No, a grin says I know something you don't know,

48:50.020 --> 48:52.420
which is never a good look to have during sex.

48:52.420 --> 48:52.920
Yeah.

48:54.340 --> 48:56.740
And everybody, different strokes for different folks.

48:56.740 --> 48:59.380
Different smokes for different pokes,

48:59.380 --> 49:05.860
but I just think that if you are giving your partner like a wry smile,

49:05.860 --> 49:07.780
then you're not doing something right.

49:10.500 --> 49:13.860
It's so like smiling.

49:14.500 --> 49:17.220
It's like if you let out like a soft giggle,

49:17.220 --> 49:18.980
a titter while you're making love.

49:20.180 --> 49:20.680
Titter.

49:21.700 --> 49:25.540
If you just said titter.

49:25.540 --> 49:27.140
Titter.

49:27.140 --> 49:30.500
God, my penis just went so far inside my body.

49:31.380 --> 49:32.900
It's hanging out with my stomach now.

49:35.140 --> 49:37.620
No, what you got to do is commit the full belly laugh.

49:41.300 --> 49:41.800
Yeah.

49:42.260 --> 49:42.900
Yeah.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.180
We are making love.

49:44.820 --> 49:45.860
Now that I think about it,

49:45.860 --> 49:48.820
there are so few things that you can do while you're making love.

49:49.460 --> 49:51.620
There's like one or two things you can do

49:51.620 --> 49:54.660
and everything else is like, no, I can't do that.

49:54.660 --> 49:55.540
Which will be worse?

49:55.540 --> 49:58.420
Looking up and seeing your other grinning or frowning?

49:59.620 --> 50:01.540
Or anything frowning.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.900
I think is actually more commonplace.

50:02.900 --> 50:03.380
Don't you think?

50:04.260 --> 50:04.580
Yeah.

50:04.580 --> 50:05.300
Because you're focused.

50:06.180 --> 50:06.900
Like Conan.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.860
That's angry face.

50:07.860 --> 50:08.260
Okay.

50:08.260 --> 50:10.900
It only seems like you can't do those things.

50:10.900 --> 50:11.540
No.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.500
You know, you can.

50:12.500 --> 50:12.980
No.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.340
It's because you live in America,

50:15.300 --> 50:17.940
land of the free and home with the bland.

50:17.940 --> 50:21.060
And you open up your sphere a little bit.

50:21.060 --> 50:23.060
If I see what possibilities are there.

50:23.060 --> 50:24.740
Just turn to the page in the Kama Sutra

50:24.740 --> 50:26.340
where it shows you all the different faces.

50:26.340 --> 50:27.380
I'm your brother.

50:27.380 --> 50:28.260
You're grossing me out.

50:29.060 --> 50:29.700
You can't.

50:29.700 --> 50:32.660
Do the one where you hook your pinkies inside the corners of your mouth.

50:32.660 --> 50:35.220
As you're driving past each other.

50:38.340 --> 50:40.660
Can you have sex out the window of a moving vehicle?

50:41.620 --> 50:42.580
Not if you're smiling.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.420
So what if you like sneeze during sex?

50:46.420 --> 50:47.860
Has anyone ever done that before?

50:48.580 --> 50:49.620
Your body actually can't.

50:49.620 --> 50:53.700
It's how you can't like hum with your mouth closed.

50:54.740 --> 50:55.300
What?

50:55.300 --> 50:57.460
I mean, it's like you can't pinch your nose and hub.

50:58.980 --> 51:02.900
It's like how you can't eat an entire spoonful of cocoa and hum at the same time.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.140
Sure.

51:04.660 --> 51:06.500
What if they gently hum while you're making love?

51:07.220 --> 51:08.420
And not like a sex way?

51:09.700 --> 51:10.500
If they were just like...

51:13.380 --> 51:15.460
No, like humming like a tune.

51:15.460 --> 51:17.060
Like the Samford theme song.

51:17.060 --> 51:20.020
Not just like a...

51:20.020 --> 51:21.380
Like you're some sort of jet bike?

51:23.380 --> 51:26.420
And as you rev up the big O, you literally rev up.

51:26.420 --> 51:27.140
Oh, God.

51:28.260 --> 51:29.540
The big O?

51:29.540 --> 51:30.980
What's the matter, you guys?

51:30.980 --> 51:33.940
Guys, I figured that would be better than actually saying orgasm, wasn't it?

51:33.940 --> 51:35.220
No, they're both bad.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.420
They're both so bad.

51:36.420 --> 51:38.420
I just want to talk about anything else.

51:38.420 --> 51:39.860
Happy time finish sauce.

51:42.980 --> 51:44.900
Okay, so that was the most repellent thing you could say.

51:44.900 --> 51:45.860
All right, because I didn't know.

51:45.860 --> 51:47.220
I wasn't sure.

51:47.220 --> 51:48.100
I was just trying to one up, you know?

51:48.100 --> 51:48.660
You got to get...

51:48.660 --> 51:49.220
Come on.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.180
Oh, God, no.

51:53.780 --> 51:55.460
I'm getting married this weekend.

51:55.460 --> 51:56.020
Yesterday.

51:57.460 --> 51:58.180
That's confusing.

51:58.740 --> 51:59.460
I know.

51:59.460 --> 52:02.100
This weekend, Saturday, May 26th was yesterday.

52:02.100 --> 52:07.380
And wanted to know if you've got any outside the box advice for solving marital problems.

52:07.380 --> 52:09.300
Yeah, don't get married, right?

52:09.300 --> 52:13.860
Get a man cave.

52:13.860 --> 52:17.300
Justin's actually gnawing.

52:17.300 --> 52:19.460
Justin's gnawing on a branch right now.

52:19.460 --> 52:21.860
He's gnawing on his own leg to escape from marriage.

52:21.860 --> 52:23.380
Get out of the bear trap.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.180
So outside the box advice for solving...

52:28.180 --> 52:28.980
Don't get in the box.

52:30.100 --> 52:31.380
Don't let her put you in a box.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.460
That's an unhealthy relationship.

52:36.100 --> 52:36.580
Just be...

52:37.300 --> 52:39.060
Just love is patient.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.020
Love is kind.

52:40.820 --> 52:41.780
Love is blind.

52:41.780 --> 52:43.140
And it'll take over your mind.

52:45.140 --> 52:47.540
Then you'll find inside the rind.

52:48.580 --> 52:51.380
You can get ready to grind on that skateboard of love.

52:52.260 --> 52:54.500
That's my favorite Mary J. Blige song.

52:56.100 --> 52:57.460
Marriage is like a skateboard.

52:58.980 --> 53:00.500
So outside the box advice.

53:00.500 --> 53:09.460
I think the number one thing that determines whether or not you're ready to be married to

53:09.460 --> 53:12.100
somebody is if you're capable.

53:12.100 --> 53:17.220
And some people aren't to this point in their maturity yet, where you're able to think,

53:17.220 --> 53:22.100
like see a problem from somebody else's perspective.

53:22.100 --> 53:27.300
And I think that if you can learn that one skill and practice that one thing in marriage

53:27.300 --> 53:30.980
that it'll solve a lot of your issues.

53:30.980 --> 53:35.300
If you're just willing to take two seconds and say, try to see it, like literally put

53:35.300 --> 53:37.700
yourself, not literally put yourself in their shoes.

53:37.700 --> 53:40.500
That's a whole other bevy of marital problems.

53:41.300 --> 53:47.300
But to put yourself in their shoes and think like, hey, why are they thinking this way?

53:47.300 --> 53:51.620
Because I guarantee if you take those seconds and slow it down a little bit, you'll be able

53:51.620 --> 53:54.420
to figure out a lot more than you think you're capable of.

53:54.420 --> 54:00.820
Honestly, here's another one, the person that you are getting married to knows you better

54:00.820 --> 54:02.420
than anyone else knows you.

54:03.060 --> 54:07.860
And so all of those things that you tell yourself that you do that are awesome and cute and

54:07.860 --> 54:12.260
adorable, if your significant other says, hey, just so you know, that's really kind

54:12.260 --> 54:16.180
of annoying and you should stop doing that, you should probably listen to that person

54:16.180 --> 54:17.860
instead of trying to defend yourself.

54:17.860 --> 54:22.980
Yeah, you got to realize that like a lot of the process of like, you know, you're not

54:22.980 --> 54:29.700
this is like getting growing up in a marriage is like letting go of your bullshit and the

54:29.700 --> 54:32.020
person will know your bullshit better than anybody.

54:32.020 --> 54:37.620
And the source of a lot of fights, especially early, is like the where you find your bullshit

54:37.620 --> 54:38.660
stops working.

54:38.660 --> 54:38.980
Yeah.

54:38.980 --> 54:39.540
Oh, wait a minute.

54:39.540 --> 54:40.420
That doesn't OK.

54:40.420 --> 54:41.300
That's not a good one.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.220
That's not a good bullshit anymore.

54:43.220 --> 54:45.700
You should always Teresa calls me on all the time.

54:45.700 --> 54:49.460
I try to use I love you as like a barometer for how the situation is going.

54:49.460 --> 54:49.860
Yeah.

54:49.860 --> 54:51.940
And usually there's a question mark at the end.

54:51.940 --> 54:54.260
I love it's your depth charge.

54:54.260 --> 54:54.500
Yeah.

54:54.500 --> 54:56.580
So like she started calling me on that.

54:56.580 --> 55:01.140
And when that happens, that's how you take steps towards becoming a better person.

55:01.140 --> 55:05.860
But only if you're willing to accept it, because typically it's just going to make you angry

55:05.860 --> 55:07.380
because like, ah, you're so right.

55:07.940 --> 55:09.460
How did you know my bullshit?

55:09.460 --> 55:10.420
You know, my tricks.

55:10.420 --> 55:10.980
You got me.

55:11.860 --> 55:18.020
You should always you should also always live under the assumption that your wife is probably

55:18.740 --> 55:19.940
cheating on you.

55:19.940 --> 55:24.340
Probably, well, why?

55:24.340 --> 55:27.940
I'm just saying if you prep yourself, that's terrible advice.

55:27.940 --> 55:30.420
You're saying like live on the defensive.

55:30.420 --> 55:36.260
I'm saying you've either got to set up a swing agreement.

55:38.100 --> 55:39.540
It's the rest of your life.

55:39.540 --> 55:41.700
Have you have you worked out your swing agreement?

55:41.700 --> 55:42.260
Yeah.

55:42.260 --> 55:43.460
Do you have it down on paper?

55:43.460 --> 55:44.500
Because it might be a smoke.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.940
You have a swing agreement.

55:45.940 --> 55:47.540
Do you have a safe couples right now?

55:47.540 --> 55:50.260
You need the Treaty of Versailles.

55:50.260 --> 55:52.580
You need the Treaty of Two Guys.

55:52.580 --> 55:54.740
You need to you need to work something out.

55:54.740 --> 55:55.780
You got to figure it out.

55:55.780 --> 55:58.180
Find a lawyer and have him draw you up a doctor.

55:58.180 --> 56:00.020
Talking about the rest of your life, dog.

56:00.660 --> 56:03.380
Find a lawyer that can hang.

56:03.380 --> 56:05.060
Find a lawyer that's a liberal lawyer.

56:05.060 --> 56:05.940
Kind of chill.

56:05.940 --> 56:06.980
And how about this?

56:06.980 --> 56:09.540
Go to marriage counseling day one.

56:09.540 --> 56:11.140
It's not just for people who are in trouble.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.820
Yeah, you don't just go to the doctor when your butt falls off.

56:14.820 --> 56:15.460
Exactly.

56:15.460 --> 56:20.100
Prevention is nine tenths of not having your butt fall off.

56:20.900 --> 56:21.380
I've always.

56:21.380 --> 56:22.420
Metaphorically speaking.

56:22.420 --> 56:22.900
No, literally.

56:22.900 --> 56:25.460
50% of marriages end in divorce.

56:25.460 --> 56:27.140
So I guess what I'm saying is you pay your money,

56:27.140 --> 56:28.020
you take your chances.

56:29.060 --> 56:30.340
There's no way to tell if this is going to work out or not.

56:30.340 --> 56:32.020
And also, I guess that's another piece of advice.

56:32.020 --> 56:32.580
No one to hold them.

56:32.580 --> 56:33.300
No one to fold them.

56:33.300 --> 56:34.180
That's all I'm going to say.

56:34.180 --> 56:34.660
No one to walk away.

56:34.660 --> 56:35.220
That's all I'm going to say.

56:35.220 --> 56:35.860
No one to run.

56:35.860 --> 56:37.220
There's always a way out.

56:37.220 --> 56:38.900
That's all I'm going to say, Josh.

56:38.900 --> 56:40.100
Know your exit strategy.

56:40.660 --> 56:42.500
Follow the closest exit.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.020
Maybe you have a fake beard buried in the yard.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.780
The closest exit may be behind you.

56:45.780 --> 56:47.060
That's all I'm saying, Josh.

56:47.780 --> 56:48.180
Josh.

56:49.220 --> 56:49.780
Josh.

56:49.780 --> 56:50.980
How's your marriage going, Josh?

56:50.980 --> 56:51.540
Light two.

56:51.540 --> 56:52.020
Hey, Josh.

56:52.820 --> 56:53.300
I know it's been 48.

56:53.300 --> 56:55.940
You're probably still in what we like to call the honeymoon phase.

56:57.060 --> 56:59.620
I should warn you, you will be fired upon your return.

57:01.860 --> 57:03.460
Enjoy your time in Gatlinburg.

57:06.980 --> 57:08.340
And then your marriage is going to dissolve,

57:08.340 --> 57:10.500
but one of those two things is going to be a goof.

57:10.500 --> 57:11.140
Your choice.

57:11.140 --> 57:11.460
Yeah.

57:11.460 --> 57:12.020
Your game, Josh.

57:12.020 --> 57:12.660
Your choice.

57:12.660 --> 57:13.620
Your game, Josh.

57:13.620 --> 57:16.980
Nothing says strengthening our burgeoning relationship like,

57:16.980 --> 57:18.820
honey, you're going to have to carry me for a while.

57:18.820 --> 57:19.060
Yeah.

57:19.700 --> 57:20.020
Yeah.

57:20.740 --> 57:22.980
So this has been our goofy comedy show,

57:22.980 --> 57:24.180
my brother, my brother, and me.

57:24.180 --> 57:27.700
I'm so flattered that you took the time to listen this week.

57:28.900 --> 57:30.900
If you could, if you get a second,

57:30.900 --> 57:35.620
could you go to iTunes and maybe write a review for us

57:35.620 --> 57:37.460
or subscribe to us there if you don't already?

57:38.580 --> 57:40.420
And thank you to people who are tweeting about the show

57:40.420 --> 57:47.460
with the M-B-A-M hashtag like Danarchist, Haley Head,

57:47.460 --> 57:52.820
Sarah Jo Stevens, Tristan Mathers, follow here, there,

57:52.820 --> 57:57.460
Philippe Young, our buddy Steven Strom, Aaron Myers,

57:58.580 --> 58:01.540
Scott Garner, maybe Mumkin.

58:01.540 --> 58:02.180
I could go on.

58:02.180 --> 58:03.300
Are you having a stroke?

58:05.460 --> 58:07.460
Like, do you know that you're slowing down

58:07.460 --> 58:09.940
or am I speeding up and this is like a relativity thing?

58:09.940 --> 58:12.980
Your comprehension has accelerated to a point where you can-

58:12.980 --> 58:13.860
I've moved to planes.

58:13.860 --> 58:15.140
You can no longer comprehend.

58:15.140 --> 58:17.140
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

58:17.140 --> 58:18.020
for the use of our theme song.

58:18.020 --> 58:20.180
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

58:21.620 --> 58:23.780
Go, go pick that up.

58:23.780 --> 58:26.180
It's a, it's a power jam for all seasons.

58:26.980 --> 58:30.020
Hey, are you, sorry, Trav, you go right ahead.

58:30.020 --> 58:31.060
Well, I was just going to say,

58:31.060 --> 58:33.060
I just want to say how excited we all are for,

58:33.060 --> 58:35.460
for Max Fun Con coming up next week.

58:35.460 --> 58:37.220
We look forward to seeing everybody there.

58:37.220 --> 58:39.940
And I also wanted to do a shameless self plug.

58:40.740 --> 58:43.140
If there's anyone in the Cincinnati area,

58:44.100 --> 58:47.140
June 8th, I'm going to be opening a show.

58:47.140 --> 58:49.700
We're doing the complete works of William Shakespeare Abridged

58:50.340 --> 58:53.300
starring me and my friends Nick Rose and Billy Chase

58:53.300 --> 58:54.740
at the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company.

58:55.620 --> 58:56.820
Tickets are on sale now.

58:56.820 --> 58:58.820
You can get them at sensyshakes.com.

58:58.820 --> 59:00.660
That's sensy with a Y, shakes.com.

59:00.660 --> 59:02.020
I hope to see you all there.

59:02.020 --> 59:04.820
And make sure you let them know that you came because of me.

59:04.820 --> 59:06.100
Oh, that's gross.

59:06.100 --> 59:08.020
That's gross.

59:08.020 --> 59:08.740
Wait.

59:08.740 --> 59:14.100
Can we, I just want to just, I guess a word of warning.

59:14.100 --> 59:17.060
We're, so our next show is a live show at Max Fun Con

59:17.060 --> 59:18.500
and Justin and I are both going to be in LA

59:18.500 --> 59:20.500
for like a week after that.

59:21.300 --> 59:24.420
So I don't know, we, the next episode may be up kind of late

59:24.420 --> 59:26.260
because we're basically going straight from that

59:26.260 --> 59:28.100
to a convention for work.

59:28.100 --> 59:30.500
So, so the next episode may be a little bit late.

59:30.500 --> 59:32.180
We're, we haven't figured that out yet.

59:32.180 --> 59:34.340
Oh, along those same lines,

59:34.340 --> 59:36.660
the three of us are going to be in LA at the Broadway Bar

59:37.300 --> 59:42.020
for the, a party hosted by our current employer,

59:42.020 --> 59:43.620
Polygon, not our current employer.

59:43.620 --> 59:45.620
The website Griffin and I make called Polygon.

59:45.620 --> 59:47.540
We're having a party at Broadway Bar,

59:47.540 --> 59:50.740
I think seven to 11 on Sunday, June 3rd.

59:50.740 --> 59:52.100
So we will all three be there.

59:52.100 --> 59:54.580
So if you're in LA and you didn't get to go to Max Fun Con,

59:54.580 --> 59:55.380
come hang out with us.

59:55.380 --> 59:56.500
Yeah, come hang out.

59:56.500 --> 59:57.300
We'll be there.

59:57.300 --> 59:58.340
Also, we love you.

59:58.340 --> 59:59.460
Thank you so much, you guys.

59:59.460 --> 59:59.700
Thank you.

59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.340
Thank you so much.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.260
Uh, this final Yahoo answer was sent in by Mark Turetsky.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.540
Thank you, Mark.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.820
It's by Yahoo Answers user HiHiLayna who asks,

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.220
I'm convinced I am a potato.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.060
I'm Justin McElroy.

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.860
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.300
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.740
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.460
Kiss your dad.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.220
Just go all the way around the lips.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.140
Keep your heart three stacks.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.180
Keep your heart.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.340
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.380
Keep your heart.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.380
Man, these girls are smart three stacks.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.500
These girls are smart.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:58.500
Play your part.
