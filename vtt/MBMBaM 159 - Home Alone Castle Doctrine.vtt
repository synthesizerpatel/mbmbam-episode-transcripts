00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.800
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.520
Just jumped right into it, huh? I'm just getting right to it. I'm very excited.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.800
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. And I'm Edward Snowden.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.880
Oh, so many, so many problems.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.400
I want to thank, I want to thank My Brother, My Brother, and Me for granting me a shalom.

01:09.040 --> 01:14.240
I have looked long and hard, and finally I found a new place to make a home.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.360
Now, not a lot of people know this, but Edward Snowden is the ghost of

01:19.360 --> 01:25.840
a Victorian-era matchstick girl. No, I am a hacker, and I possess mini secrets.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.400
Is this, now can I ask, is this actually you talking to us, or is this some sort of

01:30.400 --> 01:36.400
artificial intelligence subroutine that you have programmed to make comedy jokes?

01:36.400 --> 01:42.480
This, I have not finished my relocation. This is my shalom hologram.

01:42.480 --> 01:42.960
Okay.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.080
I will be joining you soon in a shalom.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.840
Can you, can you tell us where your physical presence, your body, your form,

01:51.840 --> 01:54.560
your ectoplasm, where is it at right now?

01:54.560 --> 02:01.680
Abs, absolutely not. I cannot grant you that. I do appreciate the podcast, a shalom,

02:02.240 --> 02:10.160
but I unfortunately cannot divulge the specific Denny's that I am hiding under a table.

02:11.440 --> 02:18.400
Note, note that it is a Denny's. I am under a table. There's room for my secrets,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.600
and me, and the Grand Slam.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.080
Now, are you-

02:22.080 --> 02:23.600
So there's room for your secrets?

02:23.600 --> 02:26.320
I know my secrets.

02:26.320 --> 02:26.720
Are you-

02:27.680 --> 02:29.920
Uncle Sham, you've been naughty.

02:29.920 --> 02:35.840
Can you even get like the kind of high bandwidth internet access that you need

02:36.400 --> 02:39.680
to project a Snowden hologram?

02:39.680 --> 02:41.920
I have, I have Ishanet, yes.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.160
Okay.

02:42.160 --> 02:48.400
It's plugged in from the table. It's complimentary with every Grand Slam.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.640
They also have given me a bib.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.920
I have never been offered either of those things at a Denny's.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.120
Well, you've never revealed Uncle Sham's secrets, have you?

02:57.120 --> 03:01.680
Oh, yeah. They are not big fans of Prism at Denny's, because they have, they got some shit

03:02.400 --> 03:06.080
that they don't, you can't work at Denny's unless you've got some shit in the closet.

03:06.800 --> 03:12.400
They are all, Denny's is run by libertarian, like really hardcore libertarians.

03:12.400 --> 03:12.640
Sure.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.280
They want all the secrets out, and Snowden has them all.

03:17.280 --> 03:23.520
That was, I believe it was Dennis Cromwell, who, who the founder of Denny's,

03:24.160 --> 03:31.760
who just hated just Uncle Sam's watching over him, watching over his secret, his buried gold.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.920
That's how he earned the title, Dennis the Annoyance.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.040
And we feel like they really missed an opportunity there,

03:41.040 --> 03:42.720
but they're pretty set in stone on that name.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.680
I want to shank you gentlemen again.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.800
You want to shank us?

03:46.800 --> 03:47.920
Jesus Christ, no.

03:48.960 --> 03:56.240
I'm sorry. I do not mean, I meant, of course, to thank you.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.520
Do you have a lisp or an aphasia?

04:01.520 --> 04:05.760
Because you keep, you keep dropping on things that aren't S's.

04:06.400 --> 04:11.120
I'd love to tell you that, but unfortunately it's one of my secrets.

04:11.120 --> 04:11.360
Okay.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.040
Once I'm there, I'll give them all a little vogue.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.320
Okay. Okay.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.200
Well, thank you.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.960
I can't wait to, I wish Justin was, I'll be honest, Edward,

04:20.960 --> 04:24.240
I wish Justin was here and not, not you, just because.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.440
Well, that's fine.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.800
Listen, he's here at the Denny's with me under a table.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.520
I'll pass him the microphone.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.200
How big is this table that I can fit?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.400
Stare at him.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.800
It's one of my secrets.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.280
Okay.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.480
And I'll stare at him as he records the comedy.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.320
That's going to be very, very distracting.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.840
This is my home, I feel I should become acclimated with your waves.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.400
Yeah.

04:46.400 --> 04:46.720
Okay.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.120
Well, again, thanks for joining us.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.000
I hope that this doesn't get us in any more legal hot water.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.760
Of course, it's been my pleasure.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.040
Okay.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.400
Hey guys.

04:56.400 --> 04:56.960
Hey Justin.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.360
Hi Justin.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.640
Hey, can Snowden hear you right now?

05:00.640 --> 05:01.680
Can he hear us?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.520
He's literally two inches from my face.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.200
Can he hear me or do you have headphones on?

05:05.200 --> 05:08.080
Let's, I do have headphones and he's just that close.

05:08.080 --> 05:08.880
Let's just.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.080
I need you to ditch him.

05:10.080 --> 05:10.960
No, don't ditch him.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.400
Here's a, he's got a pretty huge bounty on his head

05:14.400 --> 05:17.120
and we could really, really, really use the money.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.600
But we, but guys, we, we granted him asylum, asylum.

05:21.600 --> 05:21.840
Right.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.640
But the thing is that we're not a fucking country.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.480
So like, we can't actually do that.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.160
We can't actually.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.800
He just walked into the door and yelled sanctuary.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.280
Right.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.560
And that's not the same thing.

05:32.560 --> 05:37.760
Well, it is in a Denny's, but, but we, I have, I have no allegiance to this fool

05:37.760 --> 05:42.720
because I, I love prism, I love it so much.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.840
I want to know what everybody's doing all the time.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.320
Exactly.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.600
I should introduce myself, by the way.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.120
We've helped Edward Snowden and I think now we should help someone else.

05:53.120 --> 05:53.840
It's only fair.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.760
Anyone ever get him confused with the vampire guy from the Twilight movies?

05:57.760 --> 05:58.720
Only constantly.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.800
I hate talking on the phone.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.880
I can barely understand people and I don't like having to stop whatever I'm doing to

06:04.880 --> 06:06.240
have a conversation.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.840
So I've developed a policy.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.200
I don't answer the phone unless someone calls multiple times.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.200
So it's probably an emergency.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.560
Or if they text me beforehand to ask if I'm free to talk.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.360
If they leave a message, I will usually respond via email.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.960
If text, if possible.

06:20.960 --> 06:28.720
My question is there a way to explain this policy in my voicemail message, I like people

06:28.720 --> 06:32.720
to know I'm not answering, but I don't want to sound like a jerk.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.320
And that's from phone phobic.

06:34.320 --> 06:40.080
Oh, oh, there's an intrinsic problem there, though.

06:40.080 --> 06:44.800
I say this and with all the love in my heart, you are kind of you're kind of being a jerk

06:44.800 --> 06:45.440
a little bit.

06:45.440 --> 06:51.520
Like, I wish there was a loophole, too, because I despise talking on the phone immensely.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.040
I don't care who's calling.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.400
I don't care what the context is.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.480
I despise talking on the phone.

06:56.480 --> 07:01.120
Always, constantly, I'm starting to get the feeling that that's like 80 percent of the

07:01.120 --> 07:02.400
population of the earth.

07:02.400 --> 07:08.000
Like, I'm sure there are people that love just chatting away for hours, but I don't

07:08.000 --> 07:08.960
know any of them.

07:08.960 --> 07:13.840
And so my there you might know them as women.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.840
Oh, come on, what's up?

07:17.840 --> 07:22.000
I have actually I've reversed my position because I used to be on that side.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.480
But now, like the inefficiency of SMS, like, drives me up a fucking wall because it's like

07:28.480 --> 07:30.080
what what should I bring to the potluck?

07:30.640 --> 07:31.840
Wait 10 minutes.

07:31.840 --> 07:32.800
I don't know, whatever.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.880
A grain and then send it back like literally 30 seconds later.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.320
Like, can you be more specific about what kind of grain you want me to bring in gluten

07:40.320 --> 07:40.720
free?

07:40.720 --> 07:41.840
Wait 10 more minutes.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.040
And then it's like couscous.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.280
And it's like, I don't think is couscous even a grain.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.400
And then you have to wait 10 minutes.

07:46.400 --> 07:51.840
And like, get me on the phone and I'll knock out this couscous discussion like super fast,

07:51.840 --> 07:52.560
super quickly.

07:54.400 --> 08:01.440
I think the problem here at question asker is that there is no way to frame this without

08:01.440 --> 08:07.280
it sounding like you're screening because you are definitely because and that's why

08:07.280 --> 08:11.360
you're afraid of sounding like a jerk because it is is a jerky move that you're saying.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.280
Like, if it is important enough, then I will deign to speak to you.

08:15.280 --> 08:20.960
Otherwise, I will respond in written communication so as not to waste my time.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.320
This is just like anything else.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.800
Like, yeah, you can build these walls, but don't expect it to not have a detrimental

08:26.800 --> 08:28.240
effect on your relationships.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.320
I mean, it yeah, absolutely, like, but I understand the impulse.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.840
But these kinds of human interactions are sort of the the toll you pay.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.720
They're the building blocks of relationships.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.040
That was the most sociopathic thing I think you've ever said.

08:43.040 --> 08:43.600
Sorry.

08:43.600 --> 08:48.080
I mean, this is human talking to other humans is the toll you pay to live.

08:48.080 --> 08:48.560
Like, what?

08:51.280 --> 08:55.120
I get what you're saying, because this is what leads people to like when it's like,

08:55.120 --> 08:56.480
hey, let's all hang out tonight.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.760
Oh, give Tommy a call.

08:57.760 --> 09:02.320
Oh, no, Tommy never wants to do anything because you don't answer the phone and like,

09:02.320 --> 09:03.040
talk to people.

09:03.040 --> 09:09.040
Like, this is how you start to like surgically cut yourself out of people's lives.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.880
And it's it's not really cool.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.240
It's a slippery slip.

09:12.240 --> 09:12.720
That's all.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.200
I mean, I yeah, you can cut this off and then people just stop calling and then it's

09:17.200 --> 09:19.200
like hermit in your full.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.360
Also, there's no way that you can make your voicemail message something that explanatory

09:23.360 --> 09:26.320
and still keep it like fresh and poppy and fun.

09:26.320 --> 09:26.960
You know what I mean?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.160
Dave, thanks for calling me.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.240
I didn't answer because I probably don't like you.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.280
No, but it's like, how can you leave like your catchphrase like a joking catchphrase

09:35.280 --> 09:35.760
on your foot?

09:35.760 --> 09:39.600
Like a socket to me or like answering on the flip flop.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.640
Hey, hey, Meryl Streep.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.240
Leave it at the beep and then wait and then I'll leave it at the beat.

09:45.600 --> 09:51.040
I want to just I wish there was a technological way for me to have my voicemail just be like

09:51.040 --> 09:53.040
answering machine messages from the 80s.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.400
There should be a great website for that where you can just import those because some of

09:56.400 --> 09:56.960
those were great.

09:56.960 --> 10:00.480
We had a tape of them, of all these classic great bits.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.560
I think there was a guy pretending to be Barney Fife.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.520
I'd love to get that as a voicemail.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.280
Shit, we should just cancel the podcast.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.360
Just release those over.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.600
Just release those as our podcast.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.880
You know that West Virginia just instituted a law.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.840
Travis, I should have warned you.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.160
Well, I guess you didn't come to West Virginia, so you're fine.

10:18.160 --> 10:25.360
West Virginia just instituted a law on July 1st that you can't talk on the phone while

10:25.360 --> 10:25.840
you're driving.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.040
It's actually a primary offense.

10:27.040 --> 10:32.400
You can get pulled over for that, so maybe you could always pretend like you were driving

10:32.400 --> 10:34.160
or you could always be driving.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.200
Well, then people are going to start to think like you're a truck driver.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.560
Maybe you are.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.160
Maybe that's your escape.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.560
You know, no, I can't hang out with you tonight.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.640
I'm shipping a hollow NyQuil through Northeastern Oklahoma.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.480
I'm deep in a convoy right now.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.760
I can't break out of here.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.520
I'm fucking and fucking.

10:51.520 --> 10:56.960
Listen, I'm on a mountain of meth, and I'm not going to come down for 18 to 19 hours,

10:56.960 --> 11:00.800
so I can't waste that high on going to go see Iron Man 3 with you.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.320
You could just start answering the phone saying, ask acid grass, nobody rides for free,

11:04.320 --> 11:08.080
and then people will be like, I can't give you any of those things over the phone.

11:09.040 --> 11:13.920
I guess I can PayPal you, but then I can't ass or grass you that way.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.920
I can't send you ass through PayPal, sadly.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.960
How about it, technology?

11:18.960 --> 11:20.080
Hey, pay.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.560
Hey, Griffin, do you have any Yahoo?

11:22.560 --> 11:25.760
Yeah, just as soon as I think of a fun name for what PayPal would be called for.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.760
OK, let's just take a second and let's see what we can come up with.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.160
PayPal with benefits.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.520
That's pretty good.

11:36.320 --> 11:36.800
There you go.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.800
This Yahoo answer.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.600
Thank you, by the way, everybody who sent in Yahoo answers.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.880
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Julie Kin.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.520
Thank you, Julie.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.440
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jamie, I Jamie.

11:52.640 --> 12:00.400
Jesus, Ricky, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.040
Shameless.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.240
Jamie is who asks.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.480
How to cheaply catch a thief cheaply?

12:08.160 --> 12:12.400
Need some clever ideas about how to catch someone stealing from a walk in cupboard.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.960
Only person going in there for this would be the thief, but pretty sure traps are illegal.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.360
Need something cheap as we're poor, lol.

12:19.360 --> 12:19.760
Thanks.

12:20.880 --> 12:21.680
Hold on.

12:21.680 --> 12:22.640
OK, wait, hold on.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.560
I don't understand the parameters of this question.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.600
Are you telling me you have a cupboard that exists solely to be burgled?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.000
Is that what you're telling me?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.080
But no one walks in except the thief.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.120
It seems like the best trap then would be to watch and see who walks in.

12:35.120 --> 12:39.520
I think this person is saying this cupboard has has been so thoroughly burgled

12:39.520 --> 12:46.080
that they are willing to change it into a fucking reverse panic room.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.800
That is just burglable.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.440
If you think about it, this room is just full of chalices.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.960
If you think about it, prisons are all reverse panic rooms

12:57.520 --> 13:01.040
because it just puts the danger inside and then everything else is safe.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.240
That is what this person is talking about.

13:04.240 --> 13:09.920
They're pulling a reverse Jodie Foster, which is also my favorite sexual position.

13:09.920 --> 13:14.320
I feel like we played enough like Sega CD FMV games

13:14.320 --> 13:16.000
that we should be able to answer this question.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.800
I think there needs to be a lever on the wall that you pull and the floor drops out.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.240
What Sega CD FMV games are you talking about other than Night Trap?

13:22.240 --> 13:24.320
He's talking about Double Switch also.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.320
Wasn't there one called Maniac Mansion too?

13:26.320 --> 13:28.000
Maniac Mansion was something completely different.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.720
That was an adventure game.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.680
Anyway, lots of great references.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.680
Keep your Sega CD in there and then you notice it's missing.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.280
The only person you're going to catch in that fucking honeypot is Justin McElroy.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.320
Oopsie daisy.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.760
Where is this cupboard, by the way?

13:45.760 --> 13:47.200
The imaginary cupboard I invented.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.120
Gotta get over there.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.920
This person is probably right in that traps are illegal.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.520
You watch Home Alone and everyone has a good time and a good laugh.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.560
They get hit with a paint bucket.

13:58.560 --> 14:03.120
They get electrocuted with an amount of voltage that would kill a fucking elephant.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.600
And we all have a good time and we all have a good laugh.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.080
But that shit that that little kid pulls is wicked illegal, right?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.240
I mean, the thing about-

14:12.240 --> 14:12.640
Hold on.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.080
You think the Sticky Bandits are going to take him to court and be like,

14:16.080 --> 14:18.080
I'm suffering serious trauma?

14:18.080 --> 14:21.440
I think the Sticky Bandits would have a fucking great case against that kid.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.160
Yeah, absolutely.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.640
They set his head on fire.

14:25.280 --> 14:25.680
Now here's the thing about it though-

14:25.680 --> 14:27.520
But they were going in to kill him.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.240
Okay, it depends on what you're talking about.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.160
If you're talking about Home Alone 1,

14:34.160 --> 14:40.720
I think that the people versus Kevin McAllister is going to be very weak because Kevin is-

14:41.760 --> 14:46.160
Justin, I hate to interrupt, but I think you mean the Bandits versus Kevin McAllister

14:46.160 --> 14:50.080
because I don't think the people of the city have banded together to support-

14:50.080 --> 14:50.640
No, no.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.000
They're going to be a criminal trial first and then-

14:54.000 --> 14:56.480
Take it to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

14:56.480 --> 14:56.720
Okay.

14:56.720 --> 15:02.160
Yeah, so anyway, in Home Alone 1, people versus Kevin McAllister is going to be very weak

15:02.160 --> 15:10.560
because Kevin McAllister was defending his home and absolutely the impetus, I think,

15:10.560 --> 15:13.120
is on him to defend that in any way he sees fit.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.160
He could have killed them.

15:14.160 --> 15:14.640
Oh, you're saying-

15:14.640 --> 15:17.200
He could have shot them with a shotgun.

15:17.200 --> 15:22.640
Chicago, as we all know, the castle doctrine is very much in play in Illinois.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.440
Yeah, absolutely.

15:23.440 --> 15:27.280
He has unlimited power, unlimited lethal power.

15:27.840 --> 15:33.280
Problematically, though, in Home Alone 2, your case, if you're Kevin McAllister,

15:33.280 --> 15:37.440
is going to get very weak because you have sadistically, I would say,

15:38.000 --> 15:45.200
lured these men into your trap of hurting and just to defend a toy store, pretty much.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.920
He could have called Lamp up in that hotel, had Tim Curry bringing him waffles.

15:49.920 --> 15:54.720
Now, it's been a while since I saw the movie, but isn't his final trap house,

15:54.720 --> 15:56.080
isn't that like his uncle's house?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.320
Or it's a relative's house of some sort, right?

15:58.320 --> 15:58.880
And that's how he's-

15:58.880 --> 16:00.880
It's his uncle's house.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.280
That's what's fucked up is that it's his uncle's house.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.440
They're rebuilding it.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.640
They're remodeling it.

16:06.640 --> 16:12.320
So if those fucking guys hadn't come that night, there would have been a score of contractors

16:12.960 --> 16:15.680
who would have perished at this little kid's hands.

16:15.680 --> 16:20.480
Right? There is almost certainly more trap.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.400
There's no way he hit them all.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.200
Those contractors are going in the next morning like,

16:25.200 --> 16:27.680
why is this knob sticky?

16:27.680 --> 16:28.960
Ah, electricity.

16:31.120 --> 16:36.160
I wish that the whole second movie was just spent with Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci screaming,

16:36.160 --> 16:37.200
what are the odds?

16:37.760 --> 16:38.880
How could this happen again?

16:39.520 --> 16:40.400
Twice?

16:40.400 --> 16:40.800
Twice?

16:40.800 --> 16:41.360
Really?

16:41.360 --> 16:42.320
Is anything-

16:42.320 --> 16:44.960
We went to the biggest city in America.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.280
And we ran into the same 10-year-old.

16:47.280 --> 16:55.200
Are you also telling me that like, job one, once you get out of prison for being the wet bandits,

16:55.200 --> 16:59.680
job one isn't, listen, we've got to start carrying guns.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.720
We just have to buy a gun and use it on a child.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.680
We see a child and he's got a trap.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.040
We just gotta shoot him.

17:07.040 --> 17:07.440
Shoot the child.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.800
I know it's hard.

17:08.800 --> 17:14.160
Many of the traps are automated, I'm sure, but most of them are being deployed by the child on us.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.280
And if the child is dead, we have nothing to fear.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.040
We don't even have to pursue him anymore.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.400
We just move on.

17:20.400 --> 17:25.920
We don't even have to worry about fucking Brenda Fricker launching palm after palm of bird feed

17:25.920 --> 17:28.800
at us to attack us with her army of birds.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.720
She's like, fly my children at bam bam.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.240
Oh no.

17:34.240 --> 17:40.240
You know, we give him a lot of credit for being sort of a master strategist.

17:40.240 --> 17:47.440
But if your end game relies on the possibility that an old woman is gonna throw seeds at your assailants,

17:47.440 --> 17:49.680
you do not have a strong plan.

17:49.680 --> 17:55.680
You know, you've actually just made me realize, in both movies, he would be dead if it were not

17:55.680 --> 17:58.960
for the creepy old people that he encountered along the way.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.520
For elderly intervention.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.960
Yeah, no question about it.

18:00.960 --> 18:01.680
Oh wow.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.200
You think old people aren't worth anything anymore, but.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.000
How scary is Brenda Fricker in that movie?

18:08.880 --> 18:09.760
So scary.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.320
Is there anything scarier than her in that movie?

18:13.040 --> 18:15.680
I don't understand how she did that movie in that movie.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.400
Tim Curry's not.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.120
Yeah, yeah, he's pretty scary.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.720
You know what's scary?

18:20.720 --> 18:21.760
I'll tell you what's scary.

18:21.760 --> 18:29.680
Timeline wise, the wet bandits have been in prison for about 12 months for home invasion

18:29.680 --> 18:32.080
and like trying to kill a child.

18:32.080 --> 18:36.320
They were put in prison for, let's say a year.

18:36.320 --> 18:36.720
They escaped, don't they?

18:36.720 --> 18:37.920
They're escapists.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.960
Yeah, they escaped.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.160
They dig out of the ground.

18:40.160 --> 18:40.800
They escaped from prison.

18:40.800 --> 18:46.240
They can't escape a 10 year old child with paint cans on strings, but they've escaped.

18:46.240 --> 18:52.720
Well, that was the, that was the, they got sent to a prison run by devious conniving

18:52.720 --> 19:00.080
little kids who just, who it was, it was just an open field with hanging paint cans suspended.

19:00.080 --> 19:04.400
It was like, it was like the open prisons of Siberia.

19:04.400 --> 19:09.520
It's actually really troubling that the two elder, the elderly interventions in Home Alone

19:09.520 --> 19:13.600
one and two, I, I refuse to acknowledge the existence of three and four.

19:14.480 --> 19:19.920
The, the elderly, elderly interventionists in one and two actually send a really confusing

19:19.920 --> 19:25.280
message to America's kids because what it says is, you know what we've been telling

19:25.280 --> 19:26.800
you about strangers.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.600
That's true.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.240
But if they look really creepy and are homeless, that's the thing.

19:32.240 --> 19:38.160
Yeah, there is a chance that they might be cool and protect you and will only do so if

19:38.160 --> 19:39.280
you interact with them.

19:39.280 --> 19:43.760
So maybe by interacting with strangers, you're not putting yourself up for danger.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.320
You're actually making an investment in your future state.

19:46.320 --> 19:51.520
I think that had they gotten to a third movie with Macaulay Culkin, with Macaulay Culkin,

19:51.520 --> 19:57.200
canonical third movie, then the stranger he met would be like covered in blood and like

19:57.200 --> 19:58.080
wielding a knife.

19:58.080 --> 20:02.560
But turns out he's just a butcher because like in the first one, he's not homeless.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.360
He owns a home.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.440
He's just a dude that like salts the sidewalk and that's and everyone's like, oh, he's

20:07.440 --> 20:08.160
a murderer.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.120
Yeah, because he's got a shovel and he's old.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.240
Kids, great job.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.520
Kids are so cruel.

20:15.440 --> 20:21.520
And you're 10 years old and some sort of choice is presented to you where you have to choose

20:21.520 --> 20:27.120
between Joe Pesci or Brenda Fricker and one of them is going to murder you and the other

20:27.120 --> 20:31.440
one is going to provide you is going to is going to provide you sanctuary.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.640
And you have to make this choice between Pesci or Fricker.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.000
One of these is going to murder.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.480
Which one?

20:36.480 --> 20:37.040
Which one would you choose?

20:37.040 --> 20:38.400
It would obviously be Fricker.

20:38.960 --> 20:39.840
She would eat you.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.080
Yeah.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.840
No question about it.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.640
Now, how sweet would it be, though, Travis?

20:44.640 --> 20:48.320
You know what you're suggesting about the old the crazy old person turning out to be

20:48.320 --> 20:49.680
genuinely crazy.

20:49.680 --> 20:57.040
How sweet would it have been for Home Alone 3 if the threat turns out to be so real that

20:57.040 --> 21:04.960
Macaulay Culkin has to team up with what would they be at that the the slippery bandits, the

21:04.960 --> 21:10.000
moist bandits, the tactile bandits, the tacky bandits, the scratchy bandits, the goopy bandits,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.120
whatever they are.

21:11.120 --> 21:15.520
He has to team up with them to defeat this larger threat.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.120
Like, I would watch the hell out of that movie.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.000
Are you kidding me?

21:20.720 --> 21:23.040
And then they turn on each other, match.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.480
I think they have guns this time.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.000
I think Home Alone 3 is actually technically the last 45 minutes of Skyfall.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.120
Let's move on.

21:31.840 --> 21:37.120
How do I gently bring up the issue of my sister leaving her hair in brushes?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.480
We're a family that has a bunch of hair brushes and no one claims particular ownership over

21:43.120 --> 21:44.160
any brush.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.240
It's a communist hairbrush society.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.160
Yeah, me and my sister.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.200
I'm a guy, by the way.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.880
We both use the same too.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.960
But every other day I see a big old mess of red hair on the brush and I have to take it

21:54.960 --> 21:55.920
out myself.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.840
I don't want to piss off my sister and otherwise irker as I think outright saying,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.240
hey, don't be so gross and clean up.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.200
Would piss her off.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.000
Would piss her off.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.680
That's from Hair Horror in Her Majesty's England.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.680
Boy, it's a shame that Christmas has already passed because if only there was some way

22:15.680 --> 22:18.160
for you to secure your own private hairbrush.

22:18.160 --> 22:22.000
Fuck, but this question is it sounds like they have ample brushes for everybody to have

22:22.000 --> 22:22.800
their own brush.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.080
This person doesn't need another brush.

22:24.080 --> 22:28.080
They need a fucking six dollar labeling machine that they buy at Walgreens.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.840
Especially when you have two brushes shared between two people.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.200
Tiffy up the brushes.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.400
This is not like a Solomon-esque like split the brush in half.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.440
Everybody gets half a brush.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.200
Oh, I got the handle end.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.120
I can't do anything with this unless I want to curl it, I guess.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.080
But this isn't a known issue, though.

22:46.080 --> 22:54.720
I would say that like, so my wife will take a hairbrush that I have and it's like put

22:54.720 --> 22:58.800
it somewhere, I don't know, wherever she dries her hair, which could be in different rooms.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.400
I don't know where she's going to do her hair.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.480
And then I have to go find my brush and then I'll buy a new brush and think, well, this

23:04.480 --> 23:06.560
one will be Justin's private brush.

23:06.560 --> 23:11.920
And then no matter what, it somehow slips into the cogs of that machine and it becomes

23:11.920 --> 23:12.720
her brush again.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.600
And it's a vicious cycle.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.680
I don't know why she likes to appropriate my brushes.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.600
What you have to do is you have to put your brush in a special drawer and then in front

23:19.600 --> 23:23.360
of that drawer, spread out some micro machines and some Christmas ornaments.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.200
That would just make her want it all the more, though.

23:29.200 --> 23:29.600
Yeah.

23:29.600 --> 23:35.440
Also, we would be creating a home alone forever scenario because Sydney would leave Justin.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.480
Home alonist.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.040
Oh, here's a solution question asker.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.360
And it's going to be gross at first, but stick with me.

23:45.360 --> 23:51.920
Collect the hair and then give her a sweater knit out of her own hair and that'll teach

23:51.920 --> 23:52.400
her.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.840
Teach her that you're a psychopath.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.800
You could make a new sister out of that hair, a politer sister.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.280
This is my new politer sister.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.320
This is my new polite sister.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.200
Watch what she does.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.600
And then you move her hair hand onto the brush.

24:07.600 --> 24:16.160
Although I do think that it is going to be really hard for you to make a case for you

24:16.160 --> 24:20.800
finding your sister's hair gross when you spend literally every waking hour sculpting

24:20.800 --> 24:21.840
it into a new human.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.160
Yeah, creating a hair golem.

24:24.160 --> 24:28.800
I think you run a real risk of Stockholm syndrome setting in with that hair.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.360
Where you become obsessed with it and everybody hates you.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.840
This is the dumbest.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.440
Just buy a new fucking brush and put a new brush and keep it secret.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.680
What if she catches you though?

24:41.680 --> 24:42.960
Like, what the fuck?

24:42.960 --> 24:43.600
What is that?

24:43.600 --> 24:44.400
What is this?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.920
I thought we were cool.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.040
That brush looks so dope.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.240
I want to put my hair in it.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.440
Ah, damn it.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.840
Then you just got to let it go and buy another brush.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.640
And then eventually your parents are like, what is up with all these brush receipts?

24:54.640 --> 24:57.920
Oh, and then you say, oh, I can't use any other brush.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.120
This brush is prescription.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.640
Ah, can you invent a prescription brush that you need for your dandruff?

25:04.640 --> 25:08.240
Can you just have psoriasis and say it's contagious?

25:11.440 --> 25:12.880
What about lice?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.640
Are you saying fake lice or catch lice?

25:16.640 --> 25:17.920
Well, now presented the option.

25:17.920 --> 25:18.720
I'm going to go with fake.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.280
Go down to your local kindergarten and rub your head on every head in the building.

25:23.280 --> 25:27.120
Hey, and then you'll have a private brush that can't go within 300 yards.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.560
Because you'll be in prison.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.040
Hey, pubes.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.000
Pubes suggestion.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.440
All right.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.000
That's all.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.520
That's as far as the thought got.

25:39.520 --> 25:39.840
All right.

25:39.840 --> 25:40.560
That's the whole thing.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.400
I'm just saying if you don't use that brush.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.160
Yeah, that's it.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.280
That one's for pubes.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.160
That one's for pubes.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.360
That's my downtown brush.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.600
I call that brush sculpty because it helps me sculpt them.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.000
Into a perfect U.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.200
I mean the letter U.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.560
I'm not making a pubes sister.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.880
Pube sister.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.080
No, no, no, no.

26:04.080 --> 26:04.640
That's not a song.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.760
That's not a song.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.640
How about a Yahoo answer?

26:06.640 --> 26:08.080
How about a Yahoo?

26:10.480 --> 26:14.960
You think by singing it, you can cataract my singing of the pubes sister theme song jingle?

26:14.960 --> 26:15.120
Yes.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.720
It's my only hope.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.800
This Yahoo is sent in by Andy Hill.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.440
Thank you, Andy.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.280
It's about Yahoo answer user John.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.160
It's going to get gross.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.760
Here it goes.

26:23.760 --> 26:30.000
John asks, detailed how to kiss, please.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.040
Some girls like making out with me, and some say I use too much teeth.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.480
Help me out here, guys.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.280
How should you kiss?

26:40.960 --> 26:42.400
You shouldn't use your teeth.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.440
Teeth isn't bad.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.320
Well, sometimes you get, you know, if it's getting all.

26:47.440 --> 26:53.120
Of the enunciators, I would say that teeth are the least important in the equation.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.680
And lips and tip of the tongue are probably much better.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.640
Yeah, I don't think he's worried about hitting his hard consonants

26:58.640 --> 27:01.200
while he's mouth deep.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.400
Help with my plosives.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.360
Guys, I actually just got a letter from my lawyer.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.440
He says that it would be actually too weird for me to continue to participate

27:09.440 --> 27:10.720
in this particular conversation.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.360
I actually just got a letter from my copyright lawyer

27:13.360 --> 27:17.200
who said that if I give away my secrets, I will be infringing on my patents.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.760
Okay, but then let's go off the record here.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.960
Oh, let me turn the chair around, and that officially means we're off the record.

27:22.960 --> 27:23.760
And none of this.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.720
Okay, just to be clear, any kissing secrets I give away here cannot be used professionally.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.680
Do not tweet them.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.320
Do not quote us in your local periodicals.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.880
But we are about to drop some science on you.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.320
Girls love it when you just run your teeth into their teeth.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.600
If there's not a loud click.

27:41.600 --> 27:46.000
I did that a lot in high school, and the girls would be like, ow, what the fuck?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.040
And I'd be like, what's wrong?

27:47.040 --> 27:47.600
Don't you know?

27:47.600 --> 27:48.400
That's how it's good.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.200
That's how it's good.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.240
That's what's good.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.680
That's good now.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.760
Girls also like it when you sword fight with your tongues.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.480
When you really get in there and Greco-Roman wrestle with that shit.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.640
If you make a mistake and you seem to set them off right, set them off wrong, rather,

28:02.640 --> 28:10.320
you need to pretend that it's the way they do it in whatever the next level of education for you is.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.200
So if you're in middle school and your teeth click and they say,

28:13.200 --> 28:15.040
oh, I hate that, you say, well, that's, listen.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.760
This is what they do at the adult learning annex.

28:17.760 --> 28:21.760
This is how they do it in my doctorate program.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.440
So I don't know.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.920
You just need to maybe get a little more mature.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.600
If you do make a mistake, though, the best way to do it is to just lean in real close

28:29.600 --> 28:32.720
to their ear and just go, uh-oh, cheerios.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.520
Yeah, that's going to really ignite the night.

28:37.520 --> 28:40.240
I think it's really going to set this situation ablaze.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.920
The trick is to be thorough.

28:41.920 --> 28:47.680
Like just get your whole mouth in their mouth and just sort of scout around like a surgeon fish.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.400
My number one kissing rule is kiss every tooth.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.520
Kiss every tooth one by one.

28:51.520 --> 28:51.920
Let me see that.

28:51.920 --> 28:52.720
Wait, y'all a muller?

28:53.840 --> 28:57.360
And then, and if that starts to get stale, just start going around the face,

28:58.400 --> 29:02.560
go for the eyes, the nose, no holds barred.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.360
Use your nose.

29:04.240 --> 29:04.800
Yeah.

29:04.800 --> 29:09.120
Oh, do Eskimo kisses, butterfly kisses, especially butterfly kisses.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.320
Girls fucking love butterfly kisses.

29:10.320 --> 29:15.920
The oppression of Eskimo and butterfly kisses, they're so highly regimented and they don't

29:15.920 --> 29:20.320
need to be because they're saying like nose on nose is Eskimo, eyelash on cheek is-

29:20.320 --> 29:21.840
Can we say Inuit kisses?

29:21.840 --> 29:22.320
Yeah, sorry.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.680
Then you don't have to follow those rules.

29:25.680 --> 29:29.600
Put your fucking eyelash on their tongue and like just give them some of that for a bit.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.400
Put your nose in their ear?

29:35.600 --> 29:39.760
Yeah, just act like you're a puppy looking for some stray pizza sauce after pizza night.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.520
After pizza Thursdays.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.120
Don't explore their mouth after pizza Thursdays though.

29:48.160 --> 29:48.480
No.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.920
And you know what else girls love?

29:49.920 --> 29:56.880
Women and gentlemen enjoy that before you do anything, you ask, and I mean constantly,

29:56.880 --> 29:58.880
is it okay if I kiss your eyeball?

29:58.880 --> 29:59.920
May I kiss your nose?

29:59.920 --> 30:00.480
Do you kiss them?

30:00.480 --> 30:02.640
I'm gonna look behind your ear for pizza sauce.

30:02.640 --> 30:07.600
Yeah, or just if you're doing the mouth too, just give them like a, can I kiss your mouth?

30:07.600 --> 30:08.960
No.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.760
Can I kiss your mouth?

30:10.640 --> 30:12.000
Can I kiss your mouth again?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.120
I really like it.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.040
And keep growing in intensity every time you ask.

30:15.040 --> 30:15.920
Can I kiss your mouth?

30:16.960 --> 30:17.760
How about that mouth?

30:19.440 --> 30:20.320
Please.

30:20.320 --> 30:20.960
Can I ask-

30:20.960 --> 30:21.840
Give me that mouth!

30:24.160 --> 30:30.480
How are we going to alert our listeners that it is now safe to walk across the room

30:30.480 --> 30:36.240
and pick up the headphones that they have surely by now cast from the-

30:36.240 --> 30:37.920
I've got like at least three more minutes of snitching tips.

30:37.920 --> 30:42.320
Somewhere there's some dude with a notepad going, ask before you do any of this.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.600
This is good, this is good stuff.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.600
Pizza Thursdays, okay, got it.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.400
This is all good.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.000
Okay, butterfly kisses.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.280
He is in breach of contract if he's doing that, so I have very little pity.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.680
It is all about feedback.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.800
Because you're worried about what you're doing, they're worried about what they're doing.

30:56.800 --> 31:01.280
So give them like, like when you get a kiss from them, say something like,

31:02.960 --> 31:04.880
just like mommy and daddy do it.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.800
To just like let them know that they are doing like a perfect job, just like mommy and daddy do it.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.120
This is how I've seen it done in movies.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.400
Can we upside down it like Spider-Man?

31:16.320 --> 31:17.920
Can you give me one Spider-Man?

31:17.920 --> 31:26.000
All right, I want to genuinely help people with the only genuinely helpful portion of our program.

31:27.280 --> 31:27.920
Farm wisdom.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.960
Farm wisdom!

31:30.960 --> 31:31.920
Farm wisdom!

31:31.920 --> 31:35.760
Get a pitchfork in your hand, farm wisdom.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.260
Ow!

31:36.880 --> 31:38.800
Like the sharp end or the handle end?

31:38.800 --> 31:39.600
I'm holding it.

31:39.600 --> 31:40.160
Okay.

31:40.160 --> 31:40.640
Oh, okay.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.360
Travis, hit me.

31:42.560 --> 31:48.320
This first one is very special, and it comes from Elizabeth Gilbert.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.560
Just because she's a celeb?

31:50.560 --> 31:54.160
It's special, it's more special than our normal listeners?

31:54.880 --> 31:57.600
Elizabeth Gilbert has had two notable works.

31:57.600 --> 32:04.240
The first, of course, being eat, pray, love, the second being the fact that if a goat eats poison ivy

32:04.240 --> 32:09.920
and you drink the goat's milk, you get poison ivy immunity that she wrote into our show Farm Wisdom.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.200
Thank you, Elizabeth Gilbert.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.760
Now, the only question I have about this, and I'm going to have to do some research,

32:15.760 --> 32:20.480
is if it is you have poison ivy immunity for the rest of your life,

32:20.480 --> 32:24.800
or if you have it for a very brief amount of time, like you have it for like an hour,

32:24.800 --> 32:26.480
and for that hour you need to like-

32:26.480 --> 32:27.120
Just go.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.040
Just go hog wild and just really-

32:29.040 --> 32:29.600
Yeah.

32:29.600 --> 32:34.400
Just tip fate, like rub your balls all over some poison ivy, like not today, poison ivy.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.960
This is gonna be a good afternoon for me.

32:36.960 --> 32:44.080
I wonder if you give the goat regular poison, can you like get like Rasputin?

32:46.000 --> 32:50.400
Or is it whatever the goat eat, like so what if the goat eats paper plates?

32:50.400 --> 32:51.760
Do you get paper plate immunity?

32:51.760 --> 32:54.560
If the goat eats pizza, you can't taste pizza after you drink its milk.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.160
The fate worse than death.

32:56.160 --> 32:56.880
All right.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.960
If the goat eats a bullet.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.080
Oh, shit.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.440
Think about it.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.080
If the goat eats a passport, you get diplomatic immunity.

33:06.080 --> 33:06.720
Asshole.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.200
We got another one sent in to us from Senta.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.040
She says, chickens are very stupid, and I wish that was the whole thing,

33:15.040 --> 33:19.920
but when it comes time to gather eggs, you can replace the eggs with golf balls,

33:19.920 --> 33:22.000
and they won't notice anything has changed.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.360
Also, horses run around real fucking crazy right before a thunderstorm.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.480
They just told, all right, Senta, thank you, but you just told us two things

33:30.480 --> 33:35.040
we probably could have sussed out on our own, like yeah, chickens are super dumb.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.880
Also, horses like to roll and run around and frolic and shit.

33:38.880 --> 33:42.560
Horses do that, no, but horses do that in the case that there's a nature photographer there,

33:42.560 --> 33:46.800
because they want to capture like an inspirational pic of a lightning bolt.

33:46.800 --> 33:47.280
Did you get it?

33:47.280 --> 33:47.920
I was blinking.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.560
Okay, hold on.

33:48.560 --> 33:48.880
Damn it.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.120
Okay.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.320
I had all three of my feet on the ground.

33:50.320 --> 33:50.640
Let me try one more time.

33:50.640 --> 33:55.600
Also, which fucking farmer Indiana Jones is like,

33:55.600 --> 33:58.800
hold up, let me just do this perfect swap, whoop, got him.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.600
Now, I haven't perturbed-

33:59.600 --> 34:00.160
That's my question.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.360
It's probably because chickens are sitting there thinking, God, farmers are stupid.

34:03.360 --> 34:03.840
Yeah.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.280
They could just take the egg.

34:05.280 --> 34:05.840
Just take it.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.440
It's like, it's my ovum.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.720
I make one every day.

34:08.720 --> 34:09.840
Just take it.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.320
It's uncomfortable in there.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.400
How much money are you spending on golf balls?

34:14.400 --> 34:16.320
Do you have like a permanent one in, one out?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.560
Like if you have like a hearty country breakfast, that's like,

34:18.560 --> 34:19.920
I don't know.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.480
That's like three cases of tidal mints right there.

34:22.480 --> 34:26.560
The only bad thing is if you want to go golf, then you have to go buy a dozen eggs

34:26.560 --> 34:27.920
because you need your balls back.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.520
So you're going to have to swap in some eggs for the golf balls that you left there.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.640
And then that's a vicious cycle.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.800
That would be a much better test of how smart chickens are

34:34.800 --> 34:37.280
if you just swapped an egg for a different egg

34:37.280 --> 34:39.760
and just see if the chicken goes like, hey, hey, come over here.

34:39.760 --> 34:40.800
Does this look different to you?

34:41.360 --> 34:42.960
I swear I didn't look like that when I laid it.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.880
The snake comes out of it.

34:44.880 --> 34:48.400
And pantyhose come out of it.

34:50.960 --> 34:51.440
Let's go.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.000
This message is for Alex Solak.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.280
Griffin, who's the message from?

35:07.280 --> 35:08.640
It's from John Solak.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.080
You guys know if you reverse the word Solak, it says koalas.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.520
Mm-hmm.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.720
That's not true at all.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.000
It's pretty close, though.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.720
Edward, what's the message?

35:21.600 --> 35:25.440
Happy birthday to my favorite and only brother, Alex.

35:25.440 --> 35:30.800
He likes science fiction, maximum fun, postulating about our inevitable

35:30.800 --> 35:36.960
techno-organic future, being sociable friends, the internet in general, and spending.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.360
He turned me on to boom, boom, boom, boom.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.200
And I'm eternally grateful.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.320
Have a great 26th birthday.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.000
We are just going to have to refund this guy's money,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
because none of that was intelligible.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.680
That all made perfect sense to me.

35:53.680 --> 35:59.040
And who better to speak on our inevitable techno-organic future than Edward Snowden?

35:59.040 --> 36:00.160
That's what he's trying to prevent.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.040
Robot plants?

36:01.040 --> 36:02.160
You mean robot plants?

36:02.960 --> 36:03.840
Something like that.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.800
I think he's talking about when we are just melted down to sludge,

36:06.800 --> 36:16.000
and then that sludge is like the synapse fuel that all of our world's wars will take place,

36:17.280 --> 36:21.760
just in a digital recreation of mankind.

36:23.120 --> 36:24.080
That sounds about right.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.000
Have you read much Ellison, Travis?

36:26.000 --> 36:26.800
You like to fuck?

36:29.600 --> 36:32.800
Tired of doing it the old way that you used to do it?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.440
Well, there's new ways.

36:35.440 --> 36:39.360
New ways you haven't even conceived of yet in your wildest dreams.

36:39.360 --> 36:39.760
It's like-

36:39.760 --> 36:40.400
Oh my shit.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.480
I just had the best idea for a remake.

36:42.480 --> 36:42.720
Okay.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.680
Home Alone, but with all Extreme Restraints products.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.920
Holy shit.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.440
I would watch that.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.040
So he opens the door and a bucket of lube-

36:58.880 --> 37:01.680
Tell you what, a bucket of water-based lube falls on you.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.960
Your day is over.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.080
He's walking across the ground barefoot on studded butt plugs, just like,

37:06.080 --> 37:07.680
ow, ow, ow, that's so gross.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.880
Just sitting outside on the front step are two flashlights,

37:10.880 --> 37:15.440
and then the rest of the movie is Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern just jerking it so right.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.960
They get so distracted by all their jerking it that they don't even go,

37:20.080 --> 37:22.720
I thought about Daniel Stern jerking it, no.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.640
Why did it happen?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.320
Just as a distraction technique,

37:30.320 --> 37:34.080
young Macaulay Culkin never appeared without a giant dildo

37:34.080 --> 37:35.760
attached to the front of his pants.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.480
What do you say that?

37:39.200 --> 37:41.040
Can you imagine if they're like,

37:41.040 --> 37:41.680
let's get-

37:41.680 --> 37:43.600
Whoa, hot you watching.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.880
Oh, God's been good to you, huh kid?

37:46.880 --> 37:49.120
That's quite a oops shotgun to the face.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.800
Well, not a shotgun, it'd probably be a whip.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.640
Wait, Macaulay Culkin just shot them?

37:52.640 --> 37:57.280
He's wearing a giant prosthetic dildo that he bought at extremrestraints.com,

37:57.280 --> 37:58.400
your adult superstore.

37:58.400 --> 38:03.120
And he has a shotgun that he bought, I guess, in another store, not extremrestraints.com.

38:04.320 --> 38:04.560
Oh.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.040
You could do something with the spurs, they have medical instruments,

38:07.040 --> 38:10.240
they have a Wartenberg wheel with a sheath that you-

38:10.240 --> 38:11.600
What is that, like a what?

38:11.600 --> 38:17.680
It's like a spur, it's like a wheel spur that you can run across your partner's skin

38:17.680 --> 38:19.520
to excite them and titillate them.

38:20.640 --> 38:23.600
And that's from King Industries, so you know it's quality.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.400
The great thing about extremrestraints.com is that

38:26.400 --> 38:35.600
if you use our coupon code, Sexabunga, then you can actually save 20% on your sex stuff.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.400
So if you've got to defend your home, you're going to need those savings.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.320
That's 20% more traps you can afford.

38:40.320 --> 38:40.960
Right.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.600
And you don't know how many traps they're going to be able to make it through.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.880
Maybe that extra 20% is what finally kills them.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.280
Oh, my God.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.960
How much different would that movie have been if the mom comes home at the end

38:52.960 --> 38:54.560
and there's just two dead men?

38:54.560 --> 38:56.240
Just dead-

38:56.240 --> 39:00.400
Two dead man bodies just sitting there and fucking her son.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.280
She's like, what?

39:01.280 --> 39:01.840
What happened?

39:01.840 --> 39:02.160
I don't-

39:02.160 --> 39:03.920
And he's got a huge dildo dick.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.560
I don't want to hug you now.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.720
Take that off and then we can talk about Christmas hugs.

39:09.760 --> 39:15.440
I was in a van with John Candy for 14 hours and I come home to two corpses and a sun dildo.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.640
Worst Christmas ever.

39:18.640 --> 39:19.120
Thank you.

39:20.080 --> 39:20.800
Thank you, Kevin.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.320
Thank you, Kevin.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.880
Thank you, Kevin, for this righteous present.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.520
I thought it was bad before.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.240
This is worse.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.160
I was picturing in my head the worst possible thing

39:34.160 --> 39:35.920
that could have been waiting for me when I got home.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.840
This is worse than you dead.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.200
This is worse than you dead.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.160
I got to say it.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.800
This is worse than finding you dead.

39:44.880 --> 39:48.560
I would rather have found you dead and all of our TVs burgled.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.480
Like so many Sega CDs.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.560
Fucking Home Alone 2, they get to their destination with Adam.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.600
She's like, fuck it.

39:55.600 --> 39:55.840
Nope.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.640
He is staying behind this time.

39:58.640 --> 39:59.200
Where's he at?

39:59.200 --> 40:00.000
I don't give a shit.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.480
That kid's a monster.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.840
I'm still thinking about Daniel Stern jerking off.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.040
I got to fuck it.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.560
We need a palate cleanser.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.520
You got to cleanse your palate.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.080
Give me something.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.680
Give me another mental image.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.480
Joe Pesci jerking it.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.880
That's way, it's the same.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.960
I am at, this is, this is weird.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.960
This is zero sum game, switching those two out.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.600
Fred Savage jerking it.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.400
No, I don't want any, I don't want anything like that.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.760
Fred Savage not jerking it.

40:35.200 --> 40:35.680
Okay.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.120
He really wanted to.

40:37.120 --> 40:37.760
Getting closer.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.800
But he's at like a funeral or something.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.400
Guys, it's getting late.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.680
Don't you guys need to get home?

40:43.680 --> 40:48.560
Oh boy, I got to clean up from this party.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.800
Hey, this is Aaron and Brian from Throwing Shade,

40:50.800 --> 40:53.680
and we would love to throw some shade on you this summer.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.000
Every Tuesday, we inject all sorts of news stories

40:56.000 --> 41:00.160
concerning ladies and gays with silliness and sexiness.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.920
Just in time for bikini season.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.480
Check us out on Max Fun under Throwing Shade.

41:04.480 --> 41:04.720
Okay.

41:04.720 --> 41:05.600
They're not stupid.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.120
I know, but yeah, they could be.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.240
Why would you spell it out like that?

41:08.240 --> 41:14.160
Well, because I was the spelling bee champion of the world.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.360
I'm throwing my husband a surprise party a few weeks from now.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.760
He's turning 30 and he's not thrilled about it.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.520
So I want to make it awesome for him.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.600
There's one dilemma I'm running into.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.840
How do I get him out of the house while the guests arrive

41:25.840 --> 41:26.480
and get things set up?

41:26.480 --> 41:27.680
Treasure hot, next question.

41:28.240 --> 41:32.800
My girlfriend of 2.5 years has recently really gotten into video games.

41:32.800 --> 41:36.400
That's awesome because I've been a gamer all my life.

41:36.400 --> 41:40.000
The only problem is she doesn't have anyone to play with except me and my friends.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.160
She plays with us occasionally, but there are times

41:42.160 --> 41:45.520
when I just want to hang out with the guys in a game

41:45.520 --> 41:47.680
or the game we're playing is too difficult for her.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.160
Okay.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.080
She isn't a fan of single player games.

41:50.080 --> 41:53.280
So how does she find other girls or guys to play with?

41:53.280 --> 41:54.720
None of her friends are into games

41:54.720 --> 41:58.000
and I'm stumped as how she can find some gamer friends.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.800
That's from gamer hunting in Illinois.

42:00.800 --> 42:04.160
Hey dog, I'm going to go out on a limb here and make a guess.

42:04.160 --> 42:04.400
Yeah.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.600
Yeah.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.840
The reason she has gotten into games

42:07.840 --> 42:11.200
is because she likes playing games with you.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.120
I mean, that's a possibility.

42:13.120 --> 42:16.000
I mean, that's not to say that she doesn't enjoy them.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.840
It's like, it's something that you guys are sharing together

42:21.840 --> 42:25.200
so she, you know, has fostered an interest in it.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.640
I mean, that's why I learned to read

42:28.640 --> 42:30.960
because my wife's always doing that and I thought, well.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.040
That's also why you learned surgery.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
Right, so we can have some common ground.

42:35.600 --> 42:42.480
I think it's pretty kind of a little bit shitty for you to say like,

42:42.480 --> 42:45.600
listen, I've got to find some other people to pawn you off on

42:45.600 --> 42:46.960
because my friends and I,

42:46.960 --> 42:50.000
we're going to ratchet the difficulty up to insanity

42:50.000 --> 42:52.640
and I just don't think you're going to be able to get the head shots.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.520
You're going to need to hang.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.320
I'm willing to bet because like, for example,

42:56.320 --> 43:00.240
Teresa likes playing board games and, you know, nerdy table game stuff.

43:00.240 --> 43:04.160
But like, there are times when I get invited over to go somewhere

43:04.160 --> 43:06.240
and we're going to play a game that I know she won't like,

43:06.240 --> 43:07.520
you know, something like that where I just go,

43:07.520 --> 43:09.600
hey, I think it's just going to be a dude's night.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.440
And as long as that's not like the norm,

43:11.440 --> 43:15.600
is that as long as that's like once in a while, that's not bad.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.440
You guys are missing the best answer.

43:18.080 --> 43:22.960
And that is you got to put her through an intense training regimen

43:22.960 --> 43:25.600
of getting fucking tight at games because like.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.880
Like montage style?

43:26.880 --> 43:28.400
Well, no, I mean, it's going to take a lot of work.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.640
It's not going to be like something you can fast forward through.

43:30.640 --> 43:33.520
It's going to like when Rachel and I started dating,

43:34.320 --> 43:37.840
her KD spread was, it was abysmal.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.680
Her headshot percentage, it was like in the negatives.

43:41.680 --> 43:46.800
Her accuracy, it was embarrassing to me.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.400
She's in the other room, so I don't want to be too loud,

43:48.400 --> 43:52.480
but it was embarrassing to me how inaccurate her gunfire was.

43:53.520 --> 43:56.480
So I put her through the ropes, you know,

43:56.480 --> 43:58.400
I imparted some of my master wisdom.

43:58.400 --> 44:03.440
Now her KD spread is still not great,

44:03.440 --> 44:05.200
but it's better than it was before.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.960
She can hang is what I'm saying.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.240
I had to, I had to berate, I had to berate her

44:10.240 --> 44:14.080
like only a super racist homophobic 13 year old can

44:14.080 --> 44:15.120
to just sort of prepare her

44:15.120 --> 44:16.720
because it's partially a mental game.

44:17.520 --> 44:18.880
It's partially about KD spread,

44:18.880 --> 44:20.320
but it's partially just about not giving up

44:20.320 --> 44:21.120
and believing in yourself.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.040
And it's hard to do that when you're being berated.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.000
And those are, you know what?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.200
It might seem like a waste of time,

44:25.200 --> 44:27.200
but those are life lessons you can impart anywhere.

44:27.200 --> 44:27.760
Right.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.880
Anytime you're getting yelled at

44:28.880 --> 44:30.160
by homophobic 13 year olds.

44:30.160 --> 44:30.320
Right.

44:31.840 --> 44:32.960
Like the bank.

44:32.960 --> 44:35.520
We need to stop employing homophobic 13 year olds

44:35.520 --> 44:36.640
at the bank, by the way.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.080
It's killing our economy.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.360
You want some hundreds, Fruit Loops?

44:41.600 --> 44:43.680
No problem, pussy.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.440
Let me just, oh, sorry.

44:47.440 --> 44:47.920
Just real quick.

44:47.920 --> 44:50.240
I need you to put your account number on the deposit slip

44:50.240 --> 44:51.040
and I fucked your mom.

44:52.560 --> 44:52.880
Oops.

44:52.880 --> 44:53.280
Oops.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.520
What? Well, you call that a deposit slip?

44:58.320 --> 44:58.720
Noob.

44:58.720 --> 44:58.960
Noob.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.800
You don't know your account number?

45:03.520 --> 45:04.000
Lamer.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.440
That actually is pretty close to how it is.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.120
Yeah, it's actually me at my bank.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.720
It's not that far from reality.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.680
I have been going to the same bank

45:13.680 --> 45:18.160
for a decade and a half now.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.600
And I've never made a deposit

45:19.600 --> 45:21.760
where I haven't just written my social security number

45:21.760 --> 45:23.200
on there and asked them to look it up,

45:23.200 --> 45:24.800
because I do not know my account number

45:24.800 --> 45:28.240
and it has not changed for three presidential administrations.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.800
Every other time I go to deposit a check,

45:30.800 --> 45:31.920
I forget to endorse it.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.320
And then they fucking come out of the little booth

45:34.320 --> 45:36.480
and they yell L2P in my face and they hump me.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.600
Some banks you have to pay extra for that,

45:43.600 --> 45:44.640
but not a BB&T.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.760
Not a BB&T, because it stands for balls, butts,

45:47.760 --> 45:49.920
and taints all over it.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.680
All over you.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.360
That was the original name of the bank.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.080
They shortened it.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.800
It was too long to fit on the check.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.680
My lady and I are going to get a dog soon.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.960
While looking for the right hound,

46:00.960 --> 46:03.040
we've discussed several different dog names.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.360
If we get a female dog, she wants to name it Beyonce.

46:06.080 --> 46:06.800
Being a white couple, I feel that might-

46:06.800 --> 46:08.560
Can you give me that one more time?

46:08.560 --> 46:09.600
I'm sorry, one more time?

46:10.640 --> 46:12.160
She wants to name it Beyonce.

46:12.720 --> 46:13.280
Okay.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.120
I feel like that might come off as racist,

46:15.120 --> 46:21.120
even though my dog is a big Beyonce.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.680
Even though my girlfriend is a big Beyonce.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.480
My dog is like-

46:24.480 --> 46:26.080
You haven't even adopted a dog yet,

46:26.080 --> 46:26.560
and you just said,

46:26.560 --> 46:29.520
we can't adopt a dog that doesn't like halo, halo.

46:31.280 --> 46:32.480
We gotta check its cred.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.120
I think it might send the wrong message.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.440
Is this a valid concern?

46:37.440 --> 46:40.000
What's the rule for naming animals after celebrities?

46:42.640 --> 46:43.280
Okay.

46:43.280 --> 46:46.480
What is the rule for naming animals after celebrities?

46:46.480 --> 46:47.680
Additional details.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.520
The dog we're most likely to get soon

46:49.520 --> 46:50.480
is a female black lab.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.440
Changes everything.

46:52.320 --> 46:52.720
Yep.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.520
That I was with you until then.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.920
That's from Dogana in Minneapolis.

46:57.920 --> 47:03.280
Oh, I think that to answer the easiest question first,

47:03.280 --> 47:05.760
the rule about naming dogs after celebrities

47:05.760 --> 47:08.560
is it's okay as long as it's not like dumb.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.520
It's tough, but like I would never name a dog.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.720
No, I was gonna say French Stewart, but I would.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.280
I wouldn't do that.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.240
I wouldn't name a dog French Stewart.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.040
Yeah, but that's-

47:17.040 --> 47:18.960
I would name a dog Robin Williams.

47:18.960 --> 47:21.120
You would name the dog French Stewart

47:21.120 --> 47:22.800
in Beverly Hills Chihuahua too,

47:22.800 --> 47:24.000
and it would be ironic

47:24.000 --> 47:26.160
because there's no way that dog's a Chihuahua.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.760
I'm trying to think if there's any celebrities

47:27.760 --> 47:29.280
I wouldn't name a dog after.

47:30.400 --> 47:31.200
Wolf Blitzer.

47:31.200 --> 47:31.840
No, I would.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.880
Damn, it's right there.

47:32.880 --> 47:33.840
Wolf Blitzer?

47:33.840 --> 47:34.080
Absolutely.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.880
I don't think, I think,

47:37.680 --> 47:38.800
I think, here's the problem.

47:38.800 --> 47:41.440
The fact that we're all sitting here thinking about it

47:41.440 --> 47:44.240
makes me think that if you invited some friend over,

47:44.240 --> 47:46.240
if you invited five friends over to your house

47:46.240 --> 47:49.600
and you said this is our new black dog named Beyonce,

47:49.600 --> 47:51.920
maybe four, four out of five of them would be like,

47:51.920 --> 47:52.720
oh, that's racist.

47:53.600 --> 47:56.400
I think 20% of your friends would think it's not racist,

47:56.400 --> 47:59.120
or at least they would think, you think about it, you know?

47:59.840 --> 48:00.960
You think it's there.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.920
Like we live in a post-

48:01.920 --> 48:03.840
So four would think it was and one would abstain.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.080
We live in a, we live in a post-racial society

48:06.080 --> 48:08.080
the Supreme Court recently decided.

48:08.080 --> 48:11.280
So like I do guess it's not that big a deal,

48:11.280 --> 48:13.840
but there would be the specter of the thought

48:13.840 --> 48:14.880
looming over that dog

48:14.880 --> 48:18.320
that would overshadow all of its dog accomplishments.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.640
The problem you have is that

48:20.640 --> 48:25.360
you no longer have plausible deniability.

48:25.360 --> 48:29.520
You're thinking about now the possibility of it

48:29.520 --> 48:31.840
being misconstrued as kind of racist.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.360
And even if you yourself are not a racist,

48:35.360 --> 48:37.120
I don't know if you are, you didn't clarify.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.400
You've already thought it.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.520
So now you can't do it.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.920
But what if they had gotten like a golden lab

48:44.640 --> 48:46.960
and named it like Craig T. Nelson?

48:50.720 --> 48:52.720
Which is the Beyonce of white people.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.480
He's so multi-talented.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.600
He is.

49:03.600 --> 49:04.800
He acts, he sings, he dances.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.800
He looks almost dead all the time.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.880
He coaches, he does everything.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.440
I think the fact that you're thinking about it

49:13.440 --> 49:16.480
means probably here there'd be dragons.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.080
Could you name the dog Sasha Fierce?

49:20.080 --> 49:21.040
That's fucking great.

49:21.040 --> 49:24.400
That's a good name for a dog, I guess.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.680
Do you guys want Yahoo?

49:26.720 --> 49:28.080
Yeah, sure.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.640
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Max Jinnikov.

49:30.640 --> 49:31.280
Thanks, Max.

49:31.280 --> 49:36.320
It's by Yahoo Answers user AndyRuss13333

49:36.320 --> 49:39.840
who asks, what is a creative name

49:39.840 --> 49:42.640
for a large barbecue sandwich with the works and then some?

49:43.680 --> 49:45.840
I have a new idea for a huge barbecue sandwich

49:45.840 --> 49:46.640
at my restaurant.

49:46.640 --> 49:50.560
It will consist of a 1 quarter pound of barbecue,

49:50.560 --> 49:53.360
a couple strips of rib meat covered with salt,

49:53.360 --> 49:55.680
pickles, cheese, and baked beans.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.560
It is a very big sandwich and very sloppy as well.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.760
Feel free to be creative and thanks for your help in advance.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.800
Here I was going to not be creative

50:04.800 --> 50:06.400
and just say barbecue sandwich,

50:06.400 --> 50:09.680
but now that you fucking let me loose.

50:11.520 --> 50:14.400
Unleash the hounds as it were of creativity.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.760
Call it a fat Sammy.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.160
Fat Sammy is not great.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.560
What about a bean boy?

50:21.840 --> 50:22.960
A sloppy bean boy.

50:22.960 --> 50:23.840
A sloppy bean boy.

50:23.840 --> 50:24.720
How about you call it-

50:24.720 --> 50:26.400
A big fat sloppy bean boy.

50:28.400 --> 50:32.160
How about you call it the menu item nobody will ever order

50:32.160 --> 50:35.040
because nobody wants to eat beans on a sandwich.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.560
So somebody does.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.000
Now you're going to get people writing in

50:38.000 --> 50:39.920
and talking about how much they love beans on sandwiches.

50:41.200 --> 50:42.720
Call it the bathroom fast track.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.360
The whole day.

50:45.360 --> 50:47.520
Because if you eat a sandwich like that,

50:47.520 --> 50:48.480
that is your whole day.

50:51.680 --> 50:53.360
Hour later regret sandwich.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.680
What about sorry so sloppy?

51:01.600 --> 51:02.000
Griffin?

51:02.000 --> 51:02.720
Yeah.

51:02.720 --> 51:03.520
Grant my wish.

51:03.520 --> 51:03.840
Yeah.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.680
Tell me the people on Yahoo Answers

51:05.680 --> 51:07.120
have responded to this question as well.

51:07.120 --> 51:07.360
Sure.

51:07.920 --> 51:08.480
Sure, of course.

51:11.200 --> 51:11.920
I'm ready.

51:11.920 --> 51:12.560
The feast.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.320
I would call it this because it sound like

51:16.320 --> 51:18.480
getting your whole meal in just one sandwich.

51:18.480 --> 51:19.280
That's good.

51:19.280 --> 51:19.840
Makes sense.

51:19.840 --> 51:20.400
It's good.

51:20.400 --> 51:20.720
Thanks.

51:20.720 --> 51:21.120
The chain-

51:21.120 --> 51:22.240
I was wondering-

51:22.240 --> 51:24.080
That is the dream in case anyone was wondering.

51:24.080 --> 51:24.960
The chainsaw.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.320
Just sounds like a manly hefty filling sandwich.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.000
Or a chainsaw.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.360
Listen to how much over fucking reaching

51:35.360 --> 51:38.240
goes on in this next Yahoo Answer answer

51:38.240 --> 51:39.440
from Michelangelo.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.720
The overload sandwich series.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.920
The overload sandwich series.

51:47.920 --> 51:50.160
You can make a couple sandwiches like this one

51:50.160 --> 51:52.640
and have a promotional limited time only kind of thing

51:52.640 --> 51:53.840
there at your restaurant.

51:53.840 --> 51:55.920
Can be a great marketing plan also.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.960
Hey, dude.

51:56.960 --> 51:57.440
Hey, dude.

51:57.440 --> 51:59.200
This guy didn't just hire you as their fucking

51:59.200 --> 52:00.400
social media manager.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.280
He asked for your help for one sandwich on Yahoo Answers.

52:03.840 --> 52:04.880
Now you've committed it.

52:04.880 --> 52:08.560
How is he going to top the Bean Boy besides-

52:08.560 --> 52:09.920
The Big Fat Sloppy Bean Boy.

52:10.880 --> 52:14.800
Hey, have you considered making an entire Bean Boy franchise?

52:14.800 --> 52:15.760
Just a thought.

52:15.760 --> 52:16.800
Thanks, Yahoo.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.400
Hey, have you considered expanding beyond the Mississippi?

52:20.400 --> 52:22.320
Like, just name my sandwich.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.520
Have you thought about getting into the steel industry?

52:25.520 --> 52:27.920
Just a thought.

52:27.920 --> 52:28.560
Just a thought.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.120
Plastics.

52:30.560 --> 52:30.960
I don't know.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.000
That's all I can think of right now.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.200
Michelangelo, you thought of a lot.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.560
You have nothing to apologize for.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.120
You've created a whole expansion plan.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.760
Yahoo Answers user Joker says your mama

52:41.760 --> 52:43.040
and then there's five asterisks.

52:43.760 --> 52:44.880
So I guess bitch.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.440
This is the your mama bitch.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.960
It's delicious.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.040
Why would anyone order that sandwich?

52:53.040 --> 52:54.480
No one would ever say that.

52:54.480 --> 52:54.880
I'm just gonna-

52:54.880 --> 52:55.920
I want your mama bitch.

52:56.560 --> 52:56.960
Okay.

52:56.960 --> 52:59.040
I'm gonna go down the line just like quick fire.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.240
Barbecue on a bun.

53:00.240 --> 53:00.480
Sure.

53:01.440 --> 53:02.080
The Summit.

53:05.360 --> 53:07.040
Listen, we got to work this out.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.280
Let's have a summit together.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.520
The G8.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.240
The Belushi.

53:14.000 --> 53:14.880
The Scale Tipper.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.160
It's a sin, but I love it sandwich.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.200
That one.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.280
Feed me mama sandwich.

53:25.280 --> 53:25.760
Oh no.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.600
I don't need no side order sandwich.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.960
Oh God, cause they're all on your bun.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.160
Make it more of a sentence.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.880
Hey sir, I do not need any side orders.

53:36.880 --> 53:37.920
Thank you for asking though,

53:37.920 --> 53:40.080
but could I see a dessert menu sandwich?

53:40.080 --> 53:43.360
Big Mo or Big Jack or your name?

53:43.360 --> 53:43.840
What if this-

53:45.120 --> 53:45.840
Big Percy.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.800
That sounds like an Appalachian context.

53:50.800 --> 53:53.440
He's gonna eat yourself a Big Percy.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.160
Those are the highlights.

53:58.160 --> 54:00.960
I think you got a lot to go on in there.

54:02.080 --> 54:02.400
Yeah.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.640
Depending on if you want to name your restaurant

54:04.640 --> 54:06.240
or close it in a week.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.640
Is there bread in this sandwich?

54:08.640 --> 54:09.520
He didn't list it.

54:10.560 --> 54:11.920
It's just a pile of-

54:11.920 --> 54:14.800
It's like a KFC Originals bowl.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.680
It's just a fucking sloppy.

54:18.880 --> 54:19.200
All right.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.120
We got to stop recording cause now I'm starving.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.120
Yeah, I got to go down to Big Percy's

54:23.120 --> 54:24.160
and get a sloppy Papa.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.800
That doesn't sound healthy.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.800
How about the name of it's the messy secret.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.000
I know a thing or two about that.

54:37.280 --> 54:39.440
We call this sandwich the sloppy Snowden.

54:41.840 --> 54:42.800
Thank you so much.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.800
That's also a new way that you can do kissing

54:44.800 --> 54:46.320
is if you buy a sloppy Snowden

54:46.320 --> 54:47.600
and then you put it in between your mouse

54:47.600 --> 54:48.480
and kiss through it.

54:48.480 --> 54:50.240
That's the only way to keep the devil out.

54:51.120 --> 54:54.000
I want to thank people tweeting about our program.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.200
My brother, my brother and me using the MBMBAM hashtag.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.640
Lydia Lenore is a new listener.

54:58.640 --> 54:59.600
She just got on board.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.360
Hello to Steph Kingston, Andrew Tennyson,

55:04.240 --> 55:06.160
our buddy Alan Black, Tyler Matheson,

55:06.160 --> 55:09.680
Chrissy Matthew Bird, Brian Dorfman,

55:10.320 --> 55:14.080
Ellen Bailey, Nick Fracker, Mason Church,

55:14.080 --> 55:14.880
Abigail McCauley.

55:14.880 --> 55:17.600
Thank you so much to everyone tweeting about the show.

55:17.600 --> 55:19.280
When you tweet about MBMBAM,

55:19.280 --> 55:21.040
why not throw in a link to our sampler?

55:21.040 --> 55:24.720
It's bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM 2013.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.840
Hey, speaking of tweeting,

55:28.400 --> 55:30.960
I got dropped on the Twitter this week

55:30.960 --> 55:33.040
on July 4th to be exact,

55:33.040 --> 55:35.280
the MBMBAM mixtape volume.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.080
Oh shit.

55:36.080 --> 55:37.040
It's available now.

55:37.920 --> 55:42.320
It's available from True Tempo, T-R-U-T-E-M-P-O

55:43.760 --> 55:47.120
and done by Worship the Sky, formerly Rocky Horror.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.480
Check it out, it is so good.

55:49.920 --> 55:50.560
If you want to find it,

55:50.560 --> 55:53.040
go to twitter.com forward slash Worship the Sky

55:53.040 --> 55:54.800
or worshipthesky.com

55:54.800 --> 55:58.720
and you'll be able to find the link there.

55:58.720 --> 55:59.440
It's very-

55:59.440 --> 56:02.080
You can also go to truetempo.com and it's available there.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.040
It is very fresh.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.440
There's a whole twerking segment in it

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
that I was listening to it in the shower

56:08.000 --> 56:09.520
and I just couldn't control.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.560
I was shaving my face

56:10.560 --> 56:13.680
and I had to start twerking while I was shaving

56:13.680 --> 56:14.960
and I got cut pretty badly.

56:14.960 --> 56:17.360
I look like Seal now.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.200
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

56:19.200 --> 56:21.120
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

56:21.120 --> 56:23.280
which is on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.320
It's an oldie, but a goodie.

56:26.960 --> 56:27.520
That's what I would-

56:27.520 --> 56:30.320
If I was like a radio DJ and I was putting this song on,

56:30.320 --> 56:33.120
I'd be like, here comes an oldie, but a goodie.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.640
And then I would put the song on and play it

56:34.640 --> 56:36.480
and I would get calls from people saying that is,

56:36.480 --> 56:37.840
it is both old and good.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.960
Is there anything else we need to say, Travis?

56:38.960 --> 56:39.440
I don't think-

56:39.440 --> 56:41.280
Did we mention the coupon code sexabonga

56:41.280 --> 56:42.160
for Extreme Restraints?

56:42.160 --> 56:42.240
Yeah, we did.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.920
It saves you 20% sexabonga.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.720
Sexabonga, sexabonga, sexabonga.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.760
And if you would like a spot on the Jumbotron,

56:49.760 --> 56:52.880
if you would like, let's say a personal spot

56:52.880 --> 56:55.040
to wish someone happy birthday or to apologize

56:55.040 --> 56:56.720
for something you did to them in the past

56:57.360 --> 57:00.560
or something you're going to do to them in the future

57:00.560 --> 57:04.560
or if it is, I don't know, a business opportunity,

57:04.560 --> 57:06.720
some kind of investment you would like people to make,

57:06.720 --> 57:10.240
just go to maximumfund.org forward slash Jumbotron

57:10.240 --> 57:12.960
and that's all you need to do.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.640
And just go through there and they'll set you right up

57:14.640 --> 57:16.480
and then you too can be on the show.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.600
We should also probably mention,

57:17.600 --> 57:18.960
next week's going to be a bye week.

57:20.080 --> 57:21.680
We try to avoid missing shows,

57:22.240 --> 57:24.880
but I'm going to be out of town for like eight days

57:24.880 --> 57:27.120
and Travis is going to be, it's tech week for Travis,

57:27.120 --> 57:28.800
which if you're in the theater community,

57:28.800 --> 57:31.920
you know that is a lot of work, I guess.

57:33.200 --> 57:34.560
And if you're not in the theater community,

57:34.560 --> 57:35.520
I'll be fighting robots.

57:35.520 --> 57:39.200
Yeah, every time, before a show opens,

57:39.200 --> 57:42.320
robots come and try to destroy it

57:42.320 --> 57:43.760
because robots hate live theater.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.920
Because if there's one thing robots hate, it's live theater.

57:45.920 --> 57:48.480
Right, so every, there's one night

57:48.480 --> 57:50.560
where everybody has to stand, hold vigil,

57:51.440 --> 57:53.440
and fight off the robot onslaught.

57:53.440 --> 57:55.440
People die, there's a lot of deaths.

57:55.440 --> 57:56.000
But it's worth it.

57:56.000 --> 57:56.880
But it is worth it.

57:56.880 --> 57:59.360
And also, on a much different note,

58:00.640 --> 58:02.800
there's some Max Funds who's putting together

58:02.800 --> 58:06.160
a Max Fund meetup in Philadelphia

58:06.160 --> 58:09.920
on July 20th, Saturday, July 20th,

58:09.920 --> 58:11.200
and they say around 4 p.m.

58:12.400 --> 58:15.920
It's going to be at Cafe Fulya, F-U-L-Y-A.

58:17.440 --> 58:21.200
We'll bully them into posting something on the forums

58:21.200 --> 58:22.880
and putting all the information there.

58:22.880 --> 58:25.120
But I want to make sure any of our Philadelphia

58:25.120 --> 58:27.040
and Philadelphia area listeners

58:27.040 --> 58:29.360
or any Max Fund listeners who want to hang out,

58:29.360 --> 58:31.680
just go hang out with some cool kids.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.000
One more thing, go listen to all the other Max Fund shows.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.960
There's a cornucopia of free comedy broadcasting

58:38.960 --> 58:40.160
all on MaxFundFund.org.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.120
You got Jordan, Jesse, Goat,

58:41.120 --> 58:43.120
Judgment on Honchman, Throwing Shades,

58:43.120 --> 58:45.680
Stop Podcasting Yourself, Risk,

58:46.800 --> 58:49.120
Wham Bam Pow, One Bad Mother.

58:49.120 --> 58:50.960
There's Bullseye.

58:50.960 --> 58:51.840
There's tons of shit.

58:51.840 --> 58:52.560
That's it.

58:52.560 --> 58:54.240
Nothing that, no others you can think of?

58:55.440 --> 58:56.400
No.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.280
I think that's it.

58:57.280 --> 58:58.240
Cause like it only counts.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.240
Oh, there's one called Bonesaw.

59:00.240 --> 59:00.740
Yeah.

59:00.740 --> 59:03.220
Come on, Bonesaw is ready.

59:07.060 --> 59:08.100
It's called Sawbones.

59:08.100 --> 59:09.380
It has me and my wife in it.

59:09.380 --> 59:10.340
It's about medical history.

59:10.340 --> 59:10.740
It's funny.

59:10.740 --> 59:11.460
You should listen to it.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.620
It hasn't been around that long yet.

59:13.620 --> 59:15.300
So they're like, you may want to give it a little bit of time

59:15.300 --> 59:16.660
for them to like find their groove.

59:18.020 --> 59:20.500
Or just like shelter it safely to your bosom.

59:20.500 --> 59:21.060
Keep it safe.

59:21.060 --> 59:21.620
Keep it secret.

59:21.620 --> 59:22.260
Like a bait.

59:22.260 --> 59:23.940
Don't tell any of your friends.

59:23.940 --> 59:24.980
Like a baby bird.

59:24.980 --> 59:26.980
Like this is your chance to get it on something

59:26.980 --> 59:27.700
on the ground floor

59:27.700 --> 59:28.900
and then keep it on the ground floor.

59:28.900 --> 59:29.540
So it's indie.

59:29.540 --> 59:30.040
Mm-hmm.

59:31.940 --> 59:32.500
Thank you.

59:32.500 --> 59:34.820
I was into Sawbones before anyone else was.

59:34.820 --> 59:36.180
Sorry, say it one more time.

59:36.180 --> 59:37.460
I was into Sawbones before anyone else was.

59:37.460 --> 59:38.900
You fucked it up the first time, Jeff.

59:38.900 --> 59:40.820
Jeff was making a joke because you fucked it up.

59:40.820 --> 59:43.300
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast, Griffin.

59:43.300 --> 59:44.420
You have a final question for us.

59:44.420 --> 59:46.660
This final Yahoo was sent in by Nicholas Guren.

59:46.660 --> 59:47.220
Thank you, Nick.

59:47.220 --> 59:50.740
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sebastian, who asks,

59:52.180 --> 59:55.620
what parts of the body can be shown in a medium core porno movie?

59:55.620 --> 59:56.820
I'm Justin McElroy.

59:56.820 --> 59:57.700
I'm Travis McElroy.

59:57.700 --> 59:58.820
I'm Griffin McElroy.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.500
These are my brother, my brother, and me.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.460
Kiss your dad.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.260
Square on the lips.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:29.140
You think, like, one nut?
