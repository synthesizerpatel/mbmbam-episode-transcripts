00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Here come the McElroys. We've got jokes and bits. We're gonna give advice and do funny

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
sips. Laughter, it is in store. Come inside and see. It's time to start. It's my brother,

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
my brother and me.

00:26.000 --> 00:37.000
Yahoo answer once responded, flowers are plant genitalia. Secret exposed. Secret revealed.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Farmers probably know some shit though. They probably know some fucking Earth wisdom. Well,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
not these days. These days farmers just flip the switch on the machine that yanks the milk

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
out of the cow's tits. Do you think that farmers still know how high the sycamore grows? I

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
don't think, no. Why does the grinning bobcat grin? They don't care about why the bag of

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
the bobcat grins. They just want to shower him in chemicals. You know, can you paint

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
with all the colors of the mountain? Listen, Douglas, I think your farm is great. I do

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
think that if you did not have that giant sycamore in the middle of it, just to see

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
how tall it'll grow. What if I cut it down? I'll never know. You won't live to see it.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
No one will. My children's children will. Their children's children are going to turn

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
it into magazines. Man, that bobcat sure seems to like it though. That bobcat seems pleased

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
his punch. How did he do that? I don't know. He's just that way. That's just how he is.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Call him Henry. Everything is shale colored. Yeah, dog, it's mountain colors, idiot. Paint

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
it with the colors of the mountain. That's what I do. Apparently, sunflowers fucking

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
rotate to follow the sun across the sky. Yeah. It's called heliotropism. Didn't know this.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I just learned about heliotropism from Yahoo Answers. Is it real? I don't want you to learn

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
from Yahoo Answers ever. Griffin, you just yearn. This is the singularity. Everybody

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
else. I don't want to learn anything from Yahoo Answers either, but if it happens, then

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm willing to accept it because I love knowledge and I love drinking it up, and apparently

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
heliotropism is the thing. Apparently, Wikipedia is telling me all about waggle dances now.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm going down a fucking rabbit hole right now. Griffin to knowledge is like a sunflower

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
to the sun. Griffin just tilts his genitalia. I tilt my plant genitalia towards it. One

02:30.000 --> 02:42.000
of the Yahoo Answers responded, carrots. Indeed revealed. I bet you guys cows know some shit,

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
but mostly farmers know some shit about Earth and the way things work that they're not telling

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
us. About good dirt and bad dirt. I bet that's something they know a lot about. You know

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
what's funny is they know a lot about farming, but they've never seen a tall building or

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
a car. Yeah, right. They would be horrified. It would be very scary, but I bet they know

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
all about what happened in Benghazi. I bet they know the truth about Benghazi. If you

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
want to fucking suss that out, put a farmer on the stand. There's two things farmers know

03:15.000 --> 03:23.000
about, like agricultural shit and foreign affairs. Benghazi specifically. I've been

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
trying to get into gardening. Sydney and I have been trying to plan some stuff. Speaking

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
of secrets that farmers know, one of those secrets that I don't know that I'm betting

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
farmers do is basically not knowing what plants will emerge from the ground and which I will

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
have to retrieve from there. I literally had to ask Sydney about basically every plant.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Like, will the pepper be in the ground or will it be above the ground? And I bet that's

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
a secret that farmers have on a lot, pretty much. Yeah, I bet that that's pretty important

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
to just their general survival and their fiscal stability is just knowing sort of like where

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
the carrots are at any given time. I can never remember. Ah, shit, I did it wrong again.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
I dug up the plant. Is it a carrot tree? Fuck. I can't remember. I did it bad. I am the

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
worst farmer. I don't know any of the secrets of Mother Earth's beautiful womb that I grow

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
my carrot children inside. I should never cut down that sickle. One of my neighbor farmers

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
told me that if you feed a cow rocks, then he'll poop out whole watermelons that you

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
can sell at the country fair, but they just killed them. They died. They're tricky farmers.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
That's the secret about farm wisdom is they're either telling you something that will enrich

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
your life, like heliotropism and bee dances, or they'll give you a little riddle. They'll

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
play a trick on you. They're like bridge trolls. They're actually descended from bridge

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
trolls. They are. All farmers are descended from bridge trolls. They only speak in riddles.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
There's another secret for you. You know that poem, God Made a Farmer? It's not true. God

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
made a bridge troll, and then they just sort of naturally fell into another vacation. They

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
defied his teachings and they left the bridges. And so they were cast out of Eden. That's

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
Genesis 1-1, baby. Read a book. Read a book. For once. Specifically the Bible. Specifically

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
our new version of the Bible. The Bradley's Grimm presents the Bible.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Is it appropriate to leave a small party? Six people. When someone puts on Gangnam Style

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
and asks everyone to start dancing. That's from Unsure in Oklahoma. Oh, this is the shittiest

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
oops, you're in the shittiest party. I would actually argue that six people does not constitute

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
a small party. Well, it's not a party until Gangnam Style comes on and then uh oh, it

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
is it is a small party in the Dungeons and Dragons sense, but not but not in the typical

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
social sense. Here's here's okay. The verbiage in this question that really throws me off

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
is that if you had asked, is it appropriate to leave a small party when someone puts on

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
Gangnam Style and everyone starts dancing? Yeah, if you leave that, if you leave that,

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
then you're a stick in the mud. But if you when someone puts on Gangnam Style and asks

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
at attention, please attention, please all rise to our feet. I'm going to teach everyone

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
the dance. I learned it from YouTube. Move your legs from side to side as if you were

06:30.000 --> 06:43.000
straddling an invisible pony. Dance you beautiful bastards. This we are golden gods there. The

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
fun thing about this question is that this person has already lived this scenario and

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
one of two things happened. Either they they feel bad because someone said everyone start

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
dancing to Gangnam Style and they said I'm leaving and then they walked out the door

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
and never look back or they did do it and they dance and they're wondering was there

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
another way? Now, I think it was the former and I think the next day the host of the party

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
this this psychopath who dictates when the dancing occurs. She came up to them is like,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
hey, what the fuck man? Like we were having a great time last night. That was inappropriate

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Dave. You left and then there were only five people and that definitely doesn't count as

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
a party anymore. You ruined my birthday. What if the host of the party was Psy? Oh, that

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
is egomaniacal. He put on his own song and said, please. It's all I have. I don't think

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
there is an organism on Earth that is more sick of that song than than Dr. Psy. I have

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
to assume nobody likes his ballads. You know what I mean? Nobody likes his likes his tender

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
lovemaking stuff. Everybody will try to get into gentlemen, but they're not feeling it.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
People. Yeah, people. People listen to gentlemen out of fucking courtesy. You know what I mean?

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
But the hook, the hook, we owe him this one. Yeah, he's given us so much and we in turn

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
have also given him quite a bit, but the hook on that one does not bring me back. It's sort

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
of like, it's sort of like how people continue to listen to if it makes you happy by Sheryl

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Crow because they, they really appreciated all I want to do so much and it was like they,

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
they did all they could do for all I want to do. They bought the single, they bought

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
the album, and then when that next album came out with it makes you happy, they thought,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
well, you know what? I still owe her. I am still in debt to her for all the fun that

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
that first song brought me. Right. Yeah, it's exactly like that. There's so many similarities

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
between science, Sheryl Crow that I feel like a lot of people just like goes right over

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
the head. Have you ever seen them in the same room together? I have not. No, I have not.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
Could it be a Phoenix rebirth? You think Sheryl Crow fucking die? No, I'm saying that Sheryl

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Crow met with like her advisors and she said, I need a new persona and they said, she went

08:52.000 --> 09:01.000
to Phoenix online university, took some classes in Korean. She took a minor in hammer dancing.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
Did you guys see that mashup? Oh, that went down good. When the two of them performed

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
that together, take a chance. How can I get my dad to be cool? He's a really shy, nerdy

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
guy. He's like 50 so can he really change? My mom walks all over him and it makes me

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
see that my father is not a real man. Yes, he's a responsible man and a kind man, but

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
not a real man. I want to teach him how to be cool and not so uptight. He needs to start

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
hitting the gym, going out to socialize and maybe pick up a fun hobby like pool hustling

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
or joining a motorcycle gang. Oh my God, 50, any too late to just fucking switch it and

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
change it. We're talking about a dad's all that, right? I can't take those glasses off.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
Oh shit. Your stigmatism. I forgot. Hey dad, get off that riding lawn mower. Can't buy

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
me dad. Come on. Let me clean you right up. Oh my goodness. Hey, dad of the year. Was

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
that the Rick Moranis movie? What was the Rick Moranis movie? That was Honey, I Shrunk

10:03.000 --> 10:13.000
the Kid. Honey, I Shrunk My Swag. Honey, I Blew Up My Swag. How can you get your 50 year

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
old? Well, first of all, you're going to have to have a Frank conversation with him. With

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
your dad, Frank. If your dad's name is Frank, it helps to say like, listen, you have raised

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
me. You're kind and you're responsible. I know my mom's walks all over you, but I respect

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
what you've done for me and my family, but fuck you are lame. Manzos. Man, I look at

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
you and it's just, you're just a pitiful husk of negative manliness. The stork has not been

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
kind enough to bless me with a baby from the cabbage patch, but I am 32. Right. So I would,

10:50.000 --> 10:59.000
I can address something for you. Your dad is a hundred percent aware at every waking

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
moment, how uncool he has become. This is not a, a wake up one day and you have those

11:07.000 --> 11:17.000
socks with, you have Argyle socks on. This is a slow descent from relevance that started

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
like in his late twenties and just kind of got worse. I would bet statistically though

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
at some point he was probably cool. That's the thing. He might be still, he might be

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
in full blown dad denial. He might be in dad Nile. Like he might be like the biggest Niles.

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
There's not a river in Egypt. I know it's not, it's not, it's not bad at all. He, like

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
he might be like a big parrot head and that might be like a mainstay from his youth. And

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
he might just think like, I fucking get it. The world is, the world is moving in the wrong

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
direction and that direction is away from Jimmy Buffett's relevance. I am still on the

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
fucking cutting bleeding edge. Is this going to be a Buffett full episode? Maybe it's his

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
birthday. What? Like, do you know what I mean? Like there are those dads out there that are

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
like, oh yeah, man, I saw the Eagles three times last year and it fucking changed. Like

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
that's, that's not, that is literally only your definition of cool. Even the Eagles don't

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
think that that, that, that Steve, the Eagles know, the Eagles are like, here's the thing.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
We need to talk about your Eagles consumption. The Eagles said to the Eagles fan, the other

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
side of this coin is so much more embarrassing that if you had a dad who suddenly just rolled

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
up one day in full on like leather outfit and biker gear and like we ride in the motorcycle

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
and he was like, Hey kids, let's go check out the concert scene. Like does anybody here

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
like Drake? And then he fans out some Drake tickets. Yeah. You're not going to be more

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
proud of him. I would actually, that would be, that would be if my dad rode his motorcycle

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
from Ironton, Ohio to Austin, Texas, and then fanned out a fucking fistful of Drake tickets.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't even, I don't know a single Drake song, but I would say yes. And I would hop

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
on the back of that Harley and we would go have the best ride in the sunset. Oh, this

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
will be interesting if the call and response works out. Um, this one was sent in by Ira

13:19.000 --> 13:30.000
Ray. Are you Ira Ray? Wow. That's gratifying. Uh, it was by Yahoo answers user Sammy who

13:30.000 --> 13:52.000
asks, what are some simple mysteries that I can solve? Be serious. My dad said to start,

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
it's misspelled start, but it's hard to pronounce it, uh, small and build my way up to big

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
mysteries like spirits and houses, hauntings, et cetera. I need to know some simple cases.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
Please. And thank you. One of the more mannerly Yahoo answers we've got. Yeah. I like that

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
play. Don't start with encyclopedia Brown. Those were way hard for me still. I cracked

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
one up. I cracked one open recently. I'm 32 now. These should be, and I'm cut to 20 minutes

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
later. Well, okay. The first battle of bull run couldn't have been this because the sword

14:23.000 --> 14:30.000
said on that love those books didn't make me any better at mysteries though. I think

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
your parents have to plan the mysteries for you, right? Cause I don't know how old this

14:33.000 --> 14:40.000
person is. Um, I hope not too old. Um, you gotta, you gotta get an early start on the

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
mystery game. It's like being a gymnast, but it can't start young. What could start as

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
a small mystery could like unfurl to be like gang gangland violence, drug trade. Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Just like, just like, just like a national national treasure. He's trying to, he's trying

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
to find the constitution and then it turns into a whole thing. Starts out with him doing

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
a tricky Sudoku. And by the end of it, he's just wrapped up in a fucking John Voight,

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
shoot him up. That is the problem with, if you've, I mean, if you've ever read anything,

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
any mystery, it always starts with what appears to be a simple mystery. I don't think you

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
can definitively say this is going to pan out to be very simple because what if it's

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
like, it's like that sweater, you start pulling that yarn and then it's just, well, there's

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
our whole case here. Then you have the mystery of the unraveled sweater. Yeah. Your mom is

15:26.000 --> 15:34.000
super pissed off that her sweater is fucking gone. And she's like, mystery solved. That

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
was simple. Let me look at some clues. Let me just think back. Yeah, that was me. I did

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
that. It's a pretty good clue. My memory. When we were, uh, when we were little, little

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
kids, uh, I don't think when we were smaller, I don't think Griffin was born yet. And Travis

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
and I tell the story then cause like, oh, this is okay. This is BGM, uh, before Griffin

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
McElroy, uh, and Travis and I had discovered food coloring. So we, uh, filled every drink.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
We could get our hands on with food coloring. And then we decided to see what effect it

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
would have on the carpets. And, um, and then our mom came down and I just wanted to tell

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
this story cause that seems like a pretty easy mystery for her to solve. So if you could

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
set that up for him, just put some food coloring on your mouth and on the couch and then sit

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
there and wait. And I think that as his parents, you could, it would be pretty easy. And it

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
was also, that was also just like a really good bit for like the family circus fans in

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
the audience. Like people who don't like all the blue humor we usually do and just want

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
some like Dennis the menace-esque shenanigans. I don't think there's anything wrong with

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
being tasteful for a few minutes. I've been pushing to get us to be a little cleaner and

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I think that was a great start.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
I told the story on Twitter today about the, uh, jawbreaker in the theater. You guys know

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
that one. I don't think so. Where, uh, we were, uh, seeing a play with dad and he, our

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
dad used to be obsessed with these, um, they were birds egg jawbreakers, birds eggs. Sometimes

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
I call them psychedelic jawbreakers. Uh, they're, they're the white ones with the colorful

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
flecks on them that, that when you eat them enough, those flecks turn into like, they

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
become tactile. They became, they become like fucking birds. They become a topographical

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
map of, of, of the, it's the worst thing to have in your mouth. I don't know why he was

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
as obsessed with them as he was. They're, they're why our daddy has diabetes now, but

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
he loved them back in the day. He had a whole, you could get him a cracker barrel. It was

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
like his exclusive dealer. And I remember he had an empty shed spread country crock

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
container that he kept up, up, up out of our reach. Mac, you're back, huh? Uh, wait till

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
you see this new shit I got in. I've got the dopest prickliest kush. But anyway, so he

17:47.000 --> 17:56.000
was, he was enjoying some of his prickly kush and he, uh, he laughed and the jawbreaker pops

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
out of his mouth and rolls down two aisles. And without missing a beat, he says, Oh, my

18:01.000 --> 18:09.000
glass eye. And he covers the socket with his hand. And this one, two aisles down, picks

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
it up and hands it back to him. He pops it right in his mouth cause he's a dirty creep.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
Our dad's a dirty creep. Our dad's a creepy dirty fuck. Just kidding. He's the best dad

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
of all time. If you say anything like that about my dad, I'll, I'll take, I'll take your

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
skin. Take a chance. Farm wisdom. Get your fork. It's not us pork. Farm wisdom. I would

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
like Griffin to read the first one please. Um, here's the first one. I grew up on a race

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
horse farm. Oh, the most exciting life. I grew up on a race horse. Welcome to the show.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
Paul Bearer, the late Paul Bearer joined us. When a veterinarian castrates a race horse,

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
they throw the detached balls up on the roof of the barn for good luck. Pretty gross. Jesse.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
Thanks, Jesse. And I fact checked that. That's a hundred percent. That's a hundred percent.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
A hundred percent. Fuck you. There's no, it doesn't horse sperm sell for like hundo

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
thousand on. You castrate a race horse if it's having behavioral problems. And then

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
you, you have like, tell me though, promise me that if you are going to do this for behavioral

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
problems, you definitely, definitely bring the horse out of the yard. When you throw

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
its balls on the roof. Hey, come see this. What? How did this old wire you get for playing

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
in my yard? Hey orb, come watch this. See what's funny to eat my pocket. Orb. Come on.

19:40.000 --> 19:48.000
How, how did this fucking witchcraft kiss? I can't imagine there was just a super lazy

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
veterinary old timey. You never heard balls on the roof fast in the hoof. I'm imagining

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
like an 18th century veterinarian. Like what do I, ah fuck. What do I do with these? They're

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
slippery. Maybe in that, maybe in the heat of a passionate horse crime, they, they cut

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
off a ball, a horse's balls unwillingly and then had to dispose of the evidence. Chinkle

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
chinkle balls. What do you know? Oh fuck. You gotta, you gotta tie them on the back

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
of your truck so that they hang comically as though they're the trucks testicles. It's

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
very comical. Is that the implication? I believe so. I'm going to go back when I'm editing

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
the podcast and find the minute Mark where Travis said he was going to start adding whiskey

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
to his beverage and then time it out to now and then we'll know like the porousness of

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
his liver. What's the other farm with him? Uh, chickens play dead and fart through their

20:44.000 --> 21:08.000
mouths. It's the best Smith's album. I don't care what anybody says is the best. Hey

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
everybody. I hope you're enjoying this bros better bros best. Sorry. It's not a new episode

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
that Justin and Griffin both lost power for a long time. When I'm recording this, Justin

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
still doesn't have power in his house and is staying in a hotel. Everybody is safe.

21:23.000 --> 21:29.000
Everybody is warm. It's just been very chaotic for the last week. So I hope you'll bear

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
with us and understand and now enjoy the money zone. Online shopping can be daunting. It's

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
listen, I'm worried enough doing my grocery shopping online. I still do it because it's

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
cool and it's the good thing to do, but it's even scarier buying clothes because I don't

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
know what's going to fit on my body. I don't know what's going to look good on my body

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
and I barely even know what my own style is. That's why I love Stitch Fix. This season

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
let Stitch Fix do all the hard work for you. They are going to find clothing hand selected

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
you can try on pieces at home before you buy. You try them on, you keep your favorites,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
you send back the rest. Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns and exchanges and a

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
prepaid return envelope is included and there's no subscription required. I've been using

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Stitch Fix for a while now. So if you see me and you're like, huh, Travis's style game

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
has really stepped up. It's all thanks to Stitch Fix. I wish I could take credit for

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
it, but so much of that is Stitch Fix. And it's not just like, you know, shirts and pants.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
It's cool shoes. I've gotten cool jackets. There's lots of stuff in there. It's all amazing.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
to be super honest with me? Do you like your sheets? Do you love them? Or have you just

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
been sleeping on them so long and you don't think about them anymore? Because I'm willing

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
to bet that when you really stop to think about it, you maybe don't even love your sheets

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
as much as you could. And that's because you don't have Brooklinen. See, Brooklinen are

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
amazing sheets that I love. And so I know you'll love because Brooklinen was founded

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000

of sheets, colors, patterns, and materials to fit your needs and tastes. And Brooklinen

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
is so much more than sheets. They've got comforters, pillows, towels, even loungewear and more.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Listen, I love their sheets very much. That's absolutely true. But my life changed when

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
I got Brooklinen towels. It's all I use now. Highly recommend. Love them. The sheets are

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
Hey, kid. Your dad tell you about the time he broke Stephen Dorff's nose at the Kids

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
Choice Awards. In Dead Pilot Society, scripts that were developed by studios and networks

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
but were never produced are given the table reads they deserve. When I was a kid, I had

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
to spend my Christmas break filming a PSA about angel dust. So yeah, being a kid sucks

26:03.000 --> 26:10.000
sometimes. Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker. Dead Pilot Society, twice a month

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
on MaximumFun.org. You know, the show you like, that hobo with the scarf who lives in

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
a magic dumpster. Dr. Who.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I'm sorry if this is too weird. Do you smell a person while hugging? Be true.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
He adds, definitely yes. It gives you a kind of an idea of what kind of a person he or she is.

26:40.000 --> 26:48.000
Does it? I'm trying to think if I've ever like, intentionally... Yeah, because that's

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
the thing. Do you mean like, oh, I hug someone and, you know, like, I'm breathing. Yeah,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
that's the thing. Or do you mean like, I hug someone and go... It's like when you scope

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
it out, when you scope out a situation. You see it with your eyes. Like, the neurons are

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
already in your brain once you perceive the thing. The neurons are going to go where they

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
want to go. They're going to fire off the synapses that they want to fire off and then

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
all of a sudden you know if that person's attractive or not. When you hug someone, you

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
have smell particles going in your nose that are firing off those... Your eyes can be deceived,

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
Griffin. Right, that's true. But smell particles can't lie. I actually have... I think that

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
my usual MO is to... Like, I'll do a regular inhale, like, as I'm going in for the hug,

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
just breathing. Oh, man. But then if I like, sort of, I like... Oh, you'll go in for

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
secondsies. I'll go... You'll take a second... Hey, do you mind if I take a second scoop?

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
Just real quick. Let me just get a second scoop real quick. Is this one per customer

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
or can I have two? How much for an extra shot? I feel like if you get an extra whiff in,

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
though, you definitely do have to comment. Oh, man, definitely. You just have to say

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
like, okay, can I hug the other shoulder now and then go to the right? Yeah, like the French

28:00.000 --> 28:07.000
do it. The French do it. Double hugs. This is a serious, serious problem for men of my

28:07.000 --> 28:18.000
kind, cynacistic, who have my particular almost constant set of maladies relating to my nose

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
zone. Which is to say, it's some kind of... It's either hay fever season or mold season

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
or some kind of season constantly here in Austin, so I'm constantly sniffling. And if

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm hugging someone, I mean, every 10 seconds I have to sniff. And like, if they land in

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
that period, it is going to seem like I'm like, oh, hey, bring it in. Yeah, I haven't

28:38.000 --> 28:49.000
seen you in a while. I love it. What? No, it's just... Yeah, I'm sick. Well, then why

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
don't I just embrace it and be like, you smell great. Just say you smell great. Everybody

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
wants to hear that. You brighten somebody's day. They don't think it's weird. Or you've

28:56.000 --> 29:01.000
been working out. A compliment. It's a great compliment when not said right after sniffing

29:01.000 --> 29:07.000
someone. Because when somebody's fit, the scent that they produce is way, way, way better

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
when they've just... Oh, no, I'm in the day of working out immediately prior to the hug.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh, God. So they smell like Jim Funk. Also, have you guys met my friend Jim Funk? I want

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
to ask you guys... This is related, and it's something that's been on my mind for a few

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
days. I was watching something on TV. I don't know. But you see it all the time. And two

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
people were meeting... The TV show? Yeah, a television program. A few people were meeting,

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
and when they were greeting each other, the guy goes in and kisses the woman's cheek as

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
like a greeting, right? And you see this happen... Was it his wife or his mom? No. Okay. But

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
you see people doing it. I mean, it happens. People do it. I don't know... I mean, grownups

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
are always doing this, and I see it on television and sometimes in real life, and I don't know

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
how you would even begin to add that layer to your social repertoire. Yeah, because I

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
honestly... I've tried it. Like, I've done a couple of, you know, just preliminary tries

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
of the cheek kiss greeting. Just to kind of take it for a spin and see how it goes. I

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
got to hear about your dry runs. I don't want to weird you out, but do you want to

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
experiment with me? I want to try something out. Okay, so you know that awkward moment

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
when someone goes for a hug and you go for a handshake? Yeah. It's like that times like

30:31.000 --> 30:38.000
eight. Just eight? That seems so conservative. Griffin, I've done a lot of number crunching

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
on this. It's eight. The chances that someone's going to fucking headbutt you is pretty high.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
The person pulled back and was like, that was eight times weirder than when you go for

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
a hug and they go for a handshake. That was exactly 800% weirder. Griffin, I took fucking

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
statistics in college and I do, in fact, know what I'm talking about. I've got a survey

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
size of a thousand. Well, you told us it was two. What? No, I said a couple. That could

31:02.000 --> 31:09.000
be a thousand. How did you... What? Were you... Had you been drinking? Like, what? I don't

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
know what... Yeah, I can't even imagine making this decision. That's a horrible experiment.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
I did it in laboratory conditions. Did you do one dude, one lady? Just to see how it

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
felt like... I did 500 dudes and 500 dudes. And it was mostly for college credit because

31:25.000 --> 31:33.000
I can't afford to pay that many people. Sure. Your fucking mouth would have been busted

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
after a thousand smooches. I had a robot. Okay. I didn't do it myself. Right. Pretend

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
this robot is a loved one you haven't seen in a long time. Your acquaintances, but not

31:43.000 --> 31:48.000
lovers. Okay. Now the scene is set. How many times worse was that? Enter the smooching

31:48.000 --> 31:55.000
chamber. The background is set. Enter the smoochitorium. Well, you don't want to skew

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
the results, so I had to tell them they were there for a sleep study. Something is going

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
to happen in this room with this stranger robot that's going to make you uncomfortable.

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
Have fun. Science. Get your college credit on the way out. It's important that they don't

32:09.000 --> 32:15.000
know that the robot is part of the experiment, though. Or else it'll ruin the truth of the

32:15.000 --> 32:25.000
experiment. Farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Get your cow into a suit. Farm wisdom. Oh, what

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
if you put your cow in a person suit? Yeah, I'm a humie. I'm a skin. I'm a flesh-o. What

32:30.000 --> 32:39.000
would they be called? Humies? Humies, maybe, I guess. I'm a humie. Cows are proven to

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
have, oh no, you know what, Travis, you should read farm wisdom. That's your thing, I think.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
Cows are proven to have best friends. If they are separated from each other, they get stressed

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
and their milk yields suffer. That's from Victoria. I don't know why, but I find that

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
fucking, like, heartwarming. Oh, it's amazing. I actually watched, there's this documentary

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
on Netflix about, I think it's called Animal Odd Couples, and it's about, like, this dog

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
and this cheetah are best pals, and they interview zookeepers. They're like, yeah, I don't know

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
what fucking happened. This dog and cheetah just started hanging out together. But you

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
knew that they just put them in a cage, like, let's see what'll happen. You know, they went

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
through, like, 14 dogs and six cheetahs before they found the right mix. Griffin, I cannot

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
imagine how bad of a day you have to have before you decide that you deserve Animal

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
Odd Couples. We watched a very bleak marathon of Homeland, and I was like, we gotta fucking

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
boost these spirits. Let's watch a monkey on a dog. Travis, any other farm wisdom this

33:39.000 --> 33:47.000
week? Yeah, I want Griffin to read the second one. This one is sent in by Laura, thank you.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
She says, if you want to get rid of a groundhog, pee in its hole. It will move to a better

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
neighborhood. Oh, the property values around here have just plummeted ever since Jeff P.

33:57.000 --> 34:04.000
in our borough. I feel like a Bad Elements moved in ever since Jeff P. in here. Hey,

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
Jeff, what are you doing? Hey, neighbor. Howdy, neighbor. Hey, neighbor, I'm just gardening.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, I just put in my last mortgage payment today. We own the- oh, fuck. Oh, Jeff. Just

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
repainted the kid's room. We pretty much have- oh, damn it, Jeff. At least the smell's gonna

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
go- oh, you ate asparagus- oh, fucking Jeff. You know, honey, earlier today I was telling

34:28.000 --> 34:34.000
Jeff about our groundhog problem- oh, goddammit. Goddammit, Julia. I told you not to tell Jeff

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
about our groundhogs. Oh, he's outside already. Son of a bitch. Yeah, I kind of feel like

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
that's a catch-all way to get anything to move out of the neighborhood. Like, is there

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
an animal that, like, you pee in its burrow and it's like, nice. Nice. Sweet. Probably

34:50.000 --> 35:00.000
prairie dogs, fucking nasty ass rodents. Let's get some piss up in here. Yeah, now the party's

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
really getting started. We're all freaks. You know rattlesnakes are getting dirty. You

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
love it. You guys wanna Yahoo? Please. This Yahoo was sent in by Bobby Mitchell. Thank

35:14.000 --> 35:21.000
you, Bobby. That's why Yahoo answers user demonica, who asks, do these guys want to

35:21.000 --> 35:29.000
steal my horse? It's very complicated, but I'm going to try my best of what's happening.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
I got a healthy- sorry, I already fucked up. I got an healthy racehorse. He's four and

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
beautiful and calm as anything. He's a dream horse. So, anyway, there's a group of lads

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
that keep on pointing my horse out in the field or in the stable. They asked me if he

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
was mine today. I was on a hack out with him, and the guys keep their eyes on him. And when

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
they noticed I was watching them, they turned the other way. So when I came back to the

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
stables, they were outside my stable door and said, oh, he's beautiful, isn't he? But

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
there's something suspicious about their behavior, right? They also want some beating it. I also

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
noticed- gross- I also noticed when I'm riding in the arena, they watch him in the far distance

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
outside the gate. So any idea of why they seem more attached to my horse? Are they flirting?

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
Other people are also interested in him, but they don't do what they do, so I'm finding

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
their actions very suspicious. What should I do?

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
She means, are they flirting with her?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Ah, it's hard to tell.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Okay.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
By lads, she may actually mean four other horses. Like, horses are following her horse

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
around. I'm going to steal this horse. It'll be like, horse taken.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
You know, I think that any- I think she might be projecting a little bit. She just loves

36:42.000 --> 36:50.000
that horse so much that she assumes everyone else would want to get into this dream horse.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Get into it?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Like, get- you know, like get-

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
They just want to take a- you know, they want to get inside, like sit in the passenger seat.

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
Right, right, right. Get into its whole scenario. They think, hey, like you could, you know,

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
really get into it.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
Like that scene in Ace Ventura when nature calls and he's inside the rhino.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
God, if we could go one episode-

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
No, I don't mean like literally into. I mean like, like when you go to the car dealership,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
it's like, I can get you into a new sedan.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
What's it going to take to put you inside this horse?

37:21.000 --> 37:26.000
You know, I don't think a horse can have a sidecar, Justin, if that's what you're-

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
if that's what you're suggesting.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Does AC come standard on this horse?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Is this a standard or automatic horse? I see.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Can you even steal a horse? Like-

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
If you can, the worst thing you can do is sit there and go, that's a beautiful horse.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
No, you know what?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
It's a lovely horse.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
What kind of oats? Does he eat any kind of special oats?

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
Do you lock the barn or how would I steal him just hypothetically?

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
The problem with the idea of stealing a horse is because it implies that you can own a horse

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
and as we all know-

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Not possible.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
Nobody can own a horse. They are like freedom incarnate.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
You can-

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Can you steal a dream? Can you steal a hope?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
You can-

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Can you steal wishes?

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
At best, you can form a partnership, a voluntary partnership with a horse.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
At best.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
But there is no title involved in the process.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
And if anything, it's a tenuous agreement.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Can you steal a sunset?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
Can you?

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
How about a yahoo?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
This yahoo is sent in by Andy Hill. Thank you Andy.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
It's about yahoo answer user John. It's gonna get gross.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
Here it goes. John asks,

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Detailed, how to kiss please?

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
Some girls like making out with me and some say I use too much teeth.

38:45.000 --> 38:51.000
Help me out here guys. How should you kiss?

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
You shouldn't use your teeth.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Teeth is a bad-

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Well sometimes you can, you know, if it's getting all-

38:58.000 --> 39:05.000
Of the enunciators, I would say that teeth are the least important in the equation

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and lips and tip of the tongue are probably much-

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah, I don't think he's worried about hitting his hard consonants while he's mouth deep.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Help with my plosives.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Guys, I actually just got a letter from my lawyer.

39:17.000 --> 39:23.000
He says that it would be actually too weird for me to continue to participate in this particular conversation.

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
I actually just got a letter from my copyright lawyer who said that if I give away my secrets, I will be infringing on my patents.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Okay, then let's go off the record here.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
Let me turn the chair around and that officially means we're off the record.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
Okay, just to be clear, any kissing secrets I give away here cannot be used professionally.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Do not tweet them. Do not quote us in your local periodicals.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
But we are about to drop some science on you.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Girls love it when you just run your teeth into their teeth.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
If there's not a loud click-

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
I did that a lot in high school and the girls would be like,

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Ow, what the fuck?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And I'd be like, what's wrong? Don't you know? That's how it's good.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
That's what's good. That's good now.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Girls also like it when you sword fight with your tongues.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
When you really get in there and Greco Roman wrestle with that shit.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
If you make a mistake and you seem to set them off right, set them off wrong rather,

40:15.000 --> 40:22.000
you need to pretend that it's the way they do it in whatever the next level of education for you is.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
So if you're in middle school and your teeth click and they say,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Oh, I hate that. You say, well, that's-

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
This is what they do at the adult learning annex.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
This is how they do it in my doctorate program.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
So I don't know. You just need to maybe get a little more mature.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
If you do make a mistake, though, the best way to do it is to just lean in real close to their ear and just go,

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
Uh oh, cheerios.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Yeah, that's going to really ignite that.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I think it's really going to set this situation ablaze.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The trick is to be thorough.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
Just get your whole mouth in their mouth and just sort of scout around like a surgeon fish.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
My number one kissing rule is kiss every tooth.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Kiss every tooth one by one. Let me see that.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Wait, you got a little more?

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
And then, and if that starts to get stale, just start going around the face.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
You know, go for the eyes, you know, the nose.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
No holds barred.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Use your nose.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Put your fucking eyelash on their tongue and like just give them some of that for a bit.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
Put your nose, put your nose in their ear.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Yeah, just act like you're a puppy looking for some straight pizza sauce after pizza night.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
After pizza, after pizza Thursdays.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Don't explore their mouth after pizza Thursdays though.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
No.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
And you know what else girls love?

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
Women and gentlemen enjoy that before you do anything, you ask, and I mean constantly,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Is it okay if I kiss your eyeball?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
May I kiss your nose?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
You can kiss them.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm going to look behind your ear for pizza sauce.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah, or just if you're doing the mouth too, just give them like a,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Can I kiss your mouth?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Can I kiss your mouth?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Can I kiss your mouth again?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
I really like it.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And keep growing in intensity every time you ask.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Can I kiss your mouth?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
How about that mouth?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Can I kiss it?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Can I, please?

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Can I ask,

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Give me that mouth!

42:13.000 --> 42:25.000
How are we going to alert our listeners that it is now safe to walk across the room and pick up the headphones that they have surely by now cast, cast from the,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I've got like at least three more minutes of snitching tips.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Somewhere there's some dude with a notepad going, ask before you do anything.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
This is good.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
This is good stuff.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Pizza Thursdays.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Okay.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
This is all good.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
This Yahoo was sent in by Wayne Rowan.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Thank you, Wayne.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
It's by Yahoo answers user Sophie who asks,

42:45.000 --> 42:51.000
Do horses have any emotions that humans don't have?

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
I am actually doing a horse behavior presentation for an equine class I'm in,

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
but I was wondering if horses had exactly the same emotions that we humans do.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Humans is in parentheses as if like you didn't fucking know.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
As we humans do.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
I went on a website that told me the types of behavior that horses have.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Buckle your asses in.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
Can I make one quick point before you tell me the behavior that things that horses have?

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
I want to see if you did something valuable from this before your presentation.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
I definitely, definitely can't wait to see this line on the bibliography.

43:29.000 --> 43:35.000
I can't wait to see how you cite the information you received from Yahoo answers.

43:35.000 --> 43:41.000
Acceptance.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
That's fair.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
If you're professionally being written, right?

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
Well, it's not ideal, but I don't have a problem.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
I love oats and apples.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Affection.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Sure.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Sure.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
This is my favorite.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
Anger one and anger two.

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
Anger one is like a quiet, reserved anger and anger two is like an explosion of biting.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Yeah.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
It's just spurs.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
That's the only thing that if they see spurs like,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I am angry one.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Breaking out the dose today.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Annoyance.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
It doesn't apathy.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Fine.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
I accepted too much oats.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I guess another ride.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Sure.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Perfect.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Whatever.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Jumps tricks.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
It's all the same.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Be beautifully.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Sorry.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
They made like an earthbound dragon.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Sure.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Why not?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Anxiety.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
What if I ran out of oats?

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
What would happen?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Boredom.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Well, what?

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Okay.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
I can't blame them too much for that.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Right.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
It's like they can't even watch Game of Thrones.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
They don't get HBO.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Could you turn the TV towards the window, please?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Right.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Towards the window.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
I got a big day today.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
I'm either going to stand in grass or run in a loop.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
I can't wait to see what fate has in store.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Well, I mean, that's okay.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Tame horses, yes.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I could see them falling prey to boredom.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Wild horses?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Boredom for a wild horse?

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
It can't happen.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Wild horses aren't familiar with this emotion because they can just go jump over a brook

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
they've never jumped over before.

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
I have to imagine that for a wild horse, it's mainly about anxiety because they're very fast.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
And I can see a situation where you're in a conversation deep with another horse friend

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
and then all of a sudden you look at them and you think, hey, Rodrigo, have you seen

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
any grass for a while?

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
And then Rodrigo's like, oh my God, you're right.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
There's no grass.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
And they're in the middle of a parking lot.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
They're in a parking lot.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Oh, great.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
This is going to be on the news.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Was no one paying attention?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Who was following who?

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
I'm feeling annoyance right now, which could be upgraded to anger one if something doesn't

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
change.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
If you keep running your fucking mouth, Rodrigo, it's going to get upgraded to anger two and

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
you don't want to see that.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Dude, just relax.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Let me figure this out.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Compassion.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
It's got a fat rider.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
It's too bad.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Did you see Lucy?

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Lucy's got a fat rider.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
I know.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Poor thing.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Poor deer.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
If you are a being that is mainly bred to be ridden and you can still work up compassion

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
for anything else, God bless you.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
That is a beautiful, beautiful reserve of goodwill.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Well, they feel bad for the burros.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Sure.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Sure, they do.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
For the burros.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Yeah.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
No, roll the R's because it's not authentic if you don't.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
For the burros.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Thank you.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
I don't know what animal you're talking about if you don't roll the R.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Contentment.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
Very few horses, I imagine, feel this.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Orb definitely feel...

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
Orb appreciates the fact that he has reached the physical fucking apex of possibly any

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
creature on the planet.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
He probably...

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I think it's just anxiety, right?

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Even if you win the Kentucky Derby, it's like, well, am I going to get the Triple Crown?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
That's what everybody starts asking.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
That's a lot of pressure.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
Am I going to be able to fucking keep up this perfect body until the Preakness?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
They're going to shower me in oats after this fucking thing.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
What if I can't perform my stud duties?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Right.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Oh, man.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Pressure.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Curiosity.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Doubtful.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
Based on what?

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Why is that doubtful?

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
What are they curious about?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
They have everything they need hand delivered to them.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I wonder what driving a car is like.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Right.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
If they are curious about it, I refuse to...

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
If they're curious about anything, they're certainly not acting on it, because they seem

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
to be kind of in a rut as a species.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Yeah.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
Nobody's ever said curiosity killed the horse, because a horse will see...

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
A fucking helicopter could land next to a horse, and a horse would be like, that's not an

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
apple.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Is that an apple?

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Come back when you're...

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
We check for a stem.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Nope.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
No stem.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
No thanks.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Come back when you're hay.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Come back when you're hay.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Fear.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Sure.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Yeah.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, daily.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
If there's a bull snake around, those things are terrified.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Yeah.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
Loneliness.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.820
Not if I have anything to say about it.

48:12.820 --> 48:13.820
Physical suffering.

48:13.820 --> 48:14.820
Yes, sure.

48:14.820 --> 48:15.820
100%.

48:15.820 --> 48:16.820
Absolutely.

48:16.820 --> 48:17.820
They are...

48:17.820 --> 48:22.740
Their entire being is suspended in a state of constant suffering.

48:22.740 --> 48:23.760
So, yes.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.000
Think about how Sat...

48:25.000 --> 48:28.080
When horses get the spurs and then they run faster,

48:28.080 --> 48:30.280
they're trying to run away from a danger

48:30.280 --> 48:32.960
that is like physically attached to them.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.780
That's the saddest thing in the world.

48:34.780 --> 48:35.840
Which most humans have,

48:35.840 --> 48:38.360
but do horses have any emotions that humans don't have

48:38.360 --> 48:39.760
or that humans can't relate to?

48:39.760 --> 48:40.840
Thanks.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.760
Prance. The latter?

48:41.760 --> 48:42.800
Yes. What?

48:42.800 --> 48:44.060
Prancing.

48:44.060 --> 48:46.040
Prancing is my- Okay.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.080
Yeah. I've never felt prancing.

48:48.080 --> 48:49.840
I don't think that's beyond human,

48:49.840 --> 48:51.840
it's beyond you, yes,

48:51.840 --> 48:54.800
just because of like your physique, no offense.

48:54.800 --> 48:55.840
Wouldn't you think, though,

48:55.840 --> 48:58.120
that if the horses did have an emotion

48:58.120 --> 49:01.200
that we don't have in humankind,

49:01.200 --> 49:04.040
then we probably don't have a human word for it, right?

49:04.040 --> 49:05.840
Right. It's sort of like,

49:05.840 --> 49:09.280
it's kind of like the flavor umami.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.120
Sure.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.760
It's an indescribable thing.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.320
It's like if there were any new colors that we didn't know,

49:15.320 --> 49:17.760
we would know about it.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.360
You know what I mean?

49:19.360 --> 49:20.200
Chicken chance.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.520
You know, I lose stuff a lot

49:21.520 --> 49:25.040
so I have a tendency to like absentmindedly sit stuff down

49:25.040 --> 49:26.680
and then just keep going.

49:26.680 --> 49:29.400
And it's like, I know that I've sat my keys down

49:29.400 --> 49:31.000
at some point, but I can't picture where.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.480
And what I do, and it's not exactly like a very proud moment,

49:34.480 --> 49:36.120
but I'll just loudly announce,

49:36.120 --> 49:38.960
like I'm setting my keys on the dresser

49:39.920 --> 49:41.520
and make it active.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.840
It's pretty dorky, but it works

49:43.840 --> 49:45.520
and I don't lose shit anymore.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.480
Do you ever sing a little song?

49:48.760 --> 49:50.840
Dresser keys, dresser keys.

49:50.840 --> 49:54.040
Will you be there when I need?

49:55.040 --> 49:59.320
Putting my wallet on the toilet paper dispenser

49:59.320 --> 50:00.920
in the bathroom.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.720
Gotta do it, gotta do it.

50:02.720 --> 50:04.680
What if there's pee on the floor?

50:04.680 --> 50:06.280
It's okay if it gets on my pants.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.360
I'm just wearing these for one day.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.800
But who am I, mister buy a new wallet every week

50:10.800 --> 50:12.840
when I get pee on it guy?

50:12.840 --> 50:13.680
No.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.600
Toilet paper wallet.

50:16.600 --> 50:19.720
You're my best friend and I love you.

50:19.720 --> 50:23.640
You know, people say Widow Yankovic has lost his step.

50:23.640 --> 50:27.680
But I think his tunes are as fresh as they were

50:27.680 --> 50:29.440
in the 80s.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.280
Take a chance.

50:32.080 --> 50:35.160
Can a 27 year old sign up for high school again?

50:37.200 --> 50:38.720
I want to see if I can go back to high school.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.720
I have a car and bigger muscles now.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.120
So I think I'll be more popular the second time around.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.400
And I've always wanted to be prom king.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.360
So what do I need to go back to high school?

50:48.360 --> 50:49.200
Oh God.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.400
Bust marketing for 21 Jump Street.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.760
I'm getting my masters in high school.

50:56.760 --> 50:59.880
I'm getting my post grad in high school.

50:59.880 --> 51:03.360
What you need is a teaching certificate.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.200
And then you can go back as a teacher.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.040
I guess that's true.

51:06.040 --> 51:06.880
Yeah.

51:06.880 --> 51:07.880
That's the only way you can go like that

51:07.880 --> 51:10.360
and then beat up all the people who are mean to you,

51:10.360 --> 51:11.200
I guess.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.880
There's no loophole where you can like,

51:12.880 --> 51:16.520
I recognize now at the age of 26 when I finished,

51:16.520 --> 51:19.480
unless I go back for some master's program,

51:19.480 --> 51:20.840
which doesn't seem likely,

51:20.840 --> 51:22.480
I've done all the school I'm going to do.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.440
And it's only now that I realized,

51:24.440 --> 51:26.200
man, I actually like learning.

51:26.200 --> 51:29.240
Fuck, I wish I'd paid attention to anything.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.440
I feel that way too.

51:30.440 --> 51:33.000
Now that I'm older,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.560
I'm reading books to teach myself.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.520
I'm trying to teach myself complex subjects

51:38.520 --> 51:39.880
that are impossible to teach yourself.

51:39.880 --> 51:44.560
And I'm like, man, if only I had fucking done anything,

51:44.560 --> 51:47.040
like any amount of work instead of just like the

51:47.040 --> 51:48.840
requisite shit to get by.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.600
I think college should be something

51:51.600 --> 51:52.880
you get to do in installments.

51:52.880 --> 51:54.960
Cause that way you really appreciate it.

51:54.960 --> 51:57.200
Cause as you get older, you want to learn.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.360
I like learning now.

51:58.360 --> 52:01.400
Back then I hated waking up more.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.960
I think that after like,

52:02.960 --> 52:04.520
when you complete your sophomore year,

52:04.520 --> 52:05.840
someone should sit you down and be like,

52:05.840 --> 52:07.240
are you appreciating this?

52:07.240 --> 52:08.280
And you're like, yeah, I'm not.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.120
I'm probably not.

52:09.120 --> 52:11.240
I'm like, okay, great, cool, cool, cool.

52:11.240 --> 52:12.600
Just go off for a while.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.760
And when you do appreciate this,

52:14.760 --> 52:16.560
we'll welcome you back.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.720
But Travis, you can't put that gene like that.

52:18.720 --> 52:21.000
If there's a definition of what adulthood is,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.840
it's realizing that you didn't appreciate stuff enough.

52:23.840 --> 52:24.680
Yeah.

52:24.680 --> 52:26.840
Cause if you could figure out how to turn back time

52:26.840 --> 52:28.720
and do that easy stuff again,

52:28.720 --> 52:30.200
cause like, let's be honest,

52:30.200 --> 52:32.720
going to college for all its ups and downs

52:32.720 --> 52:34.760
is a lot easier than having a job.

52:34.760 --> 52:35.600
Yeah.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.440
So what if,

52:36.440 --> 52:40.080
what if we start giving jobs to 12 year olds

52:40.080 --> 52:44.440
and then you work from 12 to 21

52:44.440 --> 52:47.040
and then you get to go back to school?

52:47.040 --> 52:47.880
What if-

52:47.880 --> 52:51.520
But the only jobs we give them are college professors.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.120
Now hear me out.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.840
Don't do this.

52:54.840 --> 52:57.240
Don't go to a high school like you are,

52:57.240 --> 52:58.560
as you are now as a man.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.320
You won't, you won't be allowed in.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.400
They won't let you in like you are now.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.520
You're old and-

53:04.520 --> 53:05.360
They'll know.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.200
They'll know that you,

53:06.200 --> 53:10.280
that you don't want to do great things there.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.920
So don't even, I wouldn't even try.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.520
They'd probably, seems like a good idea in the brain,

53:15.680 --> 53:17.880
but I'm pretty sure hindsight's going to be 20, 20

53:17.880 --> 53:21.120
on this particular thing that you want to do

53:21.120 --> 53:21.960
that's terrible.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.240
Especially when you're on 20, 20

53:24.240 --> 53:25.720
and they're like, what were you thinking?

53:25.720 --> 53:27.680
And you're like, you know, in hindsight.

53:27.680 --> 53:31.200
This grown man tried to wear a Justin Bieber t-shirt

53:31.200 --> 53:32.560
and go back to high school.

53:33.480 --> 53:34.320
What would you do?

53:34.320 --> 53:37.040
What would you, but fucking what if he went four years

53:37.040 --> 53:40.440
and he made it to senior prom and he was in the running

53:40.440 --> 53:42.800
and then like two days before,

53:42.800 --> 53:46.080
like, I don't know, some kid lost his legs,

53:46.080 --> 53:47.120
that he was also in the running,

53:47.120 --> 53:49.480
lost his legs in some sort of industrial accident.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.760
And this guy's like, fuck!

53:50.760 --> 53:53.480
Like I spent four years for this day.

53:54.600 --> 53:55.440
And this no-

53:55.440 --> 53:56.280
This is the worst day of my life.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.280
And this little leg kid's gonna fucking swoop in

53:58.280 --> 54:00.120
at the last second.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.120
He probably won't be swooping.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.920
Like some sort of legless Tarzan.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.480
Son of a bitch.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.320
On the plus side-

54:06.320 --> 54:07.160
Gotta do it again.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.000
Gotta do it again.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.560
31, start all over in a different town.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.360
On the plus side, I'm sick at times tables

54:12.360 --> 54:13.680
and my cursive is off the chart.

54:13.680 --> 54:14.840
It's fucking insane.

54:16.640 --> 54:19.480
How can I legally change my dog's name?

54:21.840 --> 54:23.200
His name is Larry.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.320
I want to change it to Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.600
I'm sorry.

54:28.600 --> 54:32.280
I'm gonna open up a food truck inside my dog.

54:33.440 --> 54:36.560
Or additional details, or hot dog party days.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.600
It's a really good name for a dog.

54:40.600 --> 54:43.080
Why do people keep sticking with one word name for dogs?

54:43.080 --> 54:44.560
What this person doesn't say is that

54:44.560 --> 54:47.000
this is the dog's request.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.760
Hey, Larry feels so unsophisticated, so unironic.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.080
I don't know what channels you need to go through,

54:54.080 --> 54:56.280
but I've written down some suggestions.

54:56.280 --> 54:58.040
It's why we don't teach dogs English,

54:58.040 --> 55:00.560
because they ask for stupid things like this.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.880
Here's what I'm, this is why I brought this question up,

55:02.880 --> 55:04.640
is because it brings up a good point.

55:04.640 --> 55:07.800
I'm learning all about the life of dogs.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.840
We already discussed my revelation about dog periods.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.320
Dogs go through a lot of the same shit that we go through,

55:15.320 --> 55:19.080
but at the same time, if I take my dog,

55:19.080 --> 55:23.080
nay Larry, right, previously,

55:23.080 --> 55:24.800
his previous given name was Larry,

55:24.800 --> 55:25.840
and I have decided to change it

55:25.840 --> 55:27.840
to Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

55:27.840 --> 55:28.680
And I take that dog.

55:28.680 --> 55:29.600
The puppy formerly known as Larry.

55:29.600 --> 55:34.000
Right, and I take LFPH to the vet,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.240
and they're like, Larry?

55:36.240 --> 55:39.680
And I say, no, it's Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

55:39.680 --> 55:40.680
They're not gonna be like,

55:40.680 --> 55:45.400
uh, says here on his documentation it's Larry, right?

55:45.400 --> 55:47.200
Or do I need to like go to the fucking courthouse,

55:47.200 --> 55:50.640
get a new social security card for my goddamn dog?

55:50.640 --> 55:52.800
I thought it was just like my property.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.840
Like if I call my table Jerry,

55:54.840 --> 55:57.440
then I can change it to Jerry's Fiesta Party on the house,

55:57.440 --> 55:58.280
my table.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.120
I'm gonna throw this out.

55:59.120 --> 56:01.240
There actually is a circumstance

56:01.240 --> 56:02.880
in which you would have to go through some channels

56:02.880 --> 56:03.960
to change your dog's name.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.200
What the fuck?

56:05.200 --> 56:07.560
If it is AKC registered,

56:07.560 --> 56:09.760
if it is registered with the American Kennel Club

56:09.760 --> 56:11.240
as a purebred dog,

56:12.120 --> 56:12.960
then you have to register your dog.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.360
If it's a competition dog?

56:14.360 --> 56:15.200
Is that what you're saying?

56:15.200 --> 56:16.680
No, if you breed it, our dog Nessie,

56:16.680 --> 56:20.880
Nessie was registered with the AKC as Nessie Bell McElroy.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.400
We would have had to contact them to change her name.

56:23.400 --> 56:25.240
This makes me angry.

56:25.240 --> 56:27.480
I think back to the pioneer days,

56:27.480 --> 56:29.520
horses didn't have no documentation.

56:30.760 --> 56:31.680
You know what I mean?

56:31.680 --> 56:34.320
What about when all the dogs go to heaven,

56:34.320 --> 56:35.800
don't you want St. Pete to have,

56:35.800 --> 56:36.880
what if he doesn't have them?

56:36.880 --> 56:37.720
Then they go to hell.

56:37.720 --> 56:41.200
I don't have a Larry Fiesta Party on the house.

56:41.200 --> 56:45.080
Can I break down actually Larry's Fiesta Party on the house?

56:45.080 --> 56:47.320
On the house is a parenthetical.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.560
I mean, you could just do it.

56:48.560 --> 56:51.160
I mean, Fiesta Party is obviously problematic.

56:51.160 --> 56:56.160
Because we're really just saying Larry Party Party.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.760
This is my dog Lawrence Party Party.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.360
Larry's Fiesta Party casual get together.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.800
The dog.

57:04.800 --> 57:05.640
The movie.

57:06.800 --> 57:08.000
Did you see that movie?

57:10.160 --> 57:11.480
Oh Christ.

57:12.680 --> 57:15.440
It asks for hot dog party days.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.400
I think we are Larry's Fiesta Parties.

57:17.400 --> 57:18.440
I think we're pretty,

57:18.440 --> 57:19.280
I have my heart set on it.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.960
In any case, the first name is already taken.

57:21.960 --> 57:22.800
With the AKC.

57:22.800 --> 57:26.040
We actually already have Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.600
We have a champion Basset Hound

57:27.600 --> 57:30.160
named Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

57:30.160 --> 57:33.480
This fucking, the fucking commentators

57:33.480 --> 57:35.640
at the Kennel Club show,

57:35.640 --> 57:37.000
the annual Kennel Club show,

57:37.000 --> 57:37.840
like ladies and gentlemen,

57:37.840 --> 57:39.080
I know this is gonna get confusing,

57:39.080 --> 57:43.160
but here comes the second Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.720
Another purebred Basset Hound.

57:44.720 --> 57:49.720
It's a battle of the Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

57:51.040 --> 57:53.760
Somehow we all knew it would come down to this.

57:56.200 --> 57:58.320
A hush falls over the crowd.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.360
It all comes down to the heat of the genitals.

58:00.360 --> 58:03.680
They both defecate at the same time.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.760
It is perfect.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.600
We may have a multiverse situation.

58:07.600 --> 58:10.240
We may have a multiverse bleed.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.080
It's perfect.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.080
They've made eye contact from across the room.

58:12.080 --> 58:14.360
Travis, you know about dogs and shit.

58:14.360 --> 58:17.280
Is a perfect defecation a category

58:17.280 --> 58:18.600
in the Westminster Kennel Club dog show America?

58:18.600 --> 58:20.080
Only as a tiebreaker.

58:23.280 --> 58:27.240
I've been researching extensively

58:27.240 --> 58:32.240
to try to find some information about making swords.

58:33.480 --> 58:37.840
And I found this page from anvilfire.com.

58:37.840 --> 58:41.880
And they have sword myths slash fiction.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.440
So let me hit you guys with some sword myths.

58:44.440 --> 58:45.840
Yeah, what have I been getting wrong

58:45.840 --> 58:47.080
about swords this whole time?

58:47.080 --> 58:48.760
Is it actual slash fiction?

58:48.760 --> 58:51.200
Because I feel like that's really appropriate with swords.

58:51.200 --> 58:52.800
Swords myths and sword fiction.

58:52.800 --> 58:54.880
The buster sword from Final Fantasy VII

58:54.880 --> 58:57.960
and a samurai sword, they met one day.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.600
He said, you looking really good, buster sword.

59:00.600 --> 59:02.560
And then they clanged.

59:02.560 --> 59:03.720
They clanged and clanged.

59:03.720 --> 59:04.840
I'm gonna clang.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.640
I'm gonna clang all over your sheath.

59:07.640 --> 59:12.640
Blood does not make a superior quenchant.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.840
This is an old myth.

59:14.720 --> 59:18.600
Neither virgins or slaves have been used to test swords.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.600
That is a children's story.

59:20.600 --> 59:21.440
What?

59:21.440 --> 59:22.280
Children's story.

59:22.280 --> 59:23.120
That is my favorite children's story.

59:23.120 --> 59:23.960
Get around kids.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.600
Help me test the blades.

59:25.600 --> 59:26.960
How many y'all fucked?

59:26.960 --> 59:28.200
None of y'all?

59:28.200 --> 59:29.040
Let me tell you.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.200
You'd be good sword fodder.

59:31.200 --> 59:34.280
You cannot chop a machine gun barrel in two

59:34.280 --> 59:35.760
with a Japanese sword.

59:35.760 --> 59:36.760
Modern myth.

59:36.760 --> 59:38.320
No, I saw that on Mythbusters.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.560
Myth busted.

59:41.560 --> 59:44.920
Ancient steels were not superior to modern alloy steels.

59:44.920 --> 59:45.760
Yeah, no shit.

59:45.760 --> 59:46.800
Another modern myth.

59:46.800 --> 59:49.680
It's cause our steels are genetically superior

59:49.680 --> 59:51.000
in every way.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.200
They've been modified and enhanced and chopped and screwed.

59:53.200 --> 59:56.000
Here's where things go weirdly askew.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.080
Atlantis was not in the Atlantic.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.280
The story of Atlantis was based on rumors

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.400
of the demise of Minoan Island culture

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.840
in the Mediterranean by volcanic eruption.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.000
The story was handed down by Egyptians to Plato

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.480
who turned the little truth into a myth.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.680
Listen, animal fighter.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.600
I'm not gonna tell you you're straying

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.800
from the path of sword myths,

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.800
but throw the word sword in there somewhere.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.440
Yeah.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.200
They sometimes had swords, somebody in there.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.200
Atomantium is a fictional comic book element

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.160
without any basis in reality like kryptonite.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.640
It's just another unobtainium.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.320
JFK was not actually assassinated by a sword.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.800
Like yeah, dog, like I know.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.640
I know that one.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.280
Swords are not good food.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.560
Yeah, okay, thank you.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.880
Clouds are not made of small white swords.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.000
Like thanks, website.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.760
Mythril, J-R-R token, is another myth-ical metal.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.440
Myth is all caps.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.280
Thank you.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.400
Last one, you cannot, and this is the one

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.560
that I find very confusing on several levels.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.200
You cannot cold forge a sword from a leaf spring.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.560
Modern web myth slash parody.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.040
What's the most hilarious parody on the web?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.120
There's a guy who cold forges a sword in a leaf spring.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.720
Everyone gets a real kick out of it.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.280
I think that's a weird all Yankovic jam.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.640
Does it say anything on there, Justin,

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.120
about whether or not steak knives are just little swords?

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.040
Are cocktail swords real swords?

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.960
True or false?

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.000
I feel like we all learned a lot about swords today.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.840
Sword wisdom, sword wisdom.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.880
Atomium is not a blade metal.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.640
It is not intrinsically sharp or hard as recent TV

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.960
commercial for razor blades indicates.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.440
There's more Hollywood hype and bad science

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.120
written by advertising executives

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.200
that know nothing about metallurgy.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.520
Big corpos selling out.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.200
Well, what are you gonna tell me next,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.720
that adamantium's real?

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.560
Ugh.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.160
Here we go.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.000
Last question.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.320
This one is edited by Charles Decker.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.240
Thank you, Charles Decker.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Ive, who asks,

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.120
is Mr. Pringle still alive?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.440
Why does my son make laser gun noises in the bathroom?

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.800
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.960
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.680
I'm Griffin McElroy.
