00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.400
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother mean advice show for the modern era. I'm

00:48.400 --> 00:53.040
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy, and it's time to pay the piper. I'm your middlest brother,

00:53.040 --> 00:57.840
Travis McElroy, and the piper's got bills. You know, he's got stuff to pay for.

00:57.840 --> 01:03.680
I'm Griffin the money man McElroy, and 30 under 30 money boy, and money money money money,

01:03.680 --> 01:09.200
must be funny, pay us all your dues. I'm worried about the piper.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.320
The piper has been a little bit sad lately because of all the money you owe him, sucker.

01:17.440 --> 01:24.960
You've been dancing to our jolly, jolly song. You've been dancing to our jolly song for a

01:24.960 --> 01:31.600
calendar year, and now he has upended his hat, and he is passing it around, and it's time for

01:31.600 --> 01:37.920
you to pay for the jolly tunes you've enjoyed. Also, the piper's hungry. Be cool. Come on.

01:37.920 --> 01:44.880
Also, if we want to take a different tact with the intro, it's our quadricentennial episode.

01:46.560 --> 01:51.920
It's a big one for us, and we've got a big one for you. A big episode, and a big hug. Come on

01:51.920 --> 01:57.600
close. Thank you. Oh, so warm, so warm. Let me just get that wallet. This one is special as hell.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.000
Listen, straight up, this one's special, but it's also a special time of year. It's the max fund

02:02.000 --> 02:08.160
drive. It's the max fund drive. Oh, so excited. It's our annual fundraising drive because here's

02:08.160 --> 02:14.240
the thing. Our podcasts, our podcasts are free, and we're so glad that you enjoy them, and you

02:14.240 --> 02:20.880
listen to them, and once a year, we ask you to maybe consider pledging a monthly donation to

02:20.880 --> 02:27.360
support our show and the shows you love. Listen, we McElroy's, we got a lot of shows on max fun.

02:28.240 --> 02:34.400
I think 36 last time I checked. 43 actually. Oh, we added seven more. That's right, because now

02:34.400 --> 02:40.560
my dog hosts two. Your dog now hosts, yes, you can pet this dog, and it's sort of a fan cast.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.120
Come get a pet of this. You'll never believe how much you can pet this dog.

02:45.120 --> 02:52.080
And so if you love the content that you get from max fun and from the McElroy's,

02:52.080 --> 02:57.840
maybe consider going to maximumfun.org forward slash donate and becoming a donor. We're going

02:57.840 --> 03:01.760
to tell you all the different levels, all the different rewards, but just right off the bat,

03:01.760 --> 03:06.400
I want to tell you, I think the best reward consistently year over year is all the bonus

03:06.400 --> 03:15.360
content. There is like, I would say no joke though, conservative estimate, a hundred hours. We've

03:15.360 --> 03:20.400
done the math before. It's many days of podcasting that you can enjoy, especially if you've never

03:20.400 --> 03:27.360
done it before. You have an unfathomable treasure trove there. Including an episode we recorded for

03:27.360 --> 03:32.480
our bonus episode this year, which was us just doing segments from the past, including monthly

03:32.480 --> 03:41.520
observances, haunted doll watch, subway hacks, a lot of good, oops all bits. And I used the word

03:41.520 --> 03:45.360
good in there earlier and that wouldn't describe all the segments. We've stopped doing some of them

03:45.360 --> 03:50.400
for good reason. But we've also got a bonus episode of Taz in there where we do a one-off game

03:51.360 --> 03:57.440
called for Sherlock Holmes and a vampire, which is one of the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.080
And even if you've never listened to Taz before, you could just go and listen to that and enjoy it

04:02.080 --> 04:07.600
because it's completely standalone. We are trying to get to 25,000 new and upgraded members this year

04:07.600 --> 04:12.720
and we have several different donation levels. We're going to break in in the middle and talk

04:12.720 --> 04:18.400
about all that stuff, but we want to thank you preemptively. If you've supported us in the past

04:18.400 --> 04:25.840
and you like supporting content that you love, we really appreciate you. If you are not already

04:25.840 --> 04:33.840
on board, you can go to maximumfund.org slash donate. Do it right now. And you get to feel good

04:33.840 --> 04:38.080
because you have supported something that you love and we really appreciate it. So we're going to get

04:38.080 --> 04:42.720
into the episode now and we'll be back in the middle to talk more about like the- Do we want

04:42.720 --> 04:46.960
to say anything to set this one up though? It's a little bit- Yeah, it's a wild one. This one's

04:46.960 --> 04:51.200
going to be- Of a journey. I haven't edited it yet. It's going to be a bit of a Frankenstein,

04:51.200 --> 05:02.800
but we were- Okay. We were invited to do our nasty thing, do our dirty thing, live on the red carpet

05:03.360 --> 05:11.040
of the Broadway debut of Jimmy Buffett's Escape to Margaritaville. For reasons beyond our

05:11.040 --> 05:15.360
comprehension and it's been weeks since we've done it, still beyond our comprehension, but it was a

05:15.360 --> 05:21.440
wild, wild night and we recorded a bunch of stuff from the red carpet. We had a little bit at the

05:21.440 --> 05:25.760
beginning with our good friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda. You're going to hear that too. And you're going to

05:25.760 --> 05:32.240
hear us go through various stages of sort of panic and sort of social discomfort and grief,

05:32.240 --> 05:36.400
all the stages of grief. Did we mention there were celebrities on the red carpet that we were

05:36.400 --> 05:43.360
expected to talk to? Yeah, so there's- That's part of it. It's a whole lot. So we thought episode 400,

05:43.360 --> 05:48.640
let's make it a special one by presenting you with the most anxious night of our lives and our

05:48.640 --> 05:54.560
careers. And we're going to get into the bit we recorded now with Lin and she'll listen to the

05:54.560 --> 05:58.640
rest of the episode, but we will be back soon to tell you more about the Max Fun Drive. Remember,

05:58.640 --> 06:05.040
just go donate right now. Maximumfun.org slash donate. And here comes something, man. I don't

06:05.040 --> 06:08.880
know. Here comes something. Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me,

06:08.880 --> 06:13.840
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy. I'm your

06:13.840 --> 06:19.760
middle-est brother, Travis Showbiz McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media

06:19.760 --> 06:26.960
luminary, Griffin, big lights, big city, McElroy. I'm visiting gadfly Lin-Manuel Miranda. Whoa,

06:26.960 --> 06:30.960
where did you come from? I was hoping we could do like a layer of like fiction. Like,

06:30.960 --> 06:35.360
oh, he just popped out of the toilet. No, he wouldn't be in the toilet. No, I just,

06:35.360 --> 06:40.720
if you're in Times Square, I appear Broadway. Which one of the costume characters are you

06:40.720 --> 06:46.160
on Times Square? Are you the scary Elmo or the scary Hulk? I am Ecuadorian Iron Man.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.920
We saw two Hulks today, side by side, together. That's gotta be irritating in the exact same

06:51.920 --> 06:58.080
costume. Anyway, welcome to a brought to you by, this week's episode is brought to you by

06:58.640 --> 07:02.720
Escape to Margaritaville. Did you just have to take a second to realize,

07:02.720 --> 07:07.200
because I have done this a few times, is it Escape to Margaret, and we're about to do something

07:07.200 --> 07:11.920
where we need to have this locked in. Is it Escape to Margaritaville or Escape from Margaritaville?

07:11.920 --> 07:15.360
Escape from Margaritaville would be wild. That's the sequel.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.640
Get out. Get out.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.200
Spoiler alert, but they do have to escape from Margaritaville at a certain point in the musical.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.960
We're not here to spoil story beats. We're here to talk about this great musical

07:26.960 --> 07:33.440
for everybody to go see, and we've got kind of a weird situation. A weird day ahead of us.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.840
A bit of a situation. We are going to be, here in a minute, you're going to hear us,

07:37.840 --> 07:43.440
and we have not done this yet, so we're a little on edge about it. Here in a minute,

07:43.440 --> 07:48.400
you're going to hear us down on the red carpet recording our program,

07:49.600 --> 07:54.080
live from the red carpet of Escape to Margaritaville.

07:54.080 --> 07:59.360
The Broadway debut. It's the Ides of March, which is another sort of great omen for us.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.240
Oh, no.

08:00.240 --> 08:04.960
Yeah, we will have no table. We will have no chairs. We will have your questions.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.840
I have not stood up for one straight hour in four years.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.200
I'm very nervous about that.

08:09.200 --> 08:14.640
The only thing we have is the hope that we will appear to supposed to be there.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.000
That's my hope is that it just won't look like we were just like,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.800
hey, what are you guys doing? Can we stand here?

08:20.800 --> 08:24.480
We've never been on a red carpet in our entire life. What can we expect?

08:25.120 --> 08:28.960
Well, if this were the Oscars or the Tonys or movie opening,

08:28.960 --> 08:33.360
you would expect an hour and throngs of press. But this is just Broadway.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.240
So it'll be like five outlets that are the Broadway outlets that go to everything.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.440
Well, I wanted there to be much, much more than that.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.160
I wanted there to be a chance where we could get passed over and be like,

08:44.160 --> 08:46.080
well, they had a lot of other people to get to.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.240
Now it sounds like if they pass us over, it'll be because they looked at us or heard us talking.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.000
What's that Hydra at the end of the line?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.520
How much should we explain to people?

08:55.520 --> 08:58.960
We've got some there's I don't want to talk about anybody specific.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.680
Can I ask something? What happened?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.600
What led to this series of listen?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.720
We love our buddy Jimmy Buffett. How did you end up?

09:10.320 --> 09:14.560
Jimmy just thought it would be funny if we recorded at the premiere.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.400
And I don't think he thought about it much more than that.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.320
He was like, yeah, that'd be funny. Let's do it.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.800
We were like, and then we said to in Jimmy's defense, we said, yeah.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.920
And then we were like, wait a minute, what are we going to do?

09:25.920 --> 09:27.040
What are we doing here?

09:27.040 --> 09:31.200
Oh, no, wait, did one of us like slight Jimmy Buffett in the past?

09:31.200 --> 09:36.000
And this is honest to God, had this thought several times today of at some point,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.480
he'll be walking down the red carpet and be like, everybody else stop.

09:39.040 --> 09:43.360
You three keep going and you pay attention to these three idiot assholes.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.000
Hey, do you remember that joke you made when I was on your episode?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.280
You burnt. Yeah. And then I'll dump pig's blood on us

09:49.280 --> 09:52.560
or margaritas either way or pig's blood margaritas.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.640
Um, yeah. So we're like,

09:55.920 --> 10:00.400
we're going to try to talk to people that are on the red carpet of the show.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.880
And like, I guess we'll ask them your questions

10:02.880 --> 10:04.960
that you send in about vacations to your listener.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.600
So we're trying to hang on to that.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.840
At least we'll be doing that, that we know how to do that.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.680
Did you do a red carpet for Hamilton?

10:11.680 --> 10:16.320
Uh, I did not do the pre-show red carpet cause I was in the show.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.320
But you had the, the show had one.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.200
Yeah. The show had one.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.240
That's where we didn't get that.

10:20.240 --> 10:20.400
Yeah.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.240
You know what would be funny guys?

10:25.360 --> 10:28.560
Why didn't we, we could have recorded on the red carpet of Hamilton.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.320
Wait, you guys, you guys are anxious about the red carpet of Margaritaville.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.360
I know, but then we'd be more experienced for the Margaritaville red carpet.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.040
Yours would have been the fucking burner.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.680
Like we could have really wasted.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.080
We could have wasted our energy on yours

10:42.080 --> 10:44.000
and then brought our A game to Margaritaville.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.040
I'm sorry I didn't think of that.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.600
I didn't know Jimmy was coming to the great white light.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.200
Probably because nobody's ever recorded a podcast for the premiere.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.800
That's probably the only reason that didn't occur to you

10:54.800 --> 10:56.640
is that nobody's ever fucking done it before.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.440
Whoa, Flips, are we making history?

10:59.440 --> 11:00.000
You might be.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.640
We might be.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.360
This could be the first podcast ever recorded

11:03.360 --> 11:05.840
from the red carpet of a Broadway premiere,

11:05.840 --> 11:09.760
which is not something, it's not a necessarily perfect fit

11:09.760 --> 11:10.640
if you think about it.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.400
It's not like we're going to do it

11:12.400 --> 11:14.720
and everyone's going to be like, how have we not done this before?

11:14.720 --> 11:15.840
It's so good.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.560
Did you hear that?

11:16.560 --> 11:18.720
Hey, Beverly, did you hear this episode?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.000
They sound so nervous.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.280
It's really top-notch content.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.320
It's really good.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.040
We've got to do that on the next WTF.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.240
I've been Marc Maron the whole time.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.560
I will say this, because there is less press

11:30.560 --> 11:34.080
than you would find at sort of a bigger media thing,

11:34.080 --> 11:36.240
a lot of people are going to come talk to you

11:36.240 --> 11:39.040
and they'll be game.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.480
They'll be game for whatever twisted humor

11:42.480 --> 11:46.080
you guys bring to your own slant on things.

11:47.280 --> 11:52.320
How much of our shtick should we explain to people

11:52.320 --> 11:55.600
when we talk to them or should we just go for it?

11:56.720 --> 11:57.600
Go big or go home.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.280
Is that professional advice you're giving?

12:01.280 --> 12:02.880
Are you saying that because you're going to listen

12:02.880 --> 12:06.080
to this episode and you want it to be as entertaining?

12:06.080 --> 12:08.240
Yeah, I'm just a long-time fan, first-time caller.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.600
So you're just fucking with us, right?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.400
Because we are who we are, it's not enough for us to-

12:12.400 --> 12:13.360
I think by the time you say,

12:13.360 --> 12:14.880
hey, we host My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

12:14.880 --> 12:16.640
it's a show about advice, but they're gone.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.120
So just go in.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.320
Okay, you've gone from everybody's going to be game

12:22.320 --> 12:24.480
and down to clown for as long as you want to.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.760
If you tell them the name of your show,

12:25.760 --> 12:27.360
they're going to leave, so which is it?

12:29.440 --> 12:31.760
I will want to know why these three pasty gentlemen

12:31.760 --> 12:33.760
are assaulting them with advice questions.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.360
Let me hit you guys with this.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.800
We are Jimmy Buffett's three irascible nephews.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.120
This is for a science fair?

12:45.280 --> 12:48.080
My uncle Jimmy said I could ask you some questions.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.120
Is it too late to go out and buy three matching sailor's outfits

12:51.120 --> 12:52.880
and say we're his irascible nephews

12:52.880 --> 12:54.640
doing a project for the school fair?

12:56.640 --> 12:57.680
This is the first time I've heard

12:57.680 --> 12:59.040
the word irascible said out loud.

12:59.040 --> 12:59.680
I've only read it in books.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.800
And I did it twice.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.680
Yeah, so how do you do now?

13:03.680 --> 13:04.160
Sounds right.

13:04.160 --> 13:04.880
Ward Smith.

13:05.680 --> 13:06.560
Should we find me?

13:06.560 --> 13:07.600
I'm so scared.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.880
Talk in your microphone.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.520
I'm extremely, extremely scared of tonight

13:13.520 --> 13:14.560
and how bad it's going to go.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.040
I'm scared about what we just put in our bodies.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.240
We didn't eat a lot of cheese.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.840
Went to a place called Junior's.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.960
And I don't know why they called that

13:20.960 --> 13:23.440
because there's nothing Junior about these portions.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.960
Is that a skew point of view?

13:25.600 --> 13:26.960
So if I bring that tonight, I'm good.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.480
Yeah, you're Travis had a fucking milkshake

13:28.480 --> 13:30.560
with a piece of cheesecake on top of it.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.840
It was on the menu too.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.200
I don't want anyone to think that

13:33.200 --> 13:35.520
I crafted that from my mindscape.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.280
That was an on menu.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.520
You ordered it from your fucking mindscape.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.560
I did make the decision,

13:40.560 --> 13:42.000
but I didn't really want to eat it.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.920
Well, I did, but I mostly was just like,

13:43.920 --> 13:44.800
I must see this.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.080
I told them while they were both eating

13:46.080 --> 13:47.600
their big cheesecake messes,

13:47.600 --> 13:49.760
that if they farted within a 10 foot perimeter

13:49.760 --> 13:51.760
of Al Roker, I would never speak to either of them.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.520
Watching the sun bake.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.960
Hey, Lynn, wait till you hear this.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.800
I was in Times Square and a guy jammed a CD in my hand

13:58.800 --> 13:59.920
and he says free.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.280
So I took it and then he asked me for a donation.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.600
Can you believe that Swaggy Jeff did that to me?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.080
But you just gave him free publicity.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.000
That's good.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.120
He'll enjoy that and the $20 I gave him for his bird CD.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.320
That is more than you would buy.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.360
That's all I had.

14:16.080 --> 14:16.880
What else can we say?

14:16.880 --> 14:19.440
Here's another track from Swaggy Jeff's mixtape.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.040
We're gonna play that for 30 minutes

14:21.040 --> 14:23.040
because we're only gonna get about 90 seconds

14:23.040 --> 14:24.640
of usable audio, I feel like.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.360
Listen, I think you're gonna find some real,

14:27.360 --> 14:30.560
I mean, you've only ever done your podcast

14:30.560 --> 14:32.720
sort of from the comfort of your own homes.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.800
This is not true.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.800
Lynn, we've done 50 live shows.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.920
You've been there for some of them.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.200
What are you talking about?

14:39.200 --> 14:42.880
This is like, I don't know, it's like an installation.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.840
Think of it as the sleep no more of podcast.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.600
You don't know who's coming up.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.360
You've got your mask on.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.320
Can I wear my mask?

14:52.320 --> 14:54.160
That would make this easier, actually.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.680
Now, Lynn just said something interesting,

14:55.680 --> 14:57.520
which is that we're not gonna know who's coming up.

14:58.160 --> 15:02.480
And for me, that's going to be true a lot of the time

15:02.480 --> 15:04.480
because I don't know who anybody is.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.000
Unless it's a cast of Terrace House.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.360
If somebody from Terrace House,

15:09.360 --> 15:11.920
if Ben McKenzie rolls up from the OC,

15:11.920 --> 15:13.360
here's the list of celebrities I know.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.400
Al Roker, he's gonna be there tonight, so that's good.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.240
Now, that doesn't mean we'll get to talk to him.

15:18.240 --> 15:18.960
He might see us coming a mile away.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.880
Don't get all hyped to hear from Al.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.040
Ben McKenzie from the whole cast, the OC.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.520
Dennis Quaid is doing some stuff right now

15:25.520 --> 15:27.120
for the I Can Only Imagine movie,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.120
which day one, day one, day one.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.760
And then that's it, end of list.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.480
Those are all the people.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.600
That's all the people you could identify.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
And that's like to say that the people

15:34.800 --> 15:36.160
that are gonna be here tonight

15:36.160 --> 15:40.400
are not famous and recognized or reconvenerable, you know?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.560
Sorry, was that recognized or reconvenable?

15:42.560 --> 15:43.280
Is that the word?

15:43.280 --> 15:43.840
Yeah.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.560
Okay.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.120
The problem is that I don't know who anybody is.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.200
That might make it easier.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.920
If when I go, who are you?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.200
What's your deal?

15:53.200 --> 15:53.760
I say, who are you?

15:53.760 --> 15:56.640
And then they say, I'm Tony Danza.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.440
Who are you?

15:57.440 --> 15:58.720
I'm Tony Danza.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.600
Let him get that far.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.720
Hear the name.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.320
And then say, wearing.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.120
Who are you wearing?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.480
You didn't let me finish mine.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.040
That's good.

16:05.040 --> 16:05.600
I like that.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.480
Fashion safe.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.960
If there's one thing I know about celebrities,

16:08.960 --> 16:11.920
it's that they just love being treated like normal people.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.880
And I don't know who normal people are.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.080
So why would I know who they are?

16:16.080 --> 16:18.000
So you just walk up and go, I'm Travis.

16:18.000 --> 16:18.640
Nice to meet you.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.400
This will be refreshing to you.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.360
I don't know who you are.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.240
I don't know who you are.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
And I'm going to treat you like a regular person.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.440
Now get out of my way.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.200
I'm trying to talk to Tony Danza.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.840
We're not going to talk to Tony Danza.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.560
Damn it.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.880
Are you worried that we'll try to establish that we're the boss?

16:33.440 --> 16:33.680
See?

16:33.680 --> 16:36.480
And that's why we can't talk to Tony Danza.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.280
Now we can't talk to Tony Danza.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.960
I'm going to tweet Tony Danza.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.440
And make sure-

16:39.440 --> 16:40.240
No, Lynn.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.280
Say talk to my friends.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.720
They're the irascible nephews of-

16:44.720 --> 16:45.200
DM him.

16:45.200 --> 16:45.840
Don't tweet him.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.160
I don't know that he follows me.

16:49.200 --> 16:49.920
Tony Danza.

16:49.920 --> 16:50.640
Get it, Lynn.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.960
You know Tony's got those open DMs.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.320
He wants to hear from everybody.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.800
Okay, so anyway.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.360
So this is-

16:57.360 --> 16:57.840
Love you, Tony.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.200
This is before.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.120
And then we're going to go try it.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.440
So the next thing you hear is going to be us.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.800
Try sounds so nice.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.440
Try sounds like we get a dry run with no judgment.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.160
Yeah, you might be about to hear 30 minutes of straight static.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.840
No, we'll edit that down.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.040
We probably wouldn't publish that.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.800
We're going to go do the damn thing.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.200
I'm excited because this feels like a radio version of your TV show.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.920
Where you're kind of being- you're a little out of your comfort zone.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.040
Mayor Steve Williams is the Tony Danza of Huntington.

17:25.040 --> 17:25.600
That is true.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.840
Throws down some sand.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.640
Does some soft shoe.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.320
That's what he says in his campaign commercials.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.120
All right, let's do it.

17:33.120 --> 17:33.600
Let's go.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.000
Let's go.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.960
We're at two bars of battery on this.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.240
We brought other batteries down, right?

17:38.240 --> 17:39.760
We brought other batteries.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
10 minutes before everybody comes.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.880
I assume all the celebrities will show up exactly on time.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.760
5.30 and probably not.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.720
5.30 on the dot.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.600
Totally here because everyone knows it's cool to be on time.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.320
We have an audience which I didn't expect and I don't prefer.

17:52.320 --> 17:57.760
I should have thought about that because there will be beloved famous people coming through.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.840
Everybody else is kind of standing up and they're doing stuff.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.120
Should we be over there?

18:01.120 --> 18:02.000
Are we in the wrong place?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.360
No, we're in the right place.

18:03.360 --> 18:03.920
This is good.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.480
The nervousness- just to check in because this is what everyone- the nervousness I'm feeling

18:08.480 --> 18:11.120
is unlike any kind of nervousness I've ever felt before.

18:11.120 --> 18:11.760
Yeah.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.760
Not like in a heightened- like it's not the most nervousness I've ever-

18:15.760 --> 18:18.480
but just this nervousness of I'm going to miss something.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.760
It's like Lovecraftian.

18:19.760 --> 18:24.720
It's like a sort of like a cosmic horror that I've never really seen the face of before.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.400
For me, it's a lot of times when you feel anxious before doing something like this,

18:28.400 --> 18:30.880
it's a fear of what if it goes bad?

18:30.880 --> 18:34.160
This is more like- it's like an expectation like it's going to go good,

18:34.160 --> 18:35.280
but what if it goes bad?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.280
This is more like how bad is this going to go?

18:37.280 --> 18:37.520
Yeah.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.040
How bad is this going to be?

18:39.040 --> 18:41.280
If a scary man came up to you and he was like,

18:41.280 --> 18:44.400
I've got a dire warning for you tonight, you're going to get scrambled.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.120
And it's like, well, I don't even know what that means, but it sounds horrible.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.360
Well, this is also- you can tell everyone around us has done this countless times.

18:51.360 --> 18:51.840
Yeah, yeah.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.880
They are old hands.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.160
They're not nervous about this at all.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.080
Would it be weird for us to ask what we're supposed to do?

18:58.080 --> 18:59.040
Let's see who's around.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.120
We can maybe ask the people from Margaritaville TV what we're supposed to do.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.040
They might be able to help us out.

19:05.040 --> 19:08.000
Now, do you think they've done a lot of live red carpet premieres?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.760
Or do you think this one for the Margaritaville musical is maybe among the first?

19:11.760 --> 19:13.200
Maybe this is their first one.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.440
I don't know if the Margaritaville is necessarily a news outlet

19:15.440 --> 19:17.280
that needs to cover every Broadway opening.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.120
Their coverage of the 2016 election was amazing.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.720
It's hard hitting, yeah.

19:22.720 --> 19:29.280
Okay, so there's several people who are sort of videotaping standups from the event.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.200
And we're going to be kind of in the background of those.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.120
They're going to edit us out, I assume.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.560
They're going to green screen that.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.440
Let's save our voices until people get here.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.200
We don't want to lose this solid gold.

19:39.200 --> 19:39.760
Yeah.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.440
Okay, so we're going to get right into the questions.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.640
Let's see here.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.880
We're here with Derek Jeter.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.960
Derek Jeter.

19:50.960 --> 19:51.920
So psyched.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.040
Yo, it's me, the Jeep.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.800
Hi, it's me, Derek Jeter.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.320
This one comes to us from Rose.

19:56.320 --> 20:01.120
I live in a place people go on vacation and I worry that I take the beach for granted.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.520
Do you have tips on appreciating it to the fullest

20:03.520 --> 20:06.320
without quitting my job to become one with the waves?

20:06.320 --> 20:07.440
That's from Rose.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.800
I mean, of course you do.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.680
You live at the beach.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.720
You take it for granted.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.000
Just like I take, I don't know, my bathroom for granted.

20:14.000 --> 20:14.640
It's always there.

20:14.640 --> 20:14.960
I live there.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.120
No one goes to the vacation at your bathroom.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.560
I have a very nice bathroom.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.280
I have a bidet.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.240
I've actually been there before.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.120
He does have a bidet.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.200
I'm not looking it up on a Travago though.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.320
I put it on Airbnb.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.040
Just the one room.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.400
It's on Travago.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.400
What do you think the Travago guy's bathroom looks like with him in it while he's using it?

20:33.040 --> 20:33.760
Give me a minute.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.640
Give me a minute.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.200
Give me a minute.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.200
Tell me what you think about the Travago guy in the bathroom.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.880
The first celeb that comes up here, we're going to say,

20:38.880 --> 20:41.840
what do you think it looks like when the Travago guy goes to the bathroom?

20:41.840 --> 20:42.880
This is a blood pact.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.680
I'm not joking.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.280
Walk off the set.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.320
If one of you doesn't say, hello, Mark.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.360
Hello, Marla Maples.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.880
What does the Travago guy look like when he uses the restroom?

20:52.880 --> 20:55.040
What does he look like when he uses the bathroom?

20:55.040 --> 20:55.200
Yeah.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.400
Welcome to the party, bud.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.840
No, but I mean, like, what do you know?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.360
He probably looks the same as he says.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.400
It was everybody else.

21:00.400 --> 21:00.560
All right.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.440
So that's one question.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.760
What if the first celebrity is the Travago guy?

21:04.880 --> 21:06.560
I think it's a little bit like this.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.040
I was worried we were not going to have enough to talk about,

21:09.040 --> 21:10.880
but now we got that one in the in the chamber.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.480
Oh, we're going.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.360
Oh, no, we're going.

21:13.360 --> 21:13.840
It's Mark.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.240
We're going.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.080
Mark.

21:16.080 --> 21:16.560
Oh, God.

21:17.600 --> 21:17.840
Okay.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.320
It's Mark Helgenberger from CSI.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.280
She's wearing black and white outfit.

21:23.280 --> 21:23.920
Nice.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.360
Good fashion coverage.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.080
This week.

21:26.080 --> 21:26.720
Oh, God.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.600
I'm freaking out.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.640
Travis, you got this.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.720
No, I just got so tense.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.360
You got this.

21:31.360 --> 21:31.920
Just relax.

21:32.480 --> 21:33.360
I'm just going to ask right here.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.840
Mark Helgenberger, how do you appreciate the beach?

21:37.840 --> 21:38.320
Okay.

21:38.320 --> 21:38.800
Let's start.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.280
Let's start.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.360
Let's not start off with the Travago bathroom question.

21:41.360 --> 21:41.600
Okay.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.640
We'll start with the Travago bathroom question.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.200
Don't open.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.720
We've got a few celebs under the belt.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.400
Just say like, hi, I'm Travis McElroy.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.000
I host an advice podcast.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.560
Hi, we're the McElroy brothers because I want her to know who I am, too.

21:50.560 --> 21:50.880
Okay.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.920
We host advice podcasts.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.960
And how do you what do you let's just ask beach activities.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.040
That's like, well, that's less weird.

21:57.040 --> 21:57.920
For beach advice?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.200
Favorite beach activities.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.680
It's going to be cool when she's actually here.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.120
We're going to be totally cool about it.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.400
Yeah, we're going to be like, oh, this you just mentioned like,

22:06.400 --> 22:07.840
hi, we're the McElroy brothers.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.960
This is our 20 second.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.480
We've done this a ton of times.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.400
In fact, I'm pretty bored.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.720
We've done a lot of these before and.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.400
This definitely isn't new.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.680
I have like tears welling up in my eyes and I'm not really sure why.

22:19.680 --> 22:20.080
Do you see?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.040
Are you crying?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.160
Yeah, I think a little bit.

22:22.160 --> 22:22.800
I don't know why.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.040
This is a self-engineered hell.

22:25.040 --> 22:25.440
Yeah.

22:25.440 --> 22:25.920
I've put myself.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.880
This is like salt, but specifically for the McElroy brothers.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.720
Yeah, we have put ourselves into hell.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.240
Well, you have to talk to say that that loud.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.880
Just tell her who we are first, because yes, it's going to be weird.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.320
If she's like, and don't mention the Trivago guys bathroom.

22:46.240 --> 22:46.800
We got this.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.280
We're good.

22:47.280 --> 22:47.920
Oh, okay.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.640
We're okay.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.520
Probably feels all right.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.800
So, okay.

22:50.800 --> 22:54.400
So just swing in a day still happen.

22:54.400 --> 22:54.960
Okay.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.640
So we've okay.

22:56.640 --> 22:56.960
Okay.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.400
Bit of a whiff on that one.

22:58.400 --> 22:58.900
Okay.

23:00.240 --> 23:00.960
Okay, hold on.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.640
Just going to relax and we'll talk casually and maybe.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.400
So I think the problem there is that we were talking about how this was our hell.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.640
Like really loud.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.800
I don't think she's coming back over.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.280
Yeah.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.040
No, I think the red carpet's sort of a one-way affair.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.240
Cause then okay.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.680
So let's talk about this.

23:17.680 --> 23:17.920
Okay.

23:17.920 --> 23:18.560
So what happened?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.000
Wait, no, wait, hold on.

23:20.000 --> 23:20.320
Okay.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.720
So Mark Helgenberger just walked right past us.

23:22.720 --> 23:22.960
Yeah.

23:22.960 --> 23:23.840
As well she should.

23:23.840 --> 23:24.480
As well she should.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.440
I don't follow her for that.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.240
It's totally cool.

23:26.240 --> 23:26.640
Okay.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.000
I think we're going to have another run at this.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.320
I'm starting to readjust my expectations a bit.

23:30.320 --> 23:30.560
Yeah.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.960
We need to at least talk to one person on this red carpet.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.640
At least one person should talk to us.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.400
Yeah, we'll get, listen.

23:36.400 --> 23:40.960
That's Travis and I guarantee by the end of this hour, we'll have at least one person.

23:40.960 --> 23:44.560
Should we have tried to like vibe a little bit more?

23:44.560 --> 23:48.000
Like not in a sexual way, but like put the vibe out.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.920
We weren't like, we were maybe turned in facing each other and not like.

23:51.920 --> 23:52.160
Okay.

23:53.440 --> 23:53.760
Maybe.

23:54.480 --> 23:54.720
Okay.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.760
So second whiff.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.640
Her second whiff.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.320
Second whiff.

23:58.320 --> 24:01.520
Looks like Terry Collins, former New York's Met manager.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.280
We're in a gray suit.

24:03.280 --> 24:03.600
Okay.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.400
And get that one.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.920
That was a whiff on our part.

24:07.920 --> 24:08.720
Now, okay.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.200
And this one.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.240
Hold on, wait, stop.

24:10.240 --> 24:10.960
Hold on, wait.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.080
Checkered jacket, gray pants.

24:12.080 --> 24:12.720
What?

24:12.720 --> 24:15.280
Checkered jacket, gray pants, silver watch, and gray shoes.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.200
You have to say what everyone's wearing.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.240
This is red carpet.

24:18.240 --> 24:18.480
Okay.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.120
Justin, there's someone over here getting their photo taken.

24:21.120 --> 24:21.680
Who is it?

24:21.680 --> 24:22.240
Can you spot them?

24:22.240 --> 24:22.480
Okay.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.160
Hello.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.360
Hello, we have a sheet that has pictures of everybody.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.320
There's like 80 people.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.120
That's going to be here.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.680
We'll just play it cool.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.800
Well, we do need to know who they are.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.720
We do need to know who they are, but I don't see them.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.160
Okay.

24:38.160 --> 24:38.880
So Marg.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.520
It's going past us a second time.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.560
We're going to get another run at this.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.520
Marg is back.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.200
She's talking to SiriusXM.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.320
This is going to be fine.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.880
Do I need to step over the rope?

24:48.880 --> 24:49.920
Is that what people are doing?

24:49.920 --> 24:51.360
Is stepping over the rope?

24:51.360 --> 24:53.120
I'm up against my one weakness.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.480
Rules and regulations.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.080
We might have the distinct pleasure of being passed over three times.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.760
We might need to enlist the help of somebody like more adult.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.040
Is there an adult here?

25:04.000 --> 25:04.400
Okay.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.560
So the Mets guy came back.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.720
Is that two?

25:08.720 --> 25:09.360
Oh, no.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.320
Terry Collins came back.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.200
All right.

25:11.200 --> 25:11.760
I don't...

25:11.760 --> 25:14.560
We'll just ask Terry Collins about the scariest sea creature.

25:14.560 --> 25:14.800
Yeah.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.320
It's going to be fun.

25:16.320 --> 25:20.240
They were actually, if I'm going to be honest, a little relieved when they just walked past us.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.560
Like, he's like a sports gentleman.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.000
Like, I don't have as much...

25:24.000 --> 25:26.800
What sea creature would you most want to play baseball with?

25:26.800 --> 25:28.960
No, let's just ask him what he likes to do on vacation.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.080
Again, guys, softball.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.760
Then we go scary sea creature.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.680
Then we get to like close out with the Trivago guy.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.840
So we start with what do you like to do on vacation?

25:35.840 --> 25:38.160
We are really building this plane as we're flying.

25:38.160 --> 25:38.720
It's fine.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.360
I need you to not stand on the side.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.000
Okay.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.400
What?

25:42.400 --> 25:43.440
Quick family meeting.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.640
I need you to not stand on the other side of the ropes yelling,

25:46.640 --> 25:52.080
this is fine or this is hell, while making a grim mask of death with your face.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.440
Can you stop doing that for me?

25:53.440 --> 25:55.840
Does it just kind of look like I've been doing this for a while?

25:55.840 --> 25:56.000
Yeah.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.920
You get more flies with honey than vinegar.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.600
It's not even vinegar.

26:00.960 --> 26:05.440
You get more flies offering them honey than making them watch you eat vinegar.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.600
I get more flies with honey than making them think I stink like vinegar.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.200
They should avoid the vinegar boy.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.160
It's been eight minutes.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.840
That's pretty good.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.520
For eight minutes in, I'm feeling very good.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.600
You got some solid content so far.

26:19.600 --> 26:19.840
Yeah.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.360
Yeah, not a lot of, not a lot of silhouette.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.800
I think they're all going to dump.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.840
They're dumping in, I think.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.320
But maybe they're just making the, making the runs.

26:28.320 --> 26:28.960
This is good.

26:28.960 --> 26:29.600
This is fine.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.120
Listen, I'm actually relaxing now.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.480
You know, I'm relaxing because I don't think anybody's going to talk to us.

26:34.480 --> 26:34.800
Yeah.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.120
Right.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.360
I'm not going to put it on the spot at all.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.080
Oh, here we go.

26:38.080 --> 26:38.560
Okay.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.120
I've got this.

26:39.120 --> 26:39.360
Okay.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.240
You got this, Travis.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.120
I believe in you.

26:41.120 --> 26:41.760
Hi.

26:41.760 --> 26:42.080
Nope.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.360
Panic locked up.

26:43.360 --> 26:43.920
You're locked up.

26:43.920 --> 26:52.000
So, for the folks at home, that was a third walk by Mark Helgenberger from-

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And listen, the window was there.

26:54.000 --> 26:54.640
The window was there.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.360
She was probably four inches from Travis.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.200
And I didn't, I opened my mouth.

26:59.200 --> 27:05.440
The amount of time that passed between, I've got this too, I froze up was quite short.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.400
Okay, I'm going to get Terry though.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.520
What's Terry's last name?

27:07.520 --> 27:08.020
Collins.

27:08.640 --> 27:09.280
Mr. Collins.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.080
Mr. Collins.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.400
Former, former manager of Communer Fats.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.320
This one's going to, just a real quick one, because I'm real nervous about this guy.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.040
I'm double intimidated because he's like famous and sports.

27:19.040 --> 27:19.200
Yeah.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.400
So, it's like two things that I'm not great with.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.240
What if he throws a ball at you like super hard?

27:22.800 --> 27:25.040
What if he sees something wrong, but he can mold?

27:25.040 --> 27:25.540
Yeah.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.000
You catch it really cool.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.360
Kids, you got the goods, money ball.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.000
Look, I can see the group on your microphone.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.800
You seem like a-

27:33.360 --> 27:34.400
Joke up a little bit.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.600
What's really fun is every so often I make eye contact with people in the crowd behind us,

27:37.600 --> 27:39.840
and they're looking at me like, why are you there?

27:39.840 --> 27:41.200
And I'm also thinking.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.800
And you're looking at them like, why am I here?

27:43.440 --> 27:44.480
Get me out of here.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.520
We want to make people feel like we're not pranking them, because we're not.

27:47.520 --> 27:48.480
That's not our goal here.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.200
But if we keep yelling about sea creatures, people are going to think we're going to like-

27:51.200 --> 27:52.640
It's like a regular thing that we're doing.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.800
Just have people talk about sea creatures, you know?

27:55.680 --> 27:56.180
Okay.

27:56.960 --> 27:57.460
Okay.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.280
Now, when you are flipping feverishly through the tip sheet and they see that,

28:03.280 --> 28:05.440
that's probably going to hurt their feelings a bit, so.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.200
Justin, faster.

28:07.200 --> 28:07.760
Identify.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.920
I don't know.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.760
I don't know. I'm dizzy.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.240
I'm getting dizzy.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.760
It's not Tony Danza.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.240
I feel like we're playing the most high stakes game of Guess Who?

28:18.880 --> 28:19.040
Maybe.

28:19.040 --> 28:19.760
Yeah, I know.

28:19.760 --> 28:23.120
I mean, the good news is if we keep doing things exactly as we've been doing them,

28:23.120 --> 28:24.080
it's not going to be an-

28:24.080 --> 28:25.760
It's going to be a moot point.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.200
Okay, just to check in.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.240
What's the score so far?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.240
The score is zero.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.880
We're at 12 minutes, 26 seconds on the recording.

28:32.880 --> 28:33.520
How long?

28:33.520 --> 28:34.640
1226.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.840
So if I can make eye contact with Mark Hellenberger down at the other end,

28:37.840 --> 28:40.000
and she'll feel the connection and come back.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.480
So Mark may come back.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.520
And now at this, at the point I'm at,

28:45.520 --> 28:48.080
I don't actually want to talk to anybody but Mark Hellenberger now.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.200
I feel like so jilted.

28:49.920 --> 28:53.760
Well, it's because she's damned it all up in our minds where we can't,

28:53.760 --> 28:55.200
sorry, I can't with you.

28:55.200 --> 28:55.440
Yeah.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.320
I'm still, I've still got all the questions waiting.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.040
She is loading her own stock in our minds.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.840
Okay, that guy just asked, where is your Margaritaville?

29:01.840 --> 29:02.480
That's very good.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.400
But we were going to ask that though.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.920
No, stay turned.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.760
I'm trying to look at the list of people that are here.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.360
Okay, so Justin is now looking at the tip sheet.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.400
Covertly.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.240
Covertly, using my back as a sort of shield.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.680
That was Steve Croft earlier.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.360
Steve Croft.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.280
Damn, just missed it.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.720
Tim Federal?

29:24.160 --> 29:25.600
Yeah, Tim Federal?

29:25.600 --> 29:26.100
Tim?

29:27.120 --> 29:27.840
Tim Federal?

29:31.200 --> 29:31.920
Tim.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.640
Show me the paper, you child.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.080
No, it's okay.

29:36.080 --> 29:36.720
It's okay.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.440
I, okay.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.120
Okay.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.080
Wins and losses.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.240
One, loss.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.720
He did walk right past this.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.000
Win.

29:46.000 --> 29:46.960
His name was Tim.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.280
Big win.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.080
Big W.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.120
I did invite him and I did recognize him from the tip sheet.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.960
Let's take a quick promotional break to talk about Escape to Margaritaville.

29:56.960 --> 29:57.840
It's more than a musical.

29:57.840 --> 29:58.880
It's a way of life.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.160
You've seen it now.

30:00.160 --> 30:00.800
Just the once?

30:00.800 --> 30:01.280
Just the once.

30:01.280 --> 30:01.840
Tonight the twice.

30:01.840 --> 30:06.160
Tonight is the second time it is opening.

30:06.160 --> 30:10.240
Tonight here at the Marquee Theater and right in the middle of Times Square.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.200
It's a great show.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.560
Come out and see it.

30:12.560 --> 30:19.360
Escape to MargaritavilleMusical.com and you can get tickets and plan your escape today.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.960
That's a book by Greg Garcia and Michael Malley who you may remember from

30:24.080 --> 30:24.960
My Name is Earl.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.000
A lot of great shows like that.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.920
Musical lyrics of course by Jimmy Buffett and you should come see the show.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.400
Is that maybe Matt Doyle?

30:32.400 --> 30:33.680
Nobody looks like they're pictures.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.840
Matt Doyle maybe?

30:37.520 --> 30:38.400
Maybe Matt Doyle?

30:39.200 --> 30:44.080
Say his name like 14 more times and then maybe it'll just become true.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.000
I'm thinking we need to be on the other side of the rope.

30:46.800 --> 30:47.600
You think that would be...

30:48.240 --> 30:50.800
So here's, let's set up the scene for our folks at home because let's remember that

30:50.800 --> 30:52.240
we're recording an episode of a podcast.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.240
Travis, okay Travis is going across the rope.

30:54.240 --> 30:54.800
Yes, this is the right move.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.080
Okay, there's a rope and Travis is going on the other side of it.

30:56.080 --> 30:56.800
This is the right move.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.640
You've got to be a more of a presence.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.920
We're kind of this producers.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.680
We're his supervising producers.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.560
Okay, Travis is across the road that is protecting us from the beautiful people.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.120
So terrified.

31:05.120 --> 31:05.760
Travis is very...

31:05.760 --> 31:08.080
All right, now listen from this point forward, we can't talk about...

31:08.080 --> 31:09.040
Nobody's going to yell at you.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.080
Everybody's across the rope.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.680
Now we're across the rope too.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.320
Yeah, all right.

31:12.320 --> 31:12.800
Travis is...

31:12.800 --> 31:13.680
Now he looks like it.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.200
Now he looks like he's doing interviews.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.000
Miss Hughes?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.520
Miss Hughes, right?

31:17.520 --> 31:18.640
Miss Hughes?

31:18.640 --> 31:18.880
Yes.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.200
Maybe don't mention we do a podcast.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.240
Now that I think about it.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.440
Oh no, okay.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.960
There's so many different iterations of how I'm going to introduce myself in my head.

31:26.960 --> 31:27.600
Miss Hughes.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.360
No, I think I don't actually know.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.520
I'm not 100% certain on the name.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.080
Don't.

31:32.080 --> 31:32.400
Yes.

31:32.400 --> 31:32.800
Okay.

31:32.800 --> 31:33.120
Yes.

31:33.120 --> 31:33.600
Yes.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.080
Yes.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.280
Okay, I'm going to give this.

31:35.280 --> 31:35.680
Travis.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.200
Travis.

31:37.200 --> 31:37.520
It's okay.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.640
Can we ask you some quick questions?

31:39.440 --> 31:39.920
Hi.

31:39.920 --> 31:40.400
How's it going?

31:40.400 --> 31:41.040
Hello.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.080
We do an advice podcast.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.360
Oh, you can just go ahead.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.400
It's a microphone.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.480
We've never done this before.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.920
We're recording a podcast.

31:47.920 --> 31:48.960
Very nervous is the first one.

31:48.960 --> 31:51.280
We do an advice podcast called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.040
We were wondering what advice you would give to our listeners as far as like good activities

31:55.040 --> 31:56.240
to do on vacation.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.600
Getting away to Margaritaville.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.160
Oh, I love this podcast question, actually.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.120
So I definitely, I'm a huge hiker.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.320
I love to go hiking.

32:04.320 --> 32:08.400
And I think if you're on vacay, the best way to start the day is by getting up and going

32:08.400 --> 32:10.800
for like a little exercise, a little walk.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.400
And that way, you're burning off the hangover from the night before.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.200
I love that.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.800
You work hard and you play hard.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.760
But it's not working.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.160
You're out.

32:18.160 --> 32:18.800
You're engaging.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.160
You're being good to your body.

32:20.160 --> 32:20.720
Yeah.

32:20.720 --> 32:21.760
So you're not doing anything, too.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.440
That is a novel concept for the three of us.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
This is the best advice we've actually ever had.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.240
A healthier.

32:26.240 --> 32:26.480
Yeah.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.120
That's good.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.320
But you've got to be with people.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.760
Otherwise, it feels like punishment.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.800
It feels like work, right?

32:30.800 --> 32:33.040
But if you're with people, then it's just fun.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.600
And if you're alone, you also have to be worried about bears.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.920
But with people, you're less likely to get attacked by bears.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.960
Avoid bears.

32:38.960 --> 32:43.920
Speaking of, our second question is, what sea creatures do you think are most dangerous?

32:43.920 --> 32:44.240
This is a-

32:44.240 --> 32:46.960
I mean, I'm wearing a mermaid dress, so I think mermaids, right?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.000
Mermaids can be fairly terrifying.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.280
Wow, that's a really good point.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.080
They are scary, actually.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.760
That's not an obvious choice.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.760
They'll sting you into a trance.

32:53.760 --> 32:54.960
You'll walk right in the water.

32:54.960 --> 32:55.600
Exactly.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.320
I love it.

32:56.320 --> 32:56.720
Excellent.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.520
Thank you very much.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.160
Thanks so much.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.040
What's your podcast called?

32:59.040 --> 33:00.560
It's called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.520
Oh, duh.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.520
Like it's written on the sign.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.680
Jimmy Buffett was on our show, and we asked if we could come do this.

33:05.680 --> 33:08.080
And we didn't really think through the practicalities of actually doing it.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.440
A podcast on a red carpet.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.280
Yeah, this is not really our milieu.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.240
But we're hanging in there.

33:12.240 --> 33:12.960
But you're nailing it.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.840
Thank you.

33:13.840 --> 33:17.360
A lot of people walked past us before you stopped.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.160
So this is kind of the first-

33:18.160 --> 33:18.640
Thank you.

33:18.640 --> 33:19.600
Thank you for stopping.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.760
Hopefully, I will start a trend for you.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.160
Thank you.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.040
I appreciate that.

33:23.040 --> 33:23.600
Thank you very much.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.440
I read the word that we're regular, normal people.

33:25.440 --> 33:25.920
I love it.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.720
Thank you.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.120
Real people.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.160
Should I make an announcement?

33:28.160 --> 33:29.760
Yeah, just start yelling at me.

33:29.760 --> 33:30.400
No announcements.

33:30.400 --> 33:30.960
Thank you.

33:30.960 --> 33:31.440
Thank you.

33:31.440 --> 33:31.680
All right.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.400
That's one.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.120
That was one.

33:33.120 --> 33:33.520
That's one.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.240
That was so good.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.320
Travis, do you want to come back on the other side of the road for a minute?

33:36.320 --> 33:37.360
I need your cover.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.560
I need Justin getting my back.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.240
Would you say that is Matt Doyle?

33:42.880 --> 33:43.360
What?

33:43.360 --> 33:44.480
Say it's Matt Doyle.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.600
Does that feel like Matt Doyle?

33:46.320 --> 33:47.520
You've got to show me the paper.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.000
I can't tell you.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.280
I heard Justin say it.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.560
So Matt Doyle right here.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.360
Is that Matt Doyle?

33:51.360 --> 33:53.280
Crowds are really filling up here.

33:53.280 --> 33:57.040
If we can't do a positive identification, yeah, we need a clear match.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.640
Justin is now bent over.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.640
I think that was a lot on him.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.920
You got to talk in your microphone.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.640
I dropped my badge.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.400
And I don't know.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.360
I was just bending over because I dropped something important.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.120
We can't, if we're not 100% positive of ID, we can't do an interview, Travis.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.120
Let's move on to our second question.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.640
Yeah, let's hear it.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.480
My fiance wants us to go to Italy for our honeymoon.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.720
Italy sounds great, but I'd also like to buy a house.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.200
So I want to rent a cabin up north and put the rest toward mortgage.

34:25.200 --> 34:28.320
Where can we go that both feels like a honeymoon rather than a family vacation,

34:28.320 --> 34:31.040
but also doesn't completely drain our savings?

34:31.040 --> 34:32.240
Almost married in Ann Arbor.

34:32.240 --> 34:34.800
So like romantic vacation destinations.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.800
Something romantic, but cheap.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.840
A romantic vacation destination on a budget.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.200
Not costly for not for unwealthy folks.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.480
Justin, how are you doing?

34:44.480 --> 34:45.920
I'm doing very well.

34:45.920 --> 34:50.320
The time is 5 57, which by my watch means we're halfway.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.440
Halfway through the star-studded cavalcade.

34:53.440 --> 34:56.320
We got one person to be on our show.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.240
Which is one more than I was starting to think we'd get.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.640
Marg will probably get back here soon.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.880
When the word gets out.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.880
When the word gets out about Marg Helgenberger.

35:06.000 --> 35:06.960
Who is that lady?

35:06.960 --> 35:08.480
Oh, that lady is so good.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.880
Brenda, Brenda Maccaro?

35:10.880 --> 35:11.600
I don't think so.

35:12.240 --> 35:12.720
Shit.

35:12.720 --> 35:13.440
I don't know then.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.520
If it's not fucking Brenda Maccaro, I don't know who it is.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.240
What if we, can I tell you guys an idea I just have?

35:20.240 --> 35:22.560
What if we just put this one up completely unedited?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.160
What if we just threw this one up on the channel?

35:26.160 --> 35:29.600
Okay, there's a very handsome guy who I do not know his identity.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.320
But he's so handsome.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.120
But he's so handsome.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.640
He's gotta be somebody.

35:32.640 --> 35:33.680
Is that Matt DeWill?

35:34.400 --> 35:37.200
I swear to God if I hear you say this name one more time.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.320
This guy's so handsome.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.680
I just don't, I'm too nervous to talk to him.

35:39.680 --> 35:39.920
Is that handsome?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.840
Can I just approach him as handsome guy?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.440
No, I wouldn't do that at all.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.200
Are you kidding me?

35:45.200 --> 35:46.240
Maybe he's a date.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.920
Some people are people's dates.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.280
And they're not all attention.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.320
And they're just beautiful.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.040
So we shouldn't talk to either of these people

35:53.040 --> 35:55.280
because we cannot be clear of what we're doing.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.400
We didn't talk about that question.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.000
I ain't scared anymore, Justin.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.120
What's a romantic vacation destination?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.160
You know what's nice?

36:02.160 --> 36:02.720
What's that?

36:02.720 --> 36:03.840
If you go to a lake.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.760
We've been called out.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.880
We've been called out.

36:10.880 --> 36:11.600
We've been caught.

36:11.600 --> 36:17.600
I literally don't know how to.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.520
We've been called out for talking into our microphones.

36:19.520 --> 36:22.480
Someone yelled at us for talking into our microphones.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.040
Have you ever seen people who stood together

36:27.600 --> 36:32.320
who are just inches away from each other talking to each other on mics?

36:32.880 --> 36:34.560
Don't say I didn't hit it on the nail.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.120
No, you did.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.480
This is our first red carpet event.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.440
We're very nervous.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.000
I don't know how to do any of this.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.640
This is our first red carpet event.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.920
We do an advice podcast.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.680
We're very vulnerable right now.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.280
Yeah, we're very vulnerable.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.480
We're so nervous.

36:50.480 --> 36:51.840
Is this a radio show?

36:51.840 --> 36:53.280
Yeah, it's a podcast.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.000
It's an advice.

36:54.000 --> 36:54.800
Yeah, we're doing it.

36:54.800 --> 36:55.840
And we do advice.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.600
This is my friend Levi Bradley.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.100
Hi, Levi.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.800
That's a great question.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.760
That's actually the only question.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.600
We actually also don't know the answer.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.720
Jimmy Buffett was on our show and he thought it'd be fun if we came and did this.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.760
I asked for this cover.

37:07.760 --> 37:08.640
They didn't have it.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.240
Oh, I had to bring it into the place.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.880
Our question is romantic vacation destinations.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.680
Oh, that's great.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.240
You have any suggestions for our listeners?

37:18.240 --> 37:20.640
Yes, I would go to Bali, Indonesia.

37:23.360 --> 37:28.240
Try to overcome the McDonald's and the Kali Starbucks shop.

37:29.120 --> 37:32.240
Pass by that and get into their culture.

37:32.240 --> 37:32.560
Okay.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.520
But it is a beautiful...

37:33.520 --> 37:34.160
Are you guys serious?

37:34.160 --> 37:34.880
Is it a bad McDonald's?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.200
Yeah, somebody asked when you should go.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.960
And the Galapagos.

37:38.960 --> 37:39.440
Okay.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.960
I like all the animals there.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.560
They're very different.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.960
You look so cute with these mics.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.840
Well, thank you.

37:46.880 --> 37:47.760
Thank you so much.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.040
Thank you.

37:49.040 --> 37:49.840
Thank you very much.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.000
We'll do your podcast any day.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.400
Thank you, thank you very much.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.960
All right, so we lined up a second spot there.

37:56.960 --> 37:57.280
Okay.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.480
It's the best.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.440
We're doing great.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.800
So that went super good.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.400
That went so good.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.480
There's a whole family of handsome people.

38:04.480 --> 38:04.720
Okay.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.080
I don't want to...

38:06.080 --> 38:07.120
This is too many people.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.120
This is overwhelming.

38:09.120 --> 38:09.840
It's too many.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.480
Two people walked up that time and I couldn't handle it.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.320
Does one of the pictures have a whole family on it?

38:16.720 --> 38:18.480
Just squeezed into one picture.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.880
Okay, so just to explain, Justin has folded the tip sheet,

38:20.880 --> 38:23.760
which has the faces of all of the folks walking the red carpet

38:23.760 --> 38:26.880
and their names into an origami swan,

38:26.880 --> 38:29.920
making it nearly impossible to read at speed

38:30.480 --> 38:32.320
that people are coming down the blue.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.360
It's also a blue carpet.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.560
Have we talked about that?

38:34.560 --> 38:34.880
Oh, yeah.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.760
The carpet is blue.

38:35.760 --> 38:39.280
I think because, give me if I'm reaching too far here,

38:39.280 --> 38:40.480
like the ocean.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.760
I think it's supposed to be...

38:41.760 --> 38:43.040
Wait, who did you just ask?

38:43.040 --> 38:43.760
The camera guy.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.240
Oh, I didn't...

38:44.240 --> 38:45.200
The camera guy.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.160
Oh, yeah, the zoom?

38:46.160 --> 38:47.120
It's a dope mic.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.160
Great mic, sir.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.840
So I don't know who that is in all the tip sheet.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.960
We just got to keep pressing through.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.800
Romantic destinations for a vacation spot.

38:54.800 --> 38:59.680
Maybe spend some time, stay home, get to know each other better.

38:59.680 --> 39:00.240
That's okay.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.840
Go to the lake.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.320
Here's what I'm going to say.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.360
What if you just spend some time with your partner,

39:05.360 --> 39:06.320
making love?

39:06.320 --> 39:07.120
Oh, making love.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.160
That's so good, Travis.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.680
I have one, but you go to Bali, but you do go to the McDonald's.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.920
And you do go to the Starbucks.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.520
Go to McDonald's at Bali.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.600
The McDonald's at Bali is so wack.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.800
They have the best burgers.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.480
Hi, brothers.

39:20.480 --> 39:21.200
I'm getting...

39:21.200 --> 39:22.400
I shouldn't be checking my phone.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.160
It does make you look super bored.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.240
It doesn't make you look like you're not really paying attention.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.840
This is where I'm getting the questions from, though.

39:28.480 --> 39:29.920
This is a beautiful family.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.760
You can't keep saying that.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.560
So I just want to get the next question going because we answered that one.

39:36.560 --> 39:40.240
One of the benefits of my job is having a fair amount of vacation time.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.400
I'm of the opinion it's best to take a couple of days here and there,

39:43.600 --> 39:44.560
saving off corporate burnout.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.400
Short vacation or long vacation?

39:46.400 --> 39:47.520
Short vacation or long vacation.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.240
That's from Ezra.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.080
Short vacation or long vacation?

39:50.080 --> 39:52.400
I do like this because Ezra specifically says like,

39:52.400 --> 39:55.440
take one day off every so often so you get a three-day weekend

39:55.440 --> 39:57.760
or save it up and do like two weeks off.

39:57.760 --> 39:58.080
Yeah.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.280
I almost always prefer the big one.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.840
Because I don't work very hard usually.

40:04.400 --> 40:04.960
And so every day is kind of a vacation.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.880
So you really have to take that many days to even notice...

40:06.880 --> 40:07.920
To even feel it.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.920
I got to take a pretty big dose of PTO there.

40:11.920 --> 40:15.440
I would say that it really depends on how close you live to dope shit.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.160
Because if you could take three-day weekends and go do awesome stuff,

40:18.160 --> 40:21.520
but if you get yourself an extra day and then you don't have anything to do with it.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.880
This is going so good.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.000
It's 6.04.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.760
Still time for lots of other people to be on our show.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.720
And now we're in our groove.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.320
The heat's picking up now, you know what I mean?

40:28.320 --> 40:29.360
I'm not nervous anymore.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.240
I'm not nervous anymore.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.280
I came back around the other side.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.480
I'm just a professional doing a job.

40:32.480 --> 40:35.120
I'm worried that we're going to get too overconfident

40:35.120 --> 40:37.280
and that'll make us make big mistakes.

40:37.280 --> 40:37.760
Yes.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.440
I don't know what the fuck just happened.

40:40.480 --> 40:47.120
And that is both literal and sort of like emphasizing the wildness of whatever you just

40:47.120 --> 40:47.440
heard.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.960
I don't know where this break's going to be,

40:48.960 --> 40:55.920
but I bet it was after something just really either skin-crawlingly awkward or delightful.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.480
That was kind of where I was hovering between.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.480
It might be skin-crawlingly delightful.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.120
I don't know.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.680
Maybe like a Nightmare Before Christmas kind of vibe.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.960
This is terrifying, but man, I'm really enjoying myself.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.640
Folks, hey, become a member of the Max Fun Network.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.880
Jeez, it would be so cool.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.920
Because if you do it, you can help us meet our goal.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.360
25,000 new and upgrading members.

41:17.360 --> 41:18.800
If you're already a member, thank you so much.

41:18.800 --> 41:23.360
If you've been consuming more content from the network lately,

41:23.360 --> 41:26.880
maybe think about upping your donation because that'll make you eligible for all the great

41:26.880 --> 41:29.200
pledge gifts that we're going to tell you about right now.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.800
Travis, $5, go.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.760
Well, Griffin, that's a great question.

41:33.760 --> 41:38.880
At $5, you are going to get a exclusive bonus content that we talked about before.

41:38.880 --> 41:43.360
You've got, listen, we have been doing Max Fun Drive since 2011.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.720
So there is seven years of bonus content.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.800
Oh, this is our eighth year.

41:48.800 --> 41:49.760
This is our eighth year, my bud.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.960
This is our eighth year.

41:50.960 --> 41:55.520
Eight years, about 11 different things, including like some videos we did where we're like riffing

41:55.520 --> 41:57.840
over old educational shorts.

41:58.720 --> 42:03.360
But not only that, you're also going to get access to all of the Just Jon Hodgman bonus

42:03.360 --> 42:09.600
content, all of the Adventure Zone bonus content, all of the wonderful bonus content,

42:09.600 --> 42:11.760
all of the Sawbones bonus.

42:11.760 --> 42:15.040
Like, it's hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.000
It's incredible.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.400
Justin, $10 a month, go.

42:18.400 --> 42:24.480
$10 a month, you're going to get a drive exclusive enamel pen designed by Megan Lynn Cott.

42:24.480 --> 42:28.560
You pick your favorite, and you're going to get a cool pen.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.400
The one for this year emphasizes our theme of Stronger Together for Collaborate 18.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.200
And it is a very cool looking pen.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.280
And you also get a Max Fun membership card.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.200
And that is for $10 a month, plus all the exclusive bonus content.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.760
Yeah, on each level, you get everything up to that level.

42:43.760 --> 42:50.800
So at $20 a month, there's a Max Fun family cookbook with recipes from Max Fun hosts,

42:50.800 --> 42:56.000
contains dozens of recipes from cocktails to dessert, and you get a set of handsome

42:56.000 --> 43:02.880
space-themed cookie cutters, plus the pen designed by Megan Lynn Cott, plus the bonus

43:02.880 --> 43:03.600
content.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.160
That is a great gift.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.520
There's a recipe from our...

43:06.080 --> 43:10.000
I sent in our mom's recipe for chest bars is up in there.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.320
Did you guys put anything in?

43:12.320 --> 43:14.640
I think that's the the McElroy contribution.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.080
That's our contribution.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.440
Man, you guys are lazy, huh?

43:17.440 --> 43:18.000
Yeah, sure.

43:18.000 --> 43:18.560
So there's...

43:18.560 --> 43:19.760
I guess I'm the only team player here.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.680
Yeah, I guess I'm just so busy generating hours and hours of wonderful content for our

43:23.680 --> 43:24.240
listeners.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.880
Well, I'm the one actually making the wonderful content.

43:26.880 --> 43:27.280
And that's a fun thing I can say.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.520
No, I'm making a lowercase w.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.480
If you want to step it up, we got a $35 a month level.

43:32.480 --> 43:36.240
So you listen to a ton of shows and you want to support the whole network, $35 a month

43:36.240 --> 43:40.640
will get you a one liter juice carafe, beautifully and permanently engraved with the Max Fun

43:40.640 --> 43:41.440
rocket logo.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.120
It's not just for juice, though.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.400
And it says that in the copy.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.560
And I think you're smart enough to piece that together.

43:46.560 --> 43:49.600
But the copy thinks maybe you need some help with it.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.800
But it's great for tastefully displaying all your beverages.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.400
And you get the cookbook.

43:54.400 --> 43:55.760
You get the cookie cutters.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.640
You get the pen.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.080
You get the bonus content.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.960
And you help support us a whole bunch and we appreciate it.

44:00.960 --> 44:01.280
And then-

44:01.280 --> 44:02.240
Now we should be clear.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.280
Here's the thing.

44:03.280 --> 44:07.040
The carafe is not just for juice, but strangely the cookie cutters are.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.560
Yeah, you got to pour juice in the cookie cutters.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.360
Can't explain it.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.200
But that maybe wasn't as self-explanatory.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.560
So just wanted to make that clear.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.560
There's higher levels you can go donate at.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.400
And if you want to do that, like, thank you.

44:16.400 --> 44:21.680
But these levels, honestly, they're sort of the bread and butter of our network.

44:21.680 --> 44:25.520
And that's what a lot of people can afford to do for content that they like.

44:25.520 --> 44:26.800
And man, that just-

44:26.800 --> 44:28.160
It's just the best, y'all.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.160
Like, it really means a lot to us.

44:30.160 --> 44:36.880
And we so appreciate you going to maximumfund.org forward slash donate and getting on board.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.560
These gifts are to make it clear for new and upgrading members.

44:40.560 --> 44:43.840
So like, if you're at five bucks a month right now, you upgrade to $10 a month.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.240
You're going to get the pen and the bonus content, obviously.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.120
And so on.

44:47.120 --> 44:50.000
So, but if you can hop on at 35.

44:50.000 --> 44:50.800
Wow, 35.

44:50.800 --> 44:51.840
That's so flattering.

44:51.840 --> 44:52.160
Thank you.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.320
20, 10, 5.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.840
Anything you can give, honestly, means the world.

44:55.840 --> 44:56.800
It only takes a couple minutes.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.640
Go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.560
Choose the membership level that's right for you.

45:01.600 --> 45:05.200
And then you'll choose which max fund shows you listen to.

45:05.200 --> 45:08.320
And just like that, you are a member.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.120
And then you've helped us.

45:11.120 --> 45:11.760
You've helped us.

45:11.760 --> 45:15.200
Listen, when we started doing this, we weren't making any money off of it.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.520
And we were doing it just as a goofy goof.

45:17.520 --> 45:19.200
And didn't think anything was ever coming of it.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.200
And now it's turned into a career.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.560
This is Travis's whole job right now.

45:24.560 --> 45:29.440
Dad got to retire from the radio station last year.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.640
And just do this full time.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.280
Because the donations you all have brought in for the Adventure Zone.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.400
Like, this has made it.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.920
He probably would have retired anyway.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.200
He's very old.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.000
He's so old.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.080
Can't press the buttons on the switchboard anymore.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.240
Old, old fingers and tired old bones.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.680
And they're old, hollow bones.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.160
Withered fingers, no muscle, no skin.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.760
Just skeleton bones down there.

45:47.760 --> 45:51.360
But you've helped turn his life a little bit easier.

45:51.360 --> 45:54.480
Because he doesn't have to press all the dials and knobs on the thing anymore.

45:57.040 --> 46:01.520
And he still announces loudly what country music song people are about to hear.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.680
He does it in the privacy of his own house.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.040
And mostly he's just listening to radio and trying to guess what the next one's going to be.

46:07.040 --> 46:07.540
Right.

46:08.480 --> 46:13.040
That's all to say you all have made like a genuine material impact on our lives

46:13.040 --> 46:15.360
by allowing us to turn this into a career.

46:15.360 --> 46:17.120
And we are so grateful for it.

46:17.120 --> 46:19.280
And if you listen, you've never donated before.

46:19.280 --> 46:21.360
And you want to help contribute to that.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.640
Just think about becoming a member.

46:22.640 --> 46:24.720
Maximumfund.org slash donate.

46:24.720 --> 46:25.760
The one last thing I want to say.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.960
And we'll reiterate this a couple times over the next two weeks.

46:28.960 --> 46:34.160
But one of the amazing things about the structure of Max Fund and you the donors

46:34.160 --> 46:40.560
is that your money, your donations, your support is going directly to the shows that you love.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.640
This is not like an amorphous, you know.

46:42.640 --> 46:46.400
You don't send your money in and then hope eventually it gets to-

46:46.400 --> 46:49.760
No, like when you donate, you pick the shows you listen to.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.320
And that's where the majority of your money goes.

46:52.320 --> 46:57.600
So like if you listen to, you know, My Brother, My Brother, Me, Adventure Zone, right?

46:57.600 --> 47:00.000
And you're like, oh yeah, I became a $5 donor.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.520
And then over the last year, you started listening to Wonderful and Sawbones

47:03.520 --> 47:06.000
and the Schmaners and Trends Like These and Still Buffering.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.200
And you're like, well, now I get even more content.

47:09.200 --> 47:12.000
And now I want to support all the co-hosts on those shows.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.120
It's very direct.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.440
Yeah, you can then bump it up to 10.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.600
And now your money is going to support the shows that you love.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.440
Yeah, listen, we love being a part of the Maximum Fund Network.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.600
We love the support that our listeners have shown us

47:25.600 --> 47:27.040
in the eight years that we've been doing this.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.240
And God, that's wild.

47:28.240 --> 47:33.680
We are coming up on a decade and that's like a wild amount of time to me to even conceive of.

47:33.680 --> 47:36.960
It's no joke, the longest job I've ever had.

47:36.960 --> 47:39.520
This is the longest employment I've ever had.

47:39.520 --> 47:43.600
So you're curious to hear what other celebrities we humiliate ourselves in front of.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.280
So we're going to get back to the rest of the episode now,

47:45.280 --> 47:47.680
but we'll be back at the end to talk a little bit more about The Drive.

47:47.680 --> 47:48.640
Thank you all so much.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.800
Maximumfund.org slash donate.

47:50.800 --> 47:54.640
And just listen to us fall completely on our asses

47:54.640 --> 47:57.440
in a professional environment that we were not equipped to take on.

47:58.320 --> 47:58.800
Who's that?

47:59.440 --> 48:00.240
Hey, Justin, who's that?

48:00.240 --> 48:00.960
I hate this job.

48:00.960 --> 48:03.840
Justin, Justin, look at the faces.

48:03.840 --> 48:07.120
Justin, Justin, look at the beautiful faces.

48:07.120 --> 48:10.000
Can you find the face before they get to us?

48:10.000 --> 48:10.560
Justin, get there.

48:10.560 --> 48:10.960
Come on.

48:10.960 --> 48:14.080
The fun is in the challenge, Justin.

48:14.080 --> 48:14.560
No idea.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.160
This is actually very helpful.

48:18.800 --> 48:19.120
Okay.

48:19.120 --> 48:25.840
So to recap, a woman standing behind us has started narrating into her phone.

48:26.400 --> 48:29.040
She knows these people more than we do.

48:30.880 --> 48:35.040
So she hit me in the head with her phone.

48:35.040 --> 48:38.160
So now she owes me for the information I'm drifting off of her.

48:38.160 --> 48:38.960
Oh, my God.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.960
Steve Croft, Steve Croft, Steve Croft, right?

48:42.960 --> 48:48.320
Steve Croft is, of course, the one and only.

48:48.320 --> 48:52.000
Justin has a four step process.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.600
Steve Croft, 60 minutes.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.160
Fuck off.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.760
He's going to respect our journalistic chops.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.120
You guys have four mics.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.080
Usually I only have one.

49:01.040 --> 49:02.080
You guys are real pros.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.160
Hey, it's me, Steve Croft.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.600
60 minutes.

49:05.600 --> 49:09.440
He's four feet away from us.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.480
What the fuck?

49:10.480 --> 49:11.760
He's fucking about it.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.680
He's four feet as the crow flies.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.120
I did my best.

49:17.120 --> 49:17.760
All right, Justin.

49:17.760 --> 49:18.640
Flip, flip, flip.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.760
No, I have a page of just handsome guys.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.120
Maybe that's Matt Doyle.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.240
It's not Matt Doyle.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.760
If you say Matt Doyle one more time.

49:25.760 --> 49:27.520
I've thought four people were Matt Doyle.

49:27.520 --> 49:28.080
Stop it.

49:28.080 --> 49:28.800
Corey Cott?

49:29.760 --> 49:30.320
Oh, yeah.

49:30.320 --> 49:30.880
I love that.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.400
One of those guys is Corey Cott, for sure.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.160
Travis, I believe in you.

49:36.880 --> 49:40.240
Travis is going to try to corral Steve Croft into talking to us.

49:41.600 --> 49:42.560
And we're going to ask him.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.520
Wait, wait, what are you asking?

49:44.160 --> 49:45.120
Scariest sea creature.

49:45.120 --> 49:45.760
No, no, no.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.280
What's the most frightening sea creature?

49:47.280 --> 49:48.320
Romantic beach.

49:48.320 --> 49:48.800
Oh, we did that.

49:48.800 --> 49:49.520
No, we did that one.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.680
Short vacations or long vacations?

49:51.680 --> 49:52.000
Yes.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.120
How do you make the most of your time off?

49:53.120 --> 49:53.520
No, no, no.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.400
Short or long vacations.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.320
Can we ask you some questions real quick for our podcast?

49:56.320 --> 49:57.840
We do a podcast called My Brother.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.600
My Brother means an advice podcast.

49:59.600 --> 50:03.040
We are wondering, do you think people should take long vacations or short vacations?

50:03.040 --> 50:04.080
What do you prefer?

50:04.080 --> 50:05.840
Lots of short vacations or one long.

50:07.120 --> 50:08.000
I'm a big fan.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.280
It depends on how hard you work.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.280
We don't work at all.

50:11.280 --> 50:12.400
You don't work at all.

50:12.400 --> 50:17.840
I think if you have really a grind, I think that the longer vacation is a little bit better.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.920
You seem like somebody who's on their grind all the time.

50:19.920 --> 50:21.360
Do you prefer the long extended?

50:21.360 --> 50:25.760
Normally, we shut down for the most 60 minute shut down for the month of July.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.560
And that's a great four weeks.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.680
Just live it up.

50:29.680 --> 50:30.160
Yeah.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.760
One quick last question.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.480
What's the scariest sea creature, in your opinion?

50:34.480 --> 50:34.960
The what?

50:34.960 --> 50:36.400
Scariest sea creature.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.080
Scariest sea creature, in your opinion?

50:40.000 --> 50:43.360
Well, the only one I've seen really up close is an anaconda.

50:43.360 --> 50:45.440
Or not an anaconda, a barracuda.

50:45.440 --> 50:45.920
A barracuda.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.760
The only ones I've seen up close are a barracuda.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.280
Like about this far away.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.480
That's very terrifying.

50:50.480 --> 50:51.280
That would be it.

50:51.280 --> 50:54.240
And like a tanker exposed, like the barracuda could get you.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.920
You're just like inches away from one.

50:55.920 --> 50:59.440
Yeah, and I had a shiny ring on, too.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.800
I'm so low.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.160
Everybody said never wear them.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.480
Yeah, it was in the Florida Keys.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.760
I'm so glad you're still with us.

51:05.760 --> 51:06.080
I'm glad you're here.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.200
Thank you so much for talking with us.

51:07.200 --> 51:07.840
Thanks for your time.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.480
Enjoy the show.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.120
Okay, so professional.

51:13.120 --> 51:13.440
Yeah.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.000
Yeah.

51:14.000 --> 51:14.960
So great.

51:14.960 --> 51:15.440
So great.

51:15.440 --> 51:22.320
He even went back and did a second take of barracuda anaconda.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.120
A clean take.

51:23.120 --> 51:23.520
Clean take.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.560
He gave us a clean take on that.

51:24.560 --> 51:25.280
He gave us a clean take.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.520
Well, we shouldn't talk about that because we probably edited it.

51:27.520 --> 51:27.760
Yeah.

51:27.760 --> 51:28.400
Yeah.

51:28.400 --> 51:28.640
Okay.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.320
Now, Justin, did you identify this?

51:30.320 --> 51:31.200
Is this Matt Doyle?

51:31.840 --> 51:33.040
No, I don't know who this is.

51:33.040 --> 51:33.600
You looked it up.

51:33.600 --> 51:34.080
You said you knew who it was.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.120
I think it's Doctor Who.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.120
It's not Doctor Who, Justin.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.720
He looks slick and...

51:38.720 --> 51:39.280
Excuse me.

51:39.280 --> 51:41.760
What is this person in the suit here coming out with a bow tie?

51:41.760 --> 51:42.480
Travis is now...

51:45.680 --> 51:46.240
Okay, great.

51:46.240 --> 51:47.040
Thank you very much.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.520
Travis is trying to gather intel.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.280
Travis is our little spy.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.720
So we've all got different roles.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.720
Let's explain our process because I feel like people want to know

51:54.720 --> 51:55.920
what it's like for us in the red carpet.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.120
We've all got roles.

51:57.120 --> 51:58.320
I'm doing tech.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.680
I'm holding the stuff.

51:59.680 --> 52:03.280
Justin's over here and he keeps yelling about power and hell

52:03.280 --> 52:05.040
and everything's really scary.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.480
He's a misdirect guy.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.680
He keeps yelling the name Matt Doyle every four and a half minutes.

52:09.680 --> 52:14.080
And Travis is kind of our Tinker Tailor soldier spy out there.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.720
Gathering all the deets on all the...

52:16.720 --> 52:17.760
I'm the face man.

52:17.760 --> 52:18.640
All the celebs.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.680
I should have committed this whole sheet to memory.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.520
Told you so.

52:23.520 --> 52:24.000
Told you so.

52:24.000 --> 52:24.800
Corey Cott.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.600
Corey Cott.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.080
We got this.

52:26.640 --> 52:28.880
We're getting into our fucking swing right now.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.080
Can we cuss when we're talking to them?

52:30.080 --> 52:31.280
Yeah, fuck yeah.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.640
Okay, not like that.

52:32.640 --> 52:33.280
Oh, not now.

52:33.280 --> 52:33.840
You just...

52:33.840 --> 52:35.680
Four people just turned around to look at you.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.480
He was in Newsies.

52:36.480 --> 52:37.280
He was in Newsies.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.880
He was in Newsies on Broadway.

52:38.880 --> 52:39.760
I'm sorry, people.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.360
We don't know who anybody is.

52:41.360 --> 52:41.760
Yeah, we're the worst.

52:41.760 --> 52:42.880
It's not their...

52:42.880 --> 52:43.440
Please understand.

52:43.440 --> 52:44.880
It's our fault, not theirs.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.040
Is Travis gonna try to corral?

52:47.040 --> 52:47.680
Oh yeah, I'm gonna get him.

52:47.680 --> 52:48.560
I think grab Corey Cott.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.200
So this will be what?

52:51.200 --> 52:51.760
Five, six?

52:51.760 --> 52:54.080
Are you gonna ask about long or short vacations?

52:54.080 --> 52:54.880
We're still on that question.

52:54.880 --> 52:55.120
Yeah, I think so.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.560
I might ask a designated...

52:56.560 --> 52:58.560
Corey, can we ask you some quick questions?

52:58.560 --> 52:59.120
Hello.

52:59.120 --> 52:59.600
Oh, thanks.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.000
We do an advice podcast called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.360
It's a weird fit for a red carpet.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.160
It's a weird fit.

53:04.160 --> 53:05.360
An advice podcast?

53:05.360 --> 53:05.680
Yeah.

53:05.680 --> 53:06.160
Oh, cool.

53:06.160 --> 53:06.880
We've never done a...

53:06.880 --> 53:09.280
Nobody's ever recorded a podcast at a Broadway premiere before.

53:09.280 --> 53:09.920
You're groundbreaking.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.400
You're a pioneer.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.440
You're a revolutionary.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.000
And you're a part of it.

53:12.000 --> 53:12.960
So, congratulations.

53:12.960 --> 53:13.680
That's one of my history.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.280
In the Guinness Book of World Records Certificators.

53:15.280 --> 53:15.600
You're here.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.160
Welcome.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.640
We're doing beach-themed questions from our listeners.

53:18.640 --> 53:23.760
Okay, cool. The first is, do you prefer to save up your vacation time for one long trip

53:23.760 --> 53:26.160
or do several sort of short little getaways?

53:26.160 --> 53:27.280
Short or long vacations?

53:27.280 --> 53:31.760
I think I'd rather do a long vacation, but I think my life only allows for little short

53:31.760 --> 53:32.560
vacations most of the time.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.520
Ain't that the way?

53:33.520 --> 53:36.240
So, it's more like what I'm allowed to do.

53:36.240 --> 53:38.320
Yeah, that sounds really restrict...

53:38.320 --> 53:39.440
You should just do a podcast.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.000
We do nothing.

53:40.000 --> 53:40.480
Yeah, it's way...

53:40.480 --> 53:41.760
This is a vacation right now.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.840
Yeah, maybe should I just quit and just come with you guys?

53:43.840 --> 53:44.320
Yeah, you are.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.920
All right, I'm officially a part of the advice podcast.

53:45.920 --> 53:46.960
Welcome, Corey Cott.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.080
This will be the behind the music.

53:48.080 --> 53:48.560
Sure.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.760
This is where Corey's career...

53:49.760 --> 53:50.080
Yeah, sure.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.040
This is where...

53:51.040 --> 53:52.400
All his promise he left...

53:52.400 --> 53:54.160
Where he really started making his money.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.200
Second question, scariest sea creature?

54:03.040 --> 54:06.080
I mean, probably like a great white shark or something.

54:06.080 --> 54:06.880
That's the correct answer.

54:06.880 --> 54:10.960
Everybody tries to do these clever answers, but that's why they make a movie about this.

54:10.960 --> 54:11.520
Sure.

54:11.520 --> 54:12.400
If I'm actually gonna...

54:13.840 --> 54:16.640
If I'm swimming by myself in the ocean with nothing around me,

54:16.640 --> 54:18.960
I'm gonna be most terrified of a great white shark.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.760
Let me ask you this, Corey.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.280
Steve Croft's a barracuda.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.320
It's like a barrac...

54:22.320 --> 54:23.120
No, no, no.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.160
Let me ask you this.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.440
Let's go a little deeper here.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.800
What would be the sea creature that you wouldn't admit you would be afraid to see,

54:28.800 --> 54:30.240
but you'd totally be afraid to see?

54:31.600 --> 54:32.400
Oh, that's a really good question.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.680
It doesn't mean it's anything.

54:33.680 --> 54:34.320
Sure, sure, sure.

54:35.520 --> 54:36.020
Sure.

54:36.640 --> 54:42.080
Well, probably some sort of jellyfish, because I just like octopus.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.360
I actually like stingrays.

54:43.360 --> 54:47.840
I feel like stingrays are pretty cool and uncharacteristically nice most of the time,

54:48.560 --> 54:49.600
at least in my experience.

54:49.600 --> 54:51.600
But jellyfish, something with long tentacles.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.100
I don't...

54:52.400 --> 54:54.000
It's a little freaky to me.

54:54.000 --> 54:54.880
Good eating, though.

54:54.880 --> 54:55.360
What's that?

54:55.360 --> 54:55.760
Good eating.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.320
Good eating.

54:56.320 --> 54:56.880
Absolutely.

54:57.440 --> 54:58.480
Nothing wrong with that.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.040
Absolutely.

54:59.040 --> 54:59.840
That's very true.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.640
Fry those up, man.

55:00.640 --> 55:01.360
Fry those tentacles up.

55:01.360 --> 55:01.920
It's a good meal.

55:01.920 --> 55:02.640
Heck yeah.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.280
Thank you so much.

55:03.280 --> 55:03.600
Thank you so much.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.000
Thank you, guys.

55:04.000 --> 55:04.480
Good luck.

55:04.480 --> 55:04.880
Thank you.

55:04.880 --> 55:05.840
Thank you.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.160
Thank you.

55:06.800 --> 55:07.300
Thanks.

55:07.680 --> 55:08.800
It's 24 minutes.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.840
What time is it, Juice?

55:09.840 --> 55:11.520
It's 6.14.

55:11.520 --> 55:11.760
All right.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.360
Another 16 minutes.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.120
There's Ethan Supplee.

55:15.120 --> 55:16.320
We don't got to look that one up.

55:16.320 --> 55:17.120
That's a slam dunk.

55:17.120 --> 55:17.840
We're going to get Ethan.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.200
I'm going to try really hard not to ask him about Boy Meets World.

55:21.200 --> 55:21.760
Don't do that.

55:22.320 --> 55:22.880
Don't do that.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.000
I'm going to try so hard.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.040
You're not going to do that.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.200
I'm going to try so hard not to try.

55:27.200 --> 55:27.680
Look at me.

55:27.680 --> 55:28.480
You're not going to do that.

55:28.480 --> 55:29.360
I'm going to try so hard.

55:29.360 --> 55:29.840
Look at us.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.400
Look at us.

55:30.400 --> 55:30.880
Look at us.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.360
Look at us.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.560
You're not going to do that.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.040
Okay.

55:33.040 --> 55:34.800
I didn't know you had to like...

55:34.800 --> 55:35.520
It does...

55:35.520 --> 55:36.080
Oh my God.

55:36.080 --> 55:37.920
It's Mary Lou Henner freaking out.

55:37.920 --> 55:38.320
Okay.

55:38.320 --> 55:38.880
I'm fine.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.880
I'm fine, everyone.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.960
So don't ask about Boy Meets World.

55:44.960 --> 55:45.280
Okay.

55:45.280 --> 55:45.680
Great.

55:45.680 --> 55:45.920
Great.

55:46.720 --> 55:47.840
Unless it comes up.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.080
What?

55:48.080 --> 55:49.520
We need another question from our listeners.

55:49.520 --> 55:49.840
Oh yeah.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.160
Hurry.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.720
Something new to ask about.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.560
I feel like we could do this every week.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.040
It's easy.

55:55.040 --> 55:55.760
This is our new job.

55:55.760 --> 55:56.880
The regular podcast is canceled.

55:58.320 --> 55:58.960
Suggestion...

55:58.960 --> 55:59.440
Oh God.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.080
When I go on vacation...

56:02.080 --> 56:02.320
No.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.520
Justin's fucking broken.

56:05.520 --> 56:05.840
Justin.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.040
I have a problem in my head.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.000
I took a beat chicken.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.760
How do you enjoy the...

56:09.760 --> 56:10.160
How do you...

56:10.160 --> 56:11.920
How do you take advantage of beats?

56:11.920 --> 56:13.440
We'll go back to the destination.

56:13.440 --> 56:14.160
What's your favorite beat?

56:14.160 --> 56:15.680
Just ideal vacation.

56:15.680 --> 56:16.960
Drop the beach bullshit.

56:16.960 --> 56:17.520
Okay.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.040
This is the beach bullshit.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.240
And we'll set people up.

56:20.240 --> 56:21.840
Ethan, can we ask you some quick questions?

56:21.840 --> 56:22.240
Hi.

56:22.240 --> 56:24.320
We do an advice podcast called My Brother, My Brother.

56:24.320 --> 56:26.240
I can hold on to it if you want to or you can.

56:26.240 --> 56:26.480
Okay.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.360
It's insulting, I feel like, to be like, now you hold it.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.320
You have work to do.

56:30.320 --> 56:30.960
One job.

56:30.960 --> 56:31.840
This is our first...

56:31.840 --> 56:33.120
We have four microphones here.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.160
This is wild.

56:34.160 --> 56:34.640
We've never...

56:34.640 --> 56:36.080
We're recording a podcast.

56:36.080 --> 56:36.320
Okay.

56:36.320 --> 56:39.280
We do an advice show called My Brother, My Brother and Me.

56:39.280 --> 56:40.400
And we're talking about...

56:40.400 --> 56:41.440
Who are the brothers?

56:41.440 --> 56:42.080
All three of us.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.280
You're all three brothers.

56:43.280 --> 56:43.440
Yeah.

56:44.080 --> 56:46.400
We asked Jimmy Buffett if we could do this and he said yes.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.760
And I don't think he really thought through it.

56:47.760 --> 56:48.480
And I don't think we did either.

56:48.480 --> 56:49.200
We didn't either.

56:49.200 --> 56:49.920
We've never done this.

56:49.920 --> 56:50.720
So we're freaking out a little bit.

56:50.720 --> 56:51.200
But it's fine.

56:51.200 --> 56:51.600
It's fine.

56:51.600 --> 56:55.920
When you normally do your podcast, are you in a more sound protected environment?

56:55.920 --> 56:57.440
In our home, in our sweatpants.

56:57.440 --> 56:58.800
We go to a Kmart.

56:58.800 --> 57:03.360
More importantly, we're in a people protected environment where we don't see so many people.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.080
I'm with you.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.160
I like people protected environments.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.840
This is so hazardous.

57:07.840 --> 57:08.240
Thank you.

57:08.240 --> 57:09.600
There's a lot of folks here.

57:10.240 --> 57:10.480
Yeah.

57:11.840 --> 57:16.240
So we have questions from our audience about beach stuff.

57:16.240 --> 57:17.520
What's your ideal vacation?

57:17.520 --> 57:18.640
What's your ideal getaway?

57:18.640 --> 57:23.360
My ideal vacation is anywhere with a warm beach.

57:23.360 --> 57:28.160
And I will sit in the water up to my tits all day long.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.240
Do you take a lot of stuff down?

57:30.240 --> 57:32.080
Or do you go to the beach by yourself?

57:32.080 --> 57:34.480
Or do you have a lot of equipment you like to bring down?

57:34.480 --> 57:36.320
I have four children.

57:36.320 --> 57:37.040
OK, I hear you.

57:37.040 --> 57:37.920
OK, I hear you.

57:37.920 --> 57:42.240
Each child requires their own special equipment.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.040
So the equipment is nauseating.

57:45.040 --> 57:47.840
The amount of equipment that we have to take.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.320
Gadgets and gizmos and things.

57:50.320 --> 57:50.960
Yeah.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.080
One last question.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.520
Do you think Atlantis is real?

57:54.080 --> 57:58.400
I told Travis not to ask this because I'm lying that this is just very interesting.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.120
And I don't.

57:59.120 --> 58:00.560
But I'm a multiverse guy.

58:00.560 --> 58:04.880
If we are living in a multiverse, it's real somewhere.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.080
Holy shit.

58:06.080 --> 58:07.440
That's a good answer.

58:07.440 --> 58:08.720
Damn it, that's good.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.600
Thank you so much.

58:09.600 --> 58:10.960
I don't think it's here on Earth.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.520
So stop looking.

58:15.520 --> 58:16.960
OK, all right.

58:16.960 --> 58:17.520
Fair enough.

58:17.520 --> 58:18.400
Well, thank you very much.

58:18.400 --> 58:18.720
Thanks so much.

58:18.720 --> 58:19.840
Thanks for talking with us.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.840
Enjoy the show.

58:21.840 --> 58:22.720
That was so good.

58:22.720 --> 58:23.760
Yeah, that was really great too.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.800
Totally professional.

58:24.800 --> 58:26.240
It felt him or us?

58:26.240 --> 58:26.800
Oh, both.

58:26.800 --> 58:27.840
But totally professional.

58:27.840 --> 58:31.600
Yeah, I liked when you said tits.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.360
Give me something other than Atlantis.

58:33.920 --> 58:35.920
Scariest sea creature is so good.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.640
That's a classic.

58:36.640 --> 58:38.240
I'm going to get Mary Lou Hinner.

58:38.240 --> 58:39.600
Are you going to get Mary Lou Hinner?

58:39.600 --> 58:39.840
OK.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.320
Ask about Inverted.

58:42.320 --> 58:43.920
Which sea creature does she want to own as a pet?

58:44.480 --> 58:44.880
OK.

58:44.880 --> 58:46.480
What's the most lovable sea creature?

58:46.480 --> 58:47.520
What's the most lovable sea creature?

58:47.520 --> 58:48.800
No, that's like benign.

58:48.800 --> 58:49.760
I want to know scares.

58:49.760 --> 58:50.880
I want to know fears.

58:50.880 --> 58:52.640
I want to see any people's souls.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.800
I'm going to put that sigh in the episode.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.000
I feel like it tells a story.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.680
Can we ask you some quick questions?

58:59.680 --> 59:00.240
Two seconds.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.280
Super quick question.

59:01.280 --> 59:03.440
We do an advice podcast, and we're recording here.

59:03.440 --> 59:04.960
We've never been on a red carpet before.

59:04.960 --> 59:05.520
One question.

59:05.520 --> 59:07.360
What do you think the scariest sea creature is?

59:08.640 --> 59:10.160
Ursula from Little Mermaid.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.760
Yes, that's a good answer.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.240
Thank you.

59:12.240 --> 59:13.040
Thank you, Ms. Hinner.

59:13.040 --> 59:13.520
You crushed it.

59:13.520 --> 59:15.440
I have a little three-year-old niece who lives with me.

59:15.440 --> 59:16.960
So trust me.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.160
And she's always here.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.920
Terrified of Ursula?

59:19.920 --> 59:20.800
As she should be.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.120
Thank you.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.080
That's a great answer.

59:22.080 --> 59:23.280
Thank you so much.

59:23.280 --> 59:23.680
All right.

59:23.680 --> 59:27.840
All right, we need to not scream into the microphones

59:27.840 --> 59:30.640
as Mary Lou Hinner gives us a very good Ursula

59:30.640 --> 59:31.600
answer to our question.

59:33.600 --> 59:34.240
Oh, shit.

59:34.960 --> 59:35.520
It's happening.

59:35.520 --> 59:36.000
Is that Jimmy?

59:36.640 --> 59:38.560
All right, Jimmy will stop and talk to us.

59:39.680 --> 59:40.400
Is that Jimmy?

59:42.080 --> 59:43.600
I don't know what Jimmy Buffett looks like.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.480
I've just realized I don't know what Jimmy Buffett looks like.

59:46.480 --> 59:48.480
Oh, it's going to be an audio disaster in here now.

59:49.440 --> 59:51.840
Jimmy Buffett has arrived at the venue.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.200
Everybody's going nuts for Jimmy.

59:53.200 --> 59:54.480
This is going to be not usable anymore.

59:55.200 --> 59:56.160
We're going to lead.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.960
When James comes, we're going to lead with Scariest Sea Creature.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.240
Okay.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.040
And then we're going to ask him why he made this decision.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.920
I think we should maybe, for him, do a little debrief on why the decision was made to include

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.960
us at this event.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.520
I don't know that we'll be invited to his second Broadway show.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.880
No way.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.920
Did you?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.400
Did I?

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.440
I don't think I ever...

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.040
I think it's weird I'm at a point in my life where I could be very stressed out.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.200
And seeing Jimmy Buffett would put me at ease.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.440
Oh, there's my friend James.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.800
Are they still yelling for Jimmy Buffett?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.560
I don't know.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.840
I don't know if other people showed up.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.640
Do you think that all these people here from Margaritaville might be fans?

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.160
Maybe.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.120
People are going to be very confused about the amount of time we're going to want to

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.080
take with Jimmy Buffett.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.560
Well, he's a professional.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.080
He's probably going to breeze right past us.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:46.560
Yeah.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.560
That's the question, huh?

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.040
What?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.320
Can we get Jimmy?

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.040
Can we get Jimmy?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920
Can we get Jimmy Buffett to talk to us?

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.560
Probably.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.720
When he asks, hey guys, real quick, huddle up.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.120
We have like 30 seconds here because Jimmy Buffett's real close.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.640
But when he asks how it goes, can we all say it went super good and talk about all the

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.320
great questions we got from Mark and the gang?

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.760
We don't lie to them about how great we did a good job?

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.560
Lie to them and say we did a great job and everybody's been complimenting us on our

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.440
professionalism.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.000
Yeah, I know you're worried about taking a risk on us.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.840
We've been very professional the entire time.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.240
For sure.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.040
OK, so they told me I could step off the rope.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.160
I definitely didn't.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.240
And then I'll send him a special cut of this episode that's four minutes long of our like

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.720
our times where we approach confidence professionals.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.880
Jimmy's just made a big face at us.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.080
I think he's going to come talk to us.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.360
We'll see here.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.040
The man, the man himself.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040
So he's going to come and talk to you.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:41.680
Hi, Jimmy.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.400
How's it going?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.120
How's it going, Jimmy?

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.560
How did the Tonight Show go?

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.600
How did the Tonight Show go?

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.800
The Tonight Show went great.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.360
Bill Hader.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:51.680
Come on.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.120
You got to follow Bill Hader.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.400
I met him as he was going.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.120
He was coming out.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:55.760
I was going in.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.560
I'm a big fan, though.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.160
I know you're taking a risk by letting us on the blue carpet here at the premiere.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.360
And what happened to the red carpet?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.960
Well, it's beach themed.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.760
I spilled a margarita.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.160
We've been real professional the entire time, though.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.920
And everybody's really complimented us.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.120
And they said it's been like we did a great job is what I'm saying.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.320
We're doing a great job for you.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.640
They said Jimmy made a good choice by letting you be here.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.440
And we said I agree.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.400
No, I'm trying to.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.240
They're impressed with your work here, you know?

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.400
Those serious people are getting serious over there.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.480
It's been real good, though.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.440
We wanted to ask you, what do you think the scariest sea creature is?

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.160
The what?

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.520
Scariest sea creature.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.400
Well, sea creatures.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.760
Which one do you find the most frightening?

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.600
Scariest sea creature?

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.800
Again, we've been very professional.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.280
Haven't asked this.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.400
Moray eel.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:36.960
Moray eel.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.840
Why moray eel?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.520
Because I've had an encounter with one.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.120
Sharks don't bother me.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.280
Octopus or squid don't as long as they're not giants.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.640
But moray eel, yeah.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.080
I had one come out and swim out of the hole, you know?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.600
Why were you in its hole?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.720
Why were you looking at its hole?

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.080
Why were you getting like towards its hole?

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.200
Were you just swimming and just happened to be by the hole?

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.280
I was trying to get lobsters out.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.720
I was hoping it was a lobster that came out.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.040
What if that was his lobster?

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.480
Well, he can have it.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.240
You know, I gave it to him.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.740
All right.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.000
Well, congratulations on the show.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.360
That was fun yesterday.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:09.920
Yeah, it was.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.800
I had a good time.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.320
You and me and Len was chatting.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:12.960
It was fun.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.080
They were all happy about it.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:14.800
So I am, too.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.200
So, you know, we're talking about when

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.520
Hamilton goes down to Puerto Rico,

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.560
I'm thinking about doing the Dark Knights there

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.800
and bringing the band over and still raise some money.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.240
Oh, yeah.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:26.880
That'd be fun.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.000
So we're neighbors here.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.040
We'll be neighbors down there.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:29.540
All right.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.280
Great to see you guys.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.880
And thank you for coming to the show.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.080
Good luck with the show.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.800
Everybody listen to my brother, my brother, and me.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.360
Great pass.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.600
Thanks, Jimmy.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.600
Oh, he's saying hi to the fans.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:41.920
Uh-oh.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.320
Oh, shit.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:42.880
Yeah, we did it.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.560
He's saying hi to the fans, but it's happening right next to me.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:44.800
There's four.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.280
Oh, wait.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.160
We should get a picture.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:46.480
Hold on.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.280
Let's get a quick picture.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.320
I'm going to send Jimmy Buffett.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.520
Thanks, Jimmy.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.000
Good luck.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:50.560
Break a leg.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.280
Great.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:51.780
Yes.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:53.540
Cut.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:55.940
Did great.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:56.880
OK.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.800
I think we need to get in, right?

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.080
It starts at 630.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.600
You think we've done enough good work here?

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.280
I mean, I feel like we've done our good work.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.320
I'm now in a photo.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.760
I've now been pulled into a photo.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.320
Fans of the podcast, I guess.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.720
Yeah, I think we should probably, maybe we need to get in there.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.760
Are you just saying that because you're scared?

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.480
We do have more people.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.200
We could talk to.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.160
No, I think that that's the end of the chain of celebs here.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.560
I don't know.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.920
I see some people down there.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.920
I want to just, I'm feeling great.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.640
Let's kick it.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.920
You just want to keep going.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.800
I think it'd be weird if we, on our side, left the red carpet before everybody else.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.280
OK.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.280
Yeah, we're not supposed to leave first, right?

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.640
The energy's gotten kind of strange.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.000
So it's weird.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.600
It's like everything's been pretty chill until the members of Jimmy Buffett's band showed up.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.000
And then the people behind us are losing their damn minds.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.040
Yeah, but it's good.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.680
And it's good.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.040
I'm glad they're excited.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.000
And that's not a surprise.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.320
There's a lot of JB fans in the house tonight.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.640
It's just a little, it's gotten kind of a stressful energy, I would say.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.600
The energy is quite strange.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.800
The energy has become a stressful energy.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.440
I think the thing, let's talk about next time.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:57.920
OK.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.920
Next time we do a Broadway premiere, the one thing that seemed to fuck people up the most

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.840
is us handing them a microphone to talk into.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.880
So don't do that.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.640
So that one is weird for us to do.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.120
Also, stepping over the rope.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.720
You're not supposed to do that.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.480
So if you do a red carpet, you are supposed to be on the other end of the red carpet.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.000
Be more, be aggressive.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.120
You know what I mean?

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.800
Not too aggressive.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.080
Don't be weird about it.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.360
But it's OK to make yourself physically present.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.400
Also, let's talk real quick about Escape to Margaritaville.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.320
It's escape to margaritavillemusical.com.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.120
It's open now.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.520
You can come see it at the beautiful Marquis Theater.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.280
Stay at the Mario Marquis.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.960
It's in the same building as the show.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.680
Super convenient.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.120
So convenient.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.400
It's a heck of a lot of fun.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.120
It's a great show.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.480
If you know Jimi Lovic's music, if you love Jimi Lovic's music, then you got a heart and ears.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.560
But also you're going to love this musical.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.520
And a fucking brain.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.400
And a fucking brain to hear the music.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.560
And if you don't, then you're brainless.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.840
And heartless.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.280
I don't know, maybe at least one lung.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.200
You probably need a lung.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.480
And you probably need like a heart.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.040
I mean, all the essential organs for sure.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.320
You'll barf up one lung from how hard you'll laugh at the great jokes.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.240
I feel like I didn't do a good job with Mary Lou Hinder.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.440
I feel like I kind of fucked that up.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.560
Well, here's what happened.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.320
You said, who's the scariest sea creature?

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.280
She said, Ursula.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.320
And then you screamed the loudest noise in the universe.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:16.820
Yes!

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:17.920
Directly at her.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.640
And I scared her.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.120
You scared her.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.600
Well, also, right before you screamed, a handler said, you got like two seconds.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.400
That's freaked me out.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.240
That's what panicked me.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.040
It wasn't my fault.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.160
You listened to her say, Ursula.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.360
You said that took about two seconds.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.840
And so you thought you disengaged just by yelling and yelling.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.400
OK.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.560
I think it looks like things are thinning out.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.320
Should we walk through the photo line now?

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.400
That might be interesting.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.440
That's kind of a different.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.240
Nobody's ever podcasted across a photo line before.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.640
We got a pretty mobile operation here, except for our Tangelo snakes that we got.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:47.600
OK.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.720
I think we'd call it our last interview will be Jimmy, if that feels right.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.280
It feels good to me.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.440
Yeah.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.800
There's a certain dignity to that.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.240
And we've been going the full hour.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.120
We did a full hour.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.840
And here's the thing.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.440
We really don't need to check out with anybody.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.440
We could just turn off this microphone and walk away.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.880
We don't need anyone's permission.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.720
That sounds pretty cool.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.840
I OK.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.720
Let's close it down.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Travis, just make sure you grab our placard off the ground

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.560
so that there's no evidence of our even.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:10.800
Yeah.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.480
They'll never know.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.880
Are you guys sure we've got enough?

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.200
Yeah.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.560
It seems like nobody else is coming.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:16.960
OK, let's go.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.320
Wait, but if anybody else does come.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.280
We can start back up.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.560
We're going to feel pretty silly.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:21.680
Shit.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.560
No, can I tell you guys?

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.520
It's Al Roker.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:23.840
What?

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.960
That's Al Roker.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.120
Oh, it is Al Roker.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:27.360
OK.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.360
OK, now we do have Al Roker approaching.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.480
I'm not talking anymore.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.440
I fucked up Mary Lou Hinner.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.720
I'm not going to fuck up Al Roker.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.920
OK, we're going to talk to Al Roker.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.400
This is going to happen.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.200
Do we need to talk about?

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:35.760
It's Al Roker.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.960
We're going to leave like chumps.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.000
And then we got Al.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.680
OK, guys, this is a big show.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.160
Are we going to talk?

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:40.880
This is a big show.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.280
Al's wearing jeans and a jacket that says USA on it,

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.240
probably from the Olympics.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.680
What a pro move.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.880
Are we going to talk about that one episode

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.040
where I made a bunch of sexual jokes about Al Roker?

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:49.440
No.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.800
No, we're not going to talk about the one episode

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.240
where we made sexual jokes about Al Roker.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.840
We're just going to be normal guys.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.440
I think we talked about playing Roker poker.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.000
OK, we can't do the advice thing anymore.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.800
It's too weird.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.280
Just tell him we're from regular guy's radio and we're not going to lie.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.480
OK, just tell him.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.760
We do an advice podcast.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.720
How do you like to?

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.720
I'm going to lead the way on this one.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.480
Griffin's going to talk to somebody for once.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.680
OK, I'm going to get him, though.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.160
Here's the motion I like to do, by the way, and it's hard to describe.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.920
But it's kind of like a lean in, one hand out sheepishly,

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.160
like a minute of your time going on.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.760
So he's got a microphone that is attached

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.040
to the thing that I'm holding in my hand.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.000
It's almost like I'm fishing with Travis as bait,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.680
reeling him in with the microphone.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.320
There's one man who works here and I'm worried.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.960
He's the one who said we only got two seconds with Mary Lou.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.040
But he's also given me the names of people a couple of times.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:35.600
It's very helpful.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.800
I'm not saying it's his job.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.520
I'm worried he's going to see us and say, like, they don't.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.280
You don't want to talk to these guys.

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.720
They don't deserve Al Roker.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.080
He knows about the sexual jokes.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.320
Do you think anyone has ever been this nervous to meet Al Roker?

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.280
Yes or no?

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.080
Yes.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:50.400
Yes.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.000
OK, hands down.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.480
I'm cool.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.800
And this is what he's here for.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.080
He's here to talk to the podcast.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.680
He's here to talk to the podcast.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.600
He's here to talk to the different podcasts that are here.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.320
And I'm not talking on this one, by the way.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.440
I'm smiling on it because I fucking Mary Lou here so bad.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:05.760
You know what?

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.440
And I'm going to say this, and this might be even funnier.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.160
Even if you want to talk to me of something really funny and good to say,

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.680
don't fucking, you hear me?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.560
I'm going to be silent.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.160
Don't you open that fucking mouth of yours.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.200
I'm going to be so silent.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.560
He's going to be like, what's this guy's deal?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.720
Al Roker's looking at us while we're having this confrontation.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.000
But I swear to God, Justin.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:20.480
I won't answer.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.160
Even if he asks what my deal is, I won't answer.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.360
I'll just stare him down.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.080
Intimidation game, baby, please don't do that, please do talk.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.280
Now can I turn around?

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.520
Should I should I be your guy's photographer

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.920
and take a picture of you talking with Al Roker?

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.240
Yes.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.600
Is that good?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.680
I think people may not appreciate that.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.120
I feel like they want to be posed.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:37.920
They want to be posed.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.160
Yeah.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:38.720
That's a great point.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:38.960
Yeah.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.960
I've got a lot of selfies here on the right card.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.000
Jimmy was a friend.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.600
Al Roker is a future friend.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.480
Al Roker.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.760
The next time we see Al Roker, the next time we cover a Broadway premiere, we will.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.480
Next time.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.040
Next time.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.680
I am not going to talk.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.360
What did you guys think about the episode this week?

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.960
Well, it was OK.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.040
Basically, we watched three people unspool.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.080
We can't think about that.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:58.320
No.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.080
We're going to edit this all until we sound very cool in it.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.520
I'm going to edit out like 30 of the times that Justin said that one dude's name over

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.400
and over and over again.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.120
Which one?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:07.920
Matt Doyle?

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.400
Matt Doyle.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.880
I thought a lot of you were Matt Doyle.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.320
This may end up in Matt Doyle's hands.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.400
And if it does, I'm sorry that Justin thought you were every handsome man who watched.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.200
This is not a joke.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.080
Every handsome man.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.680
He's a very handsome man.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.360
And we don't know a lot of people.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.280
Got a couple Matt Doyles coming up the carpet right now.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.280
You guys are about to get Al Roker, and I'm just going to stand and stare into the-

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:27.520
Don't.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.480
You need to engage.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.120
I know what I said.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:29.920
You need to engage.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.640
It would be weird if you don't.

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.440
I'm not engaging.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:31.920
Engage.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.000
Justin.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.560
I'll engage mentally, spiritually.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.200
Say hi.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.720
You're going to say you're not going to engage, or then the charm's going to pull you in.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.840
The Roker charm.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.120
Oh, he's not going to have time?

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.320
Just one quick question.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:42.960
One quick question.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.480
Hey, how's it going?

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.680
Real quick question.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.440
We do an advice podcast.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:47.920
Jimmy asked.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.840
How many mics do you guys have?

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.160
I know.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.680
Everybody keeps making fun of how many-

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.480
Freaking octopus.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.760
Everybody's making fun of me.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.120
You're an octopod push.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:55.360
Yes.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.120
Wow.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.800
Dude, what the hell?

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.640
In case one goes out, there's three more?

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.760
We've never done this before.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.960
We don't know how to do this.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.520
Podcast.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.240
How many microphones do you need?

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:06.880
Too many.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.960
Technically, this is also a microphone, so that's five.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.080
You've got a mic, you've got a mic.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:10.960
What the heck?

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.680
Yeah.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.360
Jeez, is there a question here?

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:13.920
I don't know.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.920
How many mics does it take to screw in a light bulb?

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.000
How many mics does it take to make a margarita?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.880
We get on.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.760
Ask a question.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.480
This is exactly what Justin was afraid of.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.040
Oh.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:25.840
You got, what's your-

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.640
The play's over.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.200
Got to go.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.320
Glad we could come.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.600
Well, now I feel silly asking the questions.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.200
Oh, now you feel silly.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.480
Now you feel silly.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.440
You're holding 18 microphones.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.720
Now you feel silly.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.600
This is Jimmy's favorite podcast.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.600
I'm sorry.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.560
No, you're great.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.200
That was great.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.320
I think we're good.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:50.640
I think we're done.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.120
We're good.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.640
Thank you so much.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.600
I learned a lot.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:53.920
Thank you.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.760
Well, folks, we had a lot of fun here today.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.400
The power of record just made fun of us so bad

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.240
that we can't do a podcast anymore.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.440
So you just go ahead and unsubscribe.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:06.800
Subscribe.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.480
That'll be the final episode.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.280
We had a good run.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.080
This is the finale.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.680
And I guess now we're going to cut to our post-game

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.640
sort of debrief.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.160
Yeah, we'll debrief after this.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.600
With a special guest star, Matt Doyle.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.880
Wow.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.040
Thank you to us for surviving that because-

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.880
I mean, yes.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.000
Did we?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.280
Yes, we're here.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.320
So I assume we survived.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.040
I've been living a half-life since that fateful night.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.680
And thank you so much to James for having us out there.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.480
I hope you don't regret it after hearing all of the work

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.880
we did at your big night.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.200
But it's spilled milk.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.240
If you haven't yet, we would ask you one more time

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.480
to go to maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.920
And just to recap, this is money that is going directly

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.760
to the shows that you love.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.960
When you donate, you choose the shows you listen to

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.520
and they are the shows that benefit from your donation.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.920
So if you start listening to new shows and maybe you want

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.000
to kick in a few extra bucks, it seriously is the only way

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.520
that we can all sort of keep going.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.720
So it's really important.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.000
Don't wait for your neighbor to do it.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.520
You do it.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.000
No, but-

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.640
You can do it.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.480
But to that point, I also want to say,

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.520
if you are already a Max Fund donor and you're like,

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.400
well, I can't afford to up my donation this year.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.040
Totally cool.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.480
Totally understand that.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.760
The last thing I would want is for anybody to make donations

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.720
they can't afford.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.720
What you can do is you can go on social media.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.240
You go online, you talk to your friends,

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.960
you text your friends, whatever you want to do to contact them

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.840
and say, hey, I know that you listen to this too.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.800
I know you enjoy this.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.440
Are you a member?

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.680
Have you considered becoming a member?

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.200
This, the bonus content-

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.800
Of the Church of Latter-day Saints.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.520
Oh, yeah.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.080
I thought you were doing something else.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.840
Have you thought about becoming a member

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.920
and also supporting Max Fund?

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.400
But yeah, get on there, talk about it, tweet at us,

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.680
use the hashtag MaxFundDrive, share that link,

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.680
maximumfund.org forward slash donate

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.280
and help us get the word out.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.360
So last time, and we're going to wrap up here,

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.600
go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.040
Choose a donation level that's right for you.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.000
Pick the shows you listen to where your donation's going to go

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.600
and don't wait.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.160
Just join up now and tell your friends.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.800
Help us hit that goal of 25,000 new and upgrading members

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.960
and get some great gifts along the way.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.120
And let's see.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.000
I forget how we wrapped it up back in New York,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.560
but I think we did a really great job of it.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.000
Probably.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.120
We're a little buzzed.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.160
We survived.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.000
Yes, we did it.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.600
They can't say we didn't do it and we definitely didn't die.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.200
We did the red carpet thing, which you heard,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.680
and then we watched the premiere of Escape to Margaritaville

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.480
and I had a hell of a time.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.760
Had a whale of a time.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.560
I will say this too.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.040
We were seated behind Martha Plimpton.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.560
She seemed to enjoy it very much.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.040
I had many emotions.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.000
I laughed.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.080
I mostly had sort of anger

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.240
that Martha Plimpton skipped us in the line.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:58.640
You okay?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.200
Justin just had a monster yawn.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.040
Justin just had a monster yawn.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.640
I left it all on the court.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.600
You people heard.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.480
I left it all on the court.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.720
It is important to know, people at home,

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.880
it's about 9.45 and it feels like it's 2 a.m.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.400
It's 9.45.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.680
It feels like it's 2 a.m.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.520
But Travis McElroy, I'm here to tell you,

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.880
it's five o'clock somewhere.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.760
There it is.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.720
Listen, here's the thing.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.840
It's actually not.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.360
It's 9.57.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.120
It's 5.57 somewhere.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.120
It's 4.57 somewhere.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.080
Somebody's watching the clock like,

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.840
fuck yeah dude, three more minutes.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.400
They have the Miller High Life just like cracked open,

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.040
ready to part.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.640
Okay, I have the hint sheet, tip sheet here.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.120
This thing is a fucking mess.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.600
This is an old, old pirate map

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.280
that Justin aged 50 years by crumpling it nervously.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.920
I mean, let's start broad strokes.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.320
Okay.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.240
Debrief about the red carpet.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.000
I screamed at Mary Lou Henner and I feel bad about it.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.800
You didn't scream at, you were caused to scream.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.800
He screamed, you were caused to scream

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.720
towards Mary Lou Henner.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.960
It was, you couldn't get yourself.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.520
I heard her talking about it outside the restroom

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.360
and she said, there was a young man

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.520
who got so excited by my answer,

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.040
it just made my day.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:09.680
Okay, good.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:10.400
Well, that's nice.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.440
Let's just go down the list here.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.320
I've got this list.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:13.920
Terry Collins.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.160
Dead to me.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.960
Former manager of the New York Mets, Terry Collins.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.080
No, thanks.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.200
We didn't flag you down

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.040
and so we took a personal in front of the fact

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.720
that you didn't come talk to us.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.200
Before we get to her, I want to say Mark Helgenberger.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.240
That was on me.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.760
Mark Helgenberger was Travis's.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.880
Mark, we didn't know.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.720
There was a moment where I felt your energy

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.280
call to my energy and all I had to do was say,

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.480
Mark, and you would have come over

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.400
and I opened my mouth and I didn't

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.960
and that's on me because I don't get starstruck that often.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.280
Yes.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.520
But I love CSI so much.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.640
Brenda Vaccaro.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.880
That's the legit shit right there.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.480
Brenda Vaccaro is a legit lady

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.000
who's welcome on my brother, my brother, me,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.720
whatever she wants.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.280
She desperately wants to come on my brother, my brother, me.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.080
Sorry, what was it again?

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.360
I had margaritas.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.280
The margaritas, you shouldn't,

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.280
they should charge like $30 extra for the ticket

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.960
and then there's like four margaritas

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.560
waiting for you at your seat.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.560
It is such a good friend.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.720
Your margarita before you watch the show,

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.840
escape to margaritaville.com.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.760
I'm not saying it's necessary to enjoy it.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.680
It's not, but it's like you're about to watch people

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.400
drink margaritas for literally two hours.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.160
It is as if it's like a magic eye poster

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.800
where as you watch escape to margaritaville

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.000
and your eyes unfocused,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.240
the people on stage are actually looking at you going,

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.640
we'll take a break if you need to go get a margarita.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.880
Justin, can you say Matt Doyle's name 40 times

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.080
just to sort of take me back to-

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.520
Matt Doyle, it wasn't Matt Doyle.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.560
It was Matt Doyle.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.520
It was Matt Doyle.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.840
Justin had an energy on the red carpet

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.560
and we've done some debrief before we started recording

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.120
just looking at the game tape.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.800
And I think a couple of the screw-ups

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.040
were Justin yelling that this was hell

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.480
literally inches from the people

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.920
we were supposed to be talking to.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:58.480
It was a little uncomfortable.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.560
And then I think the other thing was him saying

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.680
Matt Doyle over and over again.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.200
I think it's Matt Doyle he said.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.120
Almost as if Matt Doyle had like murdered his whole family

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.000
and then Justin was having some sort of fever nightmare.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.120
All right, now it's 10 o'clock.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.560
Now it's five o'clock, so okay.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.120
Thank goodness.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.640
Ethan Souffle, great.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.120
Amazing.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:15.680
So good.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.600
Turned into a great performance.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.720
Patton Hughes.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.760
Patton Hughes came to us.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.640
That was our first-

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.080
An angel.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.760
An angel from God.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.280
I will always appreciate that.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.200
And if I remember correctly,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.400
I think Patton said like,

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.320
you are doing a good job.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.760
And it gave me, it was like-

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.000
She was wrong, but like I appreciate it.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.440
Yeah, check out Patton Hughes' series Heirloom

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.120
that you can go watch about Going Tomatoes.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.000
It's great.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.880
Martha Plimpton, again, didn't get a chance to sit down

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.920
or stand up with her,

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.680
but I did have a chance to sit down with her.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.040
We sat behind her at the show

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.120
and she had a hell of a time.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.200
Corey Cott turned in a great game.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:51.760
Thank you, Corey.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.960
Yeah, Corey was amazing.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.000
Triple double on the court today from Corey Cott.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.720
It was Corey Cott.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.600
What did I say?

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.560
Corey didn't slip.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.600
There's a dude here named Geezer Butler.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.120
I didn't see anyone who looked like a Geezer.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.480
Is he a Motorhead?

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.040
Yes.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.400
Didn't see Geezer Butler,

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.400
but I did see Geezer Butler at the check-in,

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.600
the hotel.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.640
So I know he's here.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.520
Some people went to the show

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.560
and just didn't walk the line

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.840
to talk to plebs like us,

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.640
which I get.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.200
I get.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.720
I will say, having done it,

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.440
if I was one of the guests that was like on that

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.280
and they said, but if you don't want to,

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.880
I'd be like, stop there.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.440
Don't want to.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:25.760
I will.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.600
Mary Lou Hennert was great.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.920
We had literally two seconds with her.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.080
That was the amount of time given to us,

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:32.560
which is good.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.960
Which gave me the fucking yips in a major way.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.240
Imagine someone looking at you going,

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.800
you have two seconds to impress Mary Lou Hennert.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.800
I think maybe you need a codex to understand this episode

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.480
and how we interact with people who are famous.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:46.720
Okay.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.920
I think that I try to just treat them like,

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.240
you know, average Joe on the street.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:54.560
Yeah.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.800
Travis goes a little harder than that

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:00.080
in that he wants to be very good friends with them.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:00.800
No, no, no.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.520
Let me be clear.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.720
I have two modes.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.480
Mode one is this person might be my very good friend someday.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.280
And mode two is I'm never going to see this person again.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:09.760
Oh, okay.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.600
You also have mode three, which is full iceberg,

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.600
which is I'm going to grab Mark.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.360
I'm going to grab, there she goes.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360
Well, that's because where you freeze up.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.320
Justin's.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.560
Every so often, I do have a moment where I'm like,

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.040
oh, I got nervous meeting John Ross Bowie.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.760
And he said, hi, I'm John.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.720
I said, I'm John.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.080
No, I'm not John.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.600
Justin does a thing and you heard it with Mary Lou Hinner

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.440
that I think is really fun where he just kind of yells

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.840
as if the person's pulled a gun on her.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.320
Justin has a very controlled energy 99.9% of the time.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.240
Imagine, here's what it was.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.840
I was very nervous.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.600
I think the person I was most nervous about talking to

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.960
was Mary Lou Hinner because like,

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.640
in my mind, Mary Lou Hinner is legit.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:51.440
Yes.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.920
She's very, not to say these other people weren't legit,

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.160
but like Mary Lou Hinner's old school.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.720
She's been in the game, crushing it day in, day out

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.840
for a long time.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:00.880
She's wonderful.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.480
And I was very nervous about talking to her.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.160
And then this dude's like, you have two seconds.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.600
So here's what it was.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.000
I was very nervous about having two seconds

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.160
to get a good answer from Mary Lou Hinner.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.920
Mary Lou Hinner gives us a good answer.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.560
An amazing answer.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.720
For me, it was a huge victory because we had used two seconds

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.320
and we'd got an answer from Mary Lou Hinner

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.200
in that two seconds.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.200
So what you heard was the exaltation of like,

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.600
we had two seconds and we nailed it.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:25.920
Yeah.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.480
Oh, definitely.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.120
Because I think that if you had said to Mary Lou Hinner,

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.400
what's the most dangerous sea creature?

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.560
And she'd said, I don't know, sharks?

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.760
Like it wouldn't have landed the same as her just like,

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.600
stepping up and like Ursula the sea witch.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.280
If you want to tweet at these people to thank them

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.360
for being so nice to us, that'd be great.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:41.760
Yeah.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.760
Tweeted Steve Croft from 60 Minutes.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.400
Turned in a good performance.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.880
Barracuda.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.400
He said Barracuda and we were like,

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.240
oh, this will be and then the handlers were like,

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:52.720
you're done.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.960
Your time with Steve Croft is now over.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.920
And I made a joke like,

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.640
I thought I would get 60 minutes, but he was already gone.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.400
I want to say, and I don't know if you all heard this,

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.320
but worry about Al Roker.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:04.640
All right.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.600
So here's Al Roker.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.960
Okay, time to recap Al Roker.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.840
Time to get into this.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.000
Let me say a word on Al Roker.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.880
I don't think it helped as much as the handler person

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.640
thought it did to say, these are the McElroy brothers.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.600
They host Jimmy Buffett's favorite podcast.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.040
And that was how he entered.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.400
Cause he looked at me and said,

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.840
you don't have time for Al Roker.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.280
And I said, well, no.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.120
He said Al Roker doesn't have time for you.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.240
I have plenty of time.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.320
I can make time for Al.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.760
Listen, I'm going to do you all a favor.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.440
You're too busy for Al Roker.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.160
And I woke up this morning.

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.720
I was nervous that we would do a bad job.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.600
I should have been nervous about the fact that Al Roker

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.760
was mere hours away from melting my ass in front of everyone.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.920
Mark Helgenberger looked back and said,

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.520
oh, I don't want to talk to those boys.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.320
Look at him.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.920
His ass is melting.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.360
Look at the young one.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.280
His ass is dripping out of his slacks because Al Roker just.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.920
I think you listened to Roker poker.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.320
And I think he wanted vengeance.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.760
And I think he melted.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.800
He melted my ass.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.080
Al Roker was amazing.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.720
I was holding all of the sound equipment.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:22.080
And so all of his melts were directly placed towards me.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.040
To be fair.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.360
We look like the biggest fucking idiots.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.400
Like Griffin has.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.880
OK, so Griffin, the visual, if you want to get it,

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.240
Griffin has like the zoom and we all

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.560
have our stupid ass microphones plugged into it.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.480
And we're like holding another microphone.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:42.560
Like children doing a bit of like a segment

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.880
for their local elementary school news.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.320
Griffin is holding a laptop bag that we're not

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.640
using to store anything, but he is using it

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.280
as a base to lay the zoom on.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.800
We look like children.

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.680
I'm dressed in my Easter Sunday best.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.180
Yeah.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.120
It was earned.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.240
Yeah, he melted my ass.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.360
And the whole time you all were laughing, having a great time.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.040
I was getting your ass.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.960
I was getting my ass melted.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.840
But the whole time I was like, he's he is right.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.440
What are we even doing?

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.680
So we had we had a great time and Jimmy Buffett.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.200
So go see Jimmy.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.080
Thank you for having us.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.360
Escape to Margaritaville.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.120
Listen, I can't endorse it enough.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:25.680
It's so far.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.080
If you're in New York and you're like, you know what I want to do tonight?

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:34.000
I want to have fun and just kind of like enjoy a really fun night at the theater.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.360
This show made me feel better.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.440
Hamilton, Hamilton, some dark stuff happens.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.880
Yeah, some dark shit in Hamilton.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.400
There's no murders in this one.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:47.200
Well, except for the outside before when Al Roker murdered me in your ass, in my ass with his cruel words.

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.280
Anyway, go see Escape to Margaritaville.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.320
Musical.com is the web address to go get tickets, buy tickets, come to New York, see it.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.600
I guarantee you'll have fun.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:02.480
And thanks to everybody for letting us pretend to be somebody for a little bit.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.480
It's well put, Justin.

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:04.880
Thanks.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:14.880
Goodbye.
