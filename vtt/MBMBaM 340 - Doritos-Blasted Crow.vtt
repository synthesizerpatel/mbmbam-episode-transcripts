00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:31.840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:31.840 --> 00:47.920
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

00:47.920 --> 00:52.000
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Sherman McElroy.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.200
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

00:59.200 --> 01:05.360
And boys, here we are. A lot of folks said we wouldn't make it to 340,

01:05.360 --> 01:07.840
but here we are. This is it now, isn't it?

01:08.640 --> 01:09.600
Who said that?

01:10.240 --> 01:11.840
Looks like we made it.

01:11.840 --> 01:17.280
The haters and the critics and the critic cartoon with John Lovitz.

01:17.280 --> 01:22.720
I had an idea because we've been going at this for 340 episodes.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.720
We've been doing this for 19 years. Y'all think you can fight me? Fight these tiers?

01:26.720 --> 01:29.520
No, you can't because we've been going for so long,

01:29.520 --> 01:32.800
and the main criticism we've been getting from the critic cartoon

01:32.800 --> 01:36.320
is that it's just so stale, just extremely stale.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.400
Yeah, a lot of people have said it's stale now.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.600
They said it's crusty. They said it's got crust.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.760
They said it's like year-old wheat thins. I said I'd still fuck with year-old wheat thins.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.680
They're still wheat thins, like, hello.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.520
Especially if they're one of those rosemary and olive oil kind of things.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.760
Flavor blasted ones, absolutely, Travis. Pizza blasted wheat thins, yes.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.640
So, I had a sort of... I like Triscuits better.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.920
Whoa. Well, now this is a whole thing.

02:02.640 --> 02:09.920
Whoa. Triscuits are like a single use case food stuff.

02:09.920 --> 02:16.080
Triscuits are a better cheese conveyance than wheat thins.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.920
Well, yeah, just because there's more area upon which for the...

02:19.920 --> 02:23.440
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Justin, did you just say you don't fuck with cheese?

02:23.440 --> 02:26.880
I don't fuck with cheese on cracker. I like raw cheese. I don't fuck with that.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.880
You know that. You know that about me. I don't fuck with raw cheese.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.920
I didn't know that.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.840
I don't fuck with raw cheese.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.680
So, wait, it's got to be grilled or no? That's it? That's the only sort of...

02:35.680 --> 02:40.080
No, it's got to be melted. I don't like the texture of raw cheese.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.960
I like cooked cheese. Pizza, yes. Grilled cheese, yes.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.400
I got you a fucking fondue set for Christmas once.

02:46.400 --> 02:54.880
I did not know I was getting you essentially a mandatory cheese like conversion device.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.240
Right. That's exciting.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.920
That fondue set is the Ellis Island of my cheese.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.920
You have to come here first and get it in the Great American melting pot.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.160
Give me your tired. I'm hungry. Yeah.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.800
Literally.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.200
Okay, so listen fuckos.

03:11.200 --> 03:11.440
Okay.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.960
340 is so stale. People hate it.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.640
People like old cheese.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.480
Like old cheese.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.760
And so I had an idea to mix up. It can be like a special episode.

03:23.760 --> 03:29.280
Maybe we do it every 340. Next one is popping up with 680 here in 2024 or whatever.

03:31.120 --> 03:35.440
And that my idea is just to change the structure of the show a little bit.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.480
It's a very special episode.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.520
You know how TV shows do special episodes sometimes where like

03:39.520 --> 03:41.920
there was the Real Life Simpsons that one time.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.640
And then there was the episode of Simpsons where you saw Homer's Dick

03:46.640 --> 03:48.320
and everybody was so excited about it.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.800
And like it was a TV guide like catch it Homer's Dick.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.880
What's it going to be like? Weird? Probably.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.400
It's going to be like that. It'll be our Homer's Dick episode.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.320
And my idea for the structure, you guys ready for this?

03:58.320 --> 03:59.600
I think it's quite clever.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.600
Shows an hour long.

04:01.600 --> 04:01.920
Okay.

04:02.640 --> 04:08.640
What if we each have a 20 minute chunk of the podcast

04:08.640 --> 04:15.920
where we can do our own thing and we can kind of dial out a little bit and step back

04:16.560 --> 04:20.400
and just do what we want to do and just take a quick 20 minute break.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.320
And I'll volunteer to take this first chunk because I think that's only fair.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.600
And right now we're at four minutes.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.680
So right now I have 16 minutes.

04:27.680 --> 04:31.520
But during my 16 minute break I can get some things done that I can't get done

04:31.520 --> 04:36.160
because my baby has stopped sleeping like he's in a fucking Nightmare on Elm Street movie.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.680
And I can just like go cut my nails.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.080
You can take care of your dream warrior baby.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.600
I can take care of my dream warrior baby.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.560
Or I can take care of my me and sleep on the rug of my office.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.800
Let me tell you why this is an amazing idea, Griffin.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.360
Well, hold on.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.800
I want to tell everybody else I want to do.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.960
And that's I'll wake up with like 90 seconds left and cut my nails

04:56.960 --> 04:58.800
because I've been meaning to do it for like a week and a half.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.640
And I haven't been able to cut my nails for a week and a half.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.920
So dad lie hashtag dad life.

05:05.920 --> 05:10.480
I love this because it's like Arrested Development sort of take on it.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.680
Like we'll never get all the original guys in the same room again.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.560
So this is like a spin off episode.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.800
Not only that, but the most commonly heard feedback we get is

05:20.800 --> 05:23.520
I can't tell the difference between your voices.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.920
So like if we don't announce it,

05:25.920 --> 05:30.640
I think we could go long chunks of the show without talking.

05:30.640 --> 05:34.560
And I don't think if we just occasionally said like and I'm Justin

05:34.560 --> 05:37.040
and like whoever says it, it doesn't really matter.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.720
People will be like, yeah, this tracks.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.480
I think that was all three of them.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.880
And the chemistry between the three of us is excellent, right?

05:44.880 --> 05:50.640
That it is the it's the witch's cauldron in which our comedy magic is mixed up

05:51.200 --> 05:54.960
and we cast our spell like the fucking Sanderson sisters.

05:55.520 --> 06:00.160
But what about the individual one on one stuff?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.520
We don't get that anymore.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.040
So I'm going to go to fucking sleep on the floor of my office without a pillow

06:05.040 --> 06:08.160
or blanket or anything and I'm going to cut my nails

06:08.160 --> 06:11.920
and we'll see what like you guys have what you guys are bringing to the table.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.000
And then and then I'll come back.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.520
We'll do me and Travis and me and Justin.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.880
This is going to be weird when we hit where Yahoo answers would normally go.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.320
Or we just won't have it there.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.360
Yeah, yeah.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.920
Yeah, fucking shit.

06:25.920 --> 06:26.640
You're right.

06:26.640 --> 06:31.200
I wouldn't trust you guys to to get the Yahoo's going.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.120
I would trust you guys to do sad libs.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.880
I think it would handle it with dignity and aplomb.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.080
A dog could do sad libs, Travis.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.600
The work that you do could be easily recreated by a dog.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.880
How awesome would that be?

06:44.880 --> 06:45.840
It would be good, though.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.400
I might have to work that out.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.760
That is a dog's purpose.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.120
To do.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.480
Oh, listen to that.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.320
Listen, we got a volunteer doing it.

06:59.040 --> 06:59.520
I love that.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.440
Well, she just said boner.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.040
Oh, I love it.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.480
So that's a good one.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.520
These are better than mine.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.000
Oh, no.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.120
Yeah, these are really good.

07:09.120 --> 07:14.800
I do enjoy how much of Griffin's time we've used up with this prattling on.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.120
Yeah, I'm actually starting to feel because I was fine when it was like four minutes,

07:19.120 --> 07:20.640
but now it's like almost seven.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.680
And I could do so much stuff in the seven minutes that I no longer have anymore.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.560
I could go to heaven.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.120
You know what I mean?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.080
Yeah, I love that.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.760
Do a little closet kissing.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.720
Or I could just cut my fucking nails for once

07:32.720 --> 07:36.960
because it's getting pretty Guinness Book of World Records over here, folks.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.680
It's rough stuff.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.200
Just as a test from the last time you heard me talk,

07:41.200 --> 07:44.880
I just got up and left my microphone and just ran away.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.200
I kept my headphones on so I could hear you guys,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.880
but I was in the other room.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.520
I was just enjoying the moment.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.000
I don't want folks to get mad at us either and say like,

07:55.280 --> 07:56.560
you guys aren't taking this seriously.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.640
I did, this shows my everything.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.360
Are you kidding me?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.000
Are you kidding me right now?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.960
But I will just leave to go take a nap.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.440
I will take, yeah.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.360
All right, well, I'll start by carrying the load.

08:07.360 --> 08:14.080
Griffin, you obviously can't sleep now because you've only got 13 minutes, almost 12 minutes.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.400
You're right, I'll sacrifice, I'll sacrifice my block.

08:16.400 --> 08:16.960
Okay, great.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.680
I don't think we're gonna do your idea,

08:20.720 --> 08:22.640
but I would like to read a question if you guys are ready.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.240
Oh, all right.

08:24.240 --> 08:30.160
Okay, just I want you to know that I'm going to spread my 20 minutes throughout the show.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.480
So if there's like a 30 second chunk where you're like,

08:32.480 --> 08:35.440
Travis hasn't said anything for a while, that's my time.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.440
Okay, so just your usual-

08:37.440 --> 08:38.320
Just the usual thing.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.120
Sort of way.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.400
I'm probably gonna zone out and like check my Twitter replies

08:42.400 --> 08:44.640
to see what people have said about me and-

08:44.640 --> 08:45.600
Hey, what's the sound?

08:45.600 --> 08:46.080
What's that?

08:48.640 --> 08:49.040
Really?

08:50.960 --> 08:51.680
Really?

08:51.680 --> 08:52.880
I want a munch!

08:52.880 --> 08:53.680
Munch!

08:53.680 --> 08:54.180
Squad!

08:56.240 --> 08:58.400
I want to munch!

08:59.200 --> 08:59.700
Squad!

09:00.880 --> 09:04.320
Here's the thing about the Munch Squad, Justin, especially when you lead with it.

09:04.320 --> 09:09.520
I put about three to four hours of work into putting together a question list

09:09.520 --> 09:12.400
and then we lead off with a Munch Squad and it just, it just-

09:12.400 --> 09:16.560
I have told you so many fucking times, just save the ones we don't use.

09:16.560 --> 09:17.360
You never do it.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.360
But those are old, they get stale like old cheese, Justin.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.880
They're evergreen, Travis.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.040
Just recycle them if we don't use them.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.800
I've told you this a thousand times.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.040
Well, we just keep getting these topical problems.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.400
Shut up.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.120
If we-

09:29.120 --> 09:30.560
That's ridiculous.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.320
At the rate, at the rate we-

09:32.320 --> 09:34.320
Travis puts together a list of like 14 questions

09:34.320 --> 09:35.760
and then we answer three during the show.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.680
If we reused ones from the back catalog, we would be answering questions today like,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.920
I'm sad that Friends is ending.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.640
Yeah, I know everybody has-

09:45.200 --> 09:50.080
Everybody in America has probably felt a vibe this week of like,

09:50.080 --> 09:53.360
things are really good and I wonder if you're-

09:53.360 --> 09:53.840
That's weird.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.320
For me, it was opposite.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.360
No, I'm pretty sure everybody in America has felt this way

09:59.360 --> 10:03.760
and you haven't exactly known why, but this is about osmosis.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.120
It's about fluid intelligence.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.280
It's something about awareness that we all share

10:09.280 --> 10:14.880
and that awareness is that finally, after months of being denied it,

10:15.520 --> 10:18.800
finally Taco Bell has dropped it on us.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.080
That's right.

10:20.080 --> 10:26.480
The naked chicken chalupa is in stores nationwide as of Jan 26th.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.040
There-

10:29.040 --> 10:30.800
Here's the subhead of the press release.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
Well, explain what the-

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
The subhead of the press release explains it.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.640
The shell is the chicken.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.040
The chicken is the shell.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.240
When you eat a sandwich and you eat a taco,

10:44.240 --> 10:49.840
you are participating in an unspoken social agreement

10:50.480 --> 10:52.400
that there are parts of your food

10:52.400 --> 10:55.120
you're allowed to touch with your bare grubby, nasty naked hands.

10:55.120 --> 10:55.600
Correct.

10:57.040 --> 11:03.440
And it's the carbohydrate parts of the food experience.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.120
You can touch it right on the carbs.

11:05.120 --> 11:05.680
That's fine.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.560
And you can eat where you touched it on the carbs and that's fine

11:08.560 --> 11:10.560
because we all agree that that's okay.

11:10.560 --> 11:16.960
That's okay. This and its bastard brother, the Double Down,

11:16.960 --> 11:20.880
is such a perversion of that rule

11:20.880 --> 11:24.720
because that's the part of the food that is not good to touch.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.360
Not pleasant.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.240
It's not good to touch.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.280
That's not good to-

11:27.280 --> 11:28.240
No, it feels pleasant.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.760
I'm sure it feels pleasant or whatever,

11:29.760 --> 11:33.840
but that's not the touching part of the food.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.960
It's not the carbohydrate.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.560
Quick sidebar before we talk about this.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.400
I'm sorry that this podcast is like it is sometimes.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.120
Quick sidebar.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.800
When you guys are driving and your wife is in the passenger seat

11:46.800 --> 11:49.520
and you're on a road trip and you stop for food on the way,

11:50.400 --> 11:55.200
Sydney had this thing where she would unwrap the food halfway

11:55.760 --> 11:59.600
so I could hold it in a wrapper while I ate the food.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.680
And after 10 years, I finally told her,

12:02.320 --> 12:03.440
that's insane.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.040
I just need to hold the sandwich like just the whole thing.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.960
Do you guys run into this issue and where do you stand on it?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.400
As long as we're talking about touching food.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.480
My problem is that if I do that,

12:21.280 --> 12:25.840
I will be very cognizant of the fact that I don't want to eat the wrapper

12:26.560 --> 12:30.640
and seem like some sort of comedy fat man.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.760
There's nothing worse than like pulling away

12:33.760 --> 12:36.000
and seeing a bite mark into the paper.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.640
In their paper, but I already swallowed it and it was like,

12:38.640 --> 12:42.240
damn, that checkers paper though, it's got like a spice to it.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.000
That's the problem right there.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Give me some flavored edible paper.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.880
You see people like that on My Strange Addiction all the time.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.560
You know, people don't eat their mattresses.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.240
The first bite is always by accident.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.520
My Strange Addiction, the original Munch Squad.

12:55.520 --> 13:01.680
I want a Munch a mattress.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.880
Justin, to answer your question,

13:02.880 --> 13:06.640
if I am traveling, my food of choice is always

13:06.640 --> 13:10.480
and will always be the Dairy Queen chicken strip basket

13:10.480 --> 13:12.960
with a gravy and toast within it.

13:12.960 --> 13:18.480
Are you fucking kidding me that when you're operating a motor vehicle,

13:18.480 --> 13:21.440
your food of choice is a dippable?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.160
It's a dippable?

13:22.160 --> 13:25.760
I will drive 40 to 50 miles out of my way

13:25.760 --> 13:28.800
to find a Dairy Queen if I'm on the road.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.040
Yeah.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.160
But it's a dippable?

13:30.720 --> 13:32.880
But it's also got gravy in it, Justin.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.880
How often do you find gravy in a fast food experience?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.280
If you're eating fast food while you're driving,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.680
you have to let go of the fact that you will not have,

13:41.680 --> 13:44.400
like I'm living ketchup free on this one.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.080
This one's a ketchup free-mish

13:46.080 --> 13:49.040
because I can't be dipping while I'm driving.

13:49.040 --> 13:55.120
Anyway, unless you've practiced it a bajillion times, which I have.

13:55.120 --> 13:55.600
All right.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.680
Did we ever tell the story of when we were doing

13:57.680 --> 14:02.800
the Pacific Northwest shows in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver,

14:02.800 --> 14:05.040
and it was Riley's birthday and she was with us,

14:05.040 --> 14:08.720
and so you stopped at a DQ and we got her ice cream cake

14:08.720 --> 14:14.880
that was hard as cinder block and we ate a micrometer of it,

14:14.880 --> 14:20.320
and then Travis tried to give the cake back to the people at the register

14:20.320 --> 14:24.480
as if to say, you can hand out free slices to folks if you want,

14:25.360 --> 14:28.320
and then I think we just sort of set it on top of the garbage can

14:28.320 --> 14:30.560
and got back on that lonely road.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.680
Happy birthday, Riley.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.240
I do want to note, I wasn't trying to get a refund

14:34.240 --> 14:35.680
for the unused portion of the cake.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.160
No, Travis went up there and said,

14:38.160 --> 14:39.680
you guys sell ice cream here, huh?

14:39.680 --> 14:42.000
How about you give this ice cream away for free?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.280
And they said, no.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.320
And he said, well, we'll throw it away if not.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.000
And they said, welcome to DQ.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.400
We don't care where the ice cream ends up as long as it's not here.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.200
So the naked chalupa is the question on everybody's mind.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.400
The naked chicken chalupa.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.560
Taco Bell is coming unshelled with its latest food innovation.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.160
It's coming unspooled.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.320
It's becoming unraveled.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.280
Coming in the form of the first taco shell made entirely

15:07.280 --> 15:12.960
of marinated all white crispy chicken as if history has its eyes

15:12.960 --> 15:13.680
on Taco Bell.

15:15.520 --> 15:20.000
First we won the space race, and now we've won the taco shell,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.280
but it's chicken race.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.240
No, that means you lost the Earth race

15:24.240 --> 15:25.920
if you made a chicken shell.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.720
That's what I have to say about it.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.680
What does Marisa Thalberg, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell Corp,

15:31.680 --> 15:32.080
have to say?

15:32.080 --> 15:33.600
Well, she has to say this.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.080
Something that is delicious yet different

15:36.080 --> 15:38.320
is bound to ruffle some feathers.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.840
Some might even cluck their tongues at it.

15:41.840 --> 15:47.120
However, fuck this is funny, however, we feel confident

15:47.120 --> 15:49.920
that once our fans get a taste of the naked chicken chalupa,

15:49.920 --> 15:54.080
they're going to understand exactly why this is our next big fun

15:54.080 --> 15:55.920
and craveable innovation.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.240
Following the footsteps of the Doritos Locos taco five years ago

16:00.240 --> 16:00.800
and the queso lupa.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.840
Oh my god, the slow march of time.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.880
It is a nightmare.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.880
You could tell they kind of fail it though, right?

16:06.880 --> 16:09.440
Like, listen, we need another hit.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.800
We need a hit so bad.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.000
We need a hit.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.080
It's been five years since the taco, taco loco, taco Dorito taco.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.080
The shell, what's the shell?

16:18.880 --> 16:22.800
Well, it's four ounces of marinated all white meat,

16:22.800 --> 16:24.400
antibiotic free chicken,

16:24.400 --> 16:27.440
kicked up with bold Mexican spices and seasoning

16:27.440 --> 16:28.800
and it's packed with fresh.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.360
Now, they described the chicken there.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.920
The clause that is missing from that sentence, of course,

16:33.920 --> 16:37.840
is that has been bent into a fucking taco shell.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.400
Into a ghoulish smile.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.600
Also, there's diced ripe tomatoes,

16:43.600 --> 16:45.600
cheddar cheese and creamy avocado ranch.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.720
Justin, can I tell you why I am just the most fucking pissed off

16:50.720 --> 16:52.560
at this press release?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.440
Jeez.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.280
Why are you so angry?

16:55.280 --> 16:58.880
In the first sentence, they chicken pun twice.

16:59.440 --> 16:59.840
Yeah.

16:59.840 --> 17:00.320
And then they sort of drop the cookie.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.080
And then nothing.

17:02.080 --> 17:02.400
Yeah.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.440
I'm in the desert right now looking for a good chicken pun oasis,

17:07.440 --> 17:08.320
but there is none.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.880
I do want to just point something out very quickly.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.080
Please do this.

17:12.080 --> 17:15.600
On the antibiotic free section, there's an asterisk.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.320
Horrifyingly, there's an asterisk.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.760
And if we scroll down the end of the press release,

17:19.760 --> 17:23.760
it says antibiotic chicken in this case means chicken raised

17:23.760 --> 17:26.240
without antibiotics important to human medicine.

17:26.240 --> 17:26.960
Okay.

17:26.960 --> 17:27.920
So, okay.

17:27.920 --> 17:28.480
All right.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.000
So, what you mean-

17:30.000 --> 17:32.560
This chicken does not have rubella.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.600
Good, good.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.000
So it doesn't have-

17:34.000 --> 17:36.320
We can give this chicken penicillin.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.120
Don't you worry.

17:37.120 --> 17:37.840
Okay, great.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.960
But other ones, yeah.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.240
But it's antibiotic free.

17:40.240 --> 17:40.960
You got it.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.240
Eat your chicken, tubby.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.320
And you're going to have to enjoy it on a wing and a prayer.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.560
If this is the last episode of our show,

17:48.560 --> 17:50.640
there's not a Bim Bam 341.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.320
I want everybody to know it is because I have walked into the taco bell

17:54.320 --> 17:55.520
that is around the corner from my house.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.920
And I did have a bomb strapped to my chest.

17:58.640 --> 18:04.240
And I did demand that they make me a Doritos Locos chicken chalupa mistake taco.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.600
If you think that isn't fucking common, you don't know these motherfuckers.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.960
Can you blast it and then crunch wrap it?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.040
Sir, I can't look at my chest.

18:13.040 --> 18:13.840
Look at the device.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.400
Crunch wrap and blast the chicken shell.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.360
I have nothing left to live for.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.240
I'm in a taco bell ordering food hacks.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.840
Spray the chicken with Doritos dust.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.640
And then wrap it in cinnamon sugar cap and crunch.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.280
Wrap it!

18:29.280 --> 18:31.120
Why are you having trouble with this?

18:31.120 --> 18:34.880
That's a flavor that'll give them something to squawk about.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.040
That would be good to demand it in a crunch wrap.

18:37.040 --> 18:41.200
And they say, well, sir, to do that, we'd have to have a flat chicken piece.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.760
Like, yeah, I know.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.560
Can you imagine?

18:45.200 --> 18:48.320
Can you imagine flat chicken feeling peckish?

18:49.200 --> 18:49.680
Stop it.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.200
Travis, take your 20 minutes.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.200
This is something to crow about.

18:57.200 --> 18:57.840
It's in there.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.320
I haven't.

18:58.320 --> 18:58.960
Yeah, that's right.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.280
We use all natural antibiotic free crows.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.560
Not like a rooster crows.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.080
Do you want a bite of this?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.680
Yes, you coggledoodle do.

19:09.680 --> 19:14.560
If antibiotic free means some antibiotics, then naked chicken chalupa

19:14.560 --> 19:16.640
could certainly mean naked crows chalupa.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.960
These are crows that spent some time with chickens like during spring break.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.320
Hey, listen, I don't want to panic anybody.

19:26.320 --> 19:26.960
Yeah, Reggie?

19:26.960 --> 19:31.360
Reggie, I've been the lead food scientist here for how long?

19:32.800 --> 19:33.600
About 10 years.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.200
You've really been fucking it up.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.240
Yeah, listen, yesterday I killed a crow.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.800
And when I carved its breast meat from its bottom.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.920
I carved the flesh.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.680
I collected the bones for the ritual.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.960
I collected the bones for the ritual.

19:46.960 --> 19:47.840
I carved the breast meat.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.280
Normally I would discard it.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.440
And then I came upon a terrifying realization.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.520
It was a perfect yield.

19:53.520 --> 19:58.160
The breasts of the crow had formed a taco shell.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.640
This is a sign from the ancients.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.360
Margaret, can you bread this shit?

20:04.480 --> 20:08.960
Bread this for once and Margaret, we're going to need more crows.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.400
You are thinking far too far outside of the bun.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.040
You need to think a little bit closer to the bun.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.120
You need to think a little bit closer to the bun.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.600
You're as far from the bun as like you're on some like

20:21.600 --> 20:25.680
Lovecraftian, like Miskatonic University.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.160
That's how fucking far you are from the bun.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.680
You need to leave the university

20:29.680 --> 20:32.960
and move just like a few miles closer to the bun, please.

20:32.960 --> 20:37.440
People forget that like outside the bun encompasses all existence

20:37.440 --> 20:39.680
that is not contained within the bun.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.800
There are no borders on being outside the bun.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.080
Limits are what keeps society on rails, Taco Bell.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.920
Get back near the bun, please.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.360
Please keep the bun in eyesight.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.160
Seventh or eighth meal shit at this point.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.360
We're on the eighth meal.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.720
Everything's topsy turvy.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.120
Get back on the bun, Taco Bell.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.520
I want Taco Bell needs to way over correct

20:59.520 --> 21:00.960
and their next thing is like we made a hamburger.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.960
We're sorry, we're sorry, we're sorry, we're sorry.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.520
We're in the bun.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.080
We're in the bun.

21:04.080 --> 21:04.640
We're in the bun.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.280
We're in the bun.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.040
Let's just keep this fucking fast food train rolling real quick

21:09.040 --> 21:11.520
because I have a really good Yahoo here from Brooks Oglesby.

21:11.520 --> 21:11.760
Thank you.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.520
It's from Yahoo Answers user Rebecca.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.560
Altaba user, it's just going to take me a while.

21:16.560 --> 21:22.240
Altaba user Rebecca says, asks, what is Wendy's policy when you're lost?

21:23.440 --> 21:26.160
Is it true that if you go through the drive-through at Wendy's

21:26.160 --> 21:29.040
and say you're lost, they have to give you a free cheeseburger?

21:30.400 --> 21:30.800
What?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.360
Hey, I don't know where I am.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.240
And I thought I was supposed to be here, but I'm not.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.680
So yes, sir, pull around.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.320
You know the drill.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.120
Get your free cheeseburger.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.160
But not directions?

21:45.600 --> 21:45.920
No.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.720
No, no, no, no.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.040
Well, look under the bun, Justin.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.680
Where's I-10?

21:51.680 --> 21:53.360
I'm trying to get on the 10.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.960
Oh, good luck with that.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.080
Here's your cheeseburger.

21:56.080 --> 21:56.640
No charge.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.560
Having a rough day, huh?

21:58.560 --> 21:59.920
It can be scary being lost.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.080
It can be scary being lost.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.200
What if you're a little kid?

22:03.200 --> 22:04.480
I can't find my parents.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.120
Oh, shit.

22:06.080 --> 22:06.560
Here you go.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.520
I'm sorry about your folks.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.200
You don't even have a car.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.320
Do you have a phone right now?

22:13.440 --> 22:14.000
Shit.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.040
Can I use your phone?

22:15.040 --> 22:15.360
No.

22:15.360 --> 22:15.920
No.

22:15.920 --> 22:16.480
Here's a burger.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.200
Here's a burger, though.

22:19.040 --> 22:25.280
We laugh, but can you, Justin and Griffin, can you tell me 100%

22:26.080 --> 22:30.000
that Wendy's will not give you a free cheeseburger if you are lost?

22:30.000 --> 22:30.560
That's what I'm saying.

22:30.560 --> 22:30.880
I don't know.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.600
Dave Thomas is a kind soul, probably.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.240
I don't know.

22:34.240 --> 22:34.880
I'm just saying.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.560
I think Dave Thomas probably, if I remember this urban legend correctly,

22:38.560 --> 22:40.400
Dave Thomas used to hand deliver the hamburger.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.560
You would pull up and say you're lost.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.200
There would be a beat and then your passenger door would open.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.640
Hey, you having a little bit of trouble?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.520
Like a Saint Bernard.

22:49.520 --> 22:53.120
He would come find you and bring you back to the Wendy's.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.160
Wrapped around his neck.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.160
And you had to eat it off his neck.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.520
You couldn't remove it from his neck.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.520
He was a nasty, nasty old man.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.320
Now the problem is that once Dave Thomas saved you,

23:04.320 --> 23:08.000
you then owed him a life debt and you would have to come work at Wendy's

23:08.000 --> 23:09.440
for a fair wage.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.480
This was not taking advantage of people.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.800
That was just how he hired people.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.240
And that way you were never lost again

23:16.240 --> 23:18.320
because you just knew you worked at Wendy's.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.640
Now sometimes Dave Thomas would wear his neck burger on like a long chain.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.840
So it just like sort of be greasy on his bare chest.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.480
And so you'd be in there and you'd be like, I'm lost.

23:30.480 --> 23:35.200
I'm trying to get on Research Highway.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.440
But then Dave Thomas is there.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.360
He's like, but now you're found.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.000
And he just sort of puts his chest like on you.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.520
I know where you're at, Dave.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.240
I don't know where I am.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.520
I know where you are.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.160
You're home.

23:46.160 --> 23:46.880
I know where you are.

23:46.880 --> 23:47.680
I know where you're going to be.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.480
You're home right now.

23:49.040 --> 23:49.680
Wendy's?

23:49.680 --> 23:50.480
That's right.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.200
Shackle noise.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.040
Now I'm actually doing gluten-free.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.720
So can I get a cup of chili?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.480
Oh, yeah.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.040
Hold on.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.760
Oh, why do we serve it so hot?

24:05.760 --> 24:06.720
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

24:06.720 --> 24:10.720
Uh, listen, I'm a good guy.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.240
You're not going to want to eat the chili.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.360
It's just cut up hamburgers that we couldn't sell.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.400
You knew that, right?

24:16.400 --> 24:16.720
Okay.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.240
It's a cut up hamburgers and ketchup and we make it real hot.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.760
I don't even, we don't even put beans in it.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.200
I don't know how the fuck they get in there.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.440
Where are these beans coming from?

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
We've discovered some sort of alchemy.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.280
It turns salt packets.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.280
They just turn into beans in the cauldron.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.640
I think these kids will love this.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.800
Did you know that there was no beans in Wendy's chili?

24:40.800 --> 24:41.760
You just thought there were.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.960
And it's one of those, like, reality distortion things.

24:45.840 --> 24:46.160
Huh.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.640
During a meeting at work yesterday afternoon, I noticed a tear.

24:52.160 --> 24:52.480
Okay.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.080
I thought it was tear, but that wouldn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.560
I noticed a tear in the seat of co-worker's pants.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.960
Somebody cried in my co-worker's butt.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.720
A single tear in their pants.

25:02.720 --> 25:06.160
It was vertical four or five inches long, but very narrow.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.320
You could see his black underwear, but nothing revealing after the meeting.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.560
I was going to see his balls or whatever.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.920
No balls on this one.

25:14.640 --> 25:18.320
After the meeting, I was going to tell him about it, but I decided not to.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.120
So he wouldn't worry about it for the rest of the day.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.000
I figured he would find it as soon as he got home and tell him about it.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.280
Would only embarrass him when he couldn't do anything about it.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.240
Am I good or sure?

25:28.240 --> 25:29.120
I've mentioned it to him.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.520
That's from Tom torn in the twin cities.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.880
Or Tom.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.600
Or Tom.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.800
It looks like Tom on my screen.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.400
Our end, man.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.800
They trick you sometimes because it just looks like the M shape.

25:38.800 --> 25:45.360
Can we lay down a blanket so we and then we can like just sort of wipe any future questions

25:45.360 --> 25:49.120
like this just off this light and lay down a blanket like my friend had a booger or my

25:49.120 --> 25:53.760
friend had some stuff in their TV or my friend, you know, and just say, like, always tell them

25:54.560 --> 25:57.200
you always you may not want to hear it.

25:57.200 --> 26:03.120
It may be challenging to hear it, but you need to fucking get your shit right.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.760
And I don't know what this guy does except maybe he goes home.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.440
Everybody's always, always, always, always, always, always looking for an excuse to take

26:09.440 --> 26:10.240
a half day at work.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.640
And this is this is this is decent justification for sure.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.600
Always, always.

26:15.600 --> 26:20.320
If I have shit in my teeth, tell me fucking tell me if I have a big just just snozzberry

26:20.320 --> 26:23.280
in there, just tell me about it so I can go deal with my shit.

26:23.280 --> 26:29.440
Also, like, I do things like there's things you can do in a context that often like let

26:29.440 --> 26:34.080
him put a couple of safety pins in there or maybe some fucking masking tape, jacket around

26:34.080 --> 26:34.880
his waist.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.160
Yeah, yeah, tight jacket around the waist safety pins.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.480
No matter what, it's going to be bringing back like a mid aughts hot topic look that

26:42.480 --> 26:44.160
is really popping off again.

26:44.160 --> 26:48.880
But I really like the question askers justification of like I didn't want him to worry about it

26:48.880 --> 26:49.920
for the rest of the day.

26:49.920 --> 26:55.440
So instead you let him get home and and realize that and think about like all the lunges he

26:55.440 --> 26:58.960
did and all the times he stood in front of people without knowing it.

26:58.960 --> 27:01.200
So now we can worry about it for the rest of his life.

27:02.160 --> 27:07.040
What if but like the Bible says you should address the plank in your own eye before you

27:07.600 --> 27:10.320
worry about the dust in your neighbor's eye.

27:10.320 --> 27:15.360
What if you were like, hey, listen, you have a small tear in the back of your pants and

27:15.360 --> 27:18.880
they spin around on you and you're like, you're not wearing pants.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.560
You forgot pants today.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.440
You have a two by four in your eye.

27:23.440 --> 27:23.840
What?

27:23.840 --> 27:24.480
What?

27:24.480 --> 27:24.960
Oh, God.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.760
And also you just discovered that you're back in high school because you never finished

27:29.760 --> 27:30.560
that one class.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.840
So you didn't really graduate and you have to take that math test again.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.680
But you don't remember any of the math.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.200
Well, why am I the only one who has that dream?

27:40.240 --> 27:41.680
That's not a it's not a dream.

27:41.680 --> 27:42.720
This was a real scenario.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.600
Justin was addressing.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.520
Yeah, I'm just trying to I'm trying to figure out what scenario you might find yourself

27:47.520 --> 27:52.160
in where you're not wearing any pants and you didn't know it until someone said it.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.400
It was just kind of a funny joke for our podcast, Trav.

27:55.760 --> 27:56.720
Sorry you got so hung up.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.120
No, I like it.

27:59.120 --> 27:59.840
I like this, though.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.320
I liked it.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.000
That's Travis' pitch to a fun new game.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.680
And that's what if these questions are dreams?

28:04.240 --> 28:07.680
And it's an advice happening we've never really explored before, which is like, oh,

28:07.680 --> 28:08.480
you dreamed this.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.960
It didn't it didn't happen.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.760
You dreamt it.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.560
So you're fine.

28:14.560 --> 28:19.280
That would be a good tack to take with your co-worker like, hey, these are tearing your

28:19.280 --> 28:19.600
pants.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.240
But before you get worried, none of this is real.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.320
Kiss me.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.120
Kiss me right now.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.120
Hope your teeth are falling out.

28:27.120 --> 28:27.600
Better hurry.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.640
Eat that stapler.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.600
It's marshmallows.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.640
Justin, can you do the next question after this one?

28:32.640 --> 28:35.120
Because I love it and I want to do it right now.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.400
The one after it is great, too.

28:36.400 --> 28:37.600
Travis really did a good job.

28:38.400 --> 28:42.000
Yeah, it's too bad we're only going to get to do like one more of these because we spent

28:42.000 --> 28:43.520
a lot of time talking about nasty chicken.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.560
I work in an office with the rest of my company.

28:46.560 --> 28:51.200
And at the end of the day, we exchanged pleasantries saying good night, have a good weekend, etc.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.120
However, sometimes my brain interrupts these rote actions and tells me, blow them a kiss.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.240
Hey, blow them a kiss.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.520
I've never done it.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.200
Thank God for impulse control.

29:09.200 --> 29:13.040
But the fleeing thought springs into my head up to a couple of times a month.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.600
How do I fight these thoughts down and make it go away?

29:15.600 --> 29:19.120
Or should I embrace this freedom from standard and dive in?

29:19.120 --> 29:21.040
That's from neurotic Newark.

29:21.040 --> 29:21.760
Holy shit.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.480
Is there a method?

29:24.480 --> 29:25.760
Is there a way?

29:25.760 --> 29:32.720
Is there a way to blow a kiss that is not childish?

29:33.920 --> 29:37.200
Has anybody ever blown a kiss and been like, mm, cool?

29:37.200 --> 29:38.560
Or like, mm, professional?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.480
Or mm, adult sexy?

29:40.480 --> 29:44.160
I think if you practice it well enough, you could do, like, blow a kiss into finger guns.

29:44.160 --> 29:44.800
Like, mwah.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.440
I just did it.

29:46.080 --> 29:46.640
I just did it.

29:46.640 --> 29:51.840
And I think if you just, like, kiss your hand and then, like, very, very slightly extend it,

29:51.840 --> 29:57.280
you don't, like, create a fucking launch pad that you then boost your kiss off of.

29:57.280 --> 30:00.000
Like, some sort of VTOL plane.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.240
If you just, like, and then just sort of very lightly, don't even lay it flat.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.000
Just, like, take it away from your face.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.040
That's kind of a cool look.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.680
Like, I'm doing, I know you can't see it.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.480
But it does kind of look cool how I'm doing it.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.080
Maybe you blow a kiss in your right hand.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.120
And what's that in your left hand?

30:15.120 --> 30:15.620
A dove.

30:16.160 --> 30:16.560
Okay.

30:16.560 --> 30:17.120
That's good.

30:17.120 --> 30:17.600
Just direct.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.680
I don't want you to have to have a bird.

30:19.680 --> 30:26.240
I think the only context in which blowing a kiss is acceptable for a professional setting

30:26.240 --> 30:31.040
is if your job is James Bond villain and you just put him in a trap that's supposed to kill him.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.720
If you do that and you blow him a kiss, it's, like, very, that's very evil.

30:34.720 --> 30:35.440
It's really cool.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.240
Very taunting.

30:36.240 --> 30:36.800
I love that.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.680
But other than that, no.

30:40.320 --> 30:40.880
Ever.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.120
Oh.

30:41.120 --> 30:41.680
I'm pretty sure.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.160
Dang.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.920
I feel like you didn't really think about it.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.420
Okay.

30:47.120 --> 30:47.920
Bond villain.

30:47.920 --> 30:48.800
Killing James Bond.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.360
For sure.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.400
That one's definite.

30:50.400 --> 30:50.900
Yeah.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.520
Maybe if you just fired someone and you're a real jerk.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.760
You'd be like, mm, mm, mm.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.800
That's good.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.920
I thought that's what you were going to say, but you said a real jerk.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.920
Real jerk, but yeah, that's a good one.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.800
That's a good one, too.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.240
Or it could just be, like, your new thing.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.320
I think it could be cute.

31:14.320 --> 31:14.880
I don't know.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.960
I mean, it would be a fucking zag, though, right?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.480
I mean, it would be a zag and a half.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.760
That's a zag and a half.

31:20.320 --> 31:24.880
I like this idea of your brain is, like, this friend of yours who, like, always comes up

31:24.880 --> 31:26.800
with suggestions and it's, like, well, you know what?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.400
You could try blowing him a kiss.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.120
And it's, like, no.

31:29.120 --> 31:34.400
It's, like, maybe if just once you tried it, your friend would be, like, okay, thank you

31:34.400 --> 31:36.000
for acknowledging my input.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.880
I was wrong.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.400
Or maybe it is the way to go.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.400
Maybe your brain knows better.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.640
Maybe your subconscious is, like, blow him a kiss.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.040
You do it, and suddenly, like, ooh, I like Todd's new thing.

31:47.040 --> 31:47.680
And what's that?

31:47.680 --> 31:48.960
Suddenly, Todd's CEO.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.240
Fucking a thousand years ago, fucking dark ages move in bam.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.320
It was just the three of us sitting around a stick in a swamp.

31:58.320 --> 32:09.200
And somebody was, like, I conducted mine self with mine serf and felt the extraordinary

32:09.200 --> 32:15.200
urge to grasp his hand firmly and shake it violently.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.520
Should I embrace this?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.120
Neurotic and Newark.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.240
And it's, like, that first person was just, like, give me that hand, sucker.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.280
And he grabbed it and shook it.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.640
It was, like, this is good.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.200
I like it.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.640
I like it.

32:28.640 --> 32:29.280
I like this.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.840
I don't see why this has to be any different from that.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.120
Give me that little paw.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.720
What are you doing?

32:35.680 --> 32:36.400
Are we fighting?

32:36.400 --> 32:38.160
No, we're not fighting, bud.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.120
I want to go.

32:39.120 --> 32:39.600
You can.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.040
I'm going to let you go.

32:41.040 --> 32:41.760
Hold on.

32:41.760 --> 32:42.560
I'm going to let you go.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.200
I'm just going to.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.840
Hey, look, I feel like we just did business.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.560
Yeah, I know.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.120
Yeah.

32:47.120 --> 32:47.440
Yeah.

32:47.440 --> 32:47.840
I know.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.720
It's because I grabbed you.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.760
A bit of advice on this advice show.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.520
What about the first time somebody did a fist bump?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.680
Like, oh, god, he's going to punch me in the stomach.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.640
No, no, no.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.440
No, you don't understand.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.080
Or a high five.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.080
Are you going to smack me on top of the head?

33:00.080 --> 33:00.800
No, friend.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.600
No, no, friend.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.120
A bit of advice.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.560
If this is going to be a new thing,

33:04.560 --> 33:08.240
if you're going to insert, you have to do it so you can't

33:08.240 --> 33:10.720
acknowledge that you've just done a new thing.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.160
You have to do it like, yeah, goodnight.

33:12.800 --> 33:17.280
And then go back to your desk and let them soak it in

33:17.280 --> 33:20.640
without you doing it and then kind of watching their reaction.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.680
You can't acknowledge that this is a new thing you're trying.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.560
This has to be a thing you've done a million times.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.320
You don't even think about it anymore.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.480
This is just your thing.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.320
I found the way to describe the physical act of this kiss

33:34.320 --> 33:35.280
blow that I'm talking about.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.200
Like, the cool, confident kiss blow.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.000
That's, again, just a very slight, like, just barely hand

33:40.000 --> 33:40.800
away from it.

33:40.800 --> 33:45.040
And imagine that you're Glenn Close and you've just met

33:45.040 --> 33:47.200
an enthusiastic young fan.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.160
And you're just like, you're walking out of the fucking club

33:52.160 --> 33:54.000
where you've just been bumping it all night because you're

33:54.000 --> 33:55.600
Glenn Close and you know how to tear shit up.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.840
And you see a fan on the street and they're like,

33:57.840 --> 34:00.560
Glenn, Glenn, you're so great.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.040
I'm so glad that you're getting back on Broadway.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.720
The kiss blow that she does in that moment of just, like,

34:08.720 --> 34:10.240
she doesn't go through it all the way.

34:10.240 --> 34:13.280
It's just, oh, and she takes her hand away from her face

34:13.280 --> 34:13.840
just a little bit.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.320
You're like, oh, Glenn, Glenn, you've got me.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.960
That's sort of the style I'm talking about.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.960
Griffin, Justin, I feel like we are missing a big component

34:22.960 --> 34:24.160
here that we're not addressing.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.640
Because we keep talking about the kiss.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.680
I don't think that's the weird part.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.560
I think it's the blowing.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.120
It's the blowing.

34:31.120 --> 34:31.840
That's what I'm talking about.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.920
Omit, omit the blow.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.640
Just kiss that hand and pull it away a little bit,

34:36.640 --> 34:37.680
like Glenn would do.

34:38.640 --> 34:39.520
But is that the same?

34:39.520 --> 34:41.120
Does that still count as blowing a kiss?

34:41.120 --> 34:42.240
That's just, mwah.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.760
But it's not the, whew.

34:43.760 --> 34:47.120
You know, does it still count as blowing a kiss if you are

34:47.120 --> 34:49.920
just kissing without the correspondent?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.920
Because then the kiss is just hanging in the air

34:51.920 --> 34:54.640
an inch in front of you until you blow it at them.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.800
There is a terrible risk that I had not calculated

34:56.800 --> 34:57.840
until this exact moment.

34:58.560 --> 35:02.560
If you're in a professional setting and you kiss your hand

35:02.560 --> 35:04.240
and then you blow the kiss over to the other person,

35:04.800 --> 35:08.080
if they catch that kiss and put it on their cheek,

35:08.080 --> 35:11.200
they have just power played you so fucking bad

35:11.200 --> 35:13.360
that you're probably going to have to like quit

35:13.360 --> 35:15.760
and give them your job and sign over the business to them

35:15.760 --> 35:18.000
or something, depending on what your responsibilities are.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.560
But you will never get the metaphorical ball back

35:22.560 --> 35:23.360
in that relationship.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
You're going to have to butterfly kiss them

35:26.000 --> 35:26.800
if that happens.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.320
Yeah, that's your only option.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.600
Or what if they put it on their mouth?

35:33.040 --> 35:33.680
You're fired.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.520
You've been fired at that point.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.160
You've been fired from your job.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.720
Hey guys, I just really quick, because I do think

35:38.720 --> 35:39.600
we should go to the money zone.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.760
But I did just Google Glenn Close

35:41.760 --> 35:43.360
and I'm looking at her Wikipedia page.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.280
First of all, she's 69 years old.

35:45.280 --> 35:45.780
Nice.

35:46.480 --> 35:51.280
And on her Wikipedia page is,

35:51.280 --> 35:52.240
and I'm not making this up,

35:52.240 --> 35:53.360
there's like in that little sidebar,

35:53.360 --> 35:56.480
it's like Glenn Close at the Albert Nobbs premiere in 2012.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.440
She looks amazing.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.840
Tells me all about her alma mater,

36:00.720 --> 36:03.840
her many spouses, her kid that she has, her parents.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.200
And then right under that is,

36:05.200 --> 36:06.960
and you can Google this if you don't believe me,

36:06.960 --> 36:08.720
just a picture of her signature.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.920
So I think I'm going to probably steal her identity, I guess.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.160
Yeah.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.080
Hi, I'm Glenn Close now.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.040
Catch me if you can.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.000
I'm Glenn Far.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.720
Catch you if you can, Tom Hanks.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.880
Because I'm Glenn Close now, motherfucker.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.480
The name of this show could be changed to,

36:22.480 --> 36:24.480
finally, to My Brother, My Brother, and Glenn.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.760
Or Miss Close.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.240
I mean, you'll make us call you Glenn Close.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.200
Yeah, 30 under 30 media luminary.

36:33.200 --> 36:33.920
Glenn Close.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.960
Glenn Close.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.320
All right, let's go to the money zone.

36:36.320 --> 36:48.400
Let's go to the money zone, I'm done.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.400
Hey, can I tell you guys about Nature Box?

36:50.400 --> 36:50.880
Hell yeah.

36:50.880 --> 36:51.680
I wish you would.

36:52.240 --> 36:57.760
Because I'm on that bad, bad baby sleep schedule,

36:57.760 --> 37:00.080
and now I snack to survive.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.200
Every, like, I eat those Big Island Pineapple,

37:05.200 --> 37:09.120
like they are fucking rings from Sonic the Hedgehog,

37:09.120 --> 37:10.880
and they are actually keeping me alive.

37:11.760 --> 37:16.560
It is a wonderful service where you go to naturebox.com

37:16.560 --> 37:19.280
and you pick the snacks that you want off their list,

37:19.280 --> 37:21.680
and then they just show up in a little,

37:21.680 --> 37:24.080
basically what is essentially a treasure chest

37:24.080 --> 37:25.520
that is sent to your house.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.200
These snacks taste great and they're better for you.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.640
They're made with high quality ingredients

37:28.640 --> 37:30.960
that are free from artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners,

37:30.960 --> 37:32.480
so you can feel great about snacking.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.880
Um, like I said, Big Island Pineapple, pretty rad.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.760
They got whole wheat raspberry figgy bars, love those.

37:40.560 --> 37:42.400
Salt and pepper pop pops.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.720
Do you know what I would do if I were in Nature Box?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.360
I think I would release, like, a companion snack

37:47.360 --> 37:49.680
called, like, Small Island Pineapple.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.000
Oh, that's fun.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.920
And it's like, you eat them together,

37:51.920 --> 37:54.720
and, like, one makes you big and one makes you tiny.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.880
Oh, so it's magic.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.000
Sorry, Justin, no.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.640
Travis just floated magic food.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.000
Okay, I mean, that would be a good thing for them to sell.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.320
Justin, you and I need to be more careful

38:06.320 --> 38:09.200
because sometimes Travis floats things like magic food,

38:09.200 --> 38:11.520
and we are like, oh, off to the next thing.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.000
Sounds good.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.320
But I am curious, Travis,

38:15.600 --> 38:18.640
what other sort of magic food Nature Box has

38:18.640 --> 38:20.960
that they ship you that you know about

38:20.960 --> 38:22.400
that they aren't talking about,

38:22.400 --> 38:23.920
like the deep, like, government consumers and stuff.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.160
They're afraid to let us know about.

38:26.160 --> 38:29.600
Yeah, I honestly, I'm afraid I've said too much.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.280
Oh, so you couldn't think of enough.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.600
Right now, you can save even more.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.240
Nature Box is offering our fans 50% off your first order

38:43.520 --> 38:46.640
One more again, naturebox.com slash my brother.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.120
You did a really good job on that ad, Griffin.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.240
Thank you, dude.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.200
I think Travis probably was a little bit off his game

38:53.200 --> 38:54.720
because he was literally tweeting

38:54.720 --> 38:56.160
while we were doing that bit.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.160
Oh, boy, Justin, give me that.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.760
Justin, give me that good tweet he was doing.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.280
I said that his goal is to get my bim bam verified.

39:03.280 --> 39:03.920
Can I do that?

39:03.920 --> 39:04.640
How do I do that?

39:04.640 --> 39:06.240
I still don't know how I got verified.

39:06.800 --> 39:11.680
Jesus, that is a very, very, very good Travis McElroy tweet.

39:11.680 --> 39:15.360
Well, to be fair, I did tweet that during the lengthy break

39:15.360 --> 39:18.240
that we edited out where Justin ran to, I don't know,

39:18.240 --> 39:22.000
go to the bathroom, get coffee, check his, I don't know,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.320
TV to see what was on Nickelodeon.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.680
I didn't run to the bathroom.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.120
I'm not John Candy.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.800
I walked to the bathroom.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.880
I'm not John Candy in every John Candy movie

39:32.880 --> 39:35.360
where he uses the bathroom and has to run to it.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.480
I am a gentleman, and I walked to the restroom

39:38.480 --> 39:39.440
to devastate it.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.240
I want to tell you guys about another sponsor,

39:44.240 --> 39:45.120
and it's Harry's.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.160
We've talked about Harry's many times,

39:48.160 --> 39:52.160
but I love the fact that the razors don't cost.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.680
I was just looking through the razor section today.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.680
Do you know they sell an eight-pack, one of the big companies

39:57.680 --> 40:00.960
sells an eight-pack of razors for $45?

40:00.960 --> 40:01.680
Yes.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.840
It's lunacy.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.040
It's lunacy.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.000
I love Harry's.

40:06.000 --> 40:10.400
Harry's is the only reasonable razor company in the whole world,

40:10.400 --> 40:12.880
but there's something kind of so dope about that.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.560
Like, yeah, eight razors.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.400
You'll use them in like two months.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.000
$40, please.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.760
What are you talking about, shit?

40:19.760 --> 40:20.240
Yeah.

40:20.240 --> 40:20.880
What the fuck?

40:20.880 --> 40:24.320
I shouldn't have to have a budget line item for razors.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.200
That shouldn't be listed among my utilities,

40:27.200 --> 40:28.320
and now I don't have to.

40:28.320 --> 40:33.360
They're just $2 a blade compared to the $4 or $5 or $6

40:33.360 --> 40:34.720
that you'll pay at the drugstore.

40:34.720 --> 40:35.280
Yeah.

40:35.280 --> 40:40.640
What if Downey was like eight rolls of paper towels?

40:40.640 --> 40:42.240
That'll be $160.

40:42.960 --> 40:43.760
Fuck you.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.880
All their products are great, too.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.240
Their aftershave is the best I've ever used.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.240
Now, Harry's is so confident about the quality of their blades.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.800
They want you to try their shave set for free.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.440
You heard that right.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.200
Just cover shipping when you sign up.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.520
Plus, as a special offer for fans of our show,

40:57.520 --> 41:00.400

41:00.400 --> 41:04.880
MYBROTHER at checkout, and you get a post-shave balm also free.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.640
It's the best.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.840
And you can get it for free going to harrys.com

41:09.840 --> 41:13.280
and using the code MYBROTHER when you sign up.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.320
I want to tell y'all.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.360
No, I want to.

41:18.560 --> 41:18.960
Okay.

41:19.600 --> 41:19.920
Okay.

41:20.720 --> 41:21.280
Do you know what?

41:21.280 --> 41:24.080
You got to do the thing with the snacks,

41:24.080 --> 41:25.200
and now I want to do this one.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.400
I don't want to do it.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
Listen, we only get to do this ad twice a year

41:32.400 --> 41:34.320
in the two weeks leading up to Valentine's Day.

41:34.320 --> 41:34.720
So let's just-

41:34.720 --> 41:35.200
I know.

41:35.200 --> 41:35.680
Come on.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.120
It's okay.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.240
Go do it, Travis.

41:40.080 --> 41:46.560
I don't want to do it anymore.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.040
I don't know why the sound of my little brother crying

41:49.040 --> 41:50.240
makes me so happy.

41:50.240 --> 41:57.520
I just feel like I've been looking forward to it.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.280
You know folks, Valentine's Day is just around the corner

42:01.280 --> 42:05.440
and ProFlowers is making it easier than ever

42:05.440 --> 42:08.080
by taking out the guesswork.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.680
On top of their already low prices,

42:09.680 --> 42:12.400
right now you can get two dozen assorted roses

42:12.400 --> 42:16.800
with a free glass vase for $29.99

42:16.800 --> 42:19.360
plus shipping and handling or upgrade

42:19.360 --> 42:20.720
for another $9.99.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.960
You can get two dozen long stem roses

42:22.960 --> 42:25.760
with premium vase and chocolate.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.320
You can pick your flowers

42:28.320 --> 42:29.840
and then check it out in two minutes.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.120
This hasn't happened this year,

42:33.120 --> 42:34.000
but last year,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.840
the first time ProFlowers advertised with us,

42:36.480 --> 42:38.480
they wanted to send us a sample of their product,

42:38.480 --> 42:39.520
which I thought was great.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.800
And they showed up and it was beautiful,

42:42.800 --> 42:43.920
just beautiful flowers.

42:43.920 --> 42:46.160
And you wouldn't believe these came in a box.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.040
This is fantastic.

42:47.040 --> 42:47.840
No, they're really, really-

42:47.840 --> 42:48.720
They're really pretty.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.440
Nice to have around.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.640
Except the one thing-

42:50.640 --> 42:51.600
There's one thing.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.400
There's one problem.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.840
The one problem is they send them

42:53.840 --> 42:55.440
for all the podcasts I do.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.520
So all of a sudden it went from like,

42:57.520 --> 42:58.800
oh, beautiful flowers to,

42:58.800 --> 43:00.720
holy shit, I'm getting stalked.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.680
Fucking Max Medina is about to propose to me.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.320
He's just fucking packing my house with roses

43:06.320 --> 43:11.200
and it got to be a little bit of a burden.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.040
It got to be a little bit burdensome,

43:13.040 --> 43:13.920
but they're gorgeous.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.560
They're all gorgeous.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.760
They're gorgeous flowers.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.080
For me-

43:16.080 --> 43:19.200
But it did make it seem like Justin had just died.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.000
When it happened to me,

43:20.000 --> 43:21.440
I felt that this must be what it's like

43:21.440 --> 43:23.040
to fake your own death.

43:23.040 --> 43:27.040
You get to see the flowers people send to the family.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.040
I'm like, oh, ProFlowers really cares

43:29.040 --> 43:30.080
that I faked my death.

43:30.080 --> 43:31.120
Thank you, ProFlowers.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.680
Here's the only way to get two dozen assorted

43:33.680 --> 43:36.560
rose with free glass vase starting at $29.99.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.320
Just go to ProFlowers.com

43:38.320 --> 43:39.680
and use the code MYBROTHER.

43:39.680 --> 43:40.240
All one word.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.520
That's ProFlowers.com.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.960
Click on the microphone.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.160
Type in the code MYBROTHER.

43:44.160 --> 43:44.720
Don't wait.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.560
This deal expires soon.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.320
Can I read the fucking Jumbotron at least?

43:48.320 --> 43:48.960
Sure, yeah.

43:48.960 --> 43:49.440
Go for it.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.280
Who is this message for?

43:51.280 --> 43:53.840
It's for Anna, aka Traveler.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.200
You're not even gonna read the thing right.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.480
And it's from-

43:56.480 --> 43:58.640
You're not even gonna do the impression.

43:58.640 --> 44:02.960
And it's from Rosie, aka Potion Seller.

44:03.520 --> 44:04.400
Potion Seller.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.120
Greetings, Traveler.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.160
Potion Seller.

44:10.160 --> 44:10.960
You see that video?

44:10.960 --> 44:11.840
It's fucking good.

44:11.840 --> 44:14.240
See, you don't even know the fucking meme.

44:14.240 --> 44:16.720
Listen up, big man on campus, Travis McElroy.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.760
I know all the memes.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.640
Potion Seller is Traveler.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.440
You see that?

44:24.000 --> 44:27.840
Man, I used to get blazed and just fucking roll that shit.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.400
Roll that beautiful beam footage.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.920
Surprise, by now it's been-

44:31.920 --> 44:33.200
Sorry, this is now the message.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.280
Surprise, by now it's been several months

44:35.280 --> 44:36.960
since I introduced you to Mimba Mim.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.600
Just don't know why it came out like that.

44:39.600 --> 44:42.240
And you, like a woman possessed,

44:42.240 --> 44:43.840
tore through the first hundred episodes

44:43.840 --> 44:44.960
in a matter of days.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.520
Those saw bones is your true podcast soulmate.

44:47.520 --> 44:49.760
Thanks for being there for me during my year off.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.920
I'm so glad to be back on campus with you.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.120
Happy 21st, Anna.

44:53.120 --> 44:53.620
Great job.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.160
I'd like to say to Rosie,

44:56.160 --> 44:56.640
thank you-

44:56.640 --> 44:57.840
That's a beautiful message.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.440
Thank you for right in the middle there,

44:59.440 --> 45:01.280
making sure to let us know

45:01.280 --> 45:03.120
that we are Anna's second favorite.

45:03.920 --> 45:04.880
Hey, I'll take it.

45:04.880 --> 45:05.200
Fine.

45:06.240 --> 45:06.720
Yeah.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.280
Fine.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.760
Are there like Terrace House fan casts?

45:09.760 --> 45:10.240
There is.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.880
Nick Robinson at Polygon just started doing one.

45:12.880 --> 45:13.120
Nice.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.320
Um, yeah.

45:14.320 --> 45:14.960
I don't know.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.880
Spoilers, I haven't finished Aloha State,

45:16.880 --> 45:18.560
but it's popping off though.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.000
There's only eight Eps, right?

45:20.000 --> 45:20.560
Right now?

45:20.560 --> 45:20.880
Yeah.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.880
We're really pacing ourselves

45:22.880 --> 45:24.800
because we blew through season one.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.840
Welcome to our segment Terrace House break

45:27.840 --> 45:29.840
where we talk about Terrace House.

45:29.840 --> 45:30.560
Yeah.

45:30.560 --> 45:31.760
My dad asked me this week,

45:31.760 --> 45:32.560
what's Terrace House?

45:32.560 --> 45:36.080
Because he took a fucking covert snap of me

45:36.080 --> 45:37.600
during Adventures in Recording where I was wearing

45:37.600 --> 45:39.920
the beautiful Terrace House shirt

45:39.920 --> 45:43.600
that I received for Christmas from my dear brother.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.360
And people were going nuts about it.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.200
My dad asked me, what's Terrace House?

45:47.200 --> 45:48.720
And that, it was a real,

45:49.680 --> 45:51.840
I didn't know how to explain Terrace House to my dad

45:51.840 --> 45:53.280
in a way that would make it appealing enough

45:53.280 --> 45:54.000
that he would watch it,

45:54.000 --> 45:55.600
which everybody should, on Earth.

45:57.360 --> 45:58.400
I'm Allegra Ringo.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.440
And I'm Renee Colbert.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.160
And we host a podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.240
Renee, can I tell you about a dog I met this week?

46:04.240 --> 46:05.200
I wish that you would.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.760
In turn though, can I tell you about a dog hero?

46:07.760 --> 46:09.520
May I tell you about a dog breed

46:09.520 --> 46:11.360
in a segment I like to call Mutt Minute?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.560
I would love that.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.400
Could we maybe talk about some dog tech?

46:14.400 --> 46:15.920
Could we have some cool guests on?

46:15.920 --> 46:18.880
Like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Nicole Byer, and Anne Wheaton?

46:18.880 --> 46:20.960
I mean, yeah, absolutely.

46:20.960 --> 46:21.360
I'm in.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.000
You're on board.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.760
What do you say we do all of this

46:23.760 --> 46:25.120
and put it into a podcast?

46:25.120 --> 46:25.680
Yeah, okay.

46:25.680 --> 46:26.400
You think?

46:26.400 --> 46:26.900
Perfect.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.640
Should we call it like, I don't know,

46:28.640 --> 46:29.760
Can I Pet Your Dog?

46:29.760 --> 46:30.240
Sure.

46:30.240 --> 46:30.640
All right.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.480
What do you say we put it on every Tuesday on Maximum Fun?

46:34.480 --> 46:35.600
Or on iTunes.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.480
Sounds good to me.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.200
Meeting's over.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.600
I have a Yahoo here.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.160
Can I read it?

46:43.440 --> 46:44.160
Yeah, go for it.

46:44.160 --> 46:44.720
Okay.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.200
You're the boss.

46:46.320 --> 46:46.560
What?

46:46.560 --> 46:47.120
You're the boss.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.160
Oh, okay.

46:48.160 --> 46:49.120
You're a media luminary.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.560
If you feel like it's time for a Yahoo,

46:50.560 --> 46:51.120
you should go for it.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.000
That's a fucking good point.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.040
I'm just gonna drop it then.

46:53.040 --> 46:54.400
It's also from Brooks Oglesby.

46:54.400 --> 46:54.880
Thank you, Brooks.

46:54.880 --> 46:57.200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Rose, who asks,

46:57.840 --> 47:00.560
I bet no one has asked this one before.

47:00.560 --> 47:04.080
What rides at an amusement park are best for kissing?

47:08.080 --> 47:09.920
You know, Rose?

47:09.920 --> 47:15.040
Do you guys remember having to find places to kiss?

47:16.240 --> 47:16.960
This will be a good...

47:16.960 --> 47:17.600
This will be...

47:17.600 --> 47:22.640
You'd be like walking in the park and you'd find like a little secluded grove

47:23.120 --> 47:27.040
and you'd think like, I should remember this for later for when I want to kiss.

47:27.040 --> 47:31.040
Yes, my good one was the instrument room in the band room,

47:31.040 --> 47:34.160
like the instrument closet is a good place to kiss.

47:34.160 --> 47:35.680
That's a good place to kiss.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.040
Hmm, good kissing in there.

47:37.040 --> 47:42.560
I will never forget being a teen and going on a date to a movie

47:42.560 --> 47:45.440
and sitting in the back row so I can do some smooching

47:46.000 --> 47:50.640
and then some fucking adults would come and sit like right in front of us

47:50.640 --> 47:54.160
and it's like, I think you guys know exactly what you just did.

47:54.160 --> 47:54.960
You've ruined me.

47:54.960 --> 47:57.760
I think that you're being assholes right now.

47:58.640 --> 48:02.400
Do you think I wanted to see Prince of Egypt in theaters?

48:02.400 --> 48:05.200
No, I came here for a reason and that was to kiss

48:05.200 --> 48:06.480
and to listen to Donny Osmond sing.

48:06.480 --> 48:07.200
He's got a great voice.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.400
What are the best rides at an amusement park though?

48:10.400 --> 48:12.240
Because Tunnel of Love is obvious bullshit.

48:12.240 --> 48:14.480
If you kiss on the Tunnel of Love, it's like so...

48:14.480 --> 48:19.280
Like if my wife kissed me on a Tunnel of Love, I'd be like, really?

48:19.280 --> 48:22.480
Okay, stop, stop.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.320
Stop, this needs to be addressed.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.760
My first thought was the Tunnel of Love, right?

48:27.760 --> 48:29.920
Okay, but stop for a second and think.

48:29.920 --> 48:33.440
Oh my God, holy shit, Justin, you're right.

48:34.160 --> 48:38.560
Seriously though, media has perpetrated a lot of lies on us growing up as kids,

48:38.560 --> 48:40.400
especially like old cartoons.

48:40.400 --> 48:46.800
I've never in my entire adult life, I've traveled all across this great land of ours.

48:46.800 --> 48:50.400
I've never, ever, ever seen a Tunnel of Love.

48:50.400 --> 48:54.880
I've seen a fake Mario Brothers castle that kids could run around on and fall and die.

48:55.680 --> 48:59.920
I've seen a spaceship that spins around so fast that you stick to the walls.

48:59.920 --> 49:03.440
I've never seen a Tunnel of Love in my entire life.

49:03.440 --> 49:09.120
Essentially what a Tunnel of Love is, is a timed hand job challenge.

49:10.720 --> 49:12.240
Are you tough enough?

49:12.240 --> 49:13.440
You have a hot jacket.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.480
You have 118 seconds, go.

49:16.480 --> 49:19.840
Uh oh, look up ahead, do you hear the clown music?

49:20.640 --> 49:23.280
You better hurry, you better hurry and finish to the clown music.

49:24.160 --> 49:25.520
That's when the camera flashes.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.880
Do you want to buy your pictures?

49:28.880 --> 49:31.040
I don't, please don't show the pictures.

49:33.920 --> 49:37.120
I think some real next level smooching would happen on bumper cars,

49:37.120 --> 49:39.280
but here's the thing, two separate cars.

49:42.640 --> 49:44.160
You have to bump to smooch.

49:44.160 --> 49:48.960
Okay, it's kind of like that scene in Fast Five, or maybe Fast Six,

49:49.520 --> 49:54.240
where Vin catches Letty in the air, and because their cars crash into each other.

49:54.240 --> 49:54.960
Or something like that.

49:54.960 --> 50:00.240
Or like that scene, I think it's Fast Five, where the Rock and Vin Diesel pull up next to each other and smooch.

50:00.240 --> 50:03.280
And they kiss, they crash their cars into each other and like, you want to fight?

50:03.280 --> 50:07.600
Like, no, I have a better idea, and they do kiss right there.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.680
Man, why did Izzy turn evil though?

50:11.680 --> 50:14.240
I'm still so torn up inside about it.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.440
It was about family.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.400
It was about family, but it's not anymore.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.400
Damn it, damn it.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.280
Here's a question.

50:21.280 --> 50:21.760
What's a-

50:21.760 --> 50:22.800
I got another question.

50:22.800 --> 50:23.280
Okay.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.520
Did you have something else you wanted to say about Fast and the Furious?

50:25.520 --> 50:28.160
I've always wanted to talk about Fast and the Furious on our podcast, so-

50:28.160 --> 50:32.000
No, but there's so many different rides in an amusement park where you could kiss on.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.360
I think the best one would be at Universal Studios, the Fast and the Furious.

50:35.360 --> 50:40.400
There's a part in the tram ride, where it's like, hey, here's this used to be,

50:40.400 --> 50:46.000
this used to be where we filmed Desperate Housewives, and here's the back lot where we film all of our street scenes.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.920
And now, oh, it's Dominic Toretto and gang, and they're with us.

50:49.920 --> 50:50.400
What's that?

50:50.400 --> 50:52.080
There's a bad guy trying to catch us.

50:52.080 --> 50:55.120
We're in a tram, but it's souped up, and let's take a ju-

50:55.120 --> 50:56.320
It's like, whoa, hold on.

50:56.320 --> 51:02.080
It's weird how they do that at Universal, and they're like, here we are, and there's the lot where we filmed whatever the fuck.

51:02.080 --> 51:04.320
And here was some bad movie that we filmed here.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.920
And then, oh, what's that?

51:05.920 --> 51:08.080
The tram's in the middle of a flood.

51:08.080 --> 51:10.000
And it's like, no, you can't-

51:10.000 --> 51:10.560
That doesn't make sense.

51:10.560 --> 51:14.080
Be like, here's a tour of Universal, and then you're in, you're imperiled.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.960
They also have that studio tour at Universal Studios Florida.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.960
Nothing is filmed there.

51:18.960 --> 51:19.680
Nothing is there.

51:19.680 --> 51:20.640
You're not gonna see any celebs.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.000
There's Duck Dynasty, and end of tour.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.520
I, when I, when Teresa and I went to the Universal Studios,

51:27.520 --> 51:31.440
somebody got very excited because there was, like, a board, like, posted on a wall

51:31.440 --> 51:35.760
that showed what TV shows are filmed at that studio, and one of them was, like, Mindy Project.

51:35.760 --> 51:39.120
And I saw this family lose their fucking minds,

51:39.120 --> 51:41.680
but they were like, they filmed Mindy Project here.

51:41.680 --> 51:43.360
And I was like, not here, though.

51:43.360 --> 51:46.080
Like, not in a place you're going to go.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.040
Where's Mindy?

51:47.040 --> 51:48.800
Why are you so excited?

51:48.800 --> 51:48.880
Mindy!

51:48.880 --> 51:52.400
It might as well have said, like, this is where we film Cheers.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.760
Like, here, like, yeah, you're not gonna see it.

51:55.760 --> 51:57.200
They don't have to prove that to you.

51:57.200 --> 52:01.040
Yeah, you say that, but when we took the NBC studio tour, when we went up in the AH,

52:02.000 --> 52:03.680
you know we were losing it.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.960
You know we were fucking out.

52:04.960 --> 52:05.680
That is true.

52:05.680 --> 52:10.720
Thinking about, that's where fucking Brian Fellowes had done his thing.

52:11.280 --> 52:15.200
And the fucking, if you think about it, if you think about it for a second, Travis,

52:15.200 --> 52:21.200
studio AH is where I said a bottle of sparkling apple juice to your house,

52:21.200 --> 52:21.760
did you get it?

52:21.760 --> 52:23.760
It was actually filmed, if you think about it.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.200
This is like when I went to Nickelodeon Studios,

52:27.200 --> 52:30.640
and they let us walk onto the set of the mystery Files of Shelby Woo.

52:30.640 --> 52:34.000
Uh, I want to get to this last question, because it's so fucking good.

52:34.000 --> 52:34.560
Please.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.600
My dad admitted to me that he had never seen Willy Wonka.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.720
Now here, then it gets more buck wild.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.920
Oh my god!

52:43.920 --> 52:48.400
He's a huge fan of Gene Wilder, so I told him to watch it.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.680
After a year trying to get him to watch Willy Wonka,

52:51.680 --> 52:54.720
I finally bought him a Blu-ray player with a copy of Willy Wonka.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.480
That was three years ago.

52:56.480 --> 52:59.200
Every time I see him, I beg him to watch Willy Wonka.

52:59.200 --> 53:02.800
And he watches reruns of M.A.S.H. and Big Bang Theory instead.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.160
You guys are my last hope.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.720
How do I convince you to watch this movie?

53:06.720 --> 53:10.560
Oh my god, this is all time.

53:10.560 --> 53:13.760
And in fact, a question I didn't include in the list here,

53:13.760 --> 53:16.880
but in the email also included their dad's phone number,

53:16.880 --> 53:19.200
so we could call their dad, I guess,

53:19.200 --> 53:22.240
ostensibly call their dad to tell their dad,

53:22.240 --> 53:24.320
hey, we're three people you don't know,

53:24.320 --> 53:26.320
but fucking watch Willy Wonka, old man.

53:26.320 --> 53:28.480
Yeah, please watch Willy Wonka for a second.

53:28.480 --> 53:34.000
This is fucking stellar.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.360
Are you kidding me?

53:35.360 --> 53:36.800
This is the best question.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.280
I love Vin Diesel.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.800
Oh yeah, man, Fast and Furious.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.160
Fast and the Who now?

53:42.160 --> 53:44.000
Well, I'm more of a boiler room kind of guy.

53:45.360 --> 53:46.480
Holy shit.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.200
Huge fan of Gene Wilder.

53:49.200 --> 53:51.360
Haven't seen the Willy Wonka movie,

53:51.360 --> 53:53.920
but the Frisco kid is awesome.

53:53.920 --> 53:54.880
Now, I will say this.

53:54.880 --> 53:55.360
Great flick.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.960
Gene Wilder does have a body of work

53:56.960 --> 53:59.120
where you could conceivably be a huge fan of the man

53:59.120 --> 54:00.160
and not see Willy Wonka.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.240
I don't want to disparage his other work,

54:02.240 --> 54:04.000
like fucking the-

54:04.000 --> 54:05.840
Frisco kid rules, that's fair.

54:06.560 --> 54:08.720
Yeah, like he basically rules and everything.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.480
Like fucking watch Silver Streak

54:10.480 --> 54:12.560
and don't come away a huge fan of Gene Wilder.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.600
It's literally impossible.

54:15.040 --> 54:18.240
But the difference here is that all holds true

54:18.240 --> 54:20.560
the first time you bring it up to your dad

54:20.560 --> 54:22.560
and you're like, so what about Willy Wonka?

54:22.560 --> 54:23.280
And he's like, what?

54:23.280 --> 54:24.800
And you're like, Willy Wonka?

54:24.800 --> 54:28.400
A movie that like is an amazing character study

54:28.400 --> 54:29.520
like by Gene Wilder.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.000
It's like an acting class to watch this.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.440
And you're like, oh, okay, cool.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.400
Never gonna watch it.

54:34.400 --> 54:34.720
It's like-

54:34.720 --> 54:35.680
Love the man's work.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.840
It's like arguably like between,

54:38.800 --> 54:41.360
I would say between Heath Ledger's Joker

54:41.360 --> 54:44.400
and Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka

54:44.400 --> 54:46.800
for like literally the best performance

54:46.800 --> 54:50.400
by any actor in any movie, literally ever.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.000
Like I don't think there's a better one.

54:52.560 --> 54:53.680
Heath Ledger's Joker,

54:53.680 --> 54:55.120
Jared Leto's Joker.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.840
And then right there, three with the bullet.

54:58.560 --> 54:59.520
Gene Wilder's Joker.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.400
He would have been fucking great at doing me.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.600
Oh my God.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.640
God, that would have been good.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.720
He would have been Riddler.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.080
He would have been an amazing Riddler.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.080
Oh my God, Trace, that's even better.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.320
Or Clock King.

55:12.320 --> 55:14.080
Man, that motherfucker could have been any of them.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.920
It could have been a calendar man.

55:15.920 --> 55:17.120
Fucking, he could have been Batman.

55:17.120 --> 55:20.480
He could have been, this is my 65 year old ward Robin.

55:20.480 --> 55:24.080
Hello, Batman, the Batman future show.

55:25.360 --> 55:25.840
Damn it.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.120
Just put the movie.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.160
Just put it on.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.360
Just strap your dad in, fucking Clockwork Orange, your dad.

55:33.360 --> 55:36.160
Now make him watch this culturally important film.

55:36.160 --> 55:38.560
It is going to be a weird 20 minutes

55:38.560 --> 55:39.360
where your dad's like,

55:39.920 --> 55:42.080
it's just old people in a bed.

55:43.120 --> 55:43.760
No, listen.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.000
Why is this kid so sad?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.920
He's buying so much chocolate.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.720
Okay, hang in there.

55:50.720 --> 55:51.840
You're going to love this movie, Dad.

55:51.840 --> 55:52.800
There's so much candy.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.640
I've been watching it for 20 minutes.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.160
Not even seen a single sweet.

55:58.160 --> 55:59.840
Where's the sweets kid?

55:59.840 --> 56:02.240
This kid in front of a TV, what the fuck?

56:02.240 --> 56:03.520
There's a very spoiled girl,

56:03.520 --> 56:05.200
but where's the sweets, Jamie?

56:06.400 --> 56:08.240
Where's my Gene?

56:08.240 --> 56:10.960
There has been very little of my favorite actor,

56:10.960 --> 56:12.640
Gene Wilder from the Frisco Kids.

56:12.640 --> 56:14.560
I went and showed him the movie and he said,

56:14.560 --> 56:18.560
oh, Gene Wilder, I was thinking of somebody else.

56:18.560 --> 56:20.000
I was thinking of Gene Hackman.

56:20.000 --> 56:20.960
Love that guy's work.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.400
I love Gene Hackman's stuff.

56:22.400 --> 56:25.440
Fucking tail wag dog or whatever.

56:27.120 --> 56:28.480
Wag the dog, the tail.

56:29.280 --> 56:30.640
Love him, he in that probably.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.680
The problem with watching it for the first time,

56:33.680 --> 56:35.840
sight unseen, is there's a chance he'll think

56:35.840 --> 56:37.920
Arthur Slugworth is the protagonist

56:37.920 --> 56:39.920
and he'll start rooting for him from the job.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.000
I like the look of this Slugworth guy.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.920
He's got goals, priorities.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.360
He's a mover and a shaker.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.640
For some reason, I look and sound like him.

56:49.920 --> 56:53.040
Do you think Mike TV's last name was TV

56:53.040 --> 56:54.800
or that was just a nickname they called him

56:54.800 --> 56:55.680
because he liked TV?

56:55.680 --> 56:59.280
His last name is T-E-E-V-E-E, Mike TV.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.600
That's a weird choice by Roald Dahl

57:01.600 --> 57:03.920
because none of the other kids are named that way.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.560
Yeah, my name's Augustus Fat Candy.

57:06.560 --> 57:08.480
Yeah, like it's just such a weird,

57:08.480 --> 57:11.440
like and Mike TV, I'll come up with something better later.

57:11.440 --> 57:13.360
Yeah, I'll figure it out later, whatever.

57:13.360 --> 57:15.760
It might be T-E-A-V-E-E.

57:15.760 --> 57:19.840
I like to think that if I was a pornographic film actor,

57:19.840 --> 57:21.760
I would be called Augustus Fat Candy.

57:22.720 --> 57:25.040
Excuse me, excuse me, just one moment.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.280
Just a moment of your time.

57:27.920 --> 57:30.000
I Googled to check my spelling of Mike TV

57:30.640 --> 57:32.240
and on the Wikipedia page,

57:32.240 --> 57:36.160
or sorry, the Roald Dahl Wiki page for Mike TV,

57:36.160 --> 57:37.600
there's a behind the scenes fact

57:38.160 --> 57:40.800
that the original name for Mike TV

57:40.800 --> 57:43.440
was going to be Herpes Trout.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.920
Get the fuck out of the door.

57:48.880 --> 57:51.200
Hey Roald, Roald.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.800
Yeah, I read through your manuscript here.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.640
We were so excited to publish your new book.

57:55.360 --> 57:56.640
Couple notes, couple notes.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.840
We felt like the pacing was a little off the first 20 minutes.

57:59.840 --> 58:03.280
Also, one of the kids is named Herpes.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.160
One of the children is a sexually diseased fish

58:06.160 --> 58:07.520
and maybe we could roll that back a little.

58:07.520 --> 58:10.720
We could roll that back a little bit, what do you say?

58:10.720 --> 58:13.440
And also maybe instead of being a kid

58:13.440 --> 58:15.680
who's obsessed with sexually diseased fish,

58:15.680 --> 58:16.960
he just watches a lot of TV.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.160
Watch a lot of television

58:18.160 --> 58:20.240
and there could be a bit of a morality tale there.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.400
I know what I need.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.200
All men sound like this to Griffin.

58:28.320 --> 58:30.960
I'm gonna have to rethink the whole book now.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.120
My life is basically like Anomalisa

58:33.120 --> 58:36.320
where every man who isn't one of you two basically

58:36.320 --> 58:39.200
just, hey Griffin, you wanna come watch

58:39.200 --> 58:40.480
the Royal Rumble today?

58:40.480 --> 58:41.040
Yeah, sure.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.920
So anyway, this has been my brother, my brother and me.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.120
It's an advice show for the modern era.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.320
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

58:48.320 --> 58:51.680
We have some exciting announcements for a change.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.160
We're doing things again.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.360
We're doing things again.

58:55.360 --> 58:57.040
We're shaking off our torpor.

58:57.760 --> 59:00.240
Against all odds, we're doing things again.

59:01.360 --> 59:04.000
So first off, and we don't have specifics on this,

59:04.000 --> 59:09.600
but the trailer for our show is going to drop this week

59:09.600 --> 59:13.600
at some point, maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

59:13.600 --> 59:17.040
This is like a super cut trailer with clips.

59:17.680 --> 59:18.560
Have y'all seen it?

59:18.560 --> 59:20.080
Because we saw the original trailer,

59:20.080 --> 59:22.000
but there was far too much cursing in it.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.040
Yeah, we actually had an original cut that we loved

59:25.040 --> 59:29.760
that had like seven f-words in it.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.520
And then we cut those out.

59:31.520 --> 59:32.800
It's still very good.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.480
And like you're not missing anything

59:34.480 --> 59:36.720
because we just say that word when we can't think

59:36.720 --> 59:38.480
of a funny thing to say.

59:38.480 --> 59:39.840
So you're not missing much.

59:39.840 --> 59:44.080
But that trailer will go up somewhere this week.

59:44.080 --> 59:49.520
So keep an eye on at NBNBAM or our Facebook page

59:49.520 --> 59:51.440
and we'll be sure to retweet it from there.

59:52.560 --> 01:00:00.800
Also, we are doing a live show in Portland, Oregon on March 18th.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.480
And that's going to be part of the XOXO Fest,

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.040
which we're excited to be a part of.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.720
And yeah, it's our first live show in...

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.280
Fuck dudes.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.720
What was the last live show we did?

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.920
Candle Nights in September?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.480
Yeah.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.120
Yes, Griffin.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.400
Then we had Babies.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.520
Then we all had Babies.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.160
Yeah, damn it.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:24.000
But Trav, you need to gin up a bit.ly link for this.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.560
Okay, I'll do it right now.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.040
Okay.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.200
How about MBMBAM XOXO?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.760
Yeah, that's good.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.240
Cool.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.360
MBMBAM bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM XOXO.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.040
We need to address is the XOXO Fest...

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.840
Is that Zozo?

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.080
Is he haunting us again?

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.040
Is that Zozo?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.560
Back in the mix.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:44.960
Damn it.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.640
But that's going to be March 18th.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.960
Doors at six, show at seven.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.720
My brother, my brother and me, the podcast.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.960
So that'll be popping off.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.480
We're also in the process of planning another live show

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.760
for later in the spring and details to follow.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.240
Details to follow, but soon, should follow soon.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.280
As soon as we have dates, because we know it's an issue

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.400
for people to clear up schedule times and things like that.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.880
It's going to be a single city jam.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.680
Like our Boston show, but it's going to be fun.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:19.680
Fun and good.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.320
We'll let you know.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.680
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.560

Have it somehow.

Thank you, Morgan.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.720
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gabriel the Angel.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.400
Gabriel the Angel, who asks,

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.520

I'm Travis McElroy.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.680
This has been My Brother, My Brother,

01:02:43.680 --> 01:03:02.000
Rink Eastern Dance Corps on the Lips.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.360

My name is Joe Coghlin.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.640
The first time I went to Max Fun Con,

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.480
I didn't know anyone.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.560
I wasn't really nervous about that.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.440
Everyone said not to worry about going alone,

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.880
that I'd make friends right away,

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.560
that I'd have an amazing time.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.320
It turns out everyone was right.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.280
I instantly had 200 new friends.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.480
I've made lifelong friends at Max Fun Con

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.600
that I'm going to keep in touch with for the rest of my life.

Don't be like me.

Don't waste two years being too nervous.
