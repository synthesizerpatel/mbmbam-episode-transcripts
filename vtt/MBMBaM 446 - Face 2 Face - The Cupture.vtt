00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:49.360
Welcome to my brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:51.600 --> 01:00.240
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

01:04.960 --> 01:09.040
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.280
Did you burp in the middle of your name?

01:13.280 --> 01:17.920
I didn't, I didn't burp. I got scared by the sound of my own amplified voice.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.200
And this is my brother, a trained capuchin monkey.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.280
This, like the Chilean miners, we have reemerged here in the beautiful land of Alabama.

01:31.280 --> 01:39.360
I haven't been out here since the 70s. Did some things, us and the Eagles, steely damn.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.280
You playing some Candy Crush over there, bud?

01:43.280 --> 01:48.160
No, no, no, I'm loading up my notes for the show. I have a lot of notes to mention.

01:50.080 --> 01:55.280
So this is a beautiful theater that you people...

01:55.280 --> 01:57.120
This is unprecedented.

01:57.120 --> 02:02.880
Unprecedented. And very, very encouraging.

02:02.880 --> 02:13.440
You people have managed to purchase exactly 69% of the seats in this theater.

02:19.600 --> 02:24.960
Now, thank you for coming out, but also you nasty.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.960
You nasty. How the fuck did you guys coordinate that?

02:28.960 --> 02:33.440
As an artist who makes their living this way, when we saw...

02:33.440 --> 02:37.280
Nice, thank you. Nice, nice, nice, nice. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.040
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

02:39.040 --> 02:43.360
As an artist who makes their living this way, obviously when we saw that 60% of the seats were sold,

02:43.360 --> 02:45.760
it's kind of like, oh man, that's a bummer.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.480
Now when we got to 65 with like three days left, we're like,

02:48.480 --> 02:50.960
well, let's all pump the brakes a little bit.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.880
Let's not go too wild. Maybe we're gonna... But you don't even want to say it.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.720
Right, right. You can't jinx it.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.680
You can't jinx it when you're about to throw a perfect game.

02:59.680 --> 03:05.360
I have to imagine we got to 69% and then like maybe one of your friends was like,

03:05.360 --> 03:08.160
I think I'll go too. And you're like, no! No!

03:08.160 --> 03:11.840
You slashed their tires. Stay at home, Jeremy.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.920
You should call Jeremy now though and say like, yeah, now come.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.120
Listen, things got out of hand.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.400
I just waved bye to dad. I realize that's unprofessional now looking back on it.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.240
Bye, daddy. Bye, daddy. We love you.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.120
Bye, daddy. He doesn't enjoy the show anymore.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.800
It's all about the money for Clint now. It's all about the money.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.760
We have to pay him an appearance fee. He got his $73 and he is out the door.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.720
So this is an advice show. Yes, traditionally.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.440
We'll retake your questions and turn them out. We'll be like Into Wisdom.

03:44.240 --> 03:50.000
My son loves watching video game speed runs and boss rushes online.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.880
Yes. Yeah.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.480
Yeah. He loves the games I play. And recently he has started giving me

03:54.480 --> 03:59.120
spoilers for these video games by watching boss rushes when I am gone

03:59.120 --> 04:02.960
and then telling me what is going to happen while I'm playing them for the first time.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.720
How do I avoid spoilers on games I play? When he gets so excited,

04:08.720 --> 04:12.400
he watches ahead and has no filter. That's from Befuddled in Bama.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.800
Are you here? All right.

04:15.360 --> 04:20.560
So your child has become like the embodiment of like a Nintendo helpline,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.600
but if the Nintendo helpline called you. Yeah.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.720
I was like, hey, is this Steve? Yeah.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.520
He has a second form. Oh, no.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.040
Your child's YouTube. What's up, fam? This is Dylan coming at you.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.880
Please don't say that to me, Dylan. Please.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.080
Just dad is fine. What's up, fam?

04:40.080 --> 04:44.640
Yes, I guess I am technically your family. I'm your father. Please.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.360
Got all the hot strats for the Into Red Dead Redemption 2.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.960
Dylan, no. Dylan, no.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.280
No. I'm 20 hours in, Dylan.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.960
The horse did it. No.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.880
No, Dylan. Damn it.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.160
Man, that game's so wild at the end when the horse pulls out a gun.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.720
Looks like this is the end of our journey, Red Dead.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.000
Yeah. Anyway, fam,

05:04.000 --> 05:05.840
don't forget to smash that like and subscribe button.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.720
God damn it, Dylan. Go to bed.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.960
Don't forget to support me on Patreon. I bet.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.560
Fuck you. I buy you dinner and clothes.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.000
I was, Dylan.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.560
So.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.960
So your son's probably way better than that.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.280
Also, you should be letting your son play the video games

05:27.280 --> 05:29.040
while you spoil them for him.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.040
Maybe you're someone who liked to play,

05:31.680 --> 05:34.400
so he's just like, spoiling them for you so you'll lose interest.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.040
That's why you gotta get into Fortnite. You can't spoil that.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.040
Except unless you tell me, Griffin,

05:41.040 --> 05:44.160
you're not gonna understand anything sort of culturally relevant

05:44.160 --> 05:45.840
for the next sort of couple of years there.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.840
How about a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo Answers?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.640
This one was sent in by several people.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.920
Thank you, several people.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.760
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

05:55.760 --> 05:58.400
who I'm gonna name Percy, who asks,

05:59.040 --> 06:04.080
Is it illegal to combine two sauces and sell it as your own creation?

06:07.760 --> 06:08.320
Update.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.960
Two different sauces.

06:10.960 --> 06:14.960
Not much of an update.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.880
It's not even a clarification.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.440
No.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.920
The only additional word is different.

06:19.920 --> 06:23.840
Like, yes, you could not combine ketchup and ketchup and call it your own.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.360
Update. Two different sauces.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.440
Like, for example, you go by Newman's Ranch

06:27.440 --> 06:29.280
and combine it with Baby Jane's BBQ

06:29.280 --> 06:33.440
and you sell the end result product as your own to a toilet,

06:34.400 --> 06:36.400
I'm assuming, is who you would sell that to.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.680
Every sauce begins this way.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.280
All the great sauces.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.160
You take Katsup, for example.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.640
That was just tomato sauce and also vinegar

06:48.640 --> 06:50.240
that they mixed together to get that.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.320
You take mayonnaise.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.240
That was egg sauce and oil sauce.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.760
They blended together to get mayonnaise.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.920
I can't even eat a hot dog without egg sauce on it.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.880
Doesn't that sound like a New England thing?

07:04.880 --> 07:06.480
Ah, you gotta get the egg sauce.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.000
You gotta get egg sauce on your dog.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.280
Or your nor'ista.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.000
Your nor'ista.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.680
You gotta get a good egg sauce.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.080
Get some sh...

07:12.080 --> 07:12.960
Bastards.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.760
Get some...

07:13.760 --> 07:14.640
Hey, we're in the South.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.480
Let's make fun of the North some more.

07:16.480 --> 07:16.980
Yeah!

07:19.520 --> 07:20.880
Get a little side of schmutz.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.360
What if you were watching, like, Julia Child and she was like,

07:25.360 --> 07:28.080
I'm gonna put the oil sauce in the pan?

07:28.080 --> 07:28.480
Is that...

07:31.040 --> 07:33.280
The really hot plate with the handle on it?

07:33.280 --> 07:34.240
I'm gonna put oil sauce in there.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.160
You know, on the burn box.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.360
You know, you put the oil sauce on the hot plate on the burn box.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.440
I'm gonna use square milk.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.880
Do you eat butter, Julia?

07:46.480 --> 07:48.240
And then I'll put it in my teeth hole.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.760
My teeth hole where the teeth live?

07:51.840 --> 07:52.340
I...

07:53.840 --> 07:56.240
I don't know the answer to this question.

07:57.280 --> 08:01.680
The thing is, is at some point everybody has combined every sauce and called it their own.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.240
There is only one true sauce and it's, like, lava.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.280
Lava is earth sauce.

08:09.920 --> 08:10.880
Earth sauce.

08:10.880 --> 08:11.280
The original hot sauce.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.880
It's the only natural sauce.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.680
It's the only naturally occurring hot sauce.

08:15.680 --> 08:15.840
Yeah.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.440
The hottest sauce.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.040
The very, very hot sauce.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.440
Pompeii went up and they were just like, guys, chill.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.880
It's just earth sauce.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.680
It's just earth.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.000
Mmm.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.640
It's just earth.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.480
This could use something.

08:26.480 --> 08:29.840
Earth's slathering us up with its delicious sauce.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.480
You would go to jail.

08:32.480 --> 08:38.800
I think that Newman and his cohorts would do some DNA testing on it.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.200
Right.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.400
Send it to 23andMe and say, like, this is our shit.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.640
Yeah, throw it into a fucking centrifuge.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.720
Yeah, separate out the ranch.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.040
Yeah.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.880
This came from our ranch.

08:48.880 --> 08:58.640
Now what if I so completely stealthed it and I did, like, Heinz mayonnaise with Cool Whip

08:58.640 --> 09:00.080
and I combined those together and-

09:00.080 --> 09:01.600
And called it bad Cool Whip.

09:02.160 --> 09:02.960
Not Cool Whip.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.680
What if I said Cool Whip and Miracle Whip and I put them together and I just-

09:11.680 --> 09:13.280
And just called it Cool Miracle.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.560
I call it simply All Whip.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.800
Now I do like the idea of, like, we added ketchup and mustard and Miracle Whip and

09:22.800 --> 09:25.840
basically everything we could grab off the shelf and it's called All Sauce.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.480
That's called high school cafeteria dare.

09:28.480 --> 09:28.880
Yeah.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.960
But if I take mayo and mayo and mix it together and I'm saying,

09:32.960 --> 09:34.400
this is Griffin's new Good Mayo.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.400
It has all the best parts of Heinz Mayonnaise and also Miracle Whip,

09:38.400 --> 09:41.200
and they're never going to know because I won't say that last part.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.840
This is like, but this is every sauce.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.840
Like, every sauce that you dip, like,

09:45.840 --> 09:50.400
Tato Slammers in at TGI Fridays is like mustard mayonnaise.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.680
Let's get the hell out of here.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.120
I have learned that from watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that it is honestly-

09:57.120 --> 10:00.080
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:01.600 --> 10:01.920
Why?

10:03.040 --> 10:04.720
Because sometimes-

10:04.720 --> 10:05.760
You're hungover.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.960
It's 2am in a hotel room and it's the only thing on.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.280
And it honestly is like, well, the secret ingredient is this big tub of something.

10:13.280 --> 10:13.920
Right, yeah.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.760
He's got this big tub of junk in the back and he won't tell me what it is.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.040
It's ketchup and mayo and probably some relish, guy.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.520
And sugar.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.320
How about another question from your-

10:26.320 --> 10:28.880
Oh, man, I closed my day on my iPad.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.640
Just one question tonight, gang.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.400
I was so enraptured by your-

10:32.400 --> 10:33.520
That's going to do it for us.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.400
I'm getting the light.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.720
I've recently started a mural commission for a guy's Akito studio.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.720
Important clarification from me, the oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

10:44.720 --> 10:49.600
This is guy's possessive, not, you know, an Akito studio for the guys.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.040
The G is also lowercase.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.600
This is not Guy Fieri, it's Akito studio.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.240
Wow, can I just say what a beautiful pronunciation.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.520
Thank you very much.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.000
I've been watching a lot of Diners Drive-ins sometimes.

11:02.000 --> 11:02.880
Also-

11:02.880 --> 11:04.240
Wait, stop the podcast.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.160
He's also, as we all know, a Krav Maga guy.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.440
That's why he keeps his eyes on the back of his head.

11:13.440 --> 11:13.760
Exactly.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.600
So he's always ready for the attack.

11:15.600 --> 11:15.840
Yes.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.800
He has two sets of eyes.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.520
It's not important.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.080
These are my new Krave Maga fries.

11:22.080 --> 11:27.280
You're gonna love these things.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.040
Oh no, Justin broke himself.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.160
I have broke, yeah.

11:30.160 --> 11:34.080
I recently started a mural commission for a guy's Akito studio.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.040
I met up once with him already, and within five minutes,

11:37.040 --> 11:39.840
he started to get out the mats and insists on teaching me some moves.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.600
I am but a humble artist.

11:44.160 --> 11:48.000
And also, I don't have much interest in wrestling this stranger.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.440
How do I get him to stop?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.280
That's from the anti-wrassler.

11:51.280 --> 11:51.840
Are you here?

11:53.120 --> 11:53.680
All right.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.760
Okay, you don't want to wrestle this stranger,

11:55.760 --> 11:57.920
but maybe you want to wrestle a future friend.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.440
All strangers are just people you haven't wrestled yet.

12:06.960 --> 12:12.400
That's what my wrestling coach used to say before he went to jail.

12:12.400 --> 12:25.280
How can you expect to paint Akito when you do not understand Akito?

12:25.280 --> 12:27.520
Or have you even done the base level?

12:27.520 --> 12:32.400
What if you go in and your mural is like two cybernetic ninja stabbing each other?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.080
Like, is this anything?

12:35.120 --> 12:36.160
Is this Akito?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.320
I couldn't be bothered to learn.

12:38.320 --> 12:42.400
I've only played 30 seconds of Mortal Kombat, so I'm guessing.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.520
Two jacks's from Mortal Kombat, friend.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.200
You've done a bad job.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.000
There's a lot of roles in Akito.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.040
I took two Akito classes in college, so I'm a common expert.

12:55.040 --> 12:55.680
Okay.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.760
I would say, yeah, compared to the other two people on stage with you, you're doing great.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.640
I had to do tiger leaps over some foam pads.

13:02.640 --> 13:12.160
It was pretty clear quickly that this was not my martial art because it was sort of

13:12.160 --> 13:18.400
an entry-level number of pads that I had to jump over, and I did enter.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.520
I did not exit, so my level kind of stayed right there on top of the pads.

13:23.520 --> 13:28.480
I think you got to somehow, he's throwing down the gauntlet, I feel like.

13:28.480 --> 13:34.400
You need to somehow prove the deadliness of your painting abilities, and I'm saying this

13:34.400 --> 13:39.920
out loud and realizing now that paintbrushes are not that sort of sharp.

13:39.920 --> 13:45.840
Well, when you get them in their front or let the paint dry in them, you can fuck somebody

13:45.840 --> 13:46.640
up with those.

13:46.640 --> 13:52.560
You could go in the room early and paint a bunch of yourself all over the walls, and

13:52.560 --> 13:55.040
then just hide in different positions.

13:55.040 --> 14:01.920
Hide in different positions, and when the moment's right, shoot him with a gun.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.240
My only weakness.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.960
The one thing I can't throw, a bullet.

14:19.440 --> 14:24.000
You could paint a picture of the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to him, and then

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
when he's distracted by that, he's like looking at it, simpering like, oh my god, my pants

14:28.000 --> 14:29.120
really did pop pop.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.960
That's the sound of you shooting him with a gun.

14:35.360 --> 14:40.000
Sorry, I couldn't think of a way to close the deal with art.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.000
Just make sure you submit that invoice first.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.400
I have a Yahoo here that I'm so excited about.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.960
It was sent in by the delivery man Seth Carlson.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.520
Thank you, Seth.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.040
Seth sent in so many bangers.

14:54.160 --> 15:00.160
It's from Yahoo Answers user Chris, who's been a member since January 17th, 2019.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.520
I didn't know there were new users to this service.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.720
I have to imagine most of them are coming from this podcast.

15:07.520 --> 15:14.720
Chris asks, why haven't other animals been as generous as lizards in their evolution?

15:19.360 --> 15:19.920
What?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.120
What?

15:24.560 --> 15:29.200
Animals need to eat other animals to live, but animals need to stay alive.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.360
And lizards developing the ability to lose their tail is a good compromise.

15:36.240 --> 15:40.000
Lizard stays alive, bird gets yum yum tail.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.120
It's true.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.320
It's true.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.560
Lizards-

15:46.560 --> 15:47.840
Can't fault the logic.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.480
Lizards are the only nice animals on the planet, maybe?

15:50.480 --> 15:51.360
I think so.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.080
Disgust.

15:54.560 --> 15:59.120
Okay, I will say that this would remove for me one of my most common guilt points in life,

15:59.120 --> 16:01.840
which is watching any documentary about animals.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.240
Yes.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.840
I'm like, I always want the animal to survive that's being chased.

16:05.840 --> 16:10.240
If the pig's belly would just fall off and then would regrow naturally.

16:10.240 --> 16:14.960
I think my take on it would change if you showed the snake chasing the thing

16:14.960 --> 16:18.400
and the thing got away and then you just follow the snake for the next like week

16:18.400 --> 16:20.960
as it just got like sadder and sadder about missing.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.160
And I would be like, no, you know what?

16:22.160 --> 16:24.240
Next time, I hope that mouse fucking dies.

16:24.240 --> 16:24.480
Yeah.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.920
That's a sad ass snake.

16:25.920 --> 16:30.640
Am I not generous to the animals of Earth with my body?

16:31.280 --> 16:36.000
Or do the animals of Earth need to learn to like nail clippings and hair?

16:38.320 --> 16:39.200
Because I got that.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.480
If you guys want to eat that, I got it.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.800
I like the implication of this question that way, way back in history,

16:46.800 --> 16:48.560
a lizard was being chased by a bird.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.000
The lizard tucked his tail in and got away and then thought, that was mean.

16:52.000 --> 16:52.480
You know what?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.200
I should have let him eat my butt.

16:57.040 --> 16:57.360
Go on.

16:57.360 --> 16:57.760
You know what?

16:57.760 --> 16:59.680
Next time, I'm going to let him eat my butt.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.720
The lizard, it feels good for the tail to come off.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.520
It's like getting a haircut.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.240
Lose weight?

17:04.240 --> 17:06.560
Because it's got a lot of bad tattoos on it.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.520
Yeah.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.200
A lot of bad memories with that tail.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.320
A lot of bad things. It's funny.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.240
And it probably makes a silly noise.

17:14.240 --> 17:14.640
Yeah.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.800
I've never been close enough to find out.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.120
Yeah.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.720
Do you think lizards are ever like,

17:19.360 --> 17:23.280
honey, there's so much jelly on your tail right now,

17:23.280 --> 17:25.840
and it is really disgusting and attracting a lot of flies.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.440
And the lizard's like, what's the point?

17:27.440 --> 17:30.320
I could clean it off, but it's just going to fall off here soon.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.280
They just flex?

17:31.280 --> 17:32.160
I just leave it.

17:32.160 --> 17:32.480
Hold on.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.200
Let me flex my butt to try to get my tail to slam the door on it.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.560
Hey, honey, do you know any hawks?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.600
What about the neighbors?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.440
We haven't had them over for dinner in a while.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.720
I'll have them come over and eat my butt.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.000
It's only generous.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.760
It's the least we could do.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.640
They helped us move.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.400
I'm going to tie the end of my tail to that door,

17:52.400 --> 17:53.920
and you've got to just slam it real fast.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.320
Slam it.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.640
What about eggs?

17:56.640 --> 17:57.120
Right?

17:57.120 --> 17:57.680
Chickens lay eggs.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.960
Yes. Okay. Yes.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.560
And you can eat those, right?

18:00.560 --> 18:01.360
That's generous.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.280
I'm almost positive lizards lay eggs too, though.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.360
So they still got them one up.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.200
Until a chicken's butt can fall off and grow back,

18:11.200 --> 18:13.040
it's hard for them to beat lizards.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.960
Tails, eggs, milk.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.640
What can't lizards do for us?

18:16.640 --> 18:17.760
Wait, hold on.

18:17.760 --> 18:22.640
At least one of those out of their lizard nibbles.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.680
Or is that the milk the lizard buys and then gives to somebody else?

18:29.680 --> 18:30.800
Hey, I've got some milk.

18:30.800 --> 18:36.720
Use this milk to wash down my butt.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.560
Oh, stuck in your teeth there, friend.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.200
I got you.

18:39.200 --> 18:39.920
I got you.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.480
Where is that for real, though?

18:42.480 --> 18:42.720
Okay.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.080
Where's the new tail even come from?

18:47.040 --> 18:48.480
One of their arms gets shorter.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.520
It's like bugs and stuff, right?

18:54.960 --> 18:58.320
The lizard will eat bugs and stuff and make a new tail out of it.

18:59.360 --> 18:59.920
So when they-

18:59.920 --> 19:05.840
The same way you make teeth out of cereal and carrots, right?

19:07.040 --> 19:09.520
You eat cereal and carrots and turn them into teeth.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.320
You know.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.040
You know.

19:11.040 --> 19:11.600
Science.

19:12.640 --> 19:16.160
I can't believe you told everybody about my secret breakfast time treat.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.200
You eat a lot of Ritz crackers and Capri Suns and it turns into wrists.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.280
Same thing.

19:25.280 --> 19:30.400
Oh, my hair keeps getting longer because I keep eating all this butter.

19:30.400 --> 19:36.480
I just got a new job at a call center here in town that has a lot of perks such as a gym.

19:38.080 --> 19:39.040
Poor lizards, man.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.000
They got it rough, huh?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.200
Well, if I didn't really thought about their plight-

19:43.200 --> 19:46.560
What if their tail comes off and they're like, that was a great tail.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.360
I love that tail.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.560
God damn it.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.320
Peter Capaldi tail was my favorite.

19:50.320 --> 19:56.400
Um, a lot of perks at this new job, such as gym, free meals, and a ton of discounts.

19:56.400 --> 20:03.200
Another perk is that we get a fully stocked self-service wet bar that employees can just go to.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.880
What is this place of business?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.400
Um, I don't know.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.680
It sounds cool.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.240
We'll ask.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.200
A call center?

20:09.200 --> 20:10.000
A call center.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.520
A chill call center for laid back people.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.880
It's a stressful job taking calls from pissed off customers all day.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.760
And I just need to know when it's appropriate to go to the well, if you know what I mean.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.800
Yeah, we do.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.280
We do.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.800
You mentioned it a sentence ago.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.760
Yeah, one sentence.

20:27.280 --> 20:32.880
Also, it would help if you could help me dodge the awkward eye contact from my new co-workers.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.120
That's from Boozy in Birmingham, are you here?

20:36.320 --> 20:36.800
Okay.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.360
So you drank-

20:37.360 --> 20:38.800
This one, we're just going to put this-

20:38.800 --> 20:39.760
Time to dunk.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.720
Um, I'm really glad that it's-

20:42.720 --> 20:44.240
I want to say one thing before we get started.

20:44.240 --> 20:49.040
One thing before we get started, I think it sucks that because of stuff like salad bars,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.360
we have to call real bars, wet bars.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.880
It does sound like an unfortunate-

20:54.880 --> 20:56.640
Like you go over like, oh, this is a wet bar.

20:56.640 --> 21:02.640
You know, the one with liquids at it, as opposed to like pizza and dessert pizza, CC's Pizza.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.000
I think it's a very good thing that it is a self-service bar, because otherwise, the

21:10.000 --> 21:14.320
idea of like, and now there's just a person in the room where you do work who's not working,

21:14.320 --> 21:18.560
but waiting for you to stop working to come over and like, hey, you live Thursday.

21:18.560 --> 21:18.800
Yeah.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.480
I'm bored.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.960
We had an experience like this one time.

21:24.960 --> 21:25.600
Oh my God.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.600
Can we not say the name of the city?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.000
We won't.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.640
Let's not put them on blast.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.440
Because it was not-

21:29.440 --> 21:30.400
It was incredibly nice.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.120
It was incredibly nice.

21:32.080 --> 21:37.280
They like made us dinner backstage, which usually we just don't, that doesn't really happen.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.440
They made us dinner, but they also had, and this is going to sound like kind of schmaltzy

21:41.440 --> 21:41.760
at first.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.640
And it was.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.680
We did not request this.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.320
We asked for like Ritz crackers and milk and some beers.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.600
And lizard butts.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.400
And lizard butts.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.800
Because they're just laying around.

21:50.800 --> 21:55.840
They had, and they did this for everybody, a barista back there making coffees for everybody.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.240
But it's just the three of us.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.520
And I was also really sick.

22:01.520 --> 22:07.280
So it's just like, this guy just stands there staring at Travis and Griffin who by 30 minutes

22:07.280 --> 22:12.960
of showtime are like this because of the social anxiety they want to make this guy feel valued.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.960
He would say across the room, like, are you sure you don't want anything?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.480
And they're like, oh yeah.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.080
Are you good on coffee?

22:20.080 --> 22:20.720
All right.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.680
They also had a huge record collection and a record player.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.160
So then there's the anxiety point there too of like, let me put on some cool tunes for

22:28.160 --> 22:29.520
my new friend.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.720
And they asked, like, what's a cool record you want to listen to?

22:32.720 --> 22:35.520
And I believe Griffin said, whatever you want to listen to.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.020
Yeah.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.120
Casey, you like?

22:39.120 --> 22:41.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.080
So the thing about this is this is a trap.

22:44.080 --> 22:44.580
Yeah.

22:44.580 --> 22:49.600
This shelf service wet bar, if you walk behind it, you just like fall through a trap door

22:49.600 --> 22:50.880
into unemployment.

22:50.880 --> 22:51.380
Yeah.

22:52.240 --> 22:56.400
If you upturn one of these bottles, a pink slip falls out.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.920
It's like, oh man.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.120
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

23:01.120 --> 23:01.680
Thank you, Seth.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.480
It's Yahoo Answers user, holy shit.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.520
It's Chris again.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.760
It's the same Chris.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.720
January 17, 2019.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.000
Chris, are you here?

23:18.000 --> 23:18.720
It's Chris.

23:18.720 --> 23:27.520
Chris asks, what if every cup ever disappeared?

23:30.480 --> 23:31.680
Now wait.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.240
Hold on.

23:32.240 --> 23:32.800
Hold on.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.680
Really think about it.

23:37.680 --> 23:42.960
What if every cup ever disappeared?

23:42.960 --> 23:43.600
Holy shit.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.040
First thing, soccer and hockey.

23:47.040 --> 23:47.600
Boring.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.480
Anticlimactic.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.440
I would also say last supper, that's out.

23:53.440 --> 23:53.920
That's gone.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.480
Soccer and hockey, anticlimactic.

23:58.080 --> 24:02.080
Most other sports where balls travel at higher velocities, much more exciting.

24:02.080 --> 24:02.560
Yeah.

24:02.560 --> 24:03.120
Danger.

24:03.120 --> 24:03.920
Ratchet it up.

24:03.920 --> 24:04.560
No cups.

24:05.600 --> 24:13.200
No cu- see cause it's kind of a fun twist on the thing.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.640
Do you think the-

24:14.640 --> 24:15.760
Hunt for the Holy Grail.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.320
Over.

24:16.320 --> 24:16.800
Undone.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.960
Do we now, does this mean-

24:19.600 --> 24:21.680
Now it's just called Jesus's cool bowl.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.720
That cool plate Jesus made, probably.

24:26.720 --> 24:31.600
Is it a thing of like, we've never known about cups or like we all now suddenly-

24:31.600 --> 24:32.160
It's a rapture.

24:32.160 --> 24:32.880
It's the cup sure.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.840
It's gone.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.200
We knew of them.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.120
We knew of them, but if you make a new one, it turns to ash in your hand.

24:39.120 --> 24:39.360
Yes.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.040
I think it's, there will be two flash points.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.640
Much like the rapture, the cup sure, there'll be two flash points.

24:46.640 --> 24:53.040
The one will be when I'm drinking my nice red wine over my nice new white linen pants.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.640
And then both of those things aren't true anymore.

24:56.640 --> 24:57.120
Right.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.280
And then also having to rebuild society when all the cups are gone.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.240
That we can't, so we can no longer make cups.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.280
It's not just like cups are gone-

25:05.280 --> 25:06.880
You make a cup, it turns to ash.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.840
These are the rules.

25:07.840 --> 25:14.640
So like, you would have to just like, if you were at a bar, just like stick your head under the tap.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.400
Or just like, ooh, just put taps on the wall, insert a dollar.

25:20.240 --> 25:26.080
Or you're like, I'll have a whiskey straight up and another for my gentleman friend here.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.840
And then you just extend both of your hands.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.120
I want to do it on the mic just to get a really good clean.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.240
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
Did you hear what happened to Susan?

25:40.240 --> 25:40.960
It's crazy.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.320
Hey, I just want to tell you, I'm having a really great time tonight.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.600
I'd love it if we could do this again.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.720
Anyway, here's to Mark and Susan.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.320
Best friends ever.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.320
May their marriage continue on in perpetuity and perfect happiness.

26:01.040 --> 26:04.000
A cheers at that point would just be a very messy high five.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.520
Yeah.

26:05.520 --> 26:10.720
And you know, now that he's gone, I just don't know how I'll be able to continue on.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.800
I'll have another.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.760
So anyway, I've turned, through prayer, I've turned this wine into the blood of Jesus.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.880
I'm just going to clip the end of this Ziploc baggie.

26:24.800 --> 26:29.920
I'll ask you to in turn just kind of gerbil style.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.560
If you could not, don't put your lips to it.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.080
It's cold and flu season.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.760
Please folks, be smart.

26:35.760 --> 26:42.000
Just hold the wafer up and I'm going to just pump this super soaker and just like get psyched.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.240
It's about to get wet and wild up in here.

26:45.280 --> 26:48.080
So did you need a urine sample?

26:48.640 --> 26:49.140
No.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.120
We didn't.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.000
You look trustworthy.

26:56.000 --> 26:56.960
You're fine.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.240
Oh shit.

27:00.240 --> 27:04.800
There's the best answer, only answer I hear from cat lover who says, that'd be bad.

27:06.960 --> 27:14.160
And the asker, the asker, fucking Chris, he gave that'd be bad one out of five stars to

27:14.160 --> 27:15.040
asker rating.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.680
I know it'd be bad.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.960
Fucking mad lad, Chris.

27:18.960 --> 27:19.680
I love this dude.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.880
I'm going to check his whole history.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.320
Get that, get that full SoundCloud up.

27:24.320 --> 27:24.800
Yeah.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.160
Oh, he's pretty good.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.920
He's asked a lot of questions since January 17th.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.560
Oh hey, he's sure, he's been busy.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.200
What would it be like if Shrek had a brother?

27:37.360 --> 27:38.960
Yes, yes.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.560
He read my fan fiction.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.440
What if he had two brothers, two younger brothers?

27:47.440 --> 27:48.960
I think it'd go a little something like this.

27:48.960 --> 27:49.840
Come on fellas.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.880
Would it be illegal to set up Burger King for a lawsuit?

27:52.880 --> 27:58.800
Chris, you got to get that money somehow.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.040
Hey everybody, it's Griffin.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.600
I'm just going to go ahead and do this money zone by myself.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.520
I'm not scared to do it by myself.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.120
A lot of people are saying I seem shaky.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.040
I seem nervous because the boys asked me to do this one by myself, but I'm not afraid.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.920
I'm so excited and I hope I make you proud of me.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.880
Uh, my first sponsor that we have is stamps.com.

28:22.880 --> 28:27.520
Stampies are little sticky pieces of paper that have fun images on them.

28:27.520 --> 28:32.720
And when you put them on your letters and packages and stuff, then it lets the, it's

28:32.720 --> 28:40.000
like a password for the male people to know that you are, it's a good male and therefore

28:40.000 --> 28:42.720
it deserves to get to the places that it needs to get to.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.120
Uh, here's the rough part.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.160
Postage rates, they recently went up again.

28:48.160 --> 28:53.520
But thankfully stamps.com can ease the pain with big old discounts off of post office

28:53.520 --> 28:54.640
retail sales.

28:54.640 --> 28:58.480
They have all the services of the US postal service and they put them right at your fingertips.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.640
You can buy and you can print these little sticky guys for any letter, any package, any

29:02.640 --> 29:04.800
class of mail using your own computer and printer.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.720
Stamps.com saves you money.

29:06.720 --> 29:10.160
They give you postage discounts you can't get at the post office, including five cents

29:10.160 --> 29:12.160
off every first class stamp.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.560
That junk adds up.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.520
So, uh, yeah, stamps.com is very, very helpful.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.800
If it's, you know, the snowpocalypse wherever you live, it's if winter has come like a game

29:22.800 --> 29:25.600
of Thrones, then you don't want to leave the house.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.440
You got to get your stamps.com right now.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.280
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in my

29:41.280 --> 29:41.680
brother.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.440
That's stamps.com.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.280
Enter my brother, all one word.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.560
Also want to tell you about Squarespace.

29:46.560 --> 29:50.880
Squarespace is the coolest shape zone that I can even think of.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.760
And if you go to it, then they're going to help you make a great website.

29:53.760 --> 29:58.800
We've used it to make countless websites, some goofy and fun, like a fun joke.

29:58.800 --> 30:04.000
But even when they're fun jokes, they look very pretty and beautiful and sexy.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.840
And that's what Squarespace does.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.440
They let you make websites you can use to showcase your work or announce an upcoming

30:09.440 --> 30:13.280
project or special project or upcoming event or special event.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.760
And you can promote your physical or online business.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.120
You can sell stuff using e-commerce functionality.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.880
They got world class designers making just cranking out fucking constantly cranking out

30:22.880 --> 30:26.000
these customizable beautiful templates.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.920
And they got analytics.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.320
And do they have search engine optimization?

30:30.960 --> 30:34.320
That's like asking if they have 24 seven award winning customer support.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.400
Because yes, the answer to both of those.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.680
Think it, dream it, make it with Squarespace.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.080
Go to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.600
And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code my brother, all one word to save 10%

30:45.600 --> 30:48.560
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.000
Oh hey, we just announced also that we're going to be doing some live shows coming up

30:52.000 --> 30:52.960
in April.

30:52.960 --> 31:00.400
We are going to be doing Taz, Amma, Bim Bam in that order on April 2nd and April 3rd in

31:00.400 --> 31:01.200
San Jose.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.840
And then April 4th, we're going to be bringing my brother, my brother, me to Salt Lake City.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.800
And we're very, very excited to get out there.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.800
We haven't been to either of those places before.

31:10.800 --> 31:14.320
And we're going to get there and we're going to do our sick twist at Brannock Goofs and

31:14.320 --> 31:17.760
probably get kicked out of town by the cops because of how sick and twisted it is.

31:17.760 --> 31:21.520
City Council's going to vote to kick us out because of how just fucked up it's going to

31:21.520 --> 31:22.160
be.

31:22.160 --> 31:28.000
But yeah, you can find the links to those at McElroy.shows and we hope that you come

31:28.000 --> 31:28.960
out and see us.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.600
We'll have all the ticket links there.

31:32.640 --> 31:38.640
We are going to put them on sale Friday, February 15th at 10am local time.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.240
There's not going to be a presale this time.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.840
So 10am local to wherever, whichever city you want to go to.

31:44.320 --> 31:49.520
This Friday, February 15th is when tickets are going to go on sale and yeah, keep an

31:49.520 --> 31:55.680
eye out and we'll have stuff up on the website probably by tomorrow or so.

31:55.680 --> 31:59.680
So again, Salt Lake City, San Jose, come on out.

31:59.680 --> 32:04.080
Thanks to everybody else who came out to our shows in Birmingham and New Orleans.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.680
We had a fucking amazing time.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.760
Thank you all so much for your hospitality.

32:07.760 --> 32:12.960
And yeah, I hope we can get out to more places soon and I think that's it.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.280
Thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.520
Go to MaximumFun.org, check out all the great shows there.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.760
They got shows like Friendly Fire.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.360
They got shows like Beef and Dairy Network.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.280
They got shows like One Bad Mother and a bunch more at MaximumFun.org.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.960
Again, we have other stuff at McElroy.shows.com.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.160
Again, we got other stuff at McElroy.family.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.640
I think I said the old web address earlier.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.400
I'm still getting used to it, growing pains.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.040
This is why I shouldn't be trusted to do this by myself.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.000
Oh, and thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for theme song.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.320
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.520
It's real good stuff.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.640
Okay, here's the rest of the episode.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.360
We'll be back with a regular episode next week.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.800
So we'll talk to you then, bye.

32:50.800 --> 32:55.280
Greetings, I am Plec Dexsetter contacting you from the Zik Squadron,

32:55.280 --> 32:59.120
which is frankly sort of crappy, but I'm here on a heroic mission

32:59.120 --> 33:01.920
with my trusty crew, C-53.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.520
Heroic, that's like an exaggeration.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.320
Okay, sure.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.480
And the security officer, Dar.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.240
Plec, don't put me in your stupid recording.

33:08.240 --> 33:12.880
And we're all traveling aboard our trusty starship, the Bargerian Jade.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.040
Bargy.

33:15.040 --> 33:15.280
What?

33:15.280 --> 33:16.400
Sorry, I'm awake.

33:16.400 --> 33:16.960
I'm awake.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.920
I was just flying while asleep.

33:21.680 --> 33:25.040
Hey there, this is Alden Ford, I play Plec, and we are so excited to announce

33:25.040 --> 33:29.200
that our podcast, Mission to Zix, is now part of the Maximum Fun Network.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.000
Our third season launches on Max Fun on March 20th.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.760
Binge seasons one and two right now.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.160
That's Mission to Zix, Z-Y-X-X.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.960
Oh man, I love Chris.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.560
Hey, you want to say something?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, I'd love to.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.640
From your iPad?

33:42.640 --> 33:43.840
Yeah, I'll say something from my iPad.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.600
Do you have a Yahoo you want to do?

33:45.600 --> 33:58.960
Here's one from Chris who asks,

34:04.640 --> 34:07.840
does, are you not going to interrupt me on this one?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.120
I just asked for Yahoo.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.000
Oh, okay.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.120
I'll read another Yahoo.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.680
Here's one sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

34:13.680 --> 34:14.240
Thank you, Seth.

34:14.240 --> 34:16.800
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who asks,

34:16.800 --> 34:18.400
are you going to interrupt me or not?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.560
I was just making that up.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.160
I thought for sure you were going to jump in and interrupt me.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.440
I'm so uncomfortable.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.000
All right.

34:28.000 --> 34:28.960
This one is sent in by-

34:28.960 --> 34:31.120
If you think I'm going to do it, I don't feel anything.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.160
Okay, sure.

34:32.160 --> 34:46.560
Moira sent this one in.

34:54.560 --> 34:54.960
No, no, no.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.360
You messed me up.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.560
There's no rhythm.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.520
There's no rhythm.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.080
I'm so on.

34:58.960 --> 34:59.840
I got to start over.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.240
Fuck.

35:00.240 --> 35:06.000
It's rubato.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.280
I want a munch.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.240
Started way too high.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.040
This is the Munch Squad.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.320
It's a podcast without a podcast.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.800
The latest and greatest in fast food innovation.

35:24.800 --> 35:32.400
I had several sort of lined up for the hometown crowd here in Alabama.

35:32.400 --> 35:36.240
And this one is a late entry from Wendy's.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.960
Wendy's, I feel like it's been a little while since Wendy's.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.640
Yeah, we don't often get Wendy's on Munch Squad.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.280
But Wendy's beefs up menu.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.080
So I need you to say that word again, but way slower.

35:51.040 --> 35:51.840
Wendy's.

35:51.840 --> 35:52.880
Got that word.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.360
Beefs up menu.

35:56.160 --> 35:56.480
Okay.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.560
Because beef with three new burgers.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.320
Wendy's.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.440
God, this one really hurts.

36:05.440 --> 36:06.880
Hang in there with me, okay?

36:06.880 --> 36:10.400
We're going to get through it together and we're not going to get depressed, okay?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.080
We all promise that right now, okay?

36:13.120 --> 36:16.320
We're going to have fun after this, but we do have to get through it, okay?

36:16.320 --> 36:17.920
Let's all take our medicine.

36:17.920 --> 36:23.840
And remember that a person, in much the same way that you're a person, wrote this.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.840
I need a sip, hold on.

36:31.120 --> 36:36.160
Wendy's new made to crave menu unlocks a whole new world of cheeseburgers

36:38.640 --> 36:45.760
made with unforgettable flavors that take craveability to its peak, period, end of sentence.

36:45.760 --> 36:53.200
One more time, because I think whoever invented language, if they heard this one,

36:53.200 --> 36:55.840
they'd be like, I'm just going to go to the park.

36:58.000 --> 37:04.000
Wendy's new made to crave menu unlocks a whole new world of cheeseburgers

37:04.880 --> 37:09.120
made with unforgettable flavors that take craveability to its peak.

37:11.120 --> 37:15.120
There have been some really craveable substances on earth before this.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.240
Yeah, it's at its peak.

37:16.240 --> 37:20.720
The new made to crave line introduces a trio of cheeseburgers

37:20.720 --> 37:23.040
to the fresh, never frozen beef family.

37:23.680 --> 37:29.440
Sawsome bacon cheeseburger, peppercorn mushroom melt, and barbecue cheeseburger.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.040
Did you say sawsome?

37:31.040 --> 37:46.720
Well, Travis, this time I said sawsome, because it's S, apostrophe, A, with some sawsome.

37:46.720 --> 37:47.760
Okay, shut up.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.560
Everybody, shut up.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.880
Let's face it.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.360
We've been in denial for too long.

37:59.360 --> 38:03.040
If nobody else is going to fucking say it, I'll fucking say it.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.600
Let's face it, everybody.

38:06.400 --> 38:16.240
Foodies want maximum craveability and quickly get hooked on the deliciously different flavors

38:16.240 --> 38:19.200
Wendy's is known for, bringing to the table.

38:19.200 --> 38:25.280
Deliciously different is capitalized, bringing to the table,

38:25.280 --> 38:30.480
but sometimes these on-trend flavors are offered for a limited time.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.360
So what?

38:35.520 --> 38:37.440
Why did you bring me here, Dave?

38:39.120 --> 38:42.160
This was written by DeepMind.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.560
This was written by a machine learning program.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.240
This one scrolled through the QSR web.

38:48.240 --> 38:48.740
Uh-oh.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.840
Fuck this fucking thing.

38:51.840 --> 38:55.600
I think someone's trolling me, honestly.

38:55.600 --> 39:02.480
The now made to crave offers the same deliciousness as an exclusive menu item,

39:03.360 --> 39:04.560
but is here to stay.

39:09.600 --> 39:18.320
Let me finish so you can have flavor for days, specifically Monday through Sunday all year long.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.760
I'm going to read it all together.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.640
Let's face it.

39:22.640 --> 39:27.280
Foodies want maximum craveability and quickly get hooked on the deliciously different flavors

39:27.280 --> 39:29.440
Wendy's is known for, bringing to the table,

39:29.440 --> 39:33.600
but sometimes these on-trend flavors are offered for a limited time.

39:33.600 --> 39:38.400
Now made to crave offers the same deliciousness as an exclusive menu item,

39:38.400 --> 39:42.160
but is here to stay so you can have flavor for days,

39:42.160 --> 39:46.000
specifically Monday through Sunday all year long.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.600
That I love how that whole paragraph is written with a tone of voice of,

39:49.600 --> 39:50.720
is this what you want?

39:52.320 --> 39:53.520
Does this make you happy?

39:53.520 --> 39:54.960
We don't know anymore.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.440
The image of somebody taking a bite out of a very wet hamburger

40:00.720 --> 40:02.640
and then saying out loud,

40:03.680 --> 40:05.040
this is so delicious.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.680
It, it must be from June only.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.160
You're telling me this is available year round?

40:12.160 --> 40:13.280
This is year round.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.760
I would like to eat this Monday through Sunday.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.400
Monday through Sunday every day of the year.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.080
It's Monday through Sunday every day of the year.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.200
So Thursday?

40:21.200 --> 40:21.700
Yeah.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.040
I crave this immediately.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.200
I have a quote from Kurt Cain, Wendy's executive vice president.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.000
I thought for fucking sure you were going to say from Kurt Cameron.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.880
My spiritual dad, Jesus, made these burgers and it's awesome.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.720
The shape of this burger just proves evolution.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.800
The shape, the shape of this word proves the devil exists because sawsome

40:47.680 --> 40:49.360
was spoken by a human tongue.

40:50.080 --> 40:54.240
Quote, there's a reason we named the new menu line made to crave,

40:54.240 --> 40:56.560
said Kurt Cain, because it's true.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.080
Okay.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.320
But it, who makes a new cheeseburger line and it's like,

41:04.320 --> 41:06.240
we don't want these to be craved.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.680
No one will want this.

41:07.680 --> 41:12.240
These hamburgers are so undeniably good that made to crave is being integrated

41:12.240 --> 41:13.760
as part of our everyday menu.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.160
But that's just putting new things on a menu.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.880
No, you stupid idiot.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
They're making craveable options,

41:24.320 --> 41:29.200
peak flavorability for foodies like you to re-enjoy all fring-dong.

41:29.200 --> 41:29.520
Yeah.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.560
None of it means anything.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.600
Now they're going to have to train all their employees when somebody's like,

41:37.600 --> 41:39.840
yeah, let me get a five piece of chicken nuggets.

41:39.840 --> 41:43.120
And then the employees just have to say, you fucking idiot.

41:45.120 --> 41:45.760
Are you sure?

41:45.760 --> 41:47.200
Are you sure?

41:47.200 --> 41:49.920
It's not peak craveability, you dummy.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.520
The sawsome bacon cheeseburger.

41:53.520 --> 41:54.720
Now you did say bacon.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.640
You did just say bacon.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.680
You're welcome.

41:57.680 --> 42:01.760
Peppercorn mushroom melt and barbecue cheeseburger are individually crafted

42:01.760 --> 42:03.360
and available every day.

42:03.360 --> 42:06.480
So you can indulge in the flavors you want when you want them.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.680
How wild would it be if the inverse were true?

42:09.680 --> 42:10.880
You get involved.

42:10.880 --> 42:14.480
You can indulge the flavors you want when we decide you're damn good and ready.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.160
Can I have the sawsome?

42:18.160 --> 42:18.400
No.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.960
Has baby been a good boy?

42:22.720 --> 42:23.680
I don't know, Dave.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.000
I mean, I guess.

42:26.000 --> 42:26.800
I guess, Dave.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.680
What do you mean, bud?

42:27.680 --> 42:30.320
I don't need to read the descriptions of all the things,

42:30.320 --> 42:32.480
but I do want to close with the opening line.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.480
You're not going to explain to me what sawsome is?

42:36.080 --> 42:37.440
It's just much ketchup.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.440
It's got a windy side of sawsome sauce.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.920
Lathered between a warm and fluffy premium bun.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.600
There's meat and shit too.

42:45.600 --> 42:46.480
I just skipped to the end.

42:47.680 --> 42:52.400
What kind of raggedy dog ass buns have you been feeding us this whole time, Dave?

42:54.480 --> 42:54.800
Okay.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.800
Here's the opener for the description of the barbecue cheeseburger.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.320
Because I know you read then you're like,

43:00.320 --> 43:01.520
what the fuck could that be?

43:01.520 --> 43:08.240
Wendy's has long understood what makes barbecue taste so great.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.280
It has done nothing with this information, but we know it.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.760
You fucking braggarts.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.080
You know, you like barbecue,

43:18.080 --> 43:20.720
but you probably don't know why it tastes so great, but we do.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.280
Fuck off.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.040
Wendy's has long understood what makes barbecue taste so great.

43:27.040 --> 43:30.160
Now the barbecue cheeseburger finds that backyard balance

43:30.160 --> 43:32.720
of sweet and heat with a touch of smoke.

43:32.720 --> 43:37.040
So Wendy's knew, but they didn't want to share it with you,

43:37.040 --> 43:39.840
the consumer, until you were damn good and ready for it.

43:40.960 --> 43:44.880
But that also kind of sounds like Wendy's is someone who just tasted barbecue

43:44.880 --> 43:47.600
for the first time and said, you know what makes this good?

43:47.600 --> 43:48.560
Sauce.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.520
You know, I think the secret is the sauce.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.680
I think the sauce is what makes barbecue good.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.400
Hey, is this mayonnaise?

43:56.400 --> 44:00.560
No, Dave, it's not.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.120
It's barbecue sauce.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.000
Oh, shit.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.160
That's the secret, right?

44:07.120 --> 44:09.280
Oh, it's right in front of you the whole time.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.480
Anyway, I'm going to tell my kids about this

44:13.760 --> 44:15.840
and maybe they'll action the information.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.440
I did my will that they can't act on it for 20 years.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.800
Yes, bury the secret.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.640
Too fucking craveable.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.480
The world's not ready.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.040
We're not ready.

44:25.040 --> 44:28.080
We don't have enough locations to burn us down.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.840
Like when those dorks couldn't get that special sauce at McDonald's.

44:31.840 --> 44:32.560
We don't need that.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.960
We don't need one of those scenarios.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.800
Saw some, saw some, saw some.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.280
They're lifting the building up and carrying it to the river.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.560
They don't even know what saw some sauce is.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.520
I'm a real sheep in the river.

44:51.520 --> 44:56.000
As soon as you started chanting, I, like a sheep I am, just joined in the chant.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.360
I just love chanting.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.800
It was amazing to watch that happen.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.320
How quickly I was there.

45:00.320 --> 45:00.880
It's a human.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.440
Do you want a Yahoo?

45:03.440 --> 45:03.920
Yes.

45:03.920 --> 45:04.480
Yeah, sure.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.040
Okay.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.680
This one is sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

45:07.680 --> 45:08.160
Thank you, Seth.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.200
It's Yahoo Answers user.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.760
They're anonymous, so I'm going to call them Dave asks,

45:11.760 --> 45:20.720
how can I make a 2004 Honda Accord sexy as shit?

45:20.720 --> 45:21.360
How is that?

45:21.360 --> 45:25.920
How are they allowed to, oh, they've used like a special eye.

45:25.920 --> 45:29.520
So the Yahoo Answers filter didn't, didn't get them.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.520
There's a put some boobs on it.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.760
Travis says, put some breasts.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.960
Put some boobs on that 2004 Honda Accord.

45:36.960 --> 45:37.760
Why not?

45:37.760 --> 45:38.800
Why not do that?

45:38.800 --> 45:39.520
I asked.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.840
I can think of a few reasons.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.640
Aerodynamics.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.120
Aerodynamics is not chief among them.

45:45.120 --> 45:48.160
No, it's a big, that's what truck nuts are all about, right?

45:49.040 --> 45:49.520
Yeah.

45:49.520 --> 45:50.320
Make it sexy.

45:51.840 --> 45:54.320
I don't know that anybody has ever looked at any nuts

45:54.320 --> 45:57.200
and been like, that's looks, that looks good to me.

45:57.200 --> 45:57.760
Damn.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.160
I'm pretty sure they're just kind of there.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.520
Yeah, I'm pretty sure when someone hangs truck nuts

46:03.520 --> 46:06.880
on their car, they're not like, ah, now people want to have sex

46:06.880 --> 46:07.440
with my car.

46:07.440 --> 46:07.920
Yes.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.680
People want to have sex with my car.

46:09.680 --> 46:12.320
You guys need to read some more of my car's fan fiction.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.560
If we have not talked about this before,

46:16.560 --> 46:18.480
I will eat my shoe on stage.

46:20.320 --> 46:23.760
How do you make a 2004 Honda Accord sexy as shit?

46:25.600 --> 46:27.440
Who is the car trying to seduce?

46:27.440 --> 46:28.560
I guess that's the question.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.080
That's the problem, right?

46:30.080 --> 46:32.400
You got to cover all your bases.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.040
Truck nuts.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.640
Yabo, like Travis has suggested.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.440
Pictures of, you know, Lola Bunny from Space Jam.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:44.560 --> 46:45.120
That's it.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.520
I will say that did get the biggest reaction

46:49.520 --> 46:51.840
from our audience of everything we've said so far.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.600
Just those three things.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.600
Covers the gamut.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.840
And teach it taekwondo.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.520
Teaching, what's that?

47:01.520 --> 47:02.720
And teach it taekwondo.

47:02.720 --> 47:03.040
Okay.

47:03.040 --> 47:06.640
And teach it taekwondo, because that's something

47:06.640 --> 47:10.720
that a lot of people find very attractive.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.000
Okay, the other three things.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.400
A picture of Justin doing a spin kick.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.000
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.560
Just like, teach the car taekwondo.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.800
Or how to play guitar.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.560
Cars can't play guitar.

47:22.560 --> 47:24.160
There's no way that makes sense.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.760
We're being redundant.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.440
This thing's got Lola Bunny in it.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.920
Wait, is Lola Bunny in the car?

47:29.920 --> 47:31.600
Yeah, I'm going to go cash the checks.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.760
Yeah, I'm going to go cash the checks right now.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.640
So you get in the car and Lola Bunny's just sitting in it?

47:39.520 --> 47:39.760
Yeah.

47:41.920 --> 47:42.720
But how?

47:42.720 --> 47:44.720
Are we in a cool world scenario?

47:45.360 --> 47:47.040
I'm so glad you've asked.

47:48.240 --> 47:48.480
No.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.520
So then, how?

47:54.240 --> 47:56.560
This is a fucking joke podcast, Travis.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.200
We weave magical fantasies.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.280
Let him have it.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.960
Let the boy have his tapestries.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.040
Please, Travis.

48:05.840 --> 48:06.960
We gotta do audience questions.

48:06.960 --> 48:09.520
Yes, we have a handful of audience questions picked out.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.600
We're going to call you down by name and seat number.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.360
And can we get house lights turned up?

48:13.360 --> 48:14.560
Because I do not know where the microphones are.

48:14.560 --> 48:15.920
I see there's one right there.

48:15.920 --> 48:16.960
Probably one right there.

48:16.960 --> 48:17.360
Hi.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.240
Hello.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.960
I got really scared for a second that you weren't going to say anything.

48:20.960 --> 48:21.520
Yeah, what's up?

48:22.560 --> 48:23.600
What's your name?

48:23.600 --> 48:24.160
Douglas.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.040
Douglas, hi.

48:25.040 --> 48:25.280
Hi.

48:25.280 --> 48:30.000
Hi, so my husband thinks he's allergic to corn.

48:30.000 --> 48:30.240
Okay.

48:31.760 --> 48:32.400
Is he?

48:32.400 --> 48:32.800
Is he?

48:33.760 --> 48:35.120
Wait, are you asking us?

48:35.760 --> 48:37.200
Ah, damn, Douglas.

48:37.920 --> 48:38.640
Okay, wait.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.120
Damn.

48:39.760 --> 48:43.440
Are you saying that this is a completely untested theory?

48:43.440 --> 48:44.720
That your husband has-

48:44.720 --> 48:46.400
Well, let's not fucking risk it.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.840
If he's living a corn-free life.

48:49.840 --> 48:53.200
At this point, probably he does not build up the tolerance to corn.

48:53.200 --> 48:53.680
Yeah.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.920
Douglas, the facts are these.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.000
The floor is yours.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.280
Oh, okay.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.080
We don't know the facts.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.280
Vis-a-vis corn allergens.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.400
So he's been having a hard time sleeping at night.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.600
And you think corn will make it easier for him to sleep?

49:14.240 --> 49:18.960
Well, he traced it first to the night that he had a hard time sleeping,

49:18.960 --> 49:20.880
he would eat a whole bag of Doritos.

49:20.880 --> 49:24.160
And hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.720
Somebody, and I don't want to know who,

49:26.720 --> 49:29.280
because I will bring the wrath of God down on whoever,

49:29.280 --> 49:30.080
which one of the two.

49:31.120 --> 49:33.200
Your first thought was,

49:33.200 --> 49:36.080
the vegetable that went into these must be bad.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.760
Yeah, can't fault you there.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.840
So he stopped doing that?

49:47.840 --> 49:48.400
Yeah.

49:48.400 --> 49:48.960
I'm sorry.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.920
He stopped doing that.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.680
Stopped eating Doritos late at night.

49:53.680 --> 49:55.520
An entire bag before bed?

49:55.520 --> 49:56.000
Yes.

49:56.000 --> 49:56.720
An entire bag before bed.

49:56.720 --> 50:01.040
Probably in the bed under the covers where you can't see and God can't either.

50:03.840 --> 50:04.160
Okay.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.640
So then it shifted to on taco night,

50:08.640 --> 50:10.560
he then started having trouble sleeping.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.880
And he cited the corn tortilla chips.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.960
I mean, that's some Dr. Howe shit right there.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.400
Yeah, right there.

50:18.400 --> 50:18.720
Yeah.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.280
Douglas, first off,

50:23.920 --> 50:27.600
why is it that when we eat pretty much every meal, it's dinner,

50:27.600 --> 50:29.440
but when we have tacos, it's a day?

50:31.280 --> 50:32.320
You notice that?

50:32.320 --> 50:34.880
Anyway, that's my five minutes, everybody.

50:34.880 --> 50:35.200
Thanks.

50:35.200 --> 50:35.920
That's my time.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.040
Douglas, I think that your husband should eat some corn.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.160
And I don't mean tacos, okay?

50:46.160 --> 50:48.560
And I don't mean Doritos.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.680
No, here's what you got.

50:49.680 --> 50:52.480
It's like if I was at a test to see if I'm allergic to potatoes,

50:52.480 --> 50:53.760
I wouldn't eat Pringles.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.560
Yeah, I would just maybe try this one.

50:57.440 --> 50:58.240
Corn.

50:58.800 --> 50:59.600
Or, or.

50:59.600 --> 51:03.040
Because it's possible that your husband is just allergic to being flavor blasted.

51:03.040 --> 51:03.600
Maybe.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.400
Travis has the right...

51:06.400 --> 51:10.400
Take the Doritos, run them under some sink water for a little bit,

51:10.400 --> 51:15.040
then force feed them to him because he's not going to want to eat them.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.880
Kind of want to eat them, they're going to look real bad.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.560
It's going to be a real spoonful of sugar situation to get those,

51:20.560 --> 51:21.600
those wet guys down.

51:21.600 --> 51:22.160
So hopefully...

51:22.160 --> 51:23.520
Maybe just try corn.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.120
Yeah, just try corn also could do it.

51:25.120 --> 51:25.760
Does that help?

51:27.120 --> 51:30.080
We did, and he still came to this conclusion.

51:30.080 --> 51:30.400
Okay.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.080
Oh no, wait, hold on.

51:32.080 --> 51:37.280
What kind of reaction did, did your husband have from the straight pure from the source?

51:37.280 --> 51:38.560
Uncut corn.

51:38.560 --> 51:39.680
Uncut corn.

51:41.120 --> 51:42.640
He just couldn't sleep that night.

51:43.920 --> 51:44.240
Okay.

51:44.240 --> 51:44.880
Okay.

51:44.880 --> 51:50.880
Now when you say couldn't sleep, was he having them corn worries?

51:50.880 --> 51:51.120
Yeah.

51:51.920 --> 51:55.520
Because sometimes I get them corn worries real bad and I can't sleep either.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.880
Travis gets the pain in his corn worries.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.040
I get them corn worries going.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.920
Get a knock on my phone at three in the morning

52:03.920 --> 52:07.360
and it's my brother telling me he's got them darn corn worries.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.320
Hey, it's old Travis, I got them corn worries.

52:12.320 --> 52:16.400
Corn worries keeping me awake, troubling my brain with them corn worries.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.840
And make his body sick.

52:18.720 --> 52:19.520
Them corn worries.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.800
Oh, I got them corn troubles deep down in my belly guts.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.160
Deep down corn worries.

52:24.160 --> 52:28.000
Oh, in the heart of my soul feeling them corn worries.

52:29.840 --> 52:30.880
Troubling me.

52:30.880 --> 52:31.840
Troubling his dreams.

52:31.840 --> 52:33.280
Troubling right my head.

52:33.280 --> 52:34.640
Oh no, everybody left.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.840
Douglas, does that help?

52:38.640 --> 52:39.280
Thank you.

52:39.280 --> 52:43.120
Thank you.

52:43.120 --> 52:47.200
That is the least actionable thing we've ever said on this show.

52:47.200 --> 52:47.600
Hello.

52:48.880 --> 52:49.360
Hello.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.320
Who are you?

52:50.320 --> 52:51.120
I am Cody.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.160
Hi, Cody.

52:52.160 --> 52:52.960
What's your question?

52:53.920 --> 52:57.280
How do I get my dad to stop buttering his toast with his fingers?

53:02.800 --> 53:05.600
Now that was the one sentence you sent us.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.600
Are there no additional details?

53:07.600 --> 53:09.760
What are the other details?

53:10.320 --> 53:10.960
Guys, hold on.

53:10.960 --> 53:11.760
Devil's advocate.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.360
What the fuck else do we need to know?

53:14.080 --> 53:15.680
Wait, is it country croc?

53:15.680 --> 53:16.480
No, we got-

53:16.480 --> 53:19.760
Well, what does your dad say when you're like, a knife?

53:20.880 --> 53:24.400
Apparently people can be allergic to corn by just not sleeping.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.160
Maybe the dad's allergic to knives.

53:27.200 --> 53:30.000
Most people are allergic to knives if you think about it.

53:30.960 --> 53:32.240
My only weakness.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.840
Julius Caesar wasn't like, how did you know?

53:40.880 --> 53:41.600
Hey, though.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.440
Hey, Cody, though, for real?

53:43.440 --> 53:44.000
For real?

53:44.000 --> 53:44.560
Why?

53:45.840 --> 53:46.640
Why does it happen like this?

53:46.640 --> 53:48.080
Answer for your dad's crimes, Cody.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.600
I think he just doesn't want to do dishes.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.680
All right, now your dad's my fucking absolute dog.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.180
Yes.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.760
God gave us plates and knives.

53:59.760 --> 54:00.260
And cutlery.

54:00.260 --> 54:02.480
Plates and knives. And cups.

54:04.880 --> 54:05.600
And forks.

54:07.680 --> 54:08.720
Can I say something?

54:09.360 --> 54:10.560
I respect this.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.600
I do because I hate that.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.320
When I make toast for my daughter every morning,

54:16.320 --> 54:18.720
and there's like one thing that the knife does,

54:18.720 --> 54:20.640
and then it has to go in the sink for that?

54:22.000 --> 54:23.200
Just good old butter?

54:24.080 --> 54:25.360
That didn't hurt nobody.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.880
Butter don't give no one worries.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.920
My friend, butter?

54:27.920 --> 54:32.000
Hey, one thing you could try is give your dad spray butter.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.000
Because that tastes-

54:34.000 --> 54:35.760
He just sprayed on his fucking fingers.

54:35.760 --> 54:37.120
He likes the feel of it now.

54:39.120 --> 54:41.040
What about Wolverine claws?

54:41.040 --> 54:42.320
Wolverine claws.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.080
Now he's got the knife baked in.

54:44.080 --> 54:47.360
Cody, I once watched my dad put butter on a Pop-Tart.

54:47.360 --> 54:52.560
So I guess what I'm saying is it could be worse.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.880
Yeah, your dad could be our dad.

54:54.880 --> 54:56.080
Your dad could be our dad.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.920
That's for still counting your blessings.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.360
Count your blessings.

54:59.360 --> 55:00.080
Does your dad-

55:01.520 --> 55:02.640
Hey, we should have asked earlier.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.440
Is your dad nasty?

55:06.640 --> 55:08.960
I know nobody likes to wonder whether or not

55:08.960 --> 55:10.400
their folks are nasty,

55:10.400 --> 55:12.560
but there comes a day when everyone must look

55:12.560 --> 55:14.000
in that deep dark truth from here and say,

55:14.000 --> 55:15.200
do I have nasty folks?

55:16.160 --> 55:17.280
You got a nasty dad?

55:17.280 --> 55:18.000
You got a nasty dad?

55:18.000 --> 55:18.880
You can tell me, Cody.

55:18.880 --> 55:19.600
It's just us.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.200
Everybody plug your ears.

55:21.200 --> 55:21.760
Close your ears.

55:21.760 --> 55:22.480
Close your ears, everybody.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.400
Cody's gonna tell me he's got a nasty dad.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.840
Hey folks, don't close your ears.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.280
You paid a lot of money for these tickets.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.640
You deserve to find out if Cody's dad is nasty or not.

55:30.640 --> 55:30.960
Yeah.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.080
Cody, expose your dad.

55:34.960 --> 55:35.760
Show us your dad.

55:37.680 --> 55:38.320
Cody?

55:38.320 --> 55:38.800
Nasty.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.120
Oh, he's nasty.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.440
Okay.

55:44.080 --> 55:46.160
There's no fixing nasty, Cody.

55:46.160 --> 55:48.080
There's no fixing that.

55:48.080 --> 55:48.880
Does that help?

55:49.680 --> 55:50.960
You've helped me, Cody.

55:50.960 --> 55:51.360
Thank you.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.080
Thank you, Cody.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.760
You and your nasty dad.

55:53.760 --> 55:54.240
Okay.

55:54.240 --> 55:54.880
Final question.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.000
Hello.

55:56.000 --> 55:56.800
Hi, my name is Renee.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.000
I use she, her pronouns.

55:58.000 --> 55:58.320
Thank you.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.200
Hi, Renee.

55:59.200 --> 55:59.760
Renee, yes.

55:59.760 --> 56:00.480
Hello, Renee.

56:00.480 --> 56:00.880
Hello.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.200
So I work at a summer camp in upstate New York.

56:03.200 --> 56:05.280
And my first summer there, we were getting all the cabins

56:05.280 --> 56:07.680
ready and I noticed that there were just coffee

56:07.680 --> 56:09.200
cans in all the cabins.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.200
So I asked my boss what they were for.

56:11.200 --> 56:14.000
And he told me that there, in case a bat gets in the building

56:14.000 --> 56:16.480
at night, we have to catch it with the coffee can.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.680
And I thought he was kidding and he's not.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.760
This is in line with like CDC requirements.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.400
So we didn't have any bats the first summer,

56:24.400 --> 56:26.720
but I'm going back the next summer.

56:26.720 --> 56:30.240
So I would like some assistance because I need to know

56:30.240 --> 56:32.560
how to catch the bat with just the coffee can

56:32.560 --> 56:34.960
and like 10 or so 11-year-olds.

56:34.960 --> 56:36.880
Because if I cannot catch the bat-

56:36.880 --> 56:38.640
Yeah, you come to the right place.

56:38.640 --> 56:41.280
Everyone in the room has to go on rabies medicine

56:41.280 --> 56:41.840
and I don't want that.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.040
Holy shit.

56:43.040 --> 56:43.520
Yeah.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.720
You should quit.

56:44.720 --> 56:45.040
Yeah.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.840
That's the highest stake job I've ever heard.

56:49.840 --> 56:50.320
Yeah.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.800
And my sister-in-law is a doctor.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.960
Is, sorry, did you say the CDC requires it?

56:57.840 --> 56:58.080
Yeah.

56:58.080 --> 57:01.120
The CDC suggests even if a bat like swoops by your head,

57:01.120 --> 57:01.920
you should get rabies.

57:01.920 --> 57:05.920
Oh, I thought you said the CDC suggested it's chill.

57:05.920 --> 57:06.960
Keep a coffee can.

57:08.720 --> 57:11.840
My understanding is the state of New York requires that.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.920
Do you know there's better things to catch things?

57:15.200 --> 57:16.400
They make nets.

57:16.400 --> 57:17.920
They've chosen a device.

57:18.480 --> 57:21.680
The aperture of which is about bat sized.

57:21.680 --> 57:24.480
What they've given you is a fucking carnival game.

57:27.120 --> 57:31.520
You're playing fucking mini golf with a bat.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.080
Oh, man.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.200
Get the 10-year-olds together.

57:34.720 --> 57:36.960
Tell them that the bat knows where to go play Fortnite.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.440
And then your job is done.

57:42.320 --> 57:45.040
Those little bastards will be flying around the room.

57:45.040 --> 57:49.520
Fill the coffee can halfway up with lizard tails.

57:49.520 --> 57:52.320
Bat flies in.

57:52.320 --> 57:53.680
You could lure the bat.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.280
What does the bat crave?

57:55.280 --> 57:55.920
Fear?

57:55.920 --> 57:56.420
Yes.

57:58.000 --> 57:58.800
Bugs?

57:58.800 --> 57:59.360
Yes.

57:59.360 --> 58:00.240
The Joker.

58:00.240 --> 58:00.880
The Joker.

58:01.600 --> 58:02.320
Could you fill...

58:03.680 --> 58:04.880
Batman, love it.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.200
Okay.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.160
You can say the bat and I only know one of the bats.

58:08.160 --> 58:11.760
Could you fill the jar with bugs and just he goes into the jar?

58:12.880 --> 58:14.560
I mean, hypothetically, yes.

58:14.560 --> 58:17.680
What about just a sign on the front door that says bugs are outside?

58:17.680 --> 58:19.680
That's good.

58:19.680 --> 58:20.960
But it has to be...

58:20.960 --> 58:21.600
In bat.

58:21.600 --> 58:22.560
It has to be...

58:22.560 --> 58:25.520
No, it has to be bumpy so they can read it with echolocation.

58:27.520 --> 58:28.480
Raised letters.

58:28.480 --> 58:28.960
Raised letters.

58:28.960 --> 58:29.520
Raised letters.

58:29.520 --> 58:30.320
So important.

58:30.320 --> 58:30.820
Ah!

58:32.720 --> 58:33.920
They don't have any bugs in there.

58:33.920 --> 58:35.200
I know because I yelled at it.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.960
I yelled at it real good with my voice ears.

58:38.960 --> 58:41.200
Get a fake bat and nail it to the wall.

58:41.200 --> 58:43.200
And then when the bat comes in, just point at it.

58:44.800 --> 58:45.680
That's you.

58:45.680 --> 58:46.640
I did that.

58:46.640 --> 58:47.440
You're next.

58:47.440 --> 58:53.840
Is there an animal on Earth that when you look at Google pictures of it, looks so cute,

58:53.840 --> 58:58.240
but then when one just shows up, it's the worst shit in the whole fucking world?

58:58.240 --> 58:58.800
Babies.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.440
Woof, woof, woof.

59:05.440 --> 59:06.160
Rough stuff.

59:06.160 --> 59:07.280
I love my daughter very much.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.920
Yeah, put that shit on a fucking Hot Topic t-shirt.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.960
Let's start flinging them.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.600
Renee, does that help?

59:13.600 --> 59:14.400
Yes, thank you.

59:14.400 --> 59:15.120
Thank you, Renee.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.360
Uh, folks, this has been so fun.

59:18.400 --> 59:22.800
Birmingham, you are a, I'm gonna go ahead and say a hoot, if I may.

59:22.800 --> 59:23.840
And you know what?

59:23.840 --> 59:24.800
And a holler.

59:24.800 --> 59:27.520
I could get used to this wild Alabama energy.

59:27.520 --> 59:28.560
This is very good.

59:32.800 --> 59:38.480
And hey, just for laughs, if 400 of you wanted to come kick it in New Orleans,

59:38.480 --> 59:42.960
so we would love to have, we could probably get like a caravan,

59:42.960 --> 59:45.920
like some kind of like car sharing thing going.

59:45.920 --> 59:46.720
It'll be fun.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
If you already have tickets for the New Orleans show,

59:50.000 --> 59:53.360
just turn to someone to your left or right and say, what it come with?

59:53.360 --> 59:56.080
Unless, let us check what percentage we're at.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.560
Because if we can pull off the Grand Prix and get all three.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.040
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Linters for these.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.440
For our theme song, it's a departure of the old days to bed.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:15.120
And thank you to Sawbones and Schmaners for crushing it.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.880
Thank you to all of our wives and families without whom's permission,

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.760
we would not be here.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.200
Permissions are weird.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.120
I know, I started the sentence and then I couldn't, without whose blessing?

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.000
Worse.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.520
Thank you to Paul Seborin.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.720
Thank you to Paul Seborin.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.680
We can all live on that.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.480
Thank you to Amanda, who helps us put shows together.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.840
Yes, Amanda, thank you to CA.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.560
And thank you to this beautiful, beautiful theater

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.080
and the people who had us here to do a show.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:44.960
It's been super fun.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.280
Thank you.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.680
Every week on My Brother, My Brother and Me,

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.040
my brother Griffin reads a final Yahoo that we think about

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.200
then we come back to the next day to discuss it.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.800
We will be doing that now.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:00:59.760
Sam.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.600
Oh wait, we almost forgot the posters.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.800
The posters, holy shit.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.000
Please get the posters there.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.720
I need to say, I did those.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.920
They're so fun.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.960
I really love them.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.200
Yes.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.720
Here it comes from Sam.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.280
Thank you, Sam.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.360
It's Yahoo Answers user Kevin, who asks,

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.520
does peanut butter make boys bigger?

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.440
My name is Justin McElroy.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.400
I'm Travis McElroy.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.360
I'm Griffin McElroy.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.480
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:46.640

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.680
Since the dawn of time,

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.880
screenwriters have taken months to craft their stories,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.680
but now three Hollywood professionals

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.440
shall attempt the impossible.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.560
Break a story in one hour.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.120
That's right.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.120
Here on Story Break, I, Freddie Wong,

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:07.760
Matt Arnold,

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.640
and Will Campos,

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.480
the creators behind award-winning shows

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.520
like Video Game High School,

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.400
have one hour to turn a humble idea into an awesome movie.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.960
Now, an awesome movie starts with an awesome title.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.360
I chose The Billionaire's Marriage Valley.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.000
Mine was Christmas Pregnant Paradise.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.400
Okay, next we need a protagonist.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.520
So I've heard Wario best described as libertarian, Mark.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.520
And of course, every great movie needs a stellar pitch.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.560
In order to get to heaven,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.160
sometimes you gotta raise a little hell.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.840
Oh, that's the tagline!
