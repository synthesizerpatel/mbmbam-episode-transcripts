00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.800 --> 00:48.800
I never realized how much flossing looks like repeatedly stabbing yourself in the butt and

00:48.800 --> 00:58.160
crotch. Oh my god. Yeah, you're the one who chose to floss furiously. No one, I just said do a dance.

00:58.160 --> 01:06.320
You flossed so hard. I dislocated every bone in my body. Holy shit. You flossed really hard.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.240
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era.

01:10.240 --> 01:16.880
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.120
I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

01:23.120 --> 01:30.000
And what a thrill it is to be here in Cleveland.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.320
Oh you've heard of it. We are here and we are so grateful to those of you that bought tickets to

01:40.320 --> 01:47.600
make the long journey out. There's like 2,000 of you. This is our community theater production

01:47.600 --> 01:54.320
that just our dad's friends. Thanks for giving us a chance. This is this grassroots live show.

01:54.320 --> 02:00.640
We want you, but there's that and also our families are still at Great Wolf Lodge in Cincinnati so

02:02.560 --> 02:13.040
it's gonna get nasty tonight. We talked about it and we, this is gonna, we want it to be a vile

02:13.040 --> 02:20.160
show. What we want from this show is you know a lot of your friends maybe didn't want to come

02:20.160 --> 02:25.440
because they don't like us and they think we're like smelly or whatever or like terrible or not

02:25.440 --> 02:31.280
funny or whatever and um wait we want you to go back to them and and be like you missed.

02:32.080 --> 02:39.040
Well I won't say missed. It was vile. You made the right choice in not coming because it was

02:39.040 --> 02:45.200
it was profane. We've we've had to not publish a lot of live shows due to like technical sound

02:45.200 --> 02:50.720
issues. Or Star Wars issues. Or Star Wars issues. Star Wars centric issues. This one might just be

02:50.720 --> 02:56.000
too hot for TV. Yeah sure. And if this one goes up it'll be 10 minutes long. Not that they let us on

02:56.000 --> 03:01.440
TV anymore. No not anymore. I mean technically unless you had some way to connect your streaming

03:01.440 --> 03:06.080
device to a TV we weren't allowed on TV in the first place. That's fair that's fair but anyway

03:06.080 --> 03:13.200
we are here. We do advice. We're brothers. We're nasty. We're nasty. No we're not. We're nasty.

03:13.200 --> 03:20.240
We're three top tier nasty boys. We're nasty middle-aged men. Okay that's way worse. That's

03:20.240 --> 03:25.920
so much worse. So much worse. No listen we're three nasty middle-aged men that bring their dad

03:25.920 --> 03:31.280
with them everywhere. We're nasty. We're three dads who hang three nasty dads who hang out with

03:31.280 --> 03:37.120
their nasty dads. Who hang out with their nastier dad. With two musician nasty dads who opened for

03:37.120 --> 03:41.920
us. Listen we're just a big group of nasty dads traveling the country in a band. I thought that

03:41.920 --> 03:46.960
me breaking both my arms before the show started was a bad energy. This is making it actually way

03:46.960 --> 03:52.960
worse. I love this energy. Get comfortable here in the kingdom of the profane where we reign supreme.

03:52.960 --> 03:57.440
Y'all about to get slimed. It's gonna be. We're gonna say nasty words. All right let's fucking do

03:57.440 --> 04:04.880
the show. I'm tired of this. Traveling concepts. Confrontational ideas. Mature situations. Adult

04:04.880 --> 04:13.840
situations. Cartoon violence. Cartoon violence. Mild drug use. Anyway it's a strong language.

04:14.400 --> 04:19.520
It's an advice show. I decided to apply for a part-time job. One job that came up was for

04:19.520 --> 04:25.200
a paranormal investigation group. I jokingly sent an application and I received a phone call from

04:25.200 --> 04:31.840
the group because they want me on the team. Here lies the problem. I'm beyond terrified of the dark

04:31.840 --> 04:37.760
even though I'm an adult. Holy shit this question has now taken two turns. Yes. It is almost back

04:37.760 --> 04:46.400
where it started. I made up an excuse that I wasn't able to go to the interview and they stated that

04:46.400 --> 04:53.600
they still really want me on the team and I need to give them a call when I'm available to do the

04:53.600 --> 04:58.000
interview. How do I get out of this mess? I don't want to hurt anyone and I don't want to be haunted

04:58.000 --> 05:04.480
and that's from I ain't afraid of no ghost. Wait. Yes I am. Are you are you here? Are you here? Are

05:04.480 --> 05:10.080
you present? I'm sorry. All right thank you. Okay let me just. First off let me say I'm sorry about

05:10.080 --> 05:15.280
how dark it is out there. Are you cool? Yeah it's quite dark. Just look at us. It's bright up here.

05:15.280 --> 05:20.720
Imagine being us. I would also say two things. Thank you for. Thank you so much for writing

05:20.720 --> 05:26.800
questions but uh thing one you didn't jokingly submit a resume. It takes a lot of work. That

05:26.800 --> 05:31.600
takes a lot of work. You were like ha ha ha click like you typed out a thing and secondly how good

05:31.600 --> 05:35.920
is that resume and what do you have on it that these paranormal investigators like this is

05:35.920 --> 05:40.800
everything we've been looking for. I was an assistant assistant manager at Toys R Us before

05:40.800 --> 05:52.000
it shut down. I was a safety associate at Best Buy and also I'm an esper who can see. I would be

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
concerned about any job where the exchange is hey we want you come for interview. I'm not gonna

05:58.000 --> 06:08.160
fucking do that. No please. We really need people by which I mean bodies by which I mean vessels.

06:08.160 --> 06:16.160
Did I say vessels? Damn um have you thought okay here's what you do okay you go to the interview

06:16.160 --> 06:23.200
on pins and needles and you say okay here's the only thing I kind of focus on day ghosts okay

06:24.560 --> 06:29.760
and then if they're like what day ghosts then you say what you think ghosts only come out at night

06:29.760 --> 06:37.760
that's ridiculous and racist yeah I catch when the ghostbusters catch their nighttime ghosts

06:37.760 --> 06:42.320
and they bring them home and then those ghosts escape from captivity while they're on the road

06:42.320 --> 06:47.520
and have nowhere to haunt sun comes up what are they gonna do call a fucking uber no no they're

06:47.520 --> 06:53.600
still just ghosts are always there where do they go during the day thank you yes someone's saying

06:53.600 --> 07:01.280
yes this isn't a joke this is a this is my thesis yeah um I I think that there's a pretty easy

07:01.280 --> 07:06.880
solution is you go in you do the interview crush it of course you're already halfway you're in

07:06.880 --> 07:12.240
you're in once someone says we really need you they can't play hardball with you so you go you

07:12.240 --> 07:16.560
do the interview and as you're standing up and you're about to sign the huge novelty signing

07:16.560 --> 07:23.120
bonus they have for you a huge novelty check you say I just want one more thing I am a ghost

07:24.960 --> 07:31.040
and then see how they handle that because they can't prove you're not right can't prove a

07:31.040 --> 07:35.360
negative can't prove a negative can't prove you're not a ghost and they can't say like there's no

07:35.360 --> 07:42.880
such thing as ghost oh god damn it you are going to need to phase through the door instead of

07:42.880 --> 07:47.600
opening that will be and I have a wiki how article for you that's really going to help you out with

07:47.600 --> 07:53.760
that he was paid 17 to write it and it was worth every penny uh do you all want a yahoo from the

07:53.760 --> 08:02.320
yahoo answer service yeah uh I have one here that was sent in by uh Emma Kant thank you Emma

08:02.320 --> 08:07.760

08:21.680 --> 08:35.920
uh that's a no that's gonna be a no for me all right uh pilip asks how to surprise someone with

08:35.920 --> 08:41.440
a horse what's what's the best way to surprise someone with a horse and what's the best time

08:41.440 --> 08:49.760
to do it after dinner or early in the morning why are those the only two options yeah uh this

08:49.760 --> 08:54.800
doesn't seem relevant but btw we don't have a barn and aren't going to keep our horse at our house

08:56.720 --> 09:02.800
this is just sort of a woods a woods horse that comes back and it knows it's needed that is that

09:02.800 --> 09:07.440
is like if I surprised my child with a bike and said now I'm going to put this bike inconveniently

09:07.440 --> 09:13.040
away yeah this bike will actually be across town this one's going to be in the basement at church

09:14.160 --> 09:18.800
it is it's kind of like speed once you get the horse you can't stop with it anywhere you have

09:18.800 --> 09:23.680
nowhere to stop with a horse you have to keep moving okay it's like a chocobo it'll run away

09:23.680 --> 09:30.160
as soon as you get off of it so before breakfast or after dinner and no time in between do it yeah

09:30.160 --> 09:35.520

17:14.480 --> 17:20.640
you should stand your bliss this is beautiful now are you here no okay fine okay what about

17:20.640 --> 17:28.080
a poster of scarface that's now that's a bad a lot of people have that it's like a cool yeah

17:28.080 --> 17:32.000
it's like the world is yours and it says it on there and people come over like this is tommy

17:32.000 --> 17:41.360
montana i haven't seen the movie this is a this poster is a reminder for me to see the movie

17:41.360 --> 17:46.240
i wrote on the wall above it to do and then i put a colon and then i put the poster from

17:46.240 --> 17:50.800
scarface i didn't frame it or anything i just kind of duct taped it up there i'll just i know

17:50.800 --> 17:58.640
two things it's big gun and this dude loves confectioner's sugar i think yeah he eats piles

17:58.640 --> 18:04.560
of it um i say i say you put the anime posters up and then when your parents come in the room

18:04.560 --> 18:08.880
you're wearing like a really cool smoking jacket yeah maybe you have like a cool mustache and a

18:08.880 --> 18:14.880
pipe and you explain to them the artistic values and then if they're like that seems immature then

18:14.880 --> 18:20.000
you say you don't get it and then blow smoke directly right in their face it's time for you

18:20.000 --> 18:28.160
to elevate anime maybe a nice frame is so important and some down lighting oh yes some museum quality

18:28.160 --> 18:35.360
frame maybe like a station with a velvet rope museum quality framing is huge yes because that

18:35.360 --> 18:40.800
is art that elevates anime to art yeah and i think that that would be put a little stuff up here put

18:40.800 --> 18:46.240
a little plate next to it that says like you know printing on paper with the artist's name and maybe

18:46.240 --> 18:51.520
the piece title and the year that it came out and then just stand in front of it like can you two

18:51.520 --> 18:58.640
not name any anime other than dragon ball z yuri on ice that doesn't count

19:00.320 --> 19:05.600
i know you name any anime i've not joked about on a stage with you before gun gundam

19:08.000 --> 19:13.920
all right attack on titan okay paul was talking about that backstage also doesn't count wait hold

19:13.920 --> 19:23.840
on battle angel elita there's one where little kids are detective that's the adventure zone

19:25.600 --> 19:33.200
it doesn't count okay let me say this let me say this i'm all for this right but that's a lot of

19:33.200 --> 19:39.760
posters and you can put up too many posters you can do poster overkill but you can repurpose them

19:39.760 --> 19:44.240
i mean i was sometimes on queer either like i don't want to throw out my dad's old clothes

19:44.240 --> 19:48.480

bedroom like this fucking guy's still here justin marmaduke fuck that wasn't an option

24:11.680 --> 24:18.160
i think outside the box uh i decided to apply for a part-time job one job that came oh i got that one

24:18.160 --> 24:22.320
i work children's birthday parties take another pass i think we could one more again i work

24:22.320 --> 24:27.520
children's birthday parties at a local family fun center as it is known a big part of my job

24:27.520 --> 24:32.640
is doing magic tricks for the kids here's my issue i absolutely suck at doing magic tricks

24:32.640 --> 24:36.320
i've been doing working this job for almost two years and my boss thinks i'm great at it

24:36.320 --> 24:40.640
i managed to convince her i'm really good by pure luck even every time i do a party though

24:40.640 --> 24:44.960
the kids are unimpressed and often see right through my tricks they'll literally shout out

24:44.960 --> 24:49.760
how i'm doing the trick it's frustrating and embarrassing what do i do and that's from

24:49.760 --> 25:01.360
mediocre magician in cleveland are you are you here all right

25:01.360 --> 25:07.520
whoa a thousand doves just flew onto the stage whoa thank you they're all on fire oh shit i

25:07.520 --> 25:13.920
cannot think of anything more demoralizing than having an eight-year-old just yell out like

25:13.920 --> 25:22.720
the balls under your armpit dumb ass i mean okay maybe try theming it for something the kids like

25:23.440 --> 25:31.840
like fortnight just like i you put it instead of a bunny rabbit and just rename it their favorite

25:31.840 --> 25:38.800
fortnight stars are you literally reaching what's inside the hat and then it's your phone and you're

25:38.800 --> 25:44.960
like your favorite guys just streaming just watch this for 20 minutes i'm gonna sit in silence and

25:44.960 --> 25:54.000
smoke cigarettes while you kids enjoy this fortnight video um maybe work on your pattern

25:54.000 --> 25:58.400
yes i get less of a you know there are a lot of like uh comedian magicians out there whether

25:58.400 --> 26:02.320
the tricks are either like really basic or sometimes even really bad but then it's actually

26:02.320 --> 26:08.080
about like the comedy they do yeah you could do that and just like full on dunk on the birthday

26:08.080 --> 26:14.240

28:18.000 --> 28:27.280
than jokes um i mean i just want to know how they cheated yeah i mean uh i know how they did it

28:30.480 --> 28:39.840
the worst hey i got a yahoo okay perfect cool uh this one's from adrian cowles thank you adrian

28:39.840 --> 28:49.600
it's uh it's an anonymous yahoo answers user i'm gonna call uh adonis asks should scientists

28:50.560 --> 28:54.720
give octopi bones

29:03.520 --> 29:09.280
and a lot of other podcasts a lot of other podcasts would turn and just run away from

29:09.280 --> 29:22.160
a question like that five words each one so vitally essential should scientists give octopi

29:22.160 --> 29:28.960
bones i will say that the word that most troubles me in there and if i have to pick one is give

29:29.760 --> 29:34.880
because that makes it sound like you would hand the octopi bones and they would just absorb them

29:34.880 --> 29:42.480
in oh thank you finally someone gave us bones travis it's up to the scientists to figure out

29:42.480 --> 29:48.960
how to give the bones to the octopi i think the problem would be that's why they're scientists

29:49.920 --> 29:55.840
if if you did this i think that the it would be really hard for the octopus to walk

29:56.720 --> 30:02.720
because its legs would now just be locked in a straight position and it'd be like like a tripod

30:02.720 --> 30:09.680
it doesn't have to be one bone per leg travis your imagination has failed you make me so

30:09.680 --> 30:15.520
fucking mad sometimes i mean again with this shit even if it's every fucking show you give it like

30:15.520 --> 30:19.600
a like a human and it's two bones with knees two bones that's still gonna be hard to walk

30:20.640 --> 30:25.120
i think that it would be a lot of bones in each one how many eight

30:25.120 --> 30:34.240
eight so it would have seven knees no not every joints and knee you dullard so it would have

30:34.240 --> 30:39.600
knuckle oh wait now hold on are the legs the fingers there's 50 bones in one big skull and

30:39.600 --> 30:44.480
think about that last one for a second because that's the worst fucked up bone of all the last

30:44.480 --> 30:50.800
thing yeah what if they give him the skull no that's just attractive squidward never mind listen

30:50.800 --> 30:58.880
my fear is this we give the octopi bones we're loving it we we don't i don't know how to the

30:58.880 --> 31:04.640
scientists are gonna do this i just give them boats at first they're not crazy about it right

31:04.640 --> 31:08.400
they don't love it their pants don't fit they can't squish through little holes they can't

31:08.400 --> 31:12.720
squish through little holes oh no my door's only this big gig into my ding-dang house now they're

31:12.720 --> 31:19.600
mad at us but they do have bones oh no my fear is this you give an octopi bones and they'll

31:19.600 --> 31:24.800
want a glass of milk eventually they're gonna eventually they're gonna look up from the

31:24.800 --> 31:29.360
beautiful briny shimmery shiny sea yeah they're gonna look up on land and they're gonna say

31:29.360 --> 31:37.600
jerald i'm going up to take what's theirs that's the big mistake you make with octopi is you give

31:37.600 --> 31:42.320
them bones and they're gonna come on land and want our shit yeah that's what happened in finding

31:42.320 --> 31:48.560
dory and i know what you're saying they can't breathe well we gave them bones like lung bones

31:48.560 --> 31:53.920
like lung bones why why no why stop there let's give them gills and get them up here let's give

31:53.920 --> 31:59.440
them gills and then let's give them skin and then let's give them emotions and then let's give them

31:59.440 --> 32:06.160
a car alone let them have sex and then there'll be bicentennial octopus yes let's give them bones

32:06.160 --> 32:12.400
let's give them gills let's give them training and coding my bicentennial man joke didn't go very good

32:12.400 --> 32:21.920
nobody octotennial man no let me ask you that i think that this listen science has come a long

32:21.920 --> 32:28.880
way we know that we've maybe been to the moon you know don't do this we've done a lot of stuff

32:28.880 --> 32:35.440
where's the pelvis going an octopus they don't have to have all the bones they just have to wait

32:35.440 --> 32:40.560
where would you stop give them a spine you give them a skull you give them some legs you give

32:40.560 --> 32:47.440
them a pelvis maybe some ribs now they're a person now let me let me ask you this does the octopus

32:48.000 --> 32:55.040
wear pants with four legs or a or is it four legs and a shirt with four sleeves i would actually

32:55.040 --> 33:01.760
think uh two two sleeves two pants legs and then just when they lift their shirt up just four arms

33:01.760 --> 33:11.440
oh yeah nice fun at parties why would they wear clothes they're an octopus oh well because they've

33:11.440 --> 33:19.840
joined the fraternity of bones you've got to wear clothes if you got everybody at least that's my

33:19.840 --> 33:32.400
platform for 2020 if everybody else can run i can fucking run with if you got bones you need clothes

internet a while it's gonna take something pretty wild for me to qualify it as outrageously we used

35:23.520 --> 35:31.200
to we used to advertise for a sex toy company for many years so this is the the extreme no

37:03.280 --> 37:10.160

and family clearly but uh i don't know if i want to tell a 50 year old man that i play a card game

47:14.000 --> 47:21.200
for 13 and up uh sure most games are for 13 and up don't worry about that true true i don't know

47:21.200 --> 47:28.080
of a board game that says like for 50 years old and older uh not a board game but golf golf yeah

47:28.080 --> 47:33.360
yeah okay i'm pretty sure that you just came up so you love magic the gathering and you came up

47:33.360 --> 47:38.720
to drag golf is that what we're doing okay good oh 100 okay good good it might not be magic the

47:38.720 --> 47:43.040
gathering that's the only thing keeping you separate from 50 year olds they might also be

47:43.040 --> 47:50.320
your junkie okay um but my question is uh how do i uh make that sound cool

47:50.320 --> 48:00.080
oh my passion is cards oh do you play do you play cards i've been known to get down to vegas

48:00.080 --> 48:06.400
from time to time okay okay would you say that this is the end of our conversation yeah i would

48:06.400 --> 48:13.120
excellent this has gone very well here's a great option lie you could lie what are you into i love

48:13.120 --> 48:20.720
football i also love football excellent who's your team though the plane walkers is that a

48:21.600 --> 48:28.480
no here here's the thing real world real the thing is is like a lot of people have um hobbies that

48:28.480 --> 48:32.960
when they first started out like hundreds of years ago or whatever were all so weird and the key is

48:32.960 --> 48:37.520
now when you say it like i play magic the gathering don't explain it they don't if they said like i

48:37.520 --> 48:42.000
love to play golf they wouldn't sit there like but golf's fun it's cool you know like they wouldn't

48:42.000 --> 48:45.600
explain that's a dumb thing to say though because everybody knows that golf is yeah

48:46.880 --> 48:51.120
that would be ridiculous imagine that fucking thing you just said with your own mouth here on

48:51.120 --> 48:57.520
stage like i play golf it's um have you ever seen a very small white ball yeah but that's what i'm

48:57.520 --> 49:01.280
saying if you say like i played a magic the gathering for fun and they're like what's that

49:01.280 --> 49:07.200
i'm like oh you don't know um and then with that tiny phrase oh you don't know you've just gained

49:07.200 --> 49:13.280
dominance in this situation oh yeah oh you don't know okay uh and then you explain it to them well

49:13.280 --> 49:16.880
i got a starter deck for you to borrow let's just uh let's just throw down right now and see now you

49:16.880 --> 49:22.800
got them whoa and then if they beat you they're a natural and you take them on tour and you milk

49:22.800 --> 49:30.480
them for everything that's your bobby fisher right there yeah uh you could say oh well uh i play yugioh

49:30.480 --> 49:34.160
and they're like what you're like just kidding i play magic and they're like oh thank god

49:34.160 --> 49:42.880
i thought we had a nerd on our hands shit whoo scared me um could you and then you play your

49:42.880 --> 49:47.520
trap card and then dragon eats him or something can you travel around with a starter deck and say

49:47.520 --> 49:52.880
i play magic the gathering and now so do you and hand them the deck and and see and say like if

49:52.880 --> 49:57.280
you really care about getting to know but you'll learn to play this card game and anyways i don't

49:57.280 --> 50:01.280
know what you do but do you want to buy a car or whatever i don't know who your job is do you

50:01.280 --> 50:06.640
do you have any expensive cards any of those fancy ones i have a few nothing like in the

50:06.640 --> 50:12.320
thousand dollar range or anything like that get some of those step one step one is you need to

50:12.320 --> 50:19.040
get a lot of those until you're very wealthy with card money i guess and then you just show

50:19.040 --> 50:23.280
you play magic the gathering oh that's uh that's the nerd shit right you're like i guess you tell

50:23.280 --> 50:28.320

54:57.440 --> 55:05.360
well there's a little bit of my husband loves tourist traps uh and i am a vegetarian so

55:05.360 --> 55:12.320
so we how do you make it work yeah it's a real darman greg situation they're related

55:12.320 --> 55:20.880
strangely okay um so we honeymooned in gatlinburg tennessee yeah you are a lot of beef jerky stores

55:20.880 --> 55:26.480
okay and my husband airsoft airsoft airsoft guns beef jerky stores that fudge and laser tag

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
yeah it's lit down there we went into no less than three beef jerky stores and my husband is

55:34.000 --> 55:41.200
is incapable of not telling the employees that i'm a vegetarian okay unprompted yeah

55:42.000 --> 55:46.880
have we not gotten vegetarian jerky yet it seems like we would have gotten there yeah it's called

55:46.880 --> 55:52.320
kale chips portobello mushrooms that's not bad they do not sell it at the beef jerky stores at

55:52.320 --> 55:59.040
gatlinburg tennessee okay they do sell shirts that say uh people eating tasty animals okay pita i

55:59.040 --> 56:09.200
love that that's fucking funny i get it yeah so uh inevitably the uh employees will then like

56:09.200 --> 56:15.120
unload on me so i've had to stop going into beef jerky stores with him because he goes into this

56:15.120 --> 56:21.680
fugue state right he can't help himself like half and i've asked him like why did you nobody

56:21.680 --> 56:26.880
nobody asked like nobody even offered me jerky and he was like i don't know when you say unload

56:26.880 --> 56:31.920
do you mean like they give you shit lots of shit wow i don't understand like you don't you don't

56:33.680 --> 56:43.120
you don't like my dry animal what it's trying oh but you this un-chewable beef you don't like

56:43.120 --> 56:50.320
my hard crispy tooth-breaking beef but you you can eat jerky right except jerky though right

56:50.320 --> 57:00.720

you want the better question that we can have more fun with yeah cover your ears cover i'm

57:21.680 --> 57:26.400
watching you cover your ears cover them for real the real question is how do you get back

57:28.000 --> 57:35.040
and the answer is you take him to whole foods and you're like this one has tasted the flesh of the cow

57:36.720 --> 57:41.200
and then someone's gonna fucking kill him

57:41.200 --> 57:47.520
so you're gonna have to find a new path for yourself yeah now listen it's gonna get real

57:47.520 --> 57:52.000
messy after that you're gonna have to change your name probably move get a new job part of

57:52.000 --> 57:56.240
your journey though respect the journey you got it it's part of your journey and your new identity

57:56.240 --> 58:02.480
might eat meat yeah and it's gonna be a cover yeah they'll never suspect if you're gonna start

58:02.480 --> 58:09.360
don't start with jerky holy shit no it makes a bad first meat impression some meat is wet

58:42.720 --> 58:46.160
and now they keep jumping on it and they keep staring at me when they jump

58:54.480 --> 58:59.280
yeah yeah and it looks like michael meyers isn't the george lopez theme song okay

59:00.960 --> 59:03.360
it's a beautiful mental image you've painted for me steven

59:03.360 --> 59:10.880
um are you asking us to help you sell your house how do i feel peace of mind in my own home um

59:11.440 --> 59:16.000
see i want to i want to take it it wasn't seaman yes okay um i want to take you back to the first

59:16.000 --> 59:22.080
thing she said which was some kids moved in next door which is amazing this idea that a bunch of

59:22.080 --> 59:27.360
blank checks we got a camp nowhere situation we got a real camp nowhere situation a bunch of kids

59:27.360 --> 59:33.840
just moved in and bought a house together i also really like when you said that you had

59:33.840 --> 59:37.680
a fence you couldn't see through for your dog which i imagine your dog just is really private

59:38.240 --> 59:43.840
like this space it's uh it's the taco bell dog we don't want paparazzi

59:44.960 --> 59:48.640
um could you next time they go out to trampoline you're already on their trampoline

59:48.640 --> 59:57.520
yeah wait wait your turn idiots i'm having fun up here this is how adults do it and you're smoking

59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.200
you'll never see that coming and you always put it out on the trampoline

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.760
and maybe lower your backyard so no matter how high they get they still can't cavernous cavernous

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:18.000
very good raise your fences build an extension on the trampoline side just right in front of

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.040
the trampoline goes up another eight feet nothing maybe seal their trampoline and burn it no come

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:34.960
on it's not even a joke can you somehow and i'm i'm not a scientist i'll be i'd be putting bones

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:40.640
and fish and stuff but if i was a scientist i could tell you some way to weaken the springs

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.160
just to affect the height not enough to hurt the kids not enough to hurt the kids lawyers when they

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:53.840
jump on it it just goes lower and then doesn't raise back up that's a net so you're talking about

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.680
a huge round hammock kids would love that they'll appreciate it when they're in their 30s and they

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.400
need a license to chill that's true they'll appreciate that giant round hammock that steven

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.760
made for them steven i have one very good piece of advice but it depends on if you have one

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.000
particular item and it may be uncomfortable uncomfortable for you to tell me whether or

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.640
not you own this item is that okay okay do you own a baba duke costume

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:33.200
not yet not yet not yet ebay's open late ebay's open late kids hate this guy okay yeah i think

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.760
the problem there is if i jumped and i saw my neighbor like my neighbor was baba dude i'd want

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:43.680
to like i gotta double check this maybe try they jump over they see yours in your backyard doing

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:50.400
your taxes really frustrated and they're like oh they go down below the fence and they come back

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.280
up your baba dude they come back down they come back up you're doing your taxes oh yeah i like

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.800
that yeah it's like muscle confusion but for kids it's just kid confusion it's regular kid confusion

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.600
