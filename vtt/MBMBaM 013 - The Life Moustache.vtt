00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:09.000 --> 00:19.000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me, episode 13. We've arrived.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
This is an advice show for the modern era, and I'm Justin McElroy. I'm one of the Tequila Brothers.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm the other Boobular Brother.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm not gonna stoop to that level.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
But I will, I think we need to apologize again.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Again?

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
We made a decree, I think it was ep 8, which was like two eps ago, saying we'd never miss another show.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
And we didn't miss it, it's just a little bit late.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I would say I missed it.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I missed it.

01:04.000 --> 01:13.000
But I think because of that decree, the nice feelings that people projected last time we missed the episode of Sorrow and...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
It turned, right?

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, it turned, and people went absolutely bonkershits, and I didn't know how to handle that energy.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
They tore the internet apart.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
They fucking raged inside the internet, and they raged against it.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
They flipped the script.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
I would say that they hurt my feelings, except I knew that we had it coming.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And you don't have feelings.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
And I don't have feelings anymore, so I'm so sorry this time.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Even though it was entirely Justin's fault.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, big refund coming your way.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm in West Virginia for a week.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
Is there anything I should do whilst in Huntington besides listening to Clint McElroy on WTCR Mornings?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Travamanman from Twitter.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
You're already doing the most important thing.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
All your news, information, sports, weather, everything you need is right there.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Tear.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Comedy.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Comedy.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Tear off the knob.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Tear off the knob.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Don't touch that dial.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
It's got jam on it.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
If by the time you leave Huntington, you don't know what the words Ducky Crabtree mean, then you haven't done your job, my friend.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Failed.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
You failed.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
I feel like we need...

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
You don't fuck them.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
We haven't had Ducky do a guest spot yet, and I think that a Ducky Crabtree guest spot on My Brother, My Brother and Me is...

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Oh my god.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Have you guys ever tried Googling Ducky?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I wonder if Ducky comes up.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh my god.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Now I need to check.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Go on about your business.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm going to look.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
As far as other things to do, soak in the sights.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Go for a walk on Marshall University's campus.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
Dear Clint McElroy, why the hell doesn't Ducky Crabtree have a Facebook page?

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Facebook page for Ducky Crabtree or I quit the internet forever because there's no point.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Go to Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
You could hunt down Justin.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Well, don't do that.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
You could hunt down Justin like he's wild game.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Well, don't do that.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm going to vote against that one.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Are we voting?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't think that one's very good.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Or you could stay there for 22 years and then leave.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Just kick it.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Let me give you an alcoholics perspective.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
$2 pitchers at the Union on Monday, karaoke on Tuesday at Sharkey's, $5 all you can drink

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
at Fat Patty's on Wednesday.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
No, it's V Club.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
You're thinking of the V Club.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
It's Wednesday all you can drink.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
No.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
No, it's $5 all you can drink at Fat Patty's too.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
Thursday is Thirsty Thursdays at the Thirsty Whale and then you have Friday, Saturday,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Sunday, wherever you want to go.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
You just recuperate.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Think about the bad decisions you've made.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
The terrible decisions and how you need to get out of Huntington or you're just going

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
to drink yourself to death because it's so fresh.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
It is.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
There's a good drinking scene in Huntington.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Yahoo Answers user Timothy asks, and this question was sent in by TJ Madd, loyal listener

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
to the show.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Thank you, TJ.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
What does it mean when kids or Japanese people come and stand next to you?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Are they trying to be friendly?

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
I was at the supermarket looking at herbs and a boy came and stood next to me.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
I was at the sports field taking pictures and a Japanese guy in baseball gear came over

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
and stood near to me and I started taking pictures too.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm a guy too.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm Chinese but look Korean slash Japanese.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Do you have a similar experience?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
What do you think?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
You know what?

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm glad someone finally had the balls, the shi-hutsu to bring this up because I've had

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
this theory for years that the kids and the Asians are working together to fuck with us.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
No, it's not that.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
It's all about omens and portents.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
On this, our thirteenth episode, we're talking about omens and we're talking about portents

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
and if a kid comes and stands next to you, that is a bad omen.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Is he on your left or is he on your right?

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Either side, regardless of which direction he's adjacent to you.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, I think if he's on your left, it's bad news for you and if he's on your right, it's

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
bad news for a loved one, I believe, if I'm remembering this correctly.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
There's also a daylight savings time component.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh, fuck yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
But if a Japanese person comes and stands next to you.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh boy.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh man.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Get ready.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Get ready for good stuff because here it comes.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
It's coming on down.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
What's that tumbling down the mountain?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I think it's a nugget of fortune headed your way.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
The problem is you can't try and stand next to a Japanese person to try and emulate that

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
good fortune because they'll run away.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
There's fry.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
And if they run away, that's six more weeks of winter.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yep.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Omens and portents.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
This is a bad omen.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
This is from FormSpring.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
My best friend's ex-GF constantly hangs out with her friend and group, having isolated

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
all her friends when they were dating.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
This is a problem because even when they were dating, we barely tolerated her often selfish

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
and childish behavior.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Please help.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Ah, she's a zilch.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Just tell her to go away.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Get out of here.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
No thanks.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Hit the road, sister.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
Next time she walks in the room, just speak in this kind of tone and saying things like,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
mm-mm.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
No thanks.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I don't think so.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Actually, I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, gross.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Too bad.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
That's grody.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Let's don't say we did.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
So, bring up all mid-90s phrases.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
P-A-R-T-Y, because I gotta.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Mask?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, okay.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
That's just the mask.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Shoot.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Shoot.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh, shit.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Reganomics.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
What?

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
If that doesn't work, you could always dump a bucket of pig's blood on her.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
No harm could come from that.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
She'll get the message.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Dude's sweet, I think.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
No, talk to her ex that is a staple of your group, because it's his problem.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
It's on him.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
He brought this fucking albatross into your group, and now it's his job to dispatch her.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Next time, just be like, it's on you, Ricky.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
It's on you.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
It's on you, Ricky.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Next time, she comes in and then walk out the room.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
And then you get the bonus of every time she keeps coming in the room, you get to give

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
him that look.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
You get to look at her across the room and be like, you son of a bitch.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
This is your doing, Rick.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
We talked about this, Ricky.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Richard.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Richard.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Richard.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Kyle on Gmail asks, hey guys, is talking to yourself weird?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Context.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
All about context.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
It's not.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Context is so important.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
You know what?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
If you're giving yourself a badass pump up speech in the mirror, I do that from time

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
to time.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
You know what?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I decided it was weird because I talk to myself all the time.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Talking to yourself about stopping talking to yourself is weird.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I'll start to say out loud, what am I doing?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I need to stop.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
I look crazy and I use my hands a lot.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
But when you get out of the shower and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
just grit your teeth and you give yourself a let's fuck some shit up cowboy, then that's

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
not weird.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
That's not weird at all.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
That's natural.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I talk to myself all the time.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
I say things like you're going to have a great day today.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Send that positive energy my way.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
You can definitely do this ten thousandth push up.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And I say things like, oh, God, oh, God, he's turning blue.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
You have to stop.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
You have to stop.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Oh, God.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, God.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh, God.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
You have to stop.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
You have to stop.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Why aren't you stopping?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
You made me sick.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
You made me sick.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
You made me sick.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I wish you were dead instead of him.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh, God.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, God.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Is he dead?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
You have to run.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.440
You have to find someplace to hide and bury the body.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.640
And I don't think that's weird.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.700
It's just it helps you sort your thoughts out, you know.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.120
So there's this girl I like.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.120
I don't.

09:22.120 --> 09:26.680
But I'm pretty sure a friend of mine likes her, too.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.600
She works in the same office as him, so it's likely he's made more progress and just generally

09:30.600 --> 09:32.280
has more access to her.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
He's a good guy.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.280
So I'm conflicted.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.000
Should I continue the pursuit or back down?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Shane.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.280
This is great because this isn't one of those too late questions where it's like my friend

09:42.280 --> 09:44.280
is engaged to this girl.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
How can I get her?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Yeah.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.280
It's this is open, open season kind of question.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.280
Sure.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.680
Well, that's kind of completely less offensive kind of way.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
I don't know.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.720
He's already taken it that direction with this made more progress.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.720
Yeah.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.720
What is it?

09:59.720 --> 10:02.320
Is he got to the eighth level of sleeping with her?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.880
Like, what are you talking about?

10:03.880 --> 10:06.000
He won the first 10 points.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.120
I got two in there somewhere.

10:09.120 --> 10:14.240
My question is, how much do you really like this girl if you're not seeing her any at

10:14.240 --> 10:15.240
all?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.320
Like if your friend's making all this progress because he works with her and sees her all

10:18.320 --> 10:22.880
the time, what kind of interaction do you actually have with this girl?

10:22.880 --> 10:24.880
How do you know her?

10:24.880 --> 10:27.440
I think it breaks down to who saw her first.

10:27.440 --> 10:32.200
Yeah, that's what it is, which the thing I don't think it's you, Shane, because he works

10:32.200 --> 10:33.200
with her.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.720
The key thing to keep in mind is just don't consider her feelings.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
Yeah.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.720
Sure.

10:38.720 --> 10:43.480
That's the most important thing, because if you ask her what she wants, then, oh, I don't

10:43.480 --> 10:44.480
know.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.480
No.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.480
The decision's not up to her.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.280
But if it were, she would go with your friend.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.040
Guys, I respectfully disagree.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.600
I think Shane, step one, go to where she works.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.360
Step two, barge into the office no matter who tries to stop you.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.880
Step three, stand over her cubicle yelling, which one do you choose?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.840
You can only have one, you trollop.

11:06.840 --> 11:07.840
Pick one.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.360
Stop dragging my heart around.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.160
I think that's the solution right there.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.120
Or you form a bro pact with your buddy and say, you know what?

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
We both dig her.

11:19.120 --> 11:25.400
I think to preserve our friendship, neither one can have her, and then two weeks later,

11:25.400 --> 11:28.640
you flip it.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.360
You're not really good friends with him anyways.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.080
Don't even worry about it.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.480
Or you say, I'll date her Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

11:36.480 --> 11:41.920
You can date her Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and then Sundays will trade off.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.160
This is all sounding really good, guys.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.320
I think, you know what?

11:46.320 --> 11:49.160
I was worried we wouldn't be able to come up with a really good answer on this one,

11:49.160 --> 11:54.760
but I feel like we've- Or cut her in half.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
Cut her in half.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.880
Whichever one of you stops doesn't really love her.

11:59.880 --> 12:05.000
You know, obviously, which have to take the bottom.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.800
I thought you meant cut her in half lengthwise.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
Oh no.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.800
Oh no, she'll die from that.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.800
Yeah.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.840
You'll have to put her together like one of those whistle suckers that doesn't work unless

12:16.840 --> 12:17.840
you have...

12:17.840 --> 12:20.880
Remember those whistle gummies that people used to have?

12:20.880 --> 12:24.720
You stick two gummies together, you turn into a whistle, she'd be like that.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.720
I gotcha.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.400
I might've dreamed them.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.140
I think you may have dreamed them.

12:30.140 --> 12:34.720
This one comes from Yahoo Answers user Kibby MIA, who asks-

12:34.720 --> 12:36.520
What happened to Kibby?

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
He's MIA.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
I don't know.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.520
I haven't seen him in a while.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.520
Did he go AWOL?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.520
No.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.520
No.

12:42.520 --> 12:43.520
VTOL?

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
No.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.520
Those aren't...

12:45.520 --> 12:46.520
He's MIA.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.520
Guys, I just got the news.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.520
He's Kibby POW.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.520
Oh no.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.520
Yeah.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
No.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.520
We're going to get you, Kibby.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.520
Stay strong.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.160
Tristan's going to come, he's going to bust up Osama's-

12:56.160 --> 12:58.080
Tristan's coming, Kibbs.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.080
Just hang on.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.360
Hang on to hope.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.200
This is a topical sports question, which we'll know a lot about.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.200
Who better?

13:04.200 --> 13:08.200
LeBron with no legs or Kobe with no legs?

13:08.200 --> 13:12.040
This is how much I know about sports is the thought I just had was, okay, so they both

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
have legs.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.040
I do know they...

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
I've settled that.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.780
Now, I know they both have legs.

13:16.780 --> 13:20.800
They both have two big, strong legs each.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.800
Sinui.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.760
Big, sinui, beautiful trunks.

13:23.760 --> 13:30.120
You know, you said, you said, who better, beautifully phrased, and I, you know, I first

13:30.120 --> 13:35.200
thought who would be better in a sporting event, but maybe he's asking who would learn

13:35.200 --> 13:37.120
the most and become a better person.

13:37.120 --> 13:43.560
Okay, so let's cut it in, let's split this question in half like we would with-

13:43.560 --> 13:44.560
Shane's girlfriend.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
Shane's girlfriend.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
Okay.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.360
So, who would be better at sports?

13:49.360 --> 13:50.840
Me.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
Okay.

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
Really?

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
Is this between us?

13:53.840 --> 13:58.840
You think if you went Chicago 21 against LeBron and Kobe, neither of which had legs.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.840
Let me tell you-

13:59.840 --> 14:04.360
Would they, like, Cripple Masters join up and one would be the arms and one would be

14:04.360 --> 14:06.720
the legs?

14:06.720 --> 14:10.320
And their torsos would fuse and they'd be like a push me, pull you, but they'd be really

14:10.320 --> 14:11.320
good at basketball.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.320
Yeah.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.320
And-

14:13.320 --> 14:14.320
I love this.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.320
I love it too.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.320
And really good at defending reporters.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.800
Oh, but they play for two different teams now, don't they?

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
Yeah.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
That would get tricky.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.800
So, okay, Kobe Bryant, 31 years old.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
Okay.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.360
Are you looking up some stats?

14:28.360 --> 14:29.360
Yeah.

14:29.360 --> 14:35.800
Kobe Bryant, 31 years old, and according to this card that I cut off the back of his action

14:35.800 --> 14:39.000
figure, he's got a power rating of eight.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Okay.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Okay.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
That's a lot of fucking power, dude.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
On a scale of-

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
It's a lot.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
It's a big-

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Scale of 10?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Okay.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.280
Kobe Bryant's stats are a nine and his tech skills-

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
Jesus.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
His tech skills are a seven.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.280
Wow.

14:55.280 --> 14:56.560
This guy's a fucking super genius.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.560
Yeah.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.560
He's a super genius.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.560
Holy hell.

14:59.560 --> 15:00.560
He's a super genius, super slam dunk artist.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.560
What's he doing balling?

15:01.560 --> 15:04.160
He should be up in NASA taking us to the moon and shit.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.960
He balls at night and invents during the day.

15:06.960 --> 15:07.960
Oh my God.

15:07.960 --> 15:12.520
LeBron James, age 25, power rating nine.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.520
Ooh.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.520
Oh.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.520
Yeah.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.520
Smart.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.520
Kick it up.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.520
Seven.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
Seven.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
Holy shit.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
Holy shit.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.520
Yeah.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.520
LeBron James is really good with tech.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.520
Do you guys remember when time travel was invented in the year 2010 by the king, by the

15:28.520 --> 15:32.360
basketball king, the king of all basketball?

15:32.360 --> 15:33.360
We have to get back.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.360
How?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.360
There's only one way.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.800
We have to subvert the laws of the LeBron continuum.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.800
Fuck.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.800
Fuck, LeBron.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.800
You missed that really important three pointer and now the Miami Heat lost their basketball

15:44.800 --> 15:45.800
game.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
Not so fast.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.320
Pew, pew, pew.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.480
Only time travels back and makes the shot.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.480
Yeah.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
That's what that sound was.

15:52.480 --> 15:56.800
He goes back and he meets George Washington and a clown and he helps him decide where

15:56.800 --> 15:58.320
to put the state capital.

15:58.320 --> 16:02.280
LeBron James in the time belt.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.320
So I guess, I guess that answers that.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.320
LeBron James.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.320
LeBron James.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.100
Who would be a better person?

16:10.100 --> 16:11.360
We talked about sports side.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.560
Who would be a better person?

16:12.560 --> 16:13.560
It depends.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.680
If you live in Cleveland, it's Kobe.

16:15.680 --> 16:20.440
If you live outside of Cleveland, it's LeBron because Kobe didn't, didn't know, but here's

16:20.440 --> 16:21.440
the difference.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.240
I think Kobe has the most to learn.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.240
Kobe's got a lot.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.240
What?

16:26.240 --> 16:27.240
Why?

16:27.240 --> 16:28.240
Well, he's kind of a dick.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.240
Because his tech skills are.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.400
No, you're, you've flipped them.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
You flipped them.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
LeBron's kind of a dick.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.120
No, LeBron's a dick to people in Cleveland, but people in Miami think he's great.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.120
Yeah.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.200
They think he's the best.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.680
Did you move down to Miami, Travis?

16:39.680 --> 16:40.880
Did you get down there?

16:40.880 --> 16:44.440
I am, I am noncommittal to any geographic location.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.440
Yeah.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
Okay.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.440
So you're a world president.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.440
Except for Norman, Oklahoma.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.440
Represent.

16:49.440 --> 16:54.280
Um, so I guess that answer, yeah, I think we've pretty well addressed that one.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.720
Driven it right into the ground.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.720
BC Potter.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.720
Maybe that's what happened.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
Maybe they didn't lose their legs.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.720
They've been driven into the ground.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
Who put this cement here?

17:00.720 --> 17:01.720
A whole Larry Bird.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.720
Larry Bird from Bugs Bunny.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.720
Just getting into shenanigans.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.720
Space Jam 2.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.720
We took LeBron.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.720
Kobe.

17:06.720 --> 17:07.720
Kobe.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.720
Kobe.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.720
Kobe.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.720
Kobe.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.720
Kobe.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
Kobe.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
Kobe.

17:13.720 --> 17:14.720
Kobe.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.720
Kobe.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
Kobe.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
I hate Kobe's legs.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.200
Get on Taffy's shoulders, stupid.

17:20.200 --> 17:25.620
Bc Potter from Twitter writes, my woman wants me to shave the old berry patch.

17:25.620 --> 17:29.040
Any suggestions to get the job done as clean as possible.

17:29.040 --> 17:33.680
What's going on in her scene, that she wants you to be clean shaving down there?

17:33.680 --> 17:36.900
Cause you think you're going to do it once, you're setting yourself up for a hobby.

23:16.760 --> 23:22.880
way to be creepy about it now I'm just kissing my dad on his sweet bristly lips

23:22.880 --> 23:30.880
look at me what's up with that stainless double that I'm by your Gillette fusion

I think it's the creepiest thing I've ever heard oh there it is I'm just gonna

23:36.560 --> 23:39.960
be straight up I'm usually pretty accepting of abnormal behavior but fuck

23:39.960 --> 23:44.080
that that is weird I don't think you know though until you do it I think

23:44.080 --> 23:48.080
everyone after they're done listening to this episode needs to go find their

23:48.080 --> 23:52.960
pep-pep and plant one on him right on his sweet lips I've been looking for a

23:52.960 --> 23:57.800
good sign-off for the show for so long and I think kiss your dad square on the

23:57.800 --> 24:03.440
lips is probably square on his sweet plump lips kiss dad god I'm so disgusted

24:03.440 --> 24:07.320
right now you're like drenching in your throat yes I hate both of you I'm

24:07.320 --> 24:11.040
muting my microphone as we speak so I can bomb it in the corner

24:11.040 --> 24:16.160
here daddy come here pep-pep here it comes is it worth it to pick up a penny

24:16.160 --> 24:19.800
that is considering the amount of energy expended in the cost of food required to

24:19.800 --> 24:24.560
pick up said to provide said energy can a penny be considered profit Ryan gmail

24:24.560 --> 24:30.980
no no what no you know what I do when people give me pennies no joke I throw

24:30.980 --> 24:35.280
them in the garbage that's where pennies go in the garbage do you know why

24:35.280 --> 24:39.360
because that's a penny receptacle because pennies are in garbage pennies

24:39.360 --> 24:44.880
are garbage they're worth more the metal in them is worth more than the value

24:44.880 --> 24:48.080
that we've artificially passionate they're awful they're the worst coins

24:48.080 --> 24:55.560
they're only they're politicians from from zinc states can can keep jobs and

24:55.560 --> 24:59.560
in their home hometowns imagine this you're cleaning your room and it's been

24:59.560 --> 25:04.380
a while and you move a chair and there's a glint in the carpet and you say oh my

25:04.380 --> 25:09.960
goodness a coin but then it's a penny is it worth it no because I like this

25:09.960 --> 25:12.840
feeling in the world I just throw that across the room and say I'll find that

25:12.840 --> 25:18.600
again later I like to call pennies hobo pranks because hobos asked for change

25:18.600 --> 25:22.920
I'm like sure here it comes here comes a big fistful of pennies gotcha better

25:22.920 --> 25:27.480
luck next time they like wear cargo pants with like 18 pockets and just

25:27.480 --> 25:30.920
fill them with pennies and then wait for someone to ask you for change and then

25:30.920 --> 25:34.520
just start dumping out your pockets oh man that's gonna be a real good prank

25:34.520 --> 25:37.880
it's gonna be a real good goof and it's gonna be worth it to have all those

25:37.880 --> 25:44.960
stinky heavy-ass pennies in your pants what smells worse side side topic what

25:44.960 --> 25:50.640
smells worse than a receptacle that has held coins something that has held coins

25:50.640 --> 25:55.040
previously and then you get your you get your your snog in there get your sniffer

25:55.040 --> 26:00.800
yeah that's a well that's on the other hand what smells better than a

26:00.800 --> 26:05.760
receptacle that has contained a large sum of paper money yeah oh yeah that's

26:05.760 --> 26:12.560
that's sweet right that coin stuff smells like you made a robot out of dookie

26:22.560 --> 26:26.640
I'm gonna go one step further and say fuck nickels and dimes too and quarters

26:26.640 --> 26:31.640
quarters are where it's at and that's that's the only thing let's see it when

26:31.640 --> 26:34.560
was the last time like nobody's ever bought anything with a penny but when

26:34.560 --> 26:37.640
was the last time you actually bought something with a nickel or a dime never

26:37.640 --> 26:40.560
yeah I put them in the parking meter yeah you put them in the parking most

26:40.560 --> 26:43.320
parking meters though they don't even take those anymore they only take

26:43.320 --> 26:49.080
quarters I actually I only believe in using Sacagawea coins you want to try

26:49.080 --> 26:53.160
that again for all our Native American listeners who are so angry right now

26:53.160 --> 26:59.200
Sacagawea but you'll get it I call them I call them

26:59.200 --> 27:10.760
savage sense see I think it might be a think it might be offensive check our

27:10.760 --> 27:15.600
lips and stats and see if we have any listeners on reservations because if so

27:15.600 --> 27:20.400
I will I will delete that around the outside of the coin it says in many gods

27:20.400 --> 27:40.840

30:11.400 --> 30:15.960
value to you don't feel like you have to to pay us back for all the times that
