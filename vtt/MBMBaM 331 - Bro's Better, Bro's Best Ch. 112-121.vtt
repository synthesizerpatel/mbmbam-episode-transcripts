00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

00:18.000 --> 00:45.000
What's up, you cool baby?

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Well folks, welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Crickets. That's right, Griffin is not here. He had a baby, and he's doing the dad thing, as they say.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, as everybody says, you know, that old saying, doing the dad thing.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You know the old saying, doing the dad thing?

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
So what we have for you instead is a bountiful selection of delicious, best-of, greatest hits.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
We're sorry to do another one of these so close to the last one, but them's babies, okay?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Them's the babies.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Them's the babies, folks.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
We should also say, I guess, Griffin and Rachel are both doing great. Their baby, Henry, is doing good.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
Everybody's doing well, so you know, everything's going pretty smoothly for them.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Henry is absolutely beautiful with big, wise eyes.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Wise baby.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
That baby's got an old soul, I can already tell.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Maybe too old. Maybe an ancient one. Who knows?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It could be an ancient dark soul. It's impossible to say.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Who knows?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Who knows? Anyway, here come the hits.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
These are the hits, folks. Drink it in.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Kate Stull. Thank you, Kate.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Humphrey, who asks,

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Will I ever need to wear my cap and gown again? I just graduated this year. What to do with the robe and cap?

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
I was wondering if I would ever have an occasion to wear it again, so that I should spend $35 on dry cleaning.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
It's not cheap to dry clean the stupid robe.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
My college regalia colors are different from my high school regalia colors, and I doubt that I could wear it to my college graduation ceremony.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
I was wondering if any of the following events would require a cap and gown or even permit me to wear one.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
And what would I wear to these different events? I will probably be attending this coming year. Am I clueless?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
And then there's some...

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Alright, list the events. We'll vote.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Thesis, presentation, and defense.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I do not know what that is.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
It sounds like a power play, though, to wear a cap and gown.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
A formal academic award ceremony.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Just the cap.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
And nothing else?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Nothing else.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Now that's a brave look. Tell me about that.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
What it says is that I graduated from the University of Fuckin'.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
What about just robe?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I got my magna cum laude.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
What about just robe?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Cinched.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, rolled up sleeves to the shoulder.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
So you're showing the guns.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I like to see some black jeans underneath a robe.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
That's a really cool look.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Him it up. Him it up. Cinch it with a belt. Him it. Black jeans.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
No shirt. No shirt.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You got a tunic, basically, or a blouse.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And have it open to the navel.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Fraternity party.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
It depends on the theme, right?

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
But if you do it, you have to wear it to every fraternity party so people start to know you as the robester.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, that's nice. Robespierre.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Robespierre is here.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Could you be Professor Beer Hands?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Your hands would need to be made of beer.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Have you guys ever heard of Edward Forty Hands?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Yes, I've heard of Edward Forty Hands.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Please, Professor Beer Hands is my father. Call me Edward.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
I feel like Professor Beer Hands was invented right after I got out of college,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
which is a shame because it seems like the kind of problem-solving I could really get into.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I have to tell you, it sounds like hipster legend.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
I don't believe anybody actually does Edward Forty Hands.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Can you imagine doing Edward Forty Hands and then you get a phone call?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Or there's a knock on the door.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Or how about you've just consumed 80 ounces of liquid

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
and you need to pass it through your body via penis or vagina?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
What's the next step there? Tell me where that terminates.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
You just start smacking at your zipper, I assume.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
And hope that luck comes into play.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
If I find I'm going to be in an uncomfortable scenario,

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
sometimes one of the tricks I do is I try to learn more about the scenario than anybody there.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
So I can try to make myself the most...

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Get super deep into etiquette for male strippers.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
What is off-limits, what is good, what is not?

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
No, no, no. Okay, Susan, you'd have a dollar for each ball.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
It's a dollar per ball, Susan.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
You looked right into his spread, but you can't...

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Instead of move the male strippers to...

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
He parted them for you, you know that.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
He parted them, it's five dollars.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I know what you're going to love.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
There's a part of the show where he spreads his butt cheeks and stands motionless for 15 minutes.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
And you throw Skittles. It's like a carnival game.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
You're not actually supposed to look for more than 20 seconds at a time.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Or else it loses its specialness.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Actually, no one's supposed to look. If you look, he leaves.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
He scampers off.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh, you spooked him, Sheila.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
He starts any time someone looks inside his spread bow.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
He starts the timer over again.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
People die of hydration this way.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
Somebody look. God damn it, Christy.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
God damn it, I gotta start again.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
One, two. No one look at my spread butthole.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Isn't that the plot of Magic Mike?

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
It's basically the first hour and 45 minutes are him trying to get through the 15 minute spread butthole.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
No, it's an interactive film.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
It's just Stockard Channing.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
When it's on the honor system, you have to push the button connected to your seat.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
It is just Stockard Channing's spread butthole on the screen.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Yes, Mom and Dad, I do want to pursue acting.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And I'm sorry, but I'm quitting my day job as the usher that has demanded the audience to major.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
No one looks at Channing Tatum's spread butthole.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I said Stockard Channing.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Yes, you said Stockard Channing.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Stockard Channing doesn't hurt me.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
You said Stockard Channing's spread butthole.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You son of a bitch.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
You conjured that image into existence with your words.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Throw up.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Now everyone is thinking about Stockard Channing's spread butthole.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
It's your fucking fault.

07:13.000 --> 07:22.000
You actually said it and I went through this montage similar to Showgirls where Stockard Channing is training Channing Tatum.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
No, you've got to spread it like this to really get the soldier vitriol up.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Your humor is all out of whack, Channo.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Take it from me.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
You know that's not the first time that switch has happened.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Oh, Christ.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I think horses might be on some next level shit.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
They're like the dolphins of the land.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
They're like land dolphins.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
They're basically land dolphins.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Hey, do you want to go down to land dolphin races and lay some bets?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Me neither. That seems inhumane.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Let's just let them run free.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Why don't we have dolphin races? Just side note.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah, dolphin races would be fresh.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I'd really rather watch that than horse races.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I think it's because creating on-sea seating is so daunting.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Because everyone who would want to watch dolphins races is fat.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't know how you would buoy them.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
You would need mermaid jockeys, probably.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
If I said dolphin jockey, that kind of sounds like a racist slur, maybe.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Or something you call a scuba diver if you don't know what that is very good.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Maybe some sort of islander. I don't know.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Maybe it's like a Tongan racial slur.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I don't know. I do not know that that...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I don't think it's...

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
It's like somebody who's not from the island.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
You mean like they put the pineapple on top of their beef?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You know, like, oh, you don't put the beef on the pineapple.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You dolphin jockey.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Go back to the mainland.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Is that your islander impression, Justin?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Yeah, you just say everything slow.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Go back to the mainland, dolphin jockey.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
You sound like you've lost the ability to have inflection in your voice.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Yeah, if the Caribbean had like a deep south and also you were drunk.

09:15.000 --> 09:29.000
Take your banana republic polo and your ability to modulate your voice tone back to the mainland, dolphin jockey.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Now that's becoming like a Charlton Heston islander.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, he played it in the sixties.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
It was a crazy time.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
They got Charlton Heston. It was like Genghis Khan and John Wayne.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
You know, they got a white man to play an ethnic role.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
It was highly, highly offensive.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.000
I need to stop you both right here because I don't think either of you have watched a hip hop music video in the past 15 fucking years

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
because I do not think popping and locking it is still a thing that is commonplace.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
I do not think in a new Chris Brown video people are moving like robots.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Are people still busting a move?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
That is no, no.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
They drop it like it's hot?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Young MC took that one to the fucking grave, dog.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
They take it to the floor and touch their toes.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Now put some cardboard on the floor and spin around real fast.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh yeah, did they do that headspin thing where like they kind of...

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Pardon me.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Do I do it like a tornado?

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Teacher, would you like to see my tootsie roll?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Nope, nope.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I wouldn't because it's fucking 2012.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It is not 1999 anymore.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
I don't need you to teach me how to dougie, but I would appreciate some notes on how to improve it.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Ah, Charlie Brown.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Nope, it's not.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's super not.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Psst, when do we start working on the electric slide?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
We never did.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Never will.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Never did that.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Can't.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
It was never a thing.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Excuse me, teach.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Can you teach me how to do that move that the guy in the fishing hat does where he shakes his head really fast and it looks like he's vibrating?

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I think it's in Breaking 2.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Teach.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Teach.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
When do we start the partner work with the brooms?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
What are you talking about?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Is that in Breaking 2?

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
Are you in Fantasia?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Well, no, but now, yes.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
When do we get the lesson about dancing on the ceiling?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
That's going to go on and on.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Teach, when do we start the Jamiroquai work?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Now, Friday we have a Jamiroquai workshop.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
We do have the room where the floor is a giant treadmill, so everyone, we're going to have a lot of fun.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Don't bring your bags in, please.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.000
Do not bring your bags, but do bring in your gigantic hats like Mr. Jamiroquai would wear.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Did you guys know that the lead singer of Jamiroquai was just named Jamiroquai and it was just him?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Now, is that true?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
No.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Why did you lie?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
He was actually the last of the Jamiroquai Indians.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Exactly.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
What?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh, Christ.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
Do you think that metaphorically, like, when we look back at college and think of all the times we didn't get it.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
And you're like, ugh, do you think that's what, like, all of life is like that metaphorically?

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
Like, if you're not getting it, it's so, the difference between college and the life I'm living right now, this is what I'm saying.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
The difference between college and the life I'm in right now is similar to the difference between, is relatable metaphorically, the difference between being alive and being dead.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
It's basically what I'm saying.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Do you think that's an accurate metaphor?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't think it's-

12:41.000 --> 12:54.000
I bet that Hell is just, like, a series of being able to watch, like, completely watch on, like, television or on a giant movie screen, those moments, and then, like, having a pop-up video that's like, bloop.

12:54.000 --> 13:04.000
If he would have done this, then this was the million dollar idea that would have changed his life, or it would have been the most amazing night of his life, but he didn't because he was chicken shit.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
Hey, if you'd ordered the Panang curry, Steve Buscemi would have heard, and he'd be like, oh, bro, that's my fave.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Let's party down.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And then he would have been best friends with Buscemi.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, and that is, I guess, life's ultimate achievement.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
I regret-

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm just saying it's a cool thing that's gonna happen.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
My life is perfect right now.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
I have a great podcast and family and girlfriend and job, but man, me and Buscemi were buds.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
What if Buscemi were your roommate?

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh, god, I would forsake everything to be a Buscemi bud.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
You fucking idiots.

13:35.000 --> 13:47.000
I'm sorry that you don't live satisfying lives and that you need a trap-toothed actor to help you find satisfaction.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm gonna tell Sydney all this shit that you said, and Teresa.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
You don't have to, please, listen.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
Listen, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I love you, but I love, love Buscemi.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I just feel like there's a Buscemi-shaped hole in my hood.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
It was for Sydney's sake that I didn't pick, like, a girl or something.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
Like, I didn't say, like, and then Kathleen Turner would hear, and you would get totally crazy.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
So, wait, in your mind, Kathleen Turner is the female version of Steve Buscemi?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Like, their equivalent?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Right, exactly.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Oh, Christ.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
You could do toys.

14:24.000 --> 14:36.000
Like, I've got in my cubicle a Harry Houdini bobblehead, a Superman bust, and a donkey figurine from Shrek that talks.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Go fuck yourself.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
What? Why? Griffin?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
No, Travis, you're an adult.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I am an adult. I'm an adult that works at a theater.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
You're gonna be somebody's husband soon, and you have a Shrek toy on your desk where you work.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
He talks. He says, like, you know what it's really nice? Parfaits.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You know when someone says, you want parfaits?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
He says, hell no, I don't want no parfaits. Parfaits are delicious.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's hilarious.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
That was word for word.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
You have used this toy so much that you have memorized that entire soliloquy.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It's great. It's a good thing.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And he also makes jokes about Shrek farting.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
He says, like, shoo, Shrek.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
You used to rip one off.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm mouth-opening everything.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It's pretty great.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I'm just saying.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
It's just a pretty good thing.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Justin spit coffee all over his keyboard.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
He had to go.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Did he really?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah, he's cleaning it up now.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Um, okay.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Um, what an idiot.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You're so dumb.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
You're a stupid Shrek doll.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Hey, do you have any creative ideas for fundraisers?

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm raising money to spend two years in Nicaragua.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Volunteering, and I'm a little short of my goal.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Thanks, Evidee.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Can you kickstart a Nicaragua trip?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You can kickstart pretty much.

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
If I wanted to go to Hardee's, but I didn't want to pay, like, the four bucks for a sandwich of sausage and eggs,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
then I could kickstart that.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Let's kickstart a My Brother, My Brother, and Me Hardee's party.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
And it's basically like, however much money we get, that's how many people...

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Okay, to start, we need $500,000 to build a Hardee's.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What? There's a Hardee's in Route 60.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
You guys have Hardee's here?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
We'll need at least...

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
I think we're in pretty good with Andrew WK, so he'll probably cut us a pretty sweet deal to record a version of his song

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
when it's time to party, we will party hard-ease.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
My Brother, My Brother, and Me breakfast fundraising experience.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
We will party hard-ease.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
What are the California raisins doing?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Will they come back?

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
I will put on a garbage bag and dress like a California raisin for you.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
This is gonna be a really good party.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I'm really excited about this.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
You guys, this is gonna be, like, a super bad party.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
You're welcome.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I went to my super bad party.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
It was at a Hardee's on Route 60.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
They had a little slide-ease.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
It was awesome.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It was a little arty farty.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
What are we doing?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
I mean, it's Hardee's.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
It's no Sardee's, but it was a Hardee's party.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Just don't be tardy.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
For Christ's sake, move on.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Get a ride with my friend Marty to the Hardee's party.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
My friend Marty erased all my pictures.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Creative ideas for fundraisers.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I think if I saw a grown woman selling lemonade, that would be pretty crazy.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
I think I would probably donate to her because I'd assume she had fallen on hard times.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Especially if some of the letters were backwards.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, no.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
She put, like, womenade.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Wait, not women.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Womenade is a fundraising goal.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
I actually think you could be arrested for selling womenade on the street.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Excuse me, you got a permit for this, womenade?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You sound adorable, officer.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
No, I mean...

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Is lemonade...

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Is lemonade sold by women?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
What is it?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
I thought it was lemonade sold for women.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Like, made of them.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Like, you put a spigot in the side of a woman and womenade comes out.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
It's adorable.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's 100% pure, fresh lemonade.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Guys, this is like...

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
I feel like a new energy beverage, a new vitamin water is invented every week,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
and womenade is our fucking meal ticket.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I know.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Womenade is the...

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Here's what it's got.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's got a natural balance of electrolytes.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It's gonna help you rehydrate.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
It's also got estrogen, because that's something that's in ladies.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Here's what you do.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
B12 and whatever is in red wine that makes you not get Alzheimer's.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
You gotta...

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
You take a regular Country Time lemonade, you cut it with water,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
because vitamin drinks can't taste as good as normal drinks.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Right.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And then you throw a one-a-day women's supplement in there.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's so gay.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And then just a dash of red wine.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Guys, let me throw this out, let me eat you with this.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Okay.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
The spokesperson, Ray Liotta.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Ray Liotta for womenade.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
That's a brave choice.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
That seems pretty cut and dry.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I don't like it.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It's too obvious.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
What women these days are so concerned about is osteoporosis.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So womenade does have ground up bones in it.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
So you can get your calcium.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It's the chunks that let you know it's working.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
It does make it a little mealy.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It makes it sort of sludge-like.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Hey guys, what would you think of this as like a mascot?

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
The little animated baby from Ally McBeal.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I love it.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Your biological clock's ticking and it's counting down to womenade time.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
Crack open a fresh womenade with the baby from Ally McBeal and Ray Liotta.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Our spokespeople.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Get out of here, baby.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
You're creeping me out.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
This is Ray Liotta's voice.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
They promised him that they were going to CGI the baby in later, but they never did.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Did you see that fucking womenade commercial?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Ray Liotta's losing it.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I'm losing my mind over this.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Look at him with his little diaper.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Doing that little dance.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
What do you call that, baby?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Hey baby, get back here.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Hey, hold this drink for a second, baby.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
I got a bitch womenade.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Got to sell the people on it.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Ooga chaka.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Right, baby?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Ooga chaka.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Right, baby?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Remember that?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Remember when you appeared in McNichol?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Man, I love that show.

20:36.000 --> 20:43.000
I feel like womenade idea is going to make us a lot of money.

20:43.000 --> 20:51.000
So the neighborhood that our company house where all of our young actors live is not a nice neighborhood.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
And the other day they were telling me that this group of young people was just throwing rocks at cars.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
Like on the street, not even cars driving by, just parked cars on the street, just throwing rocks at them.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Can we-

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Why?

21:06.000 --> 21:12.000
Before we jump to any conclusions, are we sure that those cars didn't ask those children to throw rocks at them?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Kind of Knight Rider situation.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
What?

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
The Knight Rider where the cars are talking to them and asking them to throw rocks at them.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
You know Knight Rider.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
You know Knight Ritter.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Knight Rider.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
With John Ritter.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
It's just John Ritter giving David Hasselhoff piggyback rides.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Ritter Rider.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Did you guys see that episode of Ritter Rider?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
I love that one.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh my God.

21:36.000 --> 21:46.000
Sorry, I just had the vision of John Ritter voiced by Mr. Feeny and I'm going to have a rod all day now.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Perfect.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
That's going to really impede my work day.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
My girlfriend and I knew exactly almost what time her ring was going to be available.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
She knew it was happening and said to me, if you wait, I will kill you.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Okay.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Right.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So I proposed as soon as I got home, which was fine.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
It was very nice for us.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Got down to one knee, did Sets of Romance and things, bought her flowers.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Very nice.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
And then I had to spend the rest of time explaining to people why I didn't do something more surprising.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Sure.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Now here's the counter counterpoint.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Who wants to get married?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Bond, chain, milk, milk, milk.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Don't milk the cow.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
You can go out and get it.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
You don't have to tie yourself down with a, don't just fry free on that hot air balloon

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
because you don't need a sandbag tying you down.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Let's go seed.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Let's go sow your seeds in a field of pussies.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I don't remember that scene from the UHS.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Wait a minute.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Stop the world.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I want to get off.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Wait, did you just say sow your seed in a field of pussies?

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
What kind of ship are you running here?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Sow your wild oats in the pussy dirt.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
It's not a ship, it's a farm, obviously.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Pussy farm.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Zynga's new Facebook hit.

22:57.000 --> 23:05.000
Come water my pussy so I can get 30 pussy coins.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Have you seen my pussy cow?

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
I think it wandered onto your Facebook farm.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
Give us $30, we'll give you 600 zynga points and you can use it to buy new pussy cows.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh, the pussy wolf came and snuck into your farm and ate all your rutabagas.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
You pussy bagas.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Our wolves are vegetarian.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Don't steal that in your Facebook game.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
We'll sue you.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
Come on down to zynga ranch for all the milk for the pussy cows.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Ready to move on.

23:39.000 --> 23:47.000
There was a lot of, I guess it's good that we do a split every now and then because we usually talk about boners a lot,

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
but there was a lot of discussion of the vagina and its parts in this particular episode.

23:53.000 --> 24:00.000
Griffin, the one thing that you should have learned from Mexico is no regrets.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Which is also the Romney campaign slogan.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
No regrets.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Full speed ahead.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Never look back, Romney, 2012.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Fuck it, it's like my 12th time trying this.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I have nothing left to lose.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
You want to see my taxes?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I want to see the future.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Why is everybody?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Why are you in the past?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
I want to talk about how much money I'm going to make next year.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
That's what I'm looking forward to, which is why I've hired a baby to be my vice president.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Come on, baby.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
We're going to the future.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Come on, baby VP.

24:29.000 --> 24:37.000
Okay, how would you not vote? I don't agree with Mr. Romney's politics.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
If he did put a baby on the ticket, what if he actually showed the baby sitting on a ticket?

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
And you did like, Romney was at his podium, and then you had a small baby podium next to it.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Then you put a baby dressed like Mitt Romney with a Mitt Romney wig on.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
And he's wearing a toupee.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I would vote for that.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Hey, Romney, if you're listening, you're welcome.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Just imagine that VP debate, too, right?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Because you would have our VP whose name escapes me.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
His what? Sorry?

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
His name escapes me at the moment.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Oh, man, you know.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Joey B.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
You know the guy?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Joey B.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Joey Bag of Donuts is up there.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Joey Bag of Donuts, eh?

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
He's doing his thing up there.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I can't remember the goddamn vice president's name.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I've been out of the country more days than I've been in the country.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Don't you have to take a test to get back into the country?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
This is hugely embarrassing.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I'm pretty sure it's Joey Flip.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Is it not Joey Flip?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Flip Wilson?

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Flip Wilson, vice president and known cross-dresser, Flip Wilson.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Okay, I want to see a VP debate with Joseph Gordon-Biden.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
Yo, he was so good on Third Rock from the Sun.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I love his work in Brick.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
He was so good in that.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I want him up there.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I want a baby up there.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
And one of them is going to poop his pants,

26:03.000 --> 26:09.000
but the other one is going to say something offensive accidentally about the gay community.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
And it's going to be great.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Which one was which? I don't know.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
It could really go either way.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
He pays your money.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
He takes your chances.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Let's get into the advice.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
I just forgot the vice president's fucking name for two and a half minutes.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
You're not even like an American anymore, really.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh, damn it, Facebook.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Here's the truth about the Facebook.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
It's sort of my whole – it's not just for me.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
It's not just Facebook.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
It's life, you know?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Uh-oh.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
You got that right, Matthew McCullough.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
No, listen.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Let's get these stinky, sticky bongos out.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
Let's rap about this.

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
Fucking – how is anyone ever supposed to miss you if you're always there?

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
Are you saying to disappear for a while?

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
Was that on the – was that on the tweet stream of quotes from The Notebook?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Because I do follow that, too.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Hey, listen, for real, listen.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
If you're a bird, I'm a bird.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Fuck.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm going to puke.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Fuck.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Listen, seriously, for real.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Listen, but seriously.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Listen, for real.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
This is F-R-E-A-L life lesson.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
How – like, if you're always tweeting and booking and LinkedIning about everything you do,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
no one's going to give a shit.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
You got to compress.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And even then, nobody gives a shit about anything you do.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
The reason that your friend gets all these likes is because he says something broad.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
He says something that means something to everybody, not just him.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Went to five guys today.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Too many fries.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Zero likes.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Because everybody likes fries.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
No likes, no shares.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Do you know why?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Because everybody went to fucking five guys today.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Yep.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
You know what?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I'm going to drop some Carnegie on you.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Here we go.

28:02.000 --> 28:11.000
You can win more friends in two weeks of getting interested in other people

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
than you can in two years of trying to get other people interested in you.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh, God.

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
If you put up a Facebook status that is about your life and how much it blows slash rules,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I don't like either one of those.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
If it rules, I feel jealous.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
If it blows, I feel empathy.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I don't like either of those emotions.

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
If you put on your status like, five o'clock somewhere, you know I like that because I'm into that.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I feel that.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I'm with you on that.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Or get engaged because that's what I did and I got fucking like 350 likes in two hours.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
I love this.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
Travis, you have just given birth to the king of ideas.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Cracked it.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Get engaged.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Or just every...

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
And then end it and get engaged again on cycle.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
That's a little extreme, but there are a ton...

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Opened up my new business today.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Three days later, business went under.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Should have had a better plan.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Anyone know good music to listen to?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And then say like, pray for me.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Pray for me.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I've got to go pray on it like, oh my God.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
Anybody got any choice quotes about prayer and its meaning and value?

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
Anyone got some sweet bibble verses for me?

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Need them.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Last weekend was my birthday.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Happy birthday.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
No, no.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Happy birthday, Justin.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Not me.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Like, like, like.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Like, like, like, like, like.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm going to share that with all my business friends.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Oh.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Like, like, like, like.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
One idea, find a picture of an old guy in a military outfit and then say, this was my

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
pop-pop.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
He passed away this week or something like that.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Like, like, like.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Like, like, like.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
People like him and my G-MAR high school sweethearts.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
People are going to like that.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Like crazy.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
This is my G-Paw.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Red blood Americans.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
This is my G-Paw in the war.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
I want...

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
I like how your G-Paw looks.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I want to be his LinkedIn professional buddy.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Like, like, like.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I want to buddy link with him.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Like, like, like.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
I'd name my farm bill after my G-Paw.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Like, like, like, like.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I retweeted your grandpa's pussy farm.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Like, like, like, like.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
You guys are going to hear a great joke.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
It's on Yahoo.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Okay.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Justin Cain sent it in.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I've never read a Yahoo joke before.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
We'll see how it works.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
Ronnie says, how do you make a horse laugh then cry?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Uh-huh.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
To make a horse laugh, you go up to the horse and whisper in their ear, my dick is bigger

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
than yours.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
To make a horse cry, the guy shows him his penis and it was bigger.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
That is a pretty...

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
That almost beats my Pika joke.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Almost.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Comes close.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Yeah.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
The top answer on that says horses don't care about penis size.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Bullshit, they don't.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
They don't even speak English, you guys.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
You don't evolve penises that big without some sort of underlying biological impairment.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Biological imperative.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
But that's some sort of John Hodgman.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
And a man with a penis larger than a horse is to be pitied.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
He will never have a full erection and could not lay with a woman even if he could.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Weird.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Yes.

31:21.000 --> 31:27.000
Now, Griffin had a pretty good bit where he used to come up to you and say, is there

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
a baker under your bed?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
And you would say, no.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
And then Griffin would say, have you checked?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
And you would say, no.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
And then Griffin would say, then how do you know there is not a baker under your bed?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
For some people, it was adorable and hilarious.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
For me, it was terrifying.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And I often lived in fear of being baked.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
Because they were in bunk beds and Griffin would hang his head down at four o'clock

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
in the morning and shout this into Travis's face.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
I have a confession that I need to get off my chest after probably 22 years.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Okay.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Oh, wow.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
I stole the baker under your bed joke from the movie Rocket Man.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Wait a minute.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
I stole probably my most, the joke that whenever you talk about how funny a kid I was, I stole

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
that shit from Harlan Williams.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Took it right from him.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Are you telling me this?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
I hate you so much.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Took it right from him.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
I hate your fuck.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Are you serious?

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
10 years old, you thought, oh my god, this kid's on another level.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Nope.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
You know who is on another level is Harlan Williams.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
Well, he's on another level for a 10-year-old.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
That's great because when I was seven, I used to think that Griffin was like a young Harlan

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Williams.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
Holy shit, Griffin.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Now I'm being usual suspects again.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
I know.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
I know.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Kaiser Sose 2.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Sose again.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I didn't.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Sose we all.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Sose we all.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
You were suspect Sose.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Oh, god.

33:01.000 --> 33:17.000
Can we go to the money zone?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
A lot of great stuff, Trav, huh?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Yeah.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Hilarious, but also makes you think.

33:21.000 --> 33:26.000
That's the best thing about it is that it makes you think.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
And what we want you to do right now is think about spending some money on our beloved sponsors.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
First up this week is Boll and Branch.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
That's B-O-L-L and Branch.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
We've been talking about them for a long time.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
They have wonderful, impossibly good sheets.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
They're the only ones that I'll sleep on.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Otherwise, I won't sleep.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
I'll just lay and think about how itchy and crappy my non-Boll and Branch sheets are.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
So I don't use them.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
They're 100% organic cotton sheets, which means they start out super soft and get even

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
softer over time.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Plus, they last longer.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
And that's why Boll and Branch will let you sleep on them for 30 nights.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
If you're not thrilled, send them back for a full refund.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Another idea, these make a great gift.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
They come in really beautiful packaging, and I think anybody would be excited to have new,

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
great sheets.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
They're also very strong.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
If you're looking to string them together to climb out of a tall tower.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Tall tower, you can totally do that.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
Or if you wanted to use them to catch people who were jumping out of second story windows

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
of a burning building.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Whatever.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
It doesn't say that on the package.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
I want to make it clear.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Boll and Branch is not making these claims.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
These are Travis McElroy originals.

34:32.000 --> 34:39.000
Right now, our listeners can order at BollandBranch.com and get $50 off a set of sheets.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
That's $50.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
50 clams.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
50 clams.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
That's BollandBranch.com.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Promo code MyBrother.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
BollandBranch.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
That's B-O-L-L and Branch.com.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Promo code MyBrother and get $50 off a set of sheets.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
Is clams a thing people say in terms of money?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
It is, right?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
It is a thing.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Right?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Who else we got to beat, Travis?

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
I said it, and it didn't sound right.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Also this week, we've got Harry's.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Justin, let me ask you a question.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
How's your face?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Great.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Perfect, actually.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Yeah, it's a perfect face.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Can you say smooth?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
It's perfectly smooth.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
It's a great face, but you know why?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
It's perfectly smooth?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
You have no facial features?

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
No.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It's a perfect face, and you know why?

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
Because I use Harry's for my shaving needs.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah, you do.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Harry's.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
It's just, I would say, a revolution in the world of shaving.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
You might still be doing the store-bought stuff, and you're going and you're having

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
to wait for somebody to come unlock the acrylic bulletproof case because you're some kind

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
of razor criminal, but Harry's doesn't believe in all that shit.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
You go to harrys.com, you just order what you need, and you know what?

35:52.000 --> 35:56.320
Because they don't have all of that brick and mortar overhead stuff, you're going to

35:56.320 --> 36:00.480
get it at a way cheaper price, but with higher quality blades.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.560
And that's the deal with Harry's.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.360
You get high quality blades at cheap, cheap prices.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.360
It's a great deal.

36:06.360 --> 36:12.680
And right now, Harry's has a limited edition set that would be perfect for maybe a holiday

36:12.680 --> 36:16.160
gift or just a little treat for yourself.

36:16.160 --> 36:22.280
It's called the Winter Winston Shaving Set, and it has a midnight blue chrome razor handle,

36:22.280 --> 36:25.280
which you can get engraved with initials.

36:25.280 --> 36:29.680
Three of Harry's German-engineered five-blade cartridges that provide a close, comfortable

36:29.680 --> 36:30.680
shave.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.560
It also has some foaming shave gel, and it comes in a beautifully designed gift box.

36:34.560 --> 36:40.400
So this isn't just plastic bubble packaging that looks like you bought it at the corner

36:40.400 --> 36:41.400
store.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.520
This looks like something someone would be happy to open, be excited to get, and that's

36:45.520 --> 36:47.600
all for only 30 bucks.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.680
And razors, they're for everybody.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.680
Razors are for everybody.

36:51.680 --> 36:55.400
I use it, Teresa uses it, and BB uses it.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.520
We've tried to get her to stop, but she just won't.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.000
She's like, no, Dad, let me play with the razor.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.560
Where does she keep finding these razors?

37:00.560 --> 37:02.480
Well, we don't keep a clean house.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.200
We just leave razors laying around.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.200
Sure.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.200
Listen, I know-

37:06.200 --> 37:08.440
At these prices, you can afford to, Trav.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.480
Yeah, we get them.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.240
Half of the razors we have, we just throw on the ground.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.920
You know what I mean?

37:13.920 --> 37:14.920
So how can they get it?

37:14.920 --> 37:20.880
Well, what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to go to harrys.com and you're

37:20.880 --> 37:26.280
going to enter the code mybrother at checkout and you'll get $5 off.

37:26.280 --> 37:32.000
Now this is a limited edition shave set, so they still will have their other shave sets,

37:32.000 --> 37:37.080
but this Winter Winston shaving set won't last long.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.320
And free shipping ends on December 9th.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.120
So if you're looking to get something for the holidays, you're going to want to go get

37:43.120 --> 37:44.120
it now.

37:44.120 --> 37:50.840
Go to harrys.com and enter the code mybrother, all one word, at checkout for $5 off.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.480
Trust me, it's amazing.

37:52.480 --> 37:57.360
Go check out harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.

37:57.360 --> 38:02.560
I got a message for Ben, and it's from Doug, and the message is, happy birthday, bro.

38:02.560 --> 38:06.280
I definitely didn't buy this a week before your birthday because it was actually less

38:06.280 --> 38:07.280
than a week.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.280
Yep.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.960
I'm best brother.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.260
Sorry for the disappointment a long time ago.

38:12.260 --> 38:16.440
Maybe it'll happen in time for my birthday, in which case, happy birthday me, probably,

38:16.440 --> 38:17.440
for me.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.440
Buckle up, Doug.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
Love it.

38:19.440 --> 38:28.000
And the time frame, it literally says this, the time frame is May 8th, lol, which I think

38:28.000 --> 38:32.640
probably Doug knew what he was when he picked us up.

38:32.640 --> 38:38.480
So thank you to Doug and happy birthday, a long, long time ago, Ben.

38:38.480 --> 38:43.600
Oh, speaking of, the Jumbotrons are on sale again.

38:43.600 --> 38:47.800
I haven't checked to see how far in advance they are sold out now, but they did go on

38:47.800 --> 38:53.520
sale today, the 28th, so don't wait.

38:53.520 --> 38:57.520
If you're looking for something, go do it now.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.120
You got another message here, Trav?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.800
We do.

39:00.800 --> 39:07.760
This other message, Justin, thank you for asking, is for Wheelchair, and it's from Snake.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.920
Happy birthday, Boo.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.040
I love you the most.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.720
I'm so glad you were born.

39:11.720 --> 39:15.800
Good job on another 365 days of super badassery.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.660
You've got the brains, the looks, the booty, and the hooks?

39:20.660 --> 39:21.660
Hooks for hands.

39:21.660 --> 39:26.800
Enjoy the brothers saying these things, butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, butts, get out

39:26.800 --> 39:30.120
of my dreams and into my car, beep, boop, boop, beep.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
I'm a robot.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.200
That was a very good message.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.200
That was pretty solid.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.760
I liked all of that a lot.

39:36.760 --> 39:42.240
That's great stuff, so happy birthday, and that was for June 25th, so again, very sorry

39:42.240 --> 39:43.240
about that.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.240
Whoops.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.240
Whoops-a-daisy.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.440
Anyway, folks, thank you for listening.

39:48.440 --> 39:54.100
Oh, oh, before we head back into the show, the new episode of Till Death Do Us Blart

39:54.100 --> 39:55.100
is up.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.100
Yes.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.100
It went up on Thanksgiving.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.100
In case you missed it, go check that out.

39:58.100 --> 40:01.600
In case you don't know who that is, me, Justin Griffin, and Tim and Guy from The Worst Idea

40:01.600 --> 40:05.720
of All Time watch and review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 every American Thanksgiving for the

40:05.720 --> 40:07.200
rest of linear time.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.200
Go check it out.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.000
Till Death Do Us Blart.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.760
Anyway, back to the show.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.320
This one is sent in by Krista Whalen.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.320
Thank you, Krista.

40:15.320 --> 40:21.760
It's by Yahoo Answers user Kevin, who asks, if your celebrity crush says he or she will

40:21.760 --> 40:30.360
go out with you, if you eat just a little bit of his or her poop, would you do it?

40:30.360 --> 40:35.320
Oh, God.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.760
Yes.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.200
Yes.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.080
No.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.640
Can you reread the question?

40:44.640 --> 40:48.080
If your celebrity crush says he or she will go out with you, if...

40:48.080 --> 40:49.080
Stop right there.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.080
Stop right there.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.080
Okay.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.080
Go out with you?

40:52.080 --> 40:53.080
Listen.

40:53.080 --> 40:57.920
If you're talking about an ongoing relationship with my celebrity crush, this isn't just a

40:57.920 --> 41:00.480
one-off situation, okay?

41:00.480 --> 41:05.240
Anybody who begins the tenor of the relationship with, just eat a little bit of my poop.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.240
So how did you guys meet?

41:06.240 --> 41:07.240
Well, funny story.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.240
How did you guys meet?

41:08.240 --> 41:09.240
It's a terrible...

41:09.240 --> 41:10.240
What if that's...

41:10.240 --> 41:15.240
That's how how I met your mother ends.

41:15.240 --> 41:28.920
The final part of the last shot of the show is the two kids on the couch horrifying.

41:28.920 --> 41:29.920
Yeah.

41:29.920 --> 41:34.560
The series finale, the episode is 30 seconds long, and Bob Saget's like, all right, here

41:34.560 --> 41:35.560
it comes.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.560
Are you ready?

41:36.560 --> 41:37.560
It's Penelope Cruz.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.200
And she said, how do you feel about scat?

41:39.200 --> 41:40.200
And I said, not great.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.480
And she said, well, tough.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.080
And then I ate just a little bit.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.080
The end.

41:44.080 --> 41:49.560
And the camera pans around and Bob Saget is wearing a ball gag and he's in chains.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.560
Any other questions?

41:50.560 --> 41:54.840
Now get out of here so your mom can poop on me.

41:54.840 --> 41:55.840
Oh, man.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
And that is the story.

41:56.840 --> 42:01.320
Now your mom says her little whore has done enough storytelling, it's time to get upstairs

42:01.320 --> 42:06.560
and do my whore job, like a good little slut that I am, the dad from How I Met Your Mother.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.560
I have to go.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.560
Oh, God.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.560
Oh, God.

42:09.560 --> 42:10.560
Oh, shit.

42:10.560 --> 42:11.560
That'd be great.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.560
Those kids would be so angry.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.160
Like, we've been sitting here for seven years.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.480
And that's how it ends?

42:16.480 --> 42:17.600
The end of it is you eating a little bit of poop?

42:17.600 --> 42:19.600
And he just looks and he goes, the aristocrats.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.600
Yeah.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.600
Really?

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
What if...

42:22.600 --> 42:24.880
So you think it might be a celebrity mother?

42:24.880 --> 42:25.880
You think...

42:25.880 --> 42:30.360
And that's how I met your mother, Geena Davis.

42:30.360 --> 42:38.120
Known archer and scat enthusiast and star of Cutthroat Island, Geena Davis.

42:38.120 --> 42:44.960
Earth girls may be easy, but Earth boys will eat your poopy.

42:44.960 --> 42:45.960
It's science.

42:45.960 --> 42:51.520
I also feel like you reveal too much and letting people know that my celebrity crush is Geena

42:51.520 --> 42:52.520
Davis.

42:52.520 --> 42:53.520
Well...

42:53.520 --> 42:57.480
Now Geena Davis or Earth girls are easy era Geenas?

42:57.480 --> 42:58.480
Yeah, Commander in Chief.

42:58.480 --> 43:02.960
Geena, like 1988 circa Geena Davis.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.960
Sure.

43:03.960 --> 43:07.360
But also circa 1988, Annie McDowell.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.360
So...

43:08.360 --> 43:09.360
Oh my God.

43:09.360 --> 43:10.360
Yes.

43:10.360 --> 43:11.360
I got some weird standards.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.360
Yeah.

43:12.360 --> 43:13.360
And it includes time travel.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.560
I guess.

43:15.560 --> 43:16.560
And being eight.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.480
I don't want to talk about it.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.680
There isn't...

43:21.680 --> 43:22.680
We're not equipped to...

43:22.680 --> 43:27.800
We're all in very happy relationships.

43:27.800 --> 43:32.240
I feel like if this question was to hang out with a celebrity you think you should be best

43:32.240 --> 43:33.240
friends with...

43:33.240 --> 43:34.240
That's what I'm saying.

43:34.240 --> 43:35.560
Would you eat a little bit of Alton Brown's poopy?

43:35.560 --> 43:36.560
Just to like...

43:36.560 --> 43:37.560
Just to like hang out with him.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.560
Well, yes.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.560
Have you seen how well he eats?

43:39.560 --> 43:40.560
Yeah.

43:40.560 --> 43:41.560
He would prepare it.

43:41.560 --> 43:42.560
I think...

43:42.560 --> 43:43.560
He got way healthy.

43:43.560 --> 43:44.560
Yeah.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.340
I was saying, like, if you said, like, eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop, all

43:47.340 --> 43:48.340
over it.

43:48.340 --> 43:49.340
Yeah, sure.

43:49.340 --> 43:50.340
Can we not have this conversation at all?

43:50.340 --> 43:53.200
Travis would probably eat a little bit of David Tennant's poop, even if it meant not

43:53.200 --> 43:54.200
hanging.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.200
Just cause.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.200
Just cause.

43:56.200 --> 44:00.600
Even if I just ran into a dude on the street in London who said, hey, you want a bit of

44:00.600 --> 44:01.880
David Tennant's poop?

44:01.880 --> 44:03.640
I would ask the price.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.800
Can this not happen?

44:04.800 --> 44:05.800
Let me just ask...

44:05.800 --> 44:06.800
Listen, I only...

44:06.800 --> 44:10.800
Listen, I know you want to get off this subject, but I have like 75 more questions.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.200
Do you think there are people out there...

44:12.200 --> 44:13.200
And I really...

44:13.200 --> 44:17.440
I don't fancy myself a celebrity, but do you think there are people out there who eat

44:17.440 --> 44:20.640
a little bit of our poop just to hang out with us?

44:20.640 --> 44:23.440
Yeah.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.080
I really hope not.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.280
Like I super, super, super hope not.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.680
Okay, let me rephrase.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.960
I bet there are people out there that would just eat our poop.

44:31.960 --> 44:32.960
I don't think...

44:32.960 --> 44:33.960
No, Travis.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.960
No, we're not.

44:34.960 --> 44:35.960
No, we're not.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.080
We're not Tennant level, but I think we have a little bit...

44:38.080 --> 44:39.080
No, no, no.

44:39.080 --> 44:41.360
I'm saying just because I think there are people out there that like to eat poop.

44:41.360 --> 44:42.360
Oh, sure.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.360
Sure.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.360
Okay.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.840
Guys, everything that's happening right now is the worst thing that's ever happened to

44:46.840 --> 44:47.840
me.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.840
Okay.

44:48.840 --> 44:51.760
Justin, there's not a single celebrity whose poop you would eat to hang out with them?

44:51.760 --> 44:54.480
There's not a single person whose poop...

44:54.480 --> 44:55.480
Antonio Banderas.

44:55.480 --> 44:56.480
Okay.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.480
You got me.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.480
Shit.

44:58.480 --> 45:04.040
You got to cut to the core of me, Travis.

45:04.040 --> 45:05.040
Let's see.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.040
Yeah, let's...

45:06.040 --> 45:07.160
I need to talk about something like humans talk about.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.800
I need to take like a big gulp of water and just...

45:09.800 --> 45:10.800
Ugh.

45:10.800 --> 45:11.800
Ugh.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
It's not a big gulp.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.320
I hate this stupid podcast.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.360
I recently started a new job and I got a problem.

45:17.360 --> 45:21.440
My manager burps constantly, never excuses himself.

45:21.440 --> 45:25.720
He mentioned once that he burps when he is hungry, but that wouldn't mean he's hungry

45:25.720 --> 45:26.720
all the time.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.200
The other day, your boss is Yogi Bear.

45:29.200 --> 45:33.400
The other day, I think he burped in front of a customer and didn't say anything.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.840
Also, these are not little burps.

45:35.840 --> 45:36.840
Should I say something to him?

45:36.840 --> 45:38.640
If so, what should I say?

45:38.640 --> 45:42.640
Is this just a guy trying the...

45:42.640 --> 45:46.200
Is this just a guy thing that girls just have to deal with?

45:46.200 --> 45:50.680
I was bullied by a burper in elementary school, so maybe I'm more sensitive to burps.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.040
Please help me out.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.600
Grossed out in Greenwich, who worked for Travis.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.600
Pretty sure it's Greenwich.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.600
No.

45:56.600 --> 45:57.600
Greenwich.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.600
I don't know why I said Greenwich.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.040
I'm so sorry.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.040
You edited that, so I said it.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.040
Okay.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.040
Oh, a dog.

46:04.040 --> 46:05.040
Egg.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.040
Burps are completely natural.

46:06.040 --> 46:07.040
Travis burps.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.040
This gentleman needs to learn to excuse himself.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.040
Travis burps.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.040
Did you say egg burps are natural?

46:10.040 --> 46:19.640
Because I'm here to tell you, egg burps are the pits if they are the most unnatural thing.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.960
I said the letter A.

46:20.960 --> 46:21.960
Okay.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.120
It sounded like egg, so are you hungry right now?

46:24.120 --> 46:25.200
Is that a burp?

46:25.200 --> 46:26.480
I actually am very hungry.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.760
I have not eaten all day.

46:27.760 --> 46:31.400
The first time God smelled an egg burp, he was like, I did not make that.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.400
That one's on me.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
I blew it.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.400
I blew it.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.400
This is not of my creation.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
That one's on Satan.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.120
That was a Satan burp.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.560
I have not eaten in the last three days to avoid burping.

46:40.560 --> 46:41.560
I'm trying to cut back.

46:41.560 --> 46:42.560
I appreciate that.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.560
No, Travis burps a lot.

46:43.560 --> 46:44.560
I'm very lonely.

46:44.560 --> 46:45.560
Travis has the dyspepsia.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.560
I have a disease.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.560
You have a disease.

46:47.560 --> 46:50.240
He tries to blame it on a disease, but it's really just rude.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.240
I don't know.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.240
It's not rude.

46:52.240 --> 46:56.520
The disease doesn't make you open your fucking mouth when you burp like you do.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.640
If I don't burp, I'll vomit.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.640
You close your-

46:59.640 --> 47:04.040
The disease doesn't make you go to the trophy store and buy one every time.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.040
I'm just saying.

47:05.040 --> 47:08.560
I had one once that was like three minutes long and sounded like a demon was coming out

47:08.560 --> 47:09.560
of me and it was epic.

47:09.560 --> 47:10.560
That's fine, but-

47:10.560 --> 47:12.840
How does the disease prevent you from covering your goddamn mouth every time?

47:12.840 --> 47:13.840
Or not buying a t-shirt.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.840
Because I'm not a child.

47:14.840 --> 47:17.520
I'll burp when I want to in my own goddamn house.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.760
But you're often not in your house.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.960
I'll burp in your house.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.640
I'll burp in anyone's house.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.240
I would not, could not in a house.

47:25.240 --> 47:32.320
One time I actually heard Travis burp out the words Cincinnati King of Burps, which-

47:32.320 --> 47:38.920
To be fair, that was during a job interview and I nailed it.

47:38.920 --> 47:44.320
And now I'm this person's boss, so I'm climbing up the ladder.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.760
I'm afraid I might have it.

47:46.760 --> 47:51.360
This past year I've been burping a lot and it's really not from a place of pride like

47:51.360 --> 47:52.360
Travis.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.360
I'm deeply ashamed every time I do it.

47:53.360 --> 47:57.320
And I live with my girlfriend now, so she has to like, I always try to be dainty about

47:57.320 --> 47:58.320
it.

47:58.320 --> 47:59.320
So that's a sin trying to come out.

47:59.320 --> 48:04.880
I try to be dainty about it, but there's just nothing doing and I always feel this need

48:04.880 --> 48:07.000
to just apologize profusely every time it happens.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.320
You should just hide it behind a lace fan.

48:10.320 --> 48:15.320
Put your gloved hand to the back of your hand, to your mouth, and hide it.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.800
Because apparently you're a Victorian person.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.160
Just burp like an American.

48:19.160 --> 48:23.240
I faint every time too, which is nice.

48:23.240 --> 48:24.240
That's the vapors.

48:24.240 --> 48:25.240
No, it's horrible.

48:25.240 --> 48:26.240
It's disgusting.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.680
You're farting with your mouth and you wouldn't-

48:30.680 --> 48:36.200
In all seriousness, you should not, this dude is wrong, burping at a professional workplace

48:36.200 --> 48:38.240
in front of customers as your boss.

48:38.240 --> 48:43.200
Don't get me wrong, I celebrate my burps at home with friends where it's safe.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.160
It's not, but go on.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.160
That's what I'm saying.

48:46.160 --> 48:51.360
I think that you're perfectly in the right to the next time he does it be like, hey Chet,

48:51.360 --> 48:52.360
cut it out.

48:52.360 --> 48:56.780
You realize that when I'm staying over at your house on a trip or something like that

48:56.780 --> 49:02.920
and you burp, the first thing I don't think is, oh, this is a really safe environment

49:02.920 --> 49:06.220
for me to be in.

49:06.220 --> 49:08.640
You don't think, well, I'm a guest in his house.

49:08.640 --> 49:11.720
No, I think, are you fucking kidding me?

49:11.720 --> 49:15.680
I'm holding a burp right now, you guys, because I love you and I love our listeners.

49:15.680 --> 49:21.580
When I know Griffin's coming to my house, I turn on a nice scentsy, I'll maybe select

49:21.580 --> 49:25.800
a scent cake to put in, something I know he'll enjoy.

49:25.800 --> 49:30.040
When Griffin goes to Travis's house, Travis just burps in his face and shouts, dominance.

49:30.040 --> 49:33.720
Listen, I will not be bullied, all right?

49:33.720 --> 49:35.560
Burpers unite, stand up.

49:35.560 --> 49:39.720
I think it's an old fashioned, you might as well be telling me about how you're going

49:39.720 --> 49:46.000
to get a phosphate down the soda fountain and then pin a girl and go steady.

49:46.000 --> 49:51.960
We're adults, it's 2012, burp if you want to, you shouldn't be offended.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.080
It's an archaic rule, manners while you're out.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.260
How does it upset anyone?

49:56.260 --> 50:00.120
You burp so hard once my beer fell over.

50:00.120 --> 50:04.760
How does it affect anyone other than being children and giggling at it because it's burping?

50:04.760 --> 50:08.840
Because it smells like all the food you've eaten.

50:08.840 --> 50:11.040
Burp loud, burp proud.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.640
How far do you extend this?

50:12.640 --> 50:15.760
Like do you shit in your hands and throw it at people?

50:15.760 --> 50:16.760
No, of course not.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.040
Gobble that up, pretend I'm Geena Davis.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.040
What are you?

50:20.040 --> 50:22.960
No, because I also don't burp in people's faces.

50:22.960 --> 50:25.960
I don't sneak up behind them while they're napping and burping their ears as loud as

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
I can.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.200
So that would be hilarious.

50:28.200 --> 50:33.020
You would excuse yourself to the corner to defecate in, like some sort of beast.

50:33.020 --> 50:34.760
Is that what you're saying to me?

50:34.760 --> 50:36.640
Listen, one step at a time.

50:36.640 --> 50:41.640
Travis, some of us are trying to live in a society, and I'm trying to make this society

50:41.640 --> 50:45.000
safer with people with my disease.

50:45.000 --> 50:51.400
You're saying, you're saying when you make it sound like you're throwing up invisible

50:51.400 --> 50:56.960
vomit, it's because it's for a fucking cause?

50:56.960 --> 50:59.120
You're making a point?

50:59.120 --> 51:02.160
Well no, it's because I enjoy burping.

51:02.160 --> 51:07.080
This is on the March of Grimes.

51:07.080 --> 51:11.800
Oh man.

51:11.800 --> 51:12.800
You are horrible.

51:12.800 --> 51:13.800
Eat better.

51:13.800 --> 51:14.800
Just eat better.

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
Just treat yourself better.

51:15.800 --> 51:16.800
Please be focused.

51:16.800 --> 51:17.800
Me?

51:17.800 --> 51:18.800
Yeah.

51:18.800 --> 51:19.800
Okay.

51:19.800 --> 51:27.320
My lady friend's sister got knocked up by a questionable suitor from your hometown.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.520
That's Huntington, West Virginia.

51:28.520 --> 51:33.200
You're headed to the wedding next month and seek your guidance for things to do in Huntington

51:33.200 --> 51:37.640
that don't involve feigning confidence in the unholiest of unions.

51:37.640 --> 51:41.240
That's from Andy and Kindle.

51:41.240 --> 51:44.000
I think the better question is what can't you do?

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.600
We've prepared a musical number for just this situation.

51:47.600 --> 51:48.600
Here we go.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.600
You ready?

51:49.600 --> 51:50.600
Get drunk.

51:50.600 --> 51:54.320
Griffin is correct.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.740
There are quite a few drinking establishments in Huntington.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.840
Just to name a few.

51:59.840 --> 52:03.520
You got our favorite Stumblers 2 still stumbling.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.520
Real bar.

52:04.520 --> 52:05.520
Google it.

52:05.520 --> 52:06.520
There's Peckers.

52:06.520 --> 52:07.920
Is Peckers still around?

52:07.920 --> 52:10.320
No, Peckers is now a teen nightclub.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.320
Is it?

52:11.320 --> 52:12.320
What?

52:12.320 --> 52:13.320
It is.

52:13.320 --> 52:14.320
It is.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.880
This is the God's honest truth.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.520
It was a Christian themed nightclub, right?

52:18.520 --> 52:19.520
Called like Lamb of...

52:19.520 --> 52:21.160
Oh fuck, what was it called?

52:21.160 --> 52:22.160
David?

52:22.160 --> 52:23.160
No, Lamb of Babylon?

52:23.160 --> 52:24.160
No.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.160
Lamb of Fun?

52:25.160 --> 52:26.160
Fuck.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.280
It was called the Babylon City of Sin.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.280
That still exists.

52:29.280 --> 52:34.680
Which was an adjunct of the Pearl Ultra Lounge.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.040
Those were both in the same building, but two different names.

52:37.040 --> 52:39.160
And that was the former Renaissance bookstore.

52:39.160 --> 52:43.440
Former Renaissance bookstore and for a short time jazz club.

52:43.440 --> 52:49.680
You got the Thirsty Whale, which you... and the off the shoulder gentlemen's club.

52:49.680 --> 52:50.680
Of course.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.680
You could go to Hank's.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.840
Hank's, Mark's, Dave's.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.640
St. Mark's place.

52:56.640 --> 53:01.960
I've recently been informed by Google that there's a place called Jackhammer's on Route

53:01.960 --> 53:02.960
60.

53:02.960 --> 53:03.960
So make sure you get out there.

53:03.960 --> 53:09.200
You go to Driftwood or Stonewall, Huntington's Two Gay Bars.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.200
Jackhammer's maybe a third of...

53:10.200 --> 53:13.560
For Huntington's Two Gay People.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.560
It's a perfect fit.

53:14.560 --> 53:17.400
They each have all the space they could want.

53:17.400 --> 53:18.800
No, they're populous.

53:18.800 --> 53:19.800
What else?

53:19.800 --> 53:20.800
You get Hyphy.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.200
You get Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.760
Get yourself a Snuffy Doll with cheese or...

53:25.760 --> 53:29.360
Huntington Prime if you're looking for something a little fancier.

53:29.360 --> 53:33.200
You could go stare in the windows of the closed down theater.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.200
Which one you ask?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.200
Ah, take your pick.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.800
Take your pick.

53:36.800 --> 53:40.760
You could visit the burial place of Soupy Sales.

53:40.760 --> 53:41.760
Is he dead?

53:41.760 --> 53:43.280
Is he dead?

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
He is dead.

53:44.280 --> 53:47.160
You could go stare at the river for hours.

53:47.160 --> 53:50.320
Also you're on a lot of meth at the time.

53:50.320 --> 53:51.320
You could buy meth.

53:51.320 --> 53:52.320
You could make meth.

53:52.320 --> 53:53.320
Yeah, sure.

53:53.320 --> 53:54.320
You can fight the urge.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.320
You should jump in that river.

53:55.320 --> 53:56.320
And just...

53:56.320 --> 53:57.320
Because you'll die.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
Just let it take you.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.320
Yeah.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.320
Let it take you down.

54:00.320 --> 54:04.320
And I think those are all the things.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.320
So...

54:05.320 --> 54:06.320
Enjoy.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.320
Have a great trip.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.800
Make sure to look me up.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.960
There are tours by my home.

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
Ghost tours.

54:11.960 --> 54:14.800
Ghost tours by my home three times daily.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.000
Justlin's near a hospital.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.600
So a lot of spectral activity up there.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.600
Yeah.

54:20.600 --> 54:24.720
I took you on a ghost tour of some of Huntington's number one most haunted places.

54:24.720 --> 54:28.000
Did I ever tell you guys that story?

54:28.000 --> 54:36.920
I took a ghost tour in Savannah where you go around the local locations.

54:36.920 --> 54:41.720
And really it's just an excuse to stop by local bars and you drive around in a giant

54:41.720 --> 54:45.400
hearse and you stop at local bars and you get out and you buy some...

54:45.400 --> 54:49.600
Even if they're not haunted or supposedly haunted, you can still buy alcohol because

54:49.600 --> 54:51.600
Savannah has open containers.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.600
And you get all the spirits.

54:53.600 --> 54:54.960
Get all the spirits you want, right?

54:54.960 --> 54:57.800
So you can get to travel and travel around.

54:57.800 --> 55:08.540
And at one of these breaks, at one of these beer breaks, the driver is talking to my father-in-law

55:08.540 --> 55:09.540
and he said, where are you guys from?

55:09.540 --> 55:12.760
And we said, West Virginia.

55:12.760 --> 55:20.240
And he said, yeah, there's a prison there in West Virginia that is supposedly haunted,

55:20.240 --> 55:21.240
right?

55:21.240 --> 55:29.040
And my father-in-law Tommy says, yeah, apparently it's one of the most haunted places in America.

55:29.040 --> 55:37.280
And the guy, I shit you not, says, well, most haunted is difficult to quantify.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.280
Is it?

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
Is it, sir?

55:39.280 --> 55:40.280
Is it difficult?

55:40.280 --> 55:45.640
If a place, if a place had a ghost in it, it would become the most haunted place in

55:45.640 --> 55:46.640
the world.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.640
Yeah.

55:47.640 --> 55:52.680
One, one very like bold ghost that was just like, I'm here.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.640
They stop by anytime.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.120
They will trot that out though.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.120
Oh yeah.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.120
This is the most haunted.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.120
This is the most haunted.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.600
Per square foot.

56:00.600 --> 56:02.360
We got a thousand ghosts a foot.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.360
Yeah.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.920
They're all real crammed in like sardines.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.960
Can't walk from one end to the other without hitting the ghost.

56:07.960 --> 56:08.960
It's really tricky to...

56:08.960 --> 56:13.320
Sorry, got a little ghost, got a little ghost in my throat.

56:13.320 --> 56:14.320
Sorry.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
Sucked up some ghosts.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.320
Sucked up some ghosts.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.640
Oh, I'm going to have some real bad Rio tomorrow, but that's tomorrow's problem.

56:19.640 --> 56:21.560
Happy birthday, Jordan.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.360
Happy birthday.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.360
Happy birthday, Jphonic.

56:24.360 --> 56:27.240
Oh, are we not allowed to unmask?

56:27.240 --> 56:28.240
Did I just like unmask the luchador?

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
He just like unmasked him, yeah.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.240
Shit.

56:30.240 --> 56:31.240
Go to jphonicmixtape.com.

56:31.240 --> 56:36.480
You might as well tell everyone that Deadmau5's real name is Francis.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.480
Oh, shit.

56:37.480 --> 56:41.000
Francis, what are you doing on that stage?

56:41.000 --> 56:45.280
Ma, I'm trying to make some beats.

56:45.280 --> 56:46.280
That's not music.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.280
I...

56:47.280 --> 56:48.840
Whatever happened to Rudy Vallee?

56:48.840 --> 56:52.160
Ma, go home.

56:52.160 --> 56:55.640
You look like a big old cyborg Mickey Mouse or something up there.

56:55.640 --> 56:56.640
What are you doing?

56:56.640 --> 57:01.240
Ma, I told you I'm working.

57:01.240 --> 57:02.240
That ain't a job.

57:02.240 --> 57:06.560
Get back to the diner and help your father clean up the hamburger slop.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.960
He's not well and we're all waiting for the drop.

57:09.960 --> 57:10.960
Give it to us.

57:10.960 --> 57:11.960
Give us that high beat.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
That stinky drop.

57:12.960 --> 57:13.960
Give us that fat, nasty bass.

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
We're all waiting for it.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
We all got...

57:15.960 --> 57:23.760
Your grandpa's gonna die before you drop that fat bass on us.

57:23.760 --> 57:33.840
Your cousin Skrillex would never make us wait this long for a fat, nasty drop.

57:33.840 --> 57:39.920
Oh, Jesus.

57:39.920 --> 57:48.920
Francis, my high is peaking.

57:48.920 --> 57:49.920
I'm about to come down.

57:49.920 --> 57:50.920
I got my hands in the air.

57:50.920 --> 57:51.920
I'm ready.

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
Drop it.

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
Oh, God.

57:53.920 --> 58:03.560
Your father worked all day to synthesize this X.

58:03.560 --> 58:09.640
My neon globe bracelets are losing the luminosity, Francis.

58:09.640 --> 58:16.720
Francis, they're closing the JCC at 7 p.m.

58:16.720 --> 58:20.160
All these people have to get out, just drop it.

58:20.160 --> 58:26.880
Drop the beat.

58:26.880 --> 58:31.520
Can we, every time we do an episode, can we say one nice thing about each other?

58:31.520 --> 58:32.520
Just something sweet.

58:32.520 --> 58:38.440
Your ceviche is the best ceviche I've had, and Travis, the muscles in your hands are

58:38.440 --> 58:40.320
like really big.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.320
Thank you.

58:41.320 --> 58:42.840
I never made ceviche for you.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.520
I don't know why you would say things like that.

58:44.520 --> 58:45.840
You have made ceviche for me before.

58:45.840 --> 58:46.840
It's really good.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.840
I have not.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.840
I have not made ceviche for you before.

58:48.840 --> 58:49.840
You made me ceviche shrimp once.

58:49.840 --> 58:52.640
I did not make you ceviche shrimp once, but thank you.

58:52.640 --> 58:53.640
You made...

58:53.640 --> 58:54.640
I fucking ate ceviche.

58:54.640 --> 58:55.640
If they...

58:55.640 --> 58:58.480
Were those just raw shrimp I was eating out of your refrigerator?

58:58.480 --> 59:01.440
Did I tell you guys about the text that I got from dad?

59:01.440 --> 59:04.720
I got a text from dad, this was like three weeks ago.

59:04.720 --> 59:12.480
It was maybe 8 p.m. on a Saturday night, and I get a text from our shared dad that says,

59:12.480 --> 59:13.480
try ceviche.

59:13.480 --> 59:23.800
Just apropos of nothing, Clint's just like, hey, try ceviche, all right, dad?

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
Like now?

59:24.800 --> 59:25.800
I was thinking of putting it off.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.800
I was thinking of putting it off.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
This has gone far enough.

59:27.800 --> 59:28.800
Try ceviche.

59:28.800 --> 59:34.120
Do you think our dad, do you think he confused like his text message app and his notes app?

59:34.120 --> 59:39.000
He's like, I gotta send this, gonna forget this, gotta put it in the cloud.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.160
Oh fuck.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.160
That's good.

59:42.160 --> 59:45.120
Oh man, I'm...

59:45.120 --> 59:51.000
Just so you guys know, of course our listening audience won't be able to enjoy this, but

59:51.000 --> 59:52.720
just so you guys know, I'm not fucking with you.

59:52.720 --> 59:58.600
I'm gonna send you a screen cap that I just took.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.280
Here are the things that my dad texted me about.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.440
One, premiere dates for shows that we both enjoy.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.200
This can be helpful sometimes, so I appreciate that.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.440
Two, and I don't know if you guys get these too, I don't know if you guys are on this

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.680
mailing list, but when somebody dies, like a celebrity dies, I always get a text message

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680
from dad.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.920
And it's always very, it's nice that he's almost the emotional pace car for these kinds

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.320
of things, because he lets you know that...

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.200
He lets you know that yes, this person did just die, but it's cool to drop a goof in

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200
here.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.440
For instance, August 20th, 2012, and somewhere Fang is crying, what was that?

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:47.820
That was a reference to I think Carol Channing dying, maybe, Phyllis Diller dying.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.280
It was a reference to Carol Channing killing Phyllis Diller.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.680
Explain to me about hashtags on Twitter.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.920
Oh, how about this, oh this is a classic Jim, he's moving on up.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.640
That was when Mr. Jefferson died.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.640
Priceless.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.640
Priceless.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.640
Priceless.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.720
So good.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.720
Dad doesn't text me.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.480
Must be lovely to have that kind of close relationship with your father.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.280
Actually I got a text about that, so I'm not texting Travis anymore.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.200
He just keeps texting me and calling me Travis Snow, and I don't know why.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.560
July 3rd, 2012, I hope Aunt B had him a big old pie waiting, that's when Andy Griffith

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.560
died.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560
Thanks dad.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.680
I got this one on August 10th, big thumbs up on new pizza place.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.880
That's not somebody dying.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.440
No, but it was really random, because we had not spoken about a pizza place prior to that.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.680
I don't even know what pizza place he was talking about.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.660
Here's another one, and this is, I do not know where he was when he said this, he was

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:51.040
going on vacation, but this is the exact text I got from our dad.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.280
We finally got here, and Richard Gere can blow me.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.920
That was from his shitty vacation in Rodinth.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.040
How about this, Jim?

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.540
Oh, can we do this every week?

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.320
This is so great.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.440
French steward on Community.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.200
Brilliant.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.080
That says, here's one, July 17th.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:19.640
We lost Donald Sobel, that is of course Donald Sobel, author of Encyclopedia Brown books.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.680
Oh man.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.480
After his vacation, we are home.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.480
Don't get the tuna.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.480
What?

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.480
Tuna?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.480
What place?

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480
You have to help me order that.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.360
Hey dad, I love you very much.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.320
Don't have the tuna, and do try ceviche.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.320
Dad, you're the best.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320
Thanks dad.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.800
Dad, I love you so much.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.040
Your text light up my life.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.040
These texts, us reading them out loud.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.040
They're the poorest representation.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.040
They are.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.760
They make him sound completely incompetent.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.480
He's a very, very smart man.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:57.680
I just don't think he understands the medium, much like I don't think anybody over the age

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.640
of 43 dies.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.520
Listen, I'm 31, so I'm going to have to lower that bar to like 30, because I don't get it

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.520
either.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.360
I don't understand what these kids are talking about.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.360
Emojis?

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360
I don't get it.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.360
You know what, I'm going to tell you a truth, do you guys know what emojis are?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.480
No.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:25.400
Emojis are like the little icons that are, like all Japanese phones support them, and

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.960
more phones are starting to support them here, but they're basically icons that are like

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.080
emoticons, but they're actually like little pictures that you can use to convey emotion

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.440
as part of your text.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.320
So they are highbrow emoticons.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.520
They're highbrow, high flute emoticons.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.200
They're next-gen emoticons.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:49.160
They're next-gen emoticons, they're called emojis, and true story, for about three months

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:54.040
after I first heard the term, I thought it was a fun slang for emotions.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.160
Like I'm feeling some powerful emojis, you guys.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.280
Guys, I feel so many emojis right now.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.440
So I'd like to try to repurpose that for that purpose.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:09.280
I am currently getting ready to ask my girlfriend of four years to marry me, but a bit of an

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.920
issue has come up.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.500
While talking to her recently, she mentioned that her parents were a bit concerned that

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.400
I had not yet talked to them concerning my proposal.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.560
She threw me for a loop.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.800
Is talking to her parents, namely her father, who thinks I'm a screw-up, necessary in this

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:28.080
day and age, or is that tradition that went away in the 50s?

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.560
That's from Confused in California.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.280
No, it's still very much a thing.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.840
Yeah, so I've only ever gotten engaged the one time, but my thought on this is whatever

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.720
they think is a tradition is the tradition.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:50.560
Yeah, I think you should probably get a read on how traditional they are, which I think

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.240
is going to help you to light your way here.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:05:03.840
I don't think that this gesture would ever be... I do understand there's inherent sexism

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:12.320
in the gesture, but I don't think that it's necessarily going to offend anyone doing it.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:17.680
I mean, I think you run a much greater risk of offending people by not doing it.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.600
Oh yeah, like Teresa's parents... I was talking with Teresa before I did it, and I was like,

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.080
I want to talk to your parents first, and she was like, they don't care, don't worry

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080
about it.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.580
And I was like, yeah, but I do.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:31.040
And it was still a very nice moment, even though it's not like if I had proposed without

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.640
asking, they would have been super offended or anything.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.120
Can you guys tell me... It was just a nice moment for us.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.600
I want to hear your stories.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.560
I want to hear stories from Justin, and I want to hear stories from Travis about how

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560
this talk went.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.560
Oh my God.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.600
Because Justin, I know yours was kind of a panic attack.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:52.840
I'm not good at anything that happens in this whole procedure, and I asked my now mother-in-law

01:05:52.840 --> 01:06:00.400
if she and my father-in-law could meet me at their house on their lunch break.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.000
Which I love.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.840
And I'm like, come on back to the house, let's just talk this through.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.080
Because you start out by inconveniencing them.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.080
I know.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080
That's nice.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.080
I like that.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.140
This is like full panic attack.

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:17.960
And I ask them, I say, well, I'd like to... They guessed, they knew the jig was up.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.960
And I am like-

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.760
They somehow put two and two together?

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.960
What if you just got them some subs, some Subway subs, and they just called and you

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:28.280
thought, I just thought this would be a nice thing for us to do together, if we had Subway

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280
Sub Wednesdays.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.560
Would you come back to the house on your lunch break please?

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.840
I want to point out all the messes you need to clean up.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:42.400
Listen, I'm in the middle of asking, and they say yes, and then my now father-in-law says,

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:49.520
I would like to ask that you would consider maybe holding off on getting married until

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.460
after she had finished medical school, because I wouldn't want anything to get in the way

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.460
of that.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:07:01.040
And that was three years away, so I slap my hand down on the table, I was like, listen,

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
back off.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040
I don't, this part of the story-

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040
I don't remember that part.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.400
I said, back off.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.680
I think it's getting fictitious.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.040
And then your nine foot tall father-in-law stood over you.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:17.780
Even if your father-in-law was not a nine foot tall, I would say Conan-esque figure,

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:24.520
you would still probably not have the gumption, the vim to pull that maneuver off.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.960
No, I just said, I'll think about it.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.120
No one's ever brought it up again.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.760
And then you got married six months later.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.760
Yeah.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.760
I got married six months later.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.760
That was my play there.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.760
I worked out pretty good.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.080
Didn't send him an invitation to the wedding until the day before.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.080
Yeah.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.080
He just didn't bring it up again.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.080
So I was like, well, I guess this is cool.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.240
I guess we're cool.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.040
Now to be fair, you really did tie Sydney down while she was in med school.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.040
Are you kidding me?

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.040
I-

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.640
You burned all her books.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640
The crazy thing about-

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640
You wouldn't let her go to class.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.760
The crazy thing about his assertion is that I would ever do anything to get away of me

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760
making that money.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760
I know.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.760
I gotta get paid.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:03.760
But, Travis, yours, I imagine, was much smoother.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:10.840
Well, I mean, it was in the fact that we took them out to dinner in Dayton, so they didn't

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.120
have to drive down to Cincinnati or anything.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.120
But-

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.640
Can you drive down to Cincy on your lunch break?

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.640
My plan originally was when Teresa gets up from the table, use the bathroom or something,

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.400
or she goes away to check on whatever, I'll do it.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.880
And I told Teresa that at about 10 minutes in, 15 minutes in, she's like, well, I'll

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880
be right back.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.960
And I stood up with her and walked over and was like, I'm not gonna do it until you come

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960
back.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960
I can't do this without you there.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.000
She was like, oh, okay, cool.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.360
So I made her sit at the table while I asked her parents.

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.760
Pushed your courage to the sticking point, Travis.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.680
I didn't at all.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.560
I was so freaked out in that moment.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:54.440
Travis, I would like to formally request that you start referring to me as King Nuggets.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.920
The King of Having Nuggets, that is the full title.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.920
The thing is-

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.360
Let me just hear it once and kind of try it on for his eyes.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.080
So here's the thing, King Nuggets.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.920
Now, Travis, who is it that she doesn't have to impress?

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920
It's you.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.480
No, and then who is that again?

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480
You King Nugget.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.480
Thank you.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480
Thank you.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.480
It's King Nuggets.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480
King Nuggets.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:20.480
King Nuggets.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480
Nugget is adorable.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.360
King Nuggets is his honorable and most venerable nugs.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.720
Lord High Nugs of Nuggington.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:38.280
King Nuggets sounds like who Mayor McCheese had to overthrow to instill democracy in McDonaldland.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.760
My liege, there's been an uprising.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.760
The fry kids are revolting.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:52.080
Turn the vats of honey mustard.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.920
Take my child McRib and get him out of here, whisk him to safety, return only when there

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920
is calm.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.000
And even then, momentarily-

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Bring me the head of Grimace.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.600
No, my lord, we don't know where the head starts, it just kind of slopes, having a hard

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.720
time figuring this out.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.280
Let's find a thick part of the gradient.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:25.320
Someone bring me Lord High Chester McPizza, he's been gone from our kingdom.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:31.360
Advisor fajita, you've served me well these many years, now I must send you away to Toggle

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.440
Bell safety.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.240
My liege, here comes Kid Vib the Kingslayer.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:47.720
He's riding wheels like a beautiful chariot.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.160
The kids club always pays their debts.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.440
Oh, Christ.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:02.200
Oh, the kids club does always pay their debts.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:09.600
You could, I don't see why, um, I don't see why the horse can't be dressed like something

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.320
that people dress like, I remember one time a costume that I thought was pretty good was

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.120
I saw a guy dressed as Judge Lanzito.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.520
So you want to dress a horse like Judge Lanzito?

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.660
From the OJ Simpson trial, I thought that was a pretty good costume.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:31.080
So you could just dress the horse like, what's something people dress up like now?

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.800
Probably Dog the Bounty Hunter.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.800
Uh huh.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.880
Oh my god, Horse the Dog the Bounty Hunter?

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.720
What if I do?

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:45.640
What if you dressed as a hunter and you dressed your horse as like a wall-mounted head, like

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.600
you had to put something around his neck so it looked like his head was mounted on a wall?

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.600
That's not macabre.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.040
Yeah, and you have to put the rest of him in a wall.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.320
But then it's like pretty good.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.720
You put him in a box.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.160
Just stand still, horse.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:04.200
I think that would be a pretty good, make it something like a plaque out of cardboard

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.920
and then just put, what about a zebra?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.480
I mean, I feel like zebra's right there.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.480
I know.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480
That's like a minstrel show for horses.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.480
Oh my god.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480
What?

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480
What?

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.480
Come on, you guys.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480
Come on.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.480
Did you see what Daniel was wearing?

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.840
I couldn't believe it.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.080
It's so bold.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.040
Then two days later, you see Lady Gaga wearing the exact same thing.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.960
She's so edgy.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960
She's so edgy.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960
She's in zebra-face.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.120
It's unbelievable.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.040
She's in black and white and black and white and black and white and black face.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.040
Unbelievable.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.080
Didn't they make a movie about that called Bamzoozled?

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.080
Yeah.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
Oh.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080
What?

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080
Dang it.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.080
What?

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.080
There are 10 people out there that will laugh at that joke.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.080
No, there are.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.720
There are 10 people who will go, oh yeah, like bamboozled, and then they'll turn off

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.640
our show, and then they'll throw their computer away.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.640
Just so I can quantify, did you just say bamzoozled?

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640
Yeah.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.640
I did.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.640
Okay.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640
Okay.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.640
All right.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640
I think it's all right.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640
I think there's meat on them bones.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640
Thank you, Justin.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640
Thank you, Chaz.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.920
But why can't you just say like, we're having an evening, we're doing stuff, we're getting

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920
together.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.040
It's important to let people know what they're coming, like what they're coming into.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.040
Yeah.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.600
You want to establish the vibe, right?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.200
So what would you call it, Justin?

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200
I don't know.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200
I'm saying I don't have a good answer for it.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.520
I think we've got to use a totally gender-neutral word for like, if you're eating like nachos

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:37.400
and steak, then what if we just called that like, dump?

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.640
And it's like a very- We're taking a dump.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
No, no.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640
It doesn't have to be that.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.280
It's just a word that sounds like the thing that it is.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.080
It's dump night.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.040
Come on over for dump.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:57.000
And then if- Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, dump.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.840
Don't wear your fancy khakis.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.700
We're taking a dump.

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:06.600
I'm going to take that word back from the way that, honestly, the juvenile way that

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.400
you guys are using it.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.320
I'm going to open a fancy Chicago restaurant called Dump.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.120
Does it have like three E's in it?

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.480
No, it has one U with an umlaut.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.480
Dump.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.480
I just want- Come on down to dump.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.480
We got steak.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.480
We got stew?

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.480
We got steak.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480
Dump.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.000
We got steak at dump?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Capex?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.720
Oh, the walls are just lined with plasma screens showing the choices.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:49.680
We got all the freshest Angus sticks and all the choices cuts from Capex at dump.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.520
I need like cash, baked goods, some that I can-

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520
Some that I can-

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.520
Some that I can-

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.520
Something untraceable.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.680
Some that I can trade when the revolution comes.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.800
Some sky high stocks.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.560
Something I can barter with, you know?

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.420
Just something to get us out of the country.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.400
Give me some of that barter paper they call money.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.520
Do you guys want the Founding IHOO?

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.840
Yeah, please, God, save me from myself.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.520
This Founding IHOO was sent by Emily Wall.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.960
Oh, man, that's so good.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.480
The following 11 words, I feel like, summarize this human being more than any 11 words could

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.280
ever summarize any other human being.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:31.120
It's by Yahoo Answers user Trevor, who asks, is it possible for a ferret to hide a fushigi

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:51.880
ball?
