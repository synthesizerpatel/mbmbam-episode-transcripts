00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

00:15.920 --> 00:30.720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

00:30.720 --> 00:48.080
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

00:51.680 --> 00:58.960
I'm your babiest brother, Griffin McElroy. Whoa, seven hours now. Seven hours straight

00:58.960 --> 01:08.240
with nine quick time windows going simultaneously. It's Oscar watch 2015.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.880
All movie watch is what it is.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.960
We realized that it was time for Oscar watch, but we realized that we haven't watched

01:16.080 --> 01:20.000
any of the Oscar contenders, so I'm simultaneously watching all of them.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.840
I have duct taped together 45 mini televisions. I'm watching them all at the same time,

01:25.840 --> 01:29.280
but it's starting to bleed together. JK Simmons just showed up in Selma.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.000
Stephen Hawking and Alan Turing are fighting it out. I'm losing my mind.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.640
Here's what worries me. I want to watch Eddie Redmayne's performance. I want to watch that

01:38.640 --> 01:43.840
man do his acting and do it right. I want to watch Bimba Ditch Cumberbatch. I want to watch

01:43.840 --> 01:48.000
Bimba Ditch Cumberbatch do his acting on the screen. Here's the problem. I can't look away

01:48.000 --> 01:52.720
from Gone Girl because if I look away from Gone Girl, I might not see Ben Affleck's penis tip

01:52.720 --> 01:58.560
side, the side of his penis tip. You got that going for you. That was my longest run on sentence

01:58.560 --> 02:02.960
in my Bim Bam history, and I've had some goddamn long ones. You just got the Oscar.

02:03.920 --> 02:10.000
It just happened. I fucking stopped for like a second to record the intro to this podcast,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.240
and I missed the goddamn side of his penis tip. It's like that flower in the Dennis the Menace

02:16.240 --> 02:23.600
movie. Remember? Yeah. It's just like Ben Affleck's penis. You remember when Mr. Wilson was waiting

02:23.600 --> 02:28.000
to see the flower? Remember? Yeah. Well, I've got that one queued up, but the window's a little

02:28.000 --> 02:33.360
bit smaller because I had to prioritize my movie windows, and Gone Girl got, let's call it, the

02:33.360 --> 02:37.840
star treatment. I think this year they're giving the lifetime achievement award to the Dennis the

02:37.840 --> 02:47.440
Menace movie. Yeah. Movies. There's several. The film series. Yeah. I feel like we're crazy behind

02:49.120 --> 02:55.360
on all of our Oscar contenders. Well, yeah. The only one that I really saw was Selma,

02:55.360 --> 02:59.760
and then they just went ahead and just didn't nominate that for a goddamn thing.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.600
Yeah. And you thought you were getting out in front of it, right? I thought I was getting out.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.040
Everybody was like, yeah, I see that movie. It'll wreck your shit, and it's going to win

03:07.040 --> 03:10.160
all the Oscars. You're going to be like, told you so at the parties, because that's the only reason

03:10.160 --> 03:15.040
anybody goes to these fucking things. That's the only reason people see movies. Right. I would

03:15.040 --> 03:21.360
rather go out, and I'd rather watch a Nicholas Cage film, for instance. You know that's not

03:21.360 --> 03:25.760
going to get nominated, but you got to watch a Nicholas Cage film every month just to get your

03:25.760 --> 03:29.200
mind right. I would much rather be doing that. Instead, I got to go watch the goddamn imitation

03:29.200 --> 03:34.960
games. But I do love, thank you, Oscars, for throwing in random curveballs like, oh yeah,

03:34.960 --> 03:39.440
you can watch Selma, you can watch Theory of Everything. Also, X-Men Days of Future

03:39.440 --> 03:44.480
Passes up in there. And you're like, what? Oh, you're so cool, Oscars. I thought it was nice

03:44.480 --> 03:50.720
that they gave a future Oscar to Paul Blart, too. Yeah. Just Oscar for next year, Paul Blart.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.880
Next year Oscar, they have a most promising category. It's made out of just popsicle

03:56.880 --> 04:02.160
sticks and paste, and it just says, you wanted the best Oscars. It's most improved.

04:02.160 --> 04:09.200
Most improved Blart. Blartiest Picture 2015. Best Blart sequel.

04:11.840 --> 04:16.640
Best Blart editing. I thought it was a little contentious when they gave that award to Hitch

04:16.640 --> 04:25.200
in 2008. That was Best Blart prequel. Welcome to the Osc Blarts, where we honor achievements

04:25.200 --> 04:33.920
in Blart-related filmmaking. The Oscar for Blart design went to someone in an earlier procedure.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.160
I looked into the soul of Blart, and I thought, how can I perfect him?

04:40.160 --> 04:45.600
I just want to thank my Blart and my two Blarts. I couldn't have done this without my Blart. You

04:45.600 --> 04:51.200
know who you are. The original costume design for Blart included long pants,

04:51.200 --> 04:57.200
and I said it would be funnier if they were shorts. I'm Werner Herzog.

04:58.640 --> 05:05.280
Right. Yeah. Again, he got shafted. Did you notice that Paul Blart didn't get any

05:05.280 --> 05:09.200
Oscar nominations again this year? Not even Best Sound Editing.

05:09.200 --> 05:15.840
They couldn't not give one to the dude who played Martin Luther King in Selma. Hi,

05:15.840 --> 05:21.760
the hardest film role in the history of celluloid. Couldn't not nominate him, but also

05:22.320 --> 05:28.800
nominate Kevin James. They can't do that because we would burn the whole world down if that happened.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.000
He was out to play Martin Luther King and lost it at the last second.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Because he couldn't get out of the Blart 2 contract.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.800
This is my brother and my brother May. As we said, it's an advice show.

05:38.800 --> 05:47.920
We take your questions, turn them alchemy-like into wisdom. We are not experts per se,

05:47.920 --> 05:51.360
but you know, we do our best and we try to have a little fun along the way.

05:51.360 --> 05:59.360
I recently started working in a movie theater. How many is too many cardboard standees to take

05:59.360 --> 06:04.320
home and display in my house? Now, this is a fun question because think about it.

06:04.320 --> 06:14.320
There is, if you have one, that's funny. That's unique. Where did you get this standup of the

06:14.320 --> 06:22.480
rock from the rundown? Well, I used to work in a movie theater. Cool. If you have 1,000 in your

06:22.480 --> 06:28.000
home and people walk in, it looks like a shitty Madame Tussauds.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.440
And it looks like that scene in Home Alone, where Kevin McAllister is trying to make the

06:33.440 --> 06:36.720
Wet Bandits think that there's a huge party going on.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.160
Except you glued the face of your ex-girlfriend onto all of them.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.520
Onto all of them. Onto Rock's beautiful body. There's definitely a problem there if you have

06:45.520 --> 06:52.320
1,000. So somewhere between a 1 and a 1,000, there's a number. I think it's 2.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.440
If you have 2, you may as well have 1,000.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.760
But if you have 1, aren't you afraid of it looking like you're just a bit,

07:01.760 --> 07:07.600
like you got to be really picky about that one or else it looks like you're like a huge fan of

07:08.400 --> 07:10.560
fill-in-the-blank shitty movie, you know what I mean?

07:10.560 --> 07:15.680
Where it's like, oh, you took home a standup from Journey to the Center of the Earth to

07:15.680 --> 07:20.320
the Fantastical Island or whatever it's called. It's like, oh, did you like that movie?

07:20.320 --> 07:23.840
And it's like, no, it was just funny because it was just the last one I grabbed.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.680
I do like Brendan Fraser.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.320
He's not in that movie, sadly.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.640
The Rock, Dwayne Johnson replaces Brendan Fraser, bringing that Dwayne Johnson heat.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.120
Man, The Rock really stepped in for Brendan Fraser in quite a few films, huh?

07:37.120 --> 07:43.280
Now that I think about it, between Journey 2 and The Scorpion King.

07:44.960 --> 07:50.480
For a while, Brendan Fraser was his stunt double and then they switched and they just take turns.

07:50.480 --> 07:58.240
They look so similar. They both clap and laugh like children seeing a rainbow.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.280
For the first time.

07:59.280 --> 08:05.520
I would argue that if you had a thousand, it's almost okay if you do it like this is my collect-

08:05.520 --> 08:09.440
like this, you know, some people have like matchbooks from places they've been.

08:09.440 --> 08:14.960
Some people have shot glasses. I collect weird cardboard standups.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.080
My family. Let's just call it what it is, my family.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.440
This is my cardboard family.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.200
I remember at the movie theater that I worked at and Travis worked at for a while,

08:23.200 --> 08:27.040
our manager who took no guff. I will say that about her.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.600
If you had any guff, she would not receive it.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.680
She would not sign for it.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.040
She would not allow it.

08:33.760 --> 08:38.000
She wouldn't let people take those standees home because there were so many people working there.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.920
Everyone wanted that Journey 2 standee.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.080
So she would just destroy them.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.040
And it was very, it was very, very King Solomon.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.960
It was a very wisdom of Solomon decision.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.400
Like nobody can have The Rock.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.520
You must destroy The Rock.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.960
And it's like, I don't want to destroy The Rock.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.280
And then she'd be like, then you get to keep them.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.520
Then she wouldn't say that you stare her in the eye the entire time

08:57.520 --> 08:59.520
that she was burning them to the ground.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.920
Sometimes if you go to the movies late, you see people leaving with a giant bag of popcorn.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.040
Oh, that was my jam.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.000
I lived around the corner in the West Virginia building.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.720
I lived around the corner from the movie theater I worked at.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.200
And I would take home a giant garbage bag.

09:13.200 --> 09:13.920
Let's call it what it is.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.320
Cause it was a garbage bag that we'd fill with all the popcorn.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.920
I feel like I've talked about this on this show before.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.760
It's very contextual, isn't it?

09:19.760 --> 09:24.400
Like if you take that bag, does it choose your adventure?

09:24.400 --> 09:28.160
If you take that bag to the trash, it was a trash bag the whole time.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.000
You were throwing away all popcorn.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.160
If you take that to your apartment, you're suddenly a popcorn Santa Claus.

09:34.160 --> 09:34.400
Right.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.360
And I very much was.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.760
Yeah, it was a conveyance.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.720
It was not a trash bag.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.320
We would find fun ways to elevate the flavor of our garbage corn.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.760
Like splooching out an entire bottle of Nutella in there, shaking it all up.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.520
And all of a sudden you've got a fun cocoa mess.

09:51.680 --> 09:57.200
Oh, by the way, we were also a super duper, super duper, duper, triple mega, super duper high.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.480
It's also great because it doubles as a snack bag and also a bean bag.

10:03.040 --> 10:03.520
A bean bag.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.800
You eat your chocolate mess out from under between your legs.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.720
But it's not an issue.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.520
You're on the ground.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.720
You ate too much.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.840
Why are you so high?

10:11.840 --> 10:12.560
Holy shit.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.440
You're failing college.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.360
You lost two scholarships, Griffin.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.880
Past Griffin.

10:16.880 --> 10:17.760
Two of them.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.360
You don't need either of those scholarships, huh?

10:19.360 --> 10:19.920
Okay.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.720
Enjoy yourself.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.800
When you worked at Blockbuster, you would get to like take home posters, right?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.920
I mean, I wouldn't, but I could.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.280
Among other things.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.680
Yeah, among other items.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.320
At all.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.760
How many posters would you say it's okay?

10:35.760 --> 10:37.360
Because I think they take up less room.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.040
You could hypothetically put them on walls.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.400
Like, are posters a better alternative to cardboard standups?

10:44.400 --> 10:48.640
I mean, spatially speaking, in the spatial like material.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.960
Yeah, that's like in the third dimension.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.240
That's like how space works.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.400
Yeah, I think that they're there.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.960
But then it's like that whole thing.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.640
No one's ever, the problem with posters is no one's ever actually hung up a poster.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.520
Every poster in the world is just rolled up with a rubber band around it, leaning against a wall.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.120
With a poster that says to do.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.480
To do.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.760
To hang this up.

11:09.760 --> 11:15.440
And you look at it every day for years, in my case, for some posters.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.520
I'm gonna put that up as a pet detective.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.000
Someday.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.480
Someday.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.560
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

11:21.200 --> 11:21.600
Of course.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.120
This Yahoo was sent in by Andrea Ortu.

11:25.120 --> 11:25.760
Thank you.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.400
Ooh.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.960
No, it's just one in, it's O-R-T-U is the last name.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.600
I realized saying that out loud, phonetically.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
One or two Andreas sent this in.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.360
Thank you, Andrea.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.440
It's the suspended user.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.040
They don't exist anymore.

11:39.040 --> 11:39.600
They died.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.200
Oh no.

11:41.200 --> 11:47.360
This dead person asked, should they include animals in the Academy Awards?

11:47.360 --> 11:47.680
Ooh.

11:48.240 --> 11:54.160
Why aren't they nominating dogs, cats, birds, or horses actors that have been in movies?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.880
I think they should add animals in the Academy Award.

11:56.880 --> 12:01.600
I know some that act better than some of these so-called human actors.

12:01.600 --> 12:10.800
So wait, by so-called human actors, is the shitty quotation marks there going,

12:10.800 --> 12:15.200
is the sark mark going on actors or human?

12:15.200 --> 12:15.520
Human.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.280
This supposedly human Bradley Cooper.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.480
Ugh, Salarian.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.840
Can I tell you, Griffin?

12:23.840 --> 12:24.400
Yep.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.320
I kinda see where they're coming from.

12:26.320 --> 12:26.960
Yeah, for sure.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.160
Okay.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.800
I wasn't sure where we were all gonna land on that.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.400
No, I think absolutely.

12:32.400 --> 12:38.000
The best performance I saw in 1993 wasn't Shawshank, wasn't Shawshank.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.240
I'm sorry.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.760
There are a lot of good performances in there.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.920
Nothing quite as great as Dunstan.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.440
Well, I'm sorry.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.480
We give them to animated and they're not even real.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.760
And they're not even real.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.880
And a lot of those animated feature films feature exclusively animals.

12:52.880 --> 12:53.120
Yeah.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.920
Like Cat Story.

12:55.920 --> 13:01.120
The Chihuahua from Beverly Hills Chihuahua died to bring you that movie.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.200
Separate Chihuahuas.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.280
They sneak that in in the closing credits very quickly where it's like,

13:07.280 --> 13:09.120
oh, like three or four Chihuahuas died making this.

13:09.120 --> 13:09.440
Sorry.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.280
George Lopez has to strangle a Chihuahua just to get it going in the morning.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.680
Really looking forward to getting that Oscar to make it all worth it.

13:15.680 --> 13:16.000
Right.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.480
What's that?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.200
The In Memoriam section, if they allowed animals in,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.840
the In Memoriam section of the Oscars,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.080
any year that a Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie came out,

13:26.080 --> 13:28.560
would be extremely, extremely long.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.680
It would be Mr.

13:29.680 --> 13:33.040
Snuggleworth died, of course, at the hands of George Lopez.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.360
This is really Chihuahua heavy again.

13:35.360 --> 13:35.760
Yeah.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.680
Well, we got-

13:37.680 --> 13:39.680
After a while, they don't even give them names.

13:39.680 --> 13:39.920
No.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.640
It's just like CH1734.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.840
This Chihuahua is bred specifically to be killed.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.960
Go to YGeorgeY.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.760
Until the Chihuahua like Messiah appears and he's finally able to

13:53.760 --> 13:54.800
stop George Lopez.

13:54.800 --> 13:58.480
George Lopez, let my people go from the net.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.520
Because you're choking them.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.360
You're choking them to death.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.320
George G.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.160
Lo, stop it.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.800
I'm just saying, I think it was, yeah, in Cincinnati,

14:08.800 --> 14:12.960
the local theater awards started giving out awards for best

14:12.960 --> 14:14.480
animal performance in a year.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.560
And it was a hotly contested category.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.800
I'm saying there was a lot of heat being brought to it.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.560
My boy Mignon at Cincinnati Shakespeare Company took it and

14:24.560 --> 14:25.360
he deserved it.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.800
And I don't care what the haters say.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.160
What type of animal is that?

14:28.160 --> 14:30.720
He was a little poodle and he was adorable.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.200
Okay.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.000
He was a solid actor with really great comic timing.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.400
Let's talk about the issues though that are going to pop up

14:36.400 --> 14:38.080
from Animal Academy Awards.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.400
Any year with a Dunstan in it or a monkey trouble or any which

14:42.400 --> 14:46.080
way but loose, I think a monkey is going to just like fucking

14:46.080 --> 14:47.120
run the table.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.160
A monkey is the biopic of animals.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.800
Where it's like, oh, it's going to be so much easier to vote

14:52.800 --> 14:54.160
for that because it's a real person.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.240
Just like it's so much easier to vote for a monkey because

14:56.960 --> 14:57.760
I'm saying, right.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.960
They make a heart rending biopic of like, right?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.320
And it's incredible.

15:04.320 --> 15:04.880
It's really good.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.880
Bimba to Cumberbatch will probably be up in that one too.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.600
But then they make Dunstan checks in again.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.880
And I think Dunstan continues to check in.

15:12.880 --> 15:13.040
Right.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.400
I'm saying any time there's a monkey in the mix.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.280
Duncan has a credit card trouble and has to check in again.

15:17.280 --> 15:17.680
Right.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.120
It's going to be Air Bud 19.

15:21.120 --> 15:21.360
Okay.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.400
Yeah, it would have been a serious contender if it hadn't

15:24.400 --> 15:27.440
been for Dunstan won't stop checking into this goddamn

15:27.440 --> 15:27.840
hotel.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.480
Please ask Dunstan to start checking in.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.040
Starring a bedraggled Jason Alexander.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.560
He's honestly just glad for the work.

15:36.560 --> 15:36.880
Right.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.520
Now, what if he can say he wants something he can put on his

15:41.520 --> 15:45.600
CV where he says he was in an Oscar award winning film.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.320
Thanks, Dunstan.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.600
Now, what if you did like an all puppy godfather?

15:51.840 --> 15:53.440
Is that too pandering?

15:53.440 --> 15:54.240
It would be great.

15:54.240 --> 15:59.120
Except the lawyer or whatever is going to be played by a

15:59.120 --> 15:59.760
monkey, of course.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.600
And he's going to steal the spotlight.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.120
I'm saying it's going to be unfair.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.720
We would almost need a best monkey acting category and then

16:06.720 --> 16:08.240
best all other animals.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.600
I will say if there could be a scene of a monkey lawyer giving

16:11.600 --> 16:14.560
advice to a puppy mobster, they might as well just have all

16:14.560 --> 16:15.280
the Oscars.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.360
Yeah, just take them all.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.800
Have all the Oscars.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.200
His George Clooney's Lifetime Achievement Award, whatever.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.840
Sandwich between two monkey awards.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.640
Yeah, that's the Oscar sandwich.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.880
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

16:28.880 --> 16:29.200
Yes.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.840
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.560
Are you Ira Ray?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.440
Who wants to know?

16:36.080 --> 16:36.800
Thank you, Ira Ray.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.240
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.280
They were suspended too.

16:39.280 --> 16:39.840
Jesus Christ.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.960
There was a great culling of the Yahoo Answers user base.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.480
Is Nickelodeon named after Nick Cannon?

16:48.480 --> 16:49.520
Settling a bet here.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.560
That's a cool bet.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.120
Just a question to settle a bet between an idiot and an

16:57.120 --> 16:58.080
intelligent person.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.760
Which one are you?

16:59.760 --> 17:02.400
Before I collect my cash, I just wanted to post this question

17:02.400 --> 17:04.880
so the loser realizes how idiotic he looks.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.200
Thanks.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.640
And first round's on me.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.120
Update.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.480
Easiest money ever made.

17:08.480 --> 17:13.360
So I guess they're saying they were on the non Nick Cannon

17:13.360 --> 17:16.640
creationist belief set.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.600
Now hold on.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.080
I think we've all been in a position where we've drank a

17:20.080 --> 17:21.280
little bit too much.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.480
We said a thing and then someone called us on it and we

17:24.480 --> 17:26.640
just instead of going, oh yeah, you're right.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.520
I'm an idiot.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.320
We just like dug our teeth in and we're like, no, you know

17:30.320 --> 17:30.880
what?

17:30.880 --> 17:33.440
This is the battleground I choose for the evening.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.600
So I think this is actually going to make this question in

17:35.600 --> 17:38.080
the discussion around a lot more interesting is not a lot

17:38.080 --> 17:38.720
of people know this.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.040
Nick Cannon is not his actual name because that's like a

17:41.040 --> 17:41.920
crazy name.

17:41.920 --> 17:46.720
His real actual Christian name is Nick Cannon Lodeon.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.680
I'm not even sure that's true.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.840
It's I'm looking at his IMDB page right now and it's Nick

17:53.840 --> 17:54.640
Cannon Lodeon.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.280
And when him and Mariah Carey together, it was Mariah Carey

17:57.280 --> 17:58.000
Cannon Lodeon.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.480
So Nickelodeon was founded.

18:02.480 --> 18:02.800
What?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.440
And like 1983.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.480
Did you just look that up?

18:07.040 --> 18:09.680
No, I would say maybe late eighties.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.040
Okay.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.000
That's incorrect.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.120
Can I say you guys, if before you guys said 83, I would have

18:15.120 --> 18:16.560
guessed so much earlier.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.600
Just not thinking about it.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.160
Just thinking like TV stations have been around for a while.

18:20.160 --> 18:20.960
I don't know.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.040
71, 62.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.640
You could have told me any of these and I would have

18:24.640 --> 18:25.200
believed it.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.240
Okay.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.720
79.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.600
Jesus Christ.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.400
Really?

18:30.400 --> 18:31.520
As Nickelodeon.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.880
And originally the network was called Pinwheel and it launched

18:34.880 --> 18:35.520
in 77.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.240
And then Nick Cannon Lodeon came around and they're like, hey,

18:38.240 --> 18:39.280
that's a cool name.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.120
Let's call our station Nick Cannon Lodeon.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.560
And somebody was like, you know what that sounds like?

18:44.160 --> 18:45.040
Doesn't sound like anything.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.880
It's a crazy, crazy name.

18:48.720 --> 18:55.760
Is it possible that they foresaw the coming of the once in

18:55.760 --> 18:57.600
future King Nick Cannon Lodeon?

18:58.880 --> 19:01.440
There will be born unto us.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.840
There will be much wilden out.

19:03.840 --> 19:09.280
What would you do when Nick Cannon Lodeon comes?

19:09.280 --> 19:12.720
I have glanced into the obsidian sphere and a vision has

19:12.720 --> 19:15.200
come to me of so much wilden.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.880
The anti Nick Cannon Lodeon will say you can't do that on

19:18.880 --> 19:19.520
television.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.680
You must not wild.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.640
Wilding is prohibited.

19:24.640 --> 19:24.960
Sorry.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.520
Wilden.

19:26.080 --> 19:31.440
And we will welcome all the wild crazy kids to our bosom.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.560
Holy shit.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.160
It goes so deep.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.720
Brothers and sisters climb that radical rock.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.400
Guided by the Cannon Lodeon and his brilliance.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.560
Wait at the pearly gates as Moe checks the leaderboard.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.200
I can't.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.000
Do not believe in false Moes.

19:55.840 --> 20:00.400
I never even considered wild and crazy kids as the goddamn

20:00.400 --> 20:02.640
natural predecessor to wilden out.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.080
The kids are grown up.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.080
And now we turn to the chapter of Clarissa so that she might

20:10.080 --> 20:10.960
explain it all.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.200
Clarissa was a prophet.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.640
And I will send her before me and her friend Sam with his

20:18.640 --> 20:19.360
latter.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.080
Cast out the Ferguson's from our flock.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.840
You shall you shall know them from their crimson mane and

20:27.840 --> 20:31.280
many freckles.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.600
Take the most precious of your flock and make a sacrifice of

20:35.600 --> 20:38.480
them at the shrine of the silver monkey.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.240
Oh, man.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.480
Oh, Jesus.

20:43.120 --> 20:43.440
Nope.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.480
Not him.

20:44.480 --> 20:44.960
Nope.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.080
Sorry wrong guy.

20:46.080 --> 20:46.960
Nick Cannon Lodeon.

20:49.680 --> 20:50.560
There is no Jesus.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.760
There's only the tomorrow people.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.720
There are Lord and saviors.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.080
Well, that's enough.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.440
It probably Michael Malley, right?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.760
That's yeah.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.160
Who would be the head of the Nick Cannon Lodeon?

21:04.160 --> 21:06.960
So Nick Cannon Lodeon, Nick Cannon Lodeon would be the

21:06.960 --> 21:07.920
deity, right?

21:07.920 --> 21:10.320
Well, Mark Summers, I think probably lost his way a little

21:10.320 --> 21:11.040
bit.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.000
Oh, I think he's probably been excommunicated.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.640
And that's why he's now now he lives on the Food Network

21:16.640 --> 21:18.720
trying to raise basically what is a cult.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.200
I was once in a pub for a meetup and I ordered a

21:21.200 --> 21:22.240
cheeseburger.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.960
The server brought me a salmon burger instead and I just ate

21:24.960 --> 21:27.760
it instead of protesting as I felt too awkward in the moment.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.640
I actually thought I might have just forgot what I ordered

21:30.640 --> 21:31.520
about 20 minutes later.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.680
I see the same server walking around the room with a

21:33.680 --> 21:36.640
cheeseburger looking confused later that evening.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.720
They must have figured out the screw up and approached me

21:38.720 --> 21:41.120
demanding that I pay for both meals.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.440
I ordered one meal and I ate one meal.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.160
Sir refused to pay for both and was told to leave.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.120
What the fuck?

21:47.840 --> 21:51.360
Was I in the right or at least less in the wrong than the

21:51.360 --> 21:51.760
pub?

21:51.760 --> 21:53.840
And do you think it is safe to go back now?

21:53.840 --> 21:54.880
That's from Gmail.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.120
I would never go back again.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.200
No, it sounds like a terrible place.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.480
It sounds like it's crazy.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.120
Come on down to Toby's double burger.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.320
We're going to fuck up.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.800
But you've got to pay for both because that's how we do now.

22:06.800 --> 22:12.960
Okay, before we get too into it, I will say to not to put you

22:12.960 --> 22:14.240
completely in the right.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.880
You probably should have said something when your burger came

22:18.880 --> 22:22.080
from not only a different animal, but a completely different

22:22.080 --> 22:26.480
like that a version to confrontation is pathological

22:26.480 --> 22:30.080
enough that they probably suspected something nefarious

22:30.080 --> 22:32.240
was great in addition to that.

22:32.240 --> 22:32.720
Wait a minute.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.840
So he just did it.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.800
He just ate it.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.840
That doesn't make any sense.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.520
He didn't say anything.

22:37.520 --> 22:41.680
He literally you literally ate the opposite me.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.240
It's the opposite me.

22:44.240 --> 22:47.360
Here's the spectrum of meat and beef is on one end and

22:47.360 --> 22:48.720
salmon's on the other.

22:48.720 --> 22:52.320
There's no how goddamn delicious must that salmon burger

22:52.320 --> 22:55.920
have been that it completely removed you from your senses.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.000
Also question asker in the future.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.880
Don't convince yourself that maybe this is what I ordered.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.000
That's very sad to me.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.760
The scam they're running.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.360
That's a psychic scam.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.880
They're running on themselves.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.160
They took one bite of that.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.720
The first thought was this isn't what I ordered.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.640
And then it was so succulent.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.000
They thought, well, I'm salmon.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.320
Maybe I did the beef of the sea.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.600
Knowing me, I always pick the best thing at a restaurant.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.200
I'm sure I've ordered this.

23:23.200 --> 23:23.440
Okay.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.080
Now to jump back to the restaurant being the worst,

23:26.080 --> 23:30.080
the sheer balls of the restaurant to say like,

23:30.080 --> 23:33.200
hey, we brought you the wrong thing, but fuck you.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.880
But you shouldn't.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.360
Okay.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.800
I got to say my position's changing a little bit because

23:38.800 --> 23:40.960
you should not have eaten that burger, sir.

23:42.000 --> 23:42.160
Yeah.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.520
But he didn't walk up to the counter and grab it and say,

23:45.520 --> 23:47.120
this is probably mine.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.800
It was handed to him.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.680
But okay.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.080
But to Griffin's point, he should think about the onion a little bit.

23:54.080 --> 23:59.360
He got the wrong thing, ate it, and then carried his trash around

23:59.360 --> 24:02.560
the restaurant and didn't even give her a flag down.

24:03.200 --> 24:07.440
I think that maybe as a result of his carelessness,

24:07.440 --> 24:08.800
they did waste a meal.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.640
Okay, Toby's Double Burger is not made of burgers.

24:12.640 --> 24:16.320
They serve them, but the building itself needs money

24:16.320 --> 24:19.200
and concrete, but to put it in a different context, right?

24:19.200 --> 24:21.280
Say he orders a cheeseburger, right?

24:21.280 --> 24:23.200
They bring out a burger, no cheese.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.000
Hey Travis, that is the biggest false equivalent.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
We've had some doozers in the false equivalence category on this show.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.120
That's the biggest one.

24:31.120 --> 24:31.360
Yeah.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.680
It's like a cheeseburger, but without cheese or meat.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.360
And also fish is in it.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.840
No, I'm just saying that like the idea of like,

24:37.840 --> 24:38.640
where does it end?

24:38.640 --> 24:41.440
Cause they bring out that burger and then they bring out another burger

24:41.440 --> 24:43.040
and it's like, oh, that one was supposed to be mine,

24:43.040 --> 24:44.000
but they brought me this one.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.080
They're not going to ask for your money in that way.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.800
Is it just because it was the complete wrong protein

24:48.800 --> 24:50.400
that it's like, oh, you fucked up so bad?

24:50.400 --> 24:54.320
If these motherfuckers brought him a basket of boneless chicken wings

24:54.320 --> 24:56.800
instead of his burger and he eats all the chicken wings and said,

24:56.800 --> 25:00.000
oops, didn't even realize it's a whole different food kingdom,

25:00.000 --> 25:01.760
but those are free now because they're in me.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.480
That's kind of busted, I think.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.400
All you had to say is, what chicken wings?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.800
And a perfect crime.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.080
Prove it.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.360
Well, you're a sloppy boy.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.040
You're a sloppy boy.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.480
You got burn mouth.

25:15.120 --> 25:15.680
What face?

25:18.080 --> 25:18.880
Yep, sorry.

25:18.880 --> 25:19.360
Sorry guys.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.400
I'm about as consumer friendly as a fellow gets.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.640
I'm a pretty big consumer advocate.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.560
Don't eat the whole goddamn wrong burger

25:26.560 --> 25:28.080
cause that was somebody else's burger.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.520
You did the savory is what you did.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.840
Yeah, it should have been at most one bite.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.760
Were you like, pardon?

25:33.760 --> 25:36.240
Or no bites because nobody's going to eat.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.280
They're going to throw that burger away if you take a bite out of it.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.240
That's straight up what it is.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.400
You can't take that off your table and give it to somebody else.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.600
That's no.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.800
That's how trash people live.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.480
The real villain in this situation is whoever you are with.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.440
Salmon.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.240
Salmon.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.360
But it's whoever you are with because it's their job to say,

25:53.360 --> 25:55.600
excuse me, my friend ordered a cheeseburger.

25:55.600 --> 26:00.000
Cause they have to know that you were like so averse to confrontation

26:00.000 --> 26:01.520
that you would eat wrong food.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.000
It's like, hey, I need you to say something because I cannot.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh my God, wait, wait.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.520
Did this person just follow our advice from like,

26:11.520 --> 26:13.600
it was either last episode or a couple episodes ago

26:13.600 --> 26:15.120
where we said, if they bring you the wrong food,

26:15.680 --> 26:18.880
you should just eat it because you want to avoid the discomfort.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.440
Wait a minute.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.600
Going back on something we said, cause it was wrong.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.880
That doesn't sound like us.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.800
I didn't even consider the possibility that maybe

26:24.800 --> 26:27.120
it's somebody else's food and you just stole it from them.

26:27.120 --> 26:30.000
I want to double, triple, double back on this again

26:30.000 --> 26:32.880
and say that I've switched culpability in my mind

26:32.880 --> 26:35.600
from this person to the restaurant

26:35.600 --> 26:38.480
for offering something called a salmon burger.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.920
No, it's not.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.520
It's salmon on bread.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.560
Fuck you.

26:42.560 --> 26:46.000
A burger has beef and maybe ground turkey.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.680
I would hit you up there.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.640
A salmon burger is not a thing.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.400
That's like a wish broom.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.760
Like it doesn't make any sense.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.560
What?

26:54.560 --> 26:56.720
You know, like a wish broom.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.080
Like, okay, for what?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.600
Those two things don't go together.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.440
For sleeping out the old wishes.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.080
It's a dog.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.280
It's a dog tank.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.680
It's a tank that your dog lives in.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.760
These are, they're banana glasses.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.960
Glasses for a banana.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.440
Why would you even give a banana glass?

27:11.440 --> 27:12.720
That doesn't make any sense.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.720
That's about as stupid as a salmon burger.

27:14.720 --> 27:14.960
Yeah.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.080
Ugh.

27:16.080 --> 27:16.320
Yeah.

27:16.320 --> 27:16.880
Makes you mad.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.920
Anyway, let's get the money soon.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.960
This week, sponsored by salmon burgers.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.320
Have you always wanted to build an iPhone app?

27:34.320 --> 27:34.560
Yes.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.360
Is your idea the next Instagram or Snapchat?

27:37.360 --> 27:38.160
I like to think so.

27:38.160 --> 27:38.480
Yes.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.720
Do you want to learn Swift by Apple?

27:40.720 --> 27:40.960
Yes.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.520
One month iOS is an easy way to learn iOS development using Swift.

27:46.480 --> 27:52.160
Now let's say that maybe a listener doesn't know what any of that means.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.480
And you are going to explain to them.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.320
Not you.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.360
No, definitely not me.

27:57.360 --> 28:02.000
I'm a well-versed adult who definitely knows what Swift is.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.200
Yes.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.800
Swift is how you make apps.

28:04.800 --> 28:05.600
Okay.

28:05.600 --> 28:12.000
And one month is a, it's a new way of learning actual practical computer skills

28:12.560 --> 28:15.120
like programming in Swift.

28:15.120 --> 28:20.720
They also have one month HTML, one month rails, one month growth hacking.

28:20.720 --> 28:25.200
Now, surely this is going to take like just like a year, right?

28:25.200 --> 28:27.920
Like you go to college to learn a thing.

28:27.920 --> 28:28.400
What's wrong?

28:28.400 --> 28:30.160
It's literally called one month.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.360
I thought that was a clever name.

28:31.360 --> 28:37.840
30, 30 days, 30 days, 30 minutes per day, sometimes less.

28:38.480 --> 28:42.560
And you could just become fluid in an actual life skill.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.080
I did the one month HTML class and it was great.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.600
I made a great website.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.320
Is it justinmaccroy.net?

28:50.320 --> 28:51.520
You could just Google.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.800
Justin made Google.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.000
Google Junior for kids.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.600
They don't sell hover chairs like I'm sitting into just anybody,

28:59.600 --> 29:01.200
except I'm the founder of Google.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.080
Except if you are the founder of teen Google,

29:04.080 --> 29:05.920
you can sit in whatever kind of chair you want.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.920
Hey teens, good news.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.680
There's finally a Google for you.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.800
It's all boobs, not Justin.

29:12.800 --> 29:18.000
Travis, it would be, it would just be page after page explaining how to smoke.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.960
Now Justin, say I'm interested in joining,

29:20.960 --> 29:25.200
but I'm a little hesitant about paying full price the first time out.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.560
Is there anything you can do for me?

29:26.560 --> 29:31.280
Uh, yes, Travis, if you use our special coupon code,

29:31.280 --> 29:32.720
which is my brother.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.240
Not so much a coupon code.

29:34.240 --> 29:38.880
It's not a coupon code so much as I was trying to see if teengoogle.com is available.

29:38.880 --> 29:45.840
Go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.840
Onemonth.com slash my brother,

29:47.840 --> 29:51.840
and you're going to get 25% off for getting up in it.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.600
It's a one-time discount.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.000
You can get it at onemonth.com slash my brother.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.320
That's a, please just go get a life skill.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.840
It's a great website, great service, Justin.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.760
I do need to know if Teen Google is taken,

30:01.760 --> 30:03.440
and if you're going to buy it, and if it's going to read it.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.200
And if it's a weird porn site.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.560
Excuse me, time out.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.800
I just bought Teen Google.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.800
It's the best one yet.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.600
It's the best day of my life.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.400
We're going to be rich.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.880
I can't believe this.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.640
Oh man, we are going to make that,

30:20.640 --> 30:23.360
we are going to make that redirect to the Moo Boom Bam website for a long time

30:23.360 --> 30:26.000
until Google buys it from you for $55 million.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.280
We'll be rich.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.640
Oh my god, it's so worth it.

30:30.080 --> 30:30.800
How much was it?

30:31.680 --> 30:32.640
Cancel the show.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.360
I can't, I can't even deal with this show anymore.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.000
No, we're the owners of Teen Google, we're rich.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.760
How's the owner of Teen Google

30:40.400 --> 30:44.000
supposed to, supposed to worry about making a comedy podcast?

30:46.160 --> 30:47.520
We have another sponsor this week,

30:47.520 --> 30:49.200
and maybe you'll recognize the name,

30:49.200 --> 30:53.120
and maybe you'll respect the game of Nature Box.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.560
NatureBox.com, where you can get delicious and healthy snack options.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.040
They have over 100 nutritionist approved snacks.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.160
They got something for everyone, all with zero artificial flavors,

31:02.160 --> 31:04.800
colors, sweeteners, zero grams trans fats,

31:04.800 --> 31:06.720
and no high fructose corn syrup.

31:07.360 --> 31:07.920
Here's the thing.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.080
Sometimes you eat healthy snacks and you're like,

31:12.080 --> 31:13.200
oh, yeah, it's healthy.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.720
I'm going to power my way through it, I guess,

31:14.720 --> 31:16.400
because it's better than nothing.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.000
Nah, dude, nah.

31:18.000 --> 31:18.960
Nah, dude.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.400
Nah, nah, dude.

31:20.400 --> 31:24.400
You're listening to a Teen Google version of my bim bam.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.160
Extreme Teen Google.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.320
Justin, quick.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.440
Have you tried Teen Google?

31:31.440 --> 31:33.680
Well, it's time for Extreme Teen Google.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.640
I feel like in another browser window,

31:36.640 --> 31:39.920
I'm winning the lot, like I'm in the process of winning the lottery.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.160
I can't even focus on this show right now.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.000
I'm the owner of Teen Google.

31:44.000 --> 31:50.480
I'm doing jokes about ghosts and boners and shit

31:50.480 --> 31:55.600
when I'm the web domain raster of Teen Google.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.000
I can do anything with that URL.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.240
That's where the fucking music is,

32:00.240 --> 32:02.560
and you are all here for it to witness it.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.800
Do we need to pause the podcast so you can call Sydney

32:04.800 --> 32:08.400
and tell her about the amazing reversal of fortune you've experienced?

32:08.400 --> 32:11.600
I was sobbing, like, you'll never guess.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.800
It's all happened.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.320
You'll never guess, in six months,

32:14.320 --> 32:17.280
we're going to be in a protracted legal battle with Google.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.160
It's all we ever dreamed.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.320
It's everything we ever wanted.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.200
We're gonna get taken to the cleaners by Google.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.000
Oh, Christ.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.560
Okay, so it's time for you to try NatureBox for free.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.480
For free.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.080
Maybe you don't own Teen Google.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.880
Maybe you can't afford a free box this time.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.600
We get it.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.080
Not everyone's the owner of Teen Google.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.360
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother,

32:45.360 --> 32:49.200
and even non-Teen Google owners like you can try free snacks.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.640
Normies is what we call them.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.480
Just go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.280
Now, peasant.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.520
Brothers, please go to teengoogle.com.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.960
Oh, Christ, it looks good.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.160
Yeah, and there it is.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.800
It looks good in the search bar.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.280
That's a good looking URL.

33:09.280 --> 33:09.920
It looks exactly like what it is.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.640
What I need to do is I need, the problem is,

33:12.640 --> 33:15.840
I need to, I need to turn on masking.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.200
I need stealth redirection.

33:17.200 --> 33:17.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.840
Okay, well, what's the list so far?

33:21.840 --> 33:26.880
We got My Smooth Face, Teen Google, of course.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.120
I feel like you bought one very recently.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.360
Let me see what I have.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.600
It's bad that you, I think you have a compulsion

33:35.600 --> 33:36.640
because you own too many.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.400
I have booboo nanny.com.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.200
Booboo nanny.com.

33:39.200 --> 33:42.640
These all, these largely go to my brother, my brother and me.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.440
Booboo nanny.com, fartpatrol.com,

33:46.320 --> 33:48.880
griffinspacejam.com is a different website

33:48.880 --> 33:52.080
that we also own, but griffinspacejam.com,

33:53.520 --> 33:59.680
mysmoothface.com, and now welcome to the family.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.680
To the my brother, my brother and me family of products.

34:04.960 --> 34:09.040
If anybody ever says the words mbmbam.com to me again,

34:09.040 --> 34:11.280
I will spit in their face.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.040
It's not a website.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.960
That website does not even exist anymore.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.600
There is only teengoogle.com.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.520
We have a sponsor right here and it is Talking to Ghosts,

34:21.520 --> 34:24.640
which is a podcast done by Wesley Mueller and Michael Kurt,

34:25.440 --> 34:26.480
which is quote,

34:26.480 --> 34:29.920
the manifestation of their fascination with the dark arts,

34:29.920 --> 34:33.360
which makes it sound like a podcast for necromancers exclusively,

34:33.360 --> 34:38.240
but really it gets into the creative minds of artists, musicians,

34:38.240 --> 34:42.160
and other dark souls, my favorite gaming franchise,

34:42.160 --> 34:46.160
to see how they work and share fun stories about the oddities of life.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.920
It's a podcast that comes out on Mondays.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.280
You can find it on iTunes.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.400
If you go to talkingtoghosts.com slash mbmbam,

34:52.400 --> 34:58.320
you will find a landing page specifically tailored for my bim bam fans,

34:58.320 --> 35:04.400
and it includes a lovely graphic of a horse flying around in space.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.080
You can also just type talkingtoghosts.com into teengoogle

35:08.080 --> 35:09.040
and it'll take you there.

35:09.040 --> 35:09.920
It'll take you there.

35:09.920 --> 35:14.240
It'll be a more rad, more extreme version of Talking to Ghosts.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.440
So yeah, go check out their podcast, go to their website.

35:17.440 --> 35:22.240
They have a bi-weekly feature in which the host of the show

35:22.240 --> 35:24.880
talk about sweet music that they like listening to.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.520
Sweet music that they like listening to.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.760
So yeah, it covers all your bases.

35:30.560 --> 35:33.840
If you like music, if you like art, if you like podcasts,

35:33.840 --> 35:35.760
or if you like the Dark Souls video games.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.520
It's got everything.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.040
It's got just about everything.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.160
Got a message for Lindsay and Tom from Jace.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.160
Says, hey, you two.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.000
This may or may not reach you before your ceremony,

35:48.000 --> 35:49.040
but I miss you guys.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.480
And I miss Luigi and his horrible dog toots.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.280
I wish I could be there.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.680
He is Lindsay's little brother.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.520
I wish I could be there for your second special day,

35:57.520 --> 36:00.480
but since I can't drive safe, don't forget to berg it up.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.280
All my love from the frozen north, Jace.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.560
I just have to say ceremony is a very nonspecific,

36:09.280 --> 36:13.200
a very nonspecific thing to congratulate a person on.

36:13.200 --> 36:16.960
Wish I could be there before your sacrificial murder of Lindsay.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.240
But at the shrine of the silver monkey.

36:20.240 --> 36:29.280
Congratulations, Lindsay and Tom, for becoming fucking pagan elders or something.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.040
Whatever it is, I'm sure you worked hard to accomplish it.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.520
And Jace certainly recognizes that effort.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.000
And just a great job all around.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.280
Just make sure you wear the appropriate garb for whatever this-

36:41.280 --> 36:44.160
Which is cargo shorts, khaki cargo shorts.

36:44.720 --> 36:45.440
Under a robe.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.440
And make sure you got those-

36:47.440 --> 36:50.240
Make sure that says something funny that you ripped the robe open at the end.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.840
You're just like, I'm out, teach.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.600
Make sure you get the skateboard out of there.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.080
It's a picture of Spud McKenzie.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.040
Make sure you have at least two medallions of power,

36:59.040 --> 37:01.600
or else those goddamn temple guards are gonna fuck you right up.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.600
And don't forget to validate your parking.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.560
Yeah, it's super important.

37:06.880 --> 37:10.160
Do you think it's okay to finish someone else's food?

37:10.960 --> 37:13.280
Do you have a fight with your friend over whether or not

37:13.280 --> 37:17.360
he should wear his Philly's garb to a Colorado Rockies game?

37:17.360 --> 37:21.440
Does your wife want to keep a chamber pot in her art studio?

37:21.440 --> 37:24.880
If so, please do not write in to Judge John Hodgman.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.400
I heard all those cases already.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.000
Judge John Hodgman is the show where I, John Hodgman,

37:30.000 --> 37:34.480
adjudicate disputes between real people calling in over the internet

37:34.480 --> 37:38.320
and I tell them who is right and who is wrong over such important issues

37:38.320 --> 37:40.800
as is a machine gun a robot?

37:40.800 --> 37:45.120
And is it okay to go through the garbage at the Canadian House of Pizza and Garbage?

37:45.760 --> 37:49.680
Bailiff Jesse Thorne rounds out the cast for a fun-filled podcast

37:49.680 --> 37:52.960
of judgment and justice.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.040
Kind of two of the same thing, actually.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.480
Judge John Hodgman, take a listen if you do not mind.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.600
I order it.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.720
Come visit the courtroom.

38:00.720 --> 38:05.040
It is open to all and located at MaximumFun.org.

38:05.040 --> 38:14.640
Farm wisdom.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.600
Farm wisdom.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.080
Put your scarecrow in a barrel.

38:18.080 --> 38:18.960
Farm wisdom.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.160
To scare away the barrel crows.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.680
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.120
Do you want me to read the farm wisdom?

38:27.120 --> 38:28.160
Yes, please.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.360
Okay, because the last one I did like hurt me.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.480
No, this one will make you feel good about life.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.480
Okay, farm wisdom.

38:36.480 --> 38:42.240
Donkeys definitely hate dogs, but thoroughbreds, racehorses, love goats.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.440
Another false equivalency here on my brother, my brother, me.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.240
It is common practice to pair a goat with a skittish racehorse.

38:50.240 --> 38:56.640
It calms them down and they usually form lifelong friendships.

38:56.640 --> 38:57.760
And that's from Jesse.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.080
Here's the thing, you're gonna have-

39:00.080 --> 39:01.760
Jesse Disney.

39:01.760 --> 39:05.440
How is this not every Disney movie ever made?

39:05.440 --> 39:08.240
Well, how is this not every anime-

39:08.240 --> 39:11.440
Like Milo and Otis, I should say those two words

39:11.440 --> 39:15.120
and I should not have a cat and a pug enter my brain.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.680
It should definitely, definitely be a goat and a skittish racehorse.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.880
Well, goats are hard to market.

39:20.880 --> 39:26.000
Name me one film that prominently features a goat as the star of it.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.720
Adam Sandler record had a pretty great bit

39:30.720 --> 39:35.680
where this funny goat, remember what they superimposed?

39:35.680 --> 39:38.080
They have the funny goat bit from Adam Sandler's

39:38.080 --> 39:40.480
What the Hell Happened to Me comedy CD and album.

39:41.120 --> 39:41.440
NLP.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.560
Classic Disney movie.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.120
No, it's not Disney movie.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.560
Yeah, goats just aren't very sexy guys, sorry.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.120
They're like little horned horses with beards.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.080
I guess that's probably what makes the horse chill out

39:54.080 --> 39:57.440
is just by comparison, by comparing themselves to this little mutant.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.040
Okay, let me pitch this to you.

39:59.040 --> 39:59.760
You ready?

39:59.760 --> 40:01.040
Close your eyes.

40:01.040 --> 40:01.920
No, I need to look.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.920
It's the day of the big race, right?

40:03.920 --> 40:05.120
Oh, there's the shot.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.320
The horses go.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.520
Okay, but our hero horse, he's losing.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.880
He's way behind.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.040
It's like he's getting really downhearted, right?

40:13.040 --> 40:16.880
But then he looks over and there at the fence is his goat buddy

40:16.880 --> 40:19.600
who just nods to him and starts running along beside him.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.800
And then they start picking up speed and then the horse goes and he wins.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.520
And then he's getting like his ring of like flowers.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.840
And he's like, I couldn't have done it without my goat buddy.

40:27.840 --> 40:32.400
But goat buddy died like two weeks earlier and he was watching a ghost.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.400
A goatst.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.040
A goatst.

40:37.040 --> 40:37.680
That's bad.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.400
It's not good.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.440
Well, I mean, we'd have to punch it up with some dialogue

40:41.440 --> 40:43.040
and maybe like Jeff Bridges.

40:43.600 --> 40:43.840
Yeah.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.200
Can we get that?

40:45.920 --> 40:48.960
Who's the guy who played goat man on Saturday Night Live?

40:49.680 --> 40:50.480
James Brewer.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.120
Was it James Brewer or Jay Brewer?

40:53.120 --> 40:54.880
I believe it was Sir James Brewer.

40:54.880 --> 40:55.380
Sir.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.600
Night of the realm, James Brewer.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.960
Do you think we could get him on the horn?

41:02.960 --> 41:08.080
He's pretty busy defending England, but we could probably get him for the project.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.280
He was the probably the best knight in Half Baked.

41:11.280 --> 41:12.000
Uh huh.

41:12.000 --> 41:12.720
If you think about it.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.400
Wait, what?

41:15.200 --> 41:18.080
He was probably the best knight in Half Baked.

41:18.080 --> 41:18.960
Were there multiple?

41:20.720 --> 41:23.280
Other than Sir James Brewer, defender of the realm?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.480
Probably not.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.880
How many of you needed Half Baked, Griffin?

41:26.880 --> 41:27.520
Jesus.

41:27.520 --> 41:27.760
Yeah.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.480
How many knights do you think they needed to make Half Baked?

41:30.480 --> 41:32.480
And then the call went out across the land.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.520
Knights return to defend your mother country.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.880
Do you guys want a yahoo?

41:36.880 --> 41:37.440
Yes.

41:37.440 --> 41:38.000
You know it.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.640
This yahoo was sent in by, oh, oh, oops.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.160
Game recognized game, Rachel Sperling.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.280
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.720
Almost forgot to recognize that game.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.200
Take a moment.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.320
Yeah, I almost breezed right by it.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.120
That would have been a crime.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.160
It's by yahoo answers user, Brooklyn, who asks,

41:52.160 --> 41:55.760
what to do with old best friend necklaces.

41:55.760 --> 42:02.400
So I'm 15 now, and my ex best friend and I haven't been talking for about a year and a half now, I guess.

42:02.400 --> 42:06.720
I was going through some stuff and found all these old BFF necklaces.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.480
I want to get rid of them.

42:08.480 --> 42:12.400
We cannot be best friends again, so I will not wear them again.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.840
That's not even an option.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.040
It just kind of seems like a waste to get rid of them.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.400
Surely I can use at least the chains for something.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.880
Any ideas? Should I just throw them away in this economy?

42:24.880 --> 42:25.680
Cash for gold.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.880
Cash for gold.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.920
Probably not gold.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.920
These are probably $14 necklaces they got at Spencer's gifts.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.480
So you're saying like the purest silver?

42:34.480 --> 42:38.160
Uh, no, probably like the purest tin.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.680
Okay.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.960
Maybe you could try selling them at teengoogle.com.

42:42.960 --> 42:43.920
That's a market place.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.680
Is there a shopping page?

42:45.680 --> 42:46.640
Is there a shopping hub?

42:46.640 --> 42:48.080
Google has everything.

42:48.080 --> 42:48.640
Okay.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.200
If you click on it, there's definitely a place that says shopping.

42:51.200 --> 42:55.280
If you click on it, it's just a picture of a guy in a hard hat, like, oh, boss, come back later.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.040
I think they're going to have some really nice shopping options.

42:57.040 --> 43:01.600
Yeah, Justin's got a fleet of developers quickly coding using their one month by Swift skills.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.440
To make a lot of shopping options.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.240
Did Swift?

43:06.240 --> 43:07.040
Just shoptions.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.920
Shoptions at teengoogle.com.

43:09.920 --> 43:16.560
Um, can you sell them to lonely people who then when they put it on,

43:16.560 --> 43:23.440
who then when they put it on contractually will become best friends with the other person.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.920
Oh, so like a best friend transfer.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.000
Yeah, that's yeah, exactly.

43:28.560 --> 43:33.280
I actually have on the back of my driver's license that when I die, I want to be a best friend donor.

43:33.280 --> 43:37.440
Yeah, all of your best friend necklaces will be taken and distributed.

43:37.440 --> 43:43.760
That is that is no light promise that I have at this point in my 31 years.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.320
I have 163 best friend necklaces.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.520
I wear all of them.

43:47.520 --> 43:48.480
Holy shit.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.240
How did you accrue so many biffs?

43:50.240 --> 43:51.840
Well, Griffin, I listen.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.640
I listen and I care.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.240
That's categorically untrue.

43:56.240 --> 43:56.960
I listen.

43:56.960 --> 43:57.680
I care.

43:57.680 --> 43:58.240
I don't.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.520
I don't talk over people.

44:00.160 --> 44:00.960
No, no, no.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.480
I remember the caring things.

44:02.480 --> 44:03.360
I'll give you caring.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.080
I'll seed caring to you.

44:06.800 --> 44:14.720
I give the best necklaces to a bunch of strangers and then ask your friend to give her necklaces

44:14.720 --> 44:16.000
to a bunch of lonely strangers.

44:16.000 --> 44:16.560
Match.com.

44:16.560 --> 44:21.120
And then match.com, lo-fi match.com, the hunt is on.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.200
You got to find your match.

44:23.200 --> 44:23.760
Oh, my God.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.400
And it's like the fucking it's the fucking missing piece.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.880
Somebody walks up, see somebody with half a heart on their chest.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.240
Like, let's put them together.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.920
Bet Fritz.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.920
No, not quite.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.200
But I don't I don't want to be.

44:35.200 --> 44:38.560
How many necklaces this person had they say they had?

44:38.560 --> 44:40.640
It just says all those.

44:40.640 --> 44:41.840
So more than one.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.040
That's like that's got to be a weird dynamic, right?

44:45.040 --> 44:46.320
Guess what I got.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.040
Yeah, I know.

44:47.040 --> 44:48.720
I know what you got, Darlene.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.280
Let me guess.

44:49.840 --> 44:50.640
Is it a best friend?

44:50.640 --> 44:52.400
It's a best friend necklace.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.120
All right, Darlene.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.840
That's why they stop being best friends.

44:55.840 --> 44:56.880
Yeah, you can't.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.880
I'm sick of all this necklace pressure.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.000
Quit asking me for money to pay for my half of the necklace.

45:05.200 --> 45:09.600
I think it's I think it's kind of bullshit to just throw them away because then your

45:09.600 --> 45:12.560
ex best friend is going to be best friends with garbage.

45:12.560 --> 45:16.160
Yeah, and maybe that's actually a statement that you want to send.

45:16.160 --> 45:20.880
Like, man, Darla, Darla, you seem like you've been down in the dumps today.

45:20.880 --> 45:24.320
Yeah, I just feel like I'm best friends with garbage now.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.280
Hold on.

45:25.280 --> 45:25.840
Never mind.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.200
That's a sweet necklace.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.840
What sort of special somebody has the other half of that?

45:29.840 --> 45:31.120
Let me see garbage.

45:31.120 --> 45:31.920
Let me rub it.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.200
Garbage has me rub it.

45:33.200 --> 45:33.680
Kiss it.

45:33.680 --> 45:34.880
Hold it to my third eye.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.840
Let's say garbage.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.160
Is there a market?

45:38.160 --> 45:41.920
Is there a product we could create that's like a casual acquaintance necklace where

45:41.920 --> 45:45.440
instead of like a broken heart, it's just like a circle that's split straight down the

45:45.440 --> 45:50.480
center, no jagged edge and just says, Kaz, you will acquaintance.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.480
And yeah, you just give it to everybody.

45:52.480 --> 45:55.760
I feel like you're going to get it's a way bigger market because more people will be

45:55.760 --> 45:57.600
like, oh, I feel that way about a lot of people.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.960
Yeah, I'll take like 30 of them.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.960
Just hand them out, hand them out with your best friends, forever necklace people.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.160
They weren't looking for the ups.

46:04.160 --> 46:08.400
Yeah, here's a business card and here's a necklace that says Kaz, I can't.

46:08.400 --> 46:14.160
It's a really great necklace.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.520
If you hold it to your third eye, we can speak to each other.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.200
It's basically the goddamn Palantir.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.240
So I think you're really going to like it.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.400
Oh, and my business card, did you get that?

46:24.400 --> 46:25.680
It's got my email address on it.

46:26.800 --> 46:28.880
I don't take a lot of emails or texts or calls.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.360
Mostly just Palantir, like direct third eye communication.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.400
And please don't lose that business card.

46:34.400 --> 46:34.960
Those are expensive.

46:34.960 --> 46:35.920
Those are expensive.

46:35.920 --> 46:36.560
And the Palantir.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.200
Those don't come free.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.160
And the Palantir contains a fraction of the devil's souls.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.200
Don't lose that one either.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.440
Yeah, that's a cost to me, too.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.200
How about one more question?

46:48.080 --> 46:49.200
Yeah, I got one more question.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.120
Let me just check it real quick.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.480
This question comes to us.

46:55.760 --> 46:56.880
Oh, God damn it.

46:57.520 --> 46:58.020
Oh, no.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.360
Oh, no.

46:59.360 --> 47:00.480
Breaking this just it.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.040
Hold on.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.480
Can we have farm wisdom and haunted doll watch in the same?

47:04.480 --> 47:07.440
Haunted farm watch.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.960
This one costs $300.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.080
Christ on a bike.

47:12.880 --> 47:17.600
If you want to buy it now, $300 if you want to buy it now.

47:18.240 --> 47:22.480
No bids as of yet on this one.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.840
Re-list authentic haunted doll.

47:27.840 --> 47:30.880
Ruth, healing spirit, and then in quotes,

47:31.840 --> 47:33.280
antique collection.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.800
Well, all of them are right.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.800
I don't imagine anybody went to the Build-A-Bear factory

47:36.800 --> 47:39.840
and got one on Tuesday and it was already haunted by Thursday.

47:39.840 --> 47:42.000
I imagine most of these are aged.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.080
Now, I try not to poke holes in these,

47:44.080 --> 47:46.000
but it strikes me as a little bit fishy.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.160
If this is a healing, you shouldn't go holes in them

47:48.160 --> 47:50.240
because they're trapping a demon spirit.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.920
So they probably want to keep those enclosed.

47:51.920 --> 47:55.200
If it's a healing spirit, why would you be trying to get rid of it?

47:55.200 --> 47:55.680
Yeah.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.600
Well, let me hip you to this story.

47:57.600 --> 48:03.040
This doll houses an old soul and is a special and unique offering.

48:03.040 --> 48:06.560
This doll is antique and was given to Michelle

48:06.560 --> 48:08.320
by her mother many years ago.

48:08.320 --> 48:15.280
Michelle's mother, 14th birthday present.

48:15.280 --> 48:17.360
Michelle's mother was a gifted medium

48:17.360 --> 48:19.680
who possessed similar talents to Michelle.

48:19.680 --> 48:20.880
Who's Michelle, you may ask?

48:21.440 --> 48:22.880
I don't know.

48:22.880 --> 48:23.920
Michelle Tanner.

48:25.280 --> 48:29.520
Ruth has lived inside this doll for well over 100 years.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.160
She passed away in the early 1900s.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.680
She froze to death after becoming lost on her travels.

48:35.680 --> 48:39.520
Ruth was 17 and about to marry, it says here.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.800
So I don't know.

48:40.800 --> 48:42.160
How do you know so much?

48:42.160 --> 48:46.000
Doll is fucking 100 years old, at least.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.840
That's worth more than $300 right there.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.440
Ruth is a very active and present spirit.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.880
That's, you know, that's so important.

48:54.880 --> 48:55.680
You got to lean in.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.920
Yeah, she gets out there, she meets people.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.440
Hey, I want to party tonight.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.880
Ruth, I can't, I'm 14.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.080
You're made of alabaster.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.520
Get me out there.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.040
I want to meet people.

49:07.040 --> 49:07.840
Oh, Jesus.

49:07.840 --> 49:08.340
She manip-

49:09.200 --> 49:10.880
Ruth is very active and present spirit.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.120
She manipulates her doll very well.

49:13.120 --> 49:17.040
Her eyes have rapidly twitched and switched direction.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.800
She appears cross-eyed at times.

49:18.800 --> 49:21.840
Her mouth seems to change shape, which is alarming.

49:21.840 --> 49:22.720
Well, wait, hold on.

49:22.720 --> 49:24.320
I had a Teddy Ruxpin that did that.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.120
All Teddy Ruxpins were haunted dolls.

49:27.120 --> 49:27.620
Okay.

49:27.620 --> 49:32.420
Ruth does move her vessel from one location to another.

49:32.420 --> 49:36.420
I have found her on the couch once upon coming downstairs and then-

49:36.420 --> 49:37.460
Watching Cops.

49:38.340 --> 49:42.660
Watching Cops and eating pizza-blasted Cheetos.

49:43.220 --> 49:44.580
Some of the greatest-

49:44.580 --> 49:46.500
Okay, I-

49:46.500 --> 49:48.580
Listen, I feel like I-

49:48.580 --> 49:53.460
These fucking posts make me feel like I'm coming into a movie with 20 minutes left.

49:53.460 --> 49:58.020
Some of the greatest orb activity I have ever seen has been a result of-

49:58.020 --> 49:59.060
What is that?

49:59.060 --> 50:04.340
The orbs are bright and have traveled directly from her vessel to the hallway and back into her vessel.

50:04.340 --> 50:07.460
She has astounding control over both her energies and spirit.

50:09.140 --> 50:10.260
And her vessel.

50:10.260 --> 50:12.180
Spirits, vessels, energies, orbs.

50:12.180 --> 50:14.340
Ruth has got it going on.

50:14.340 --> 50:16.260
Parties, Saturday night, club banging.

50:16.260 --> 50:26.260
Ruth is very curious when it comes to electronic devices as these devices were not invented

50:26.260 --> 50:27.540
in her time while living.

50:28.740 --> 50:29.540
What do you got there?

50:31.700 --> 50:33.620
Looks like some sort of magic book.

50:33.620 --> 50:35.060
It's an iPhone, Ruth.

50:35.060 --> 50:37.380
We've been over this every fucking day.

50:37.380 --> 50:38.420
This is a magical-

50:38.420 --> 50:40.980
Ruth, are you ordering pizza on my Pizza Hut app again?

50:40.980 --> 50:44.740
No, just exploring this magical piece of wood.

50:44.740 --> 50:45.860
Ruth, no pizza.

50:45.860 --> 50:47.540
I'm very active and hungry.

50:47.540 --> 50:48.180
I'm reading your-

50:48.180 --> 50:52.820
Looks like you got some little people stuck in your magic book.

50:52.820 --> 50:54.820
It's the Avengers 2 trailer, Ruth.

50:54.820 --> 50:56.660
I watched it yesterday with you.

50:57.300 --> 50:59.300
You were the one who told me to watch it on YouTube, Ruth.

50:59.300 --> 51:02.340
Tell me, can your illuminated Bible do this?

51:02.340 --> 51:02.900
Orbs.

51:04.980 --> 51:07.380
That's the sound she makes when she shoots orbs into the hallway.

51:09.060 --> 51:09.780
Sucks them back.

51:10.820 --> 51:12.020
Extremely taxing.

51:12.020 --> 51:17.060
$300, I think you're getting a lot of bang for your buck with this one.

51:18.580 --> 51:19.060
With Ruth?

51:19.060 --> 51:19.380
Yeah.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.060
It sounds like she does a lot of shit.

51:21.060 --> 51:25.380
So the reason to get rid of a spirit that could heal you is she's just too active to

51:25.380 --> 51:25.780
keep up with that lifetime.

51:25.780 --> 51:28.100
I'm sick of all these goddamn orbs.

51:28.980 --> 51:33.700
She has caused moderate headaches and pressure-related symptoms.

51:33.700 --> 51:37.300
Pretty shitty healing doll, I would say.

51:37.300 --> 51:37.940
Interesting.

51:39.700 --> 51:41.940
This whole paragraph's bold, guys, so it's important.

51:41.940 --> 51:42.820
And true.

51:42.820 --> 51:44.980
Oh, goddammit.

51:44.980 --> 51:47.300
I just looked at that picture.

51:47.300 --> 51:48.340
Yeah, sorry.

51:48.340 --> 51:52.340
She has caused moderate headaches and pressure-related symptoms during communications and psychic

51:52.340 --> 51:52.660
work.

51:52.660 --> 51:55.700
Interestingly, she has assisted with healing.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.020
She has abilities to drain, as with many spirits.

51:58.020 --> 51:59.460
Most will drain your energy.

51:59.460 --> 52:03.380
Ruth drains pain, physical and emotional.

52:03.380 --> 52:04.180
Oh, Jesus.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.220
I can't look at that.

52:05.220 --> 52:07.140
Why did you send me this, Justin?

52:07.140 --> 52:10.900
Yeah, I don't know what this doll's healing, but it's certainly not my goddamn state of

52:10.900 --> 52:11.300
mind.

52:11.300 --> 52:12.420
Oh, god, bless.

52:13.140 --> 52:16.660
Fucking haunted physician, heal thyself.

52:18.420 --> 52:20.500
Your goddamn eyes are all marble-y.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.860
Got the cataracts, Ruth.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.260
So that's gonna do it for us.

52:26.260 --> 52:28.980
Thank you for listening to my brother, my brother, and me again.

52:29.860 --> 52:33.860
We sure appreciate it, and we hope you've had some fun.

52:35.060 --> 52:35.940
Right?

52:35.940 --> 52:38.180
Yeah, I did, until I looked at that fucking picture.

52:38.180 --> 52:41.540
Yeah, and it's seared into my brain.

52:41.540 --> 52:43.220
I want to throw back real quick.

52:43.220 --> 52:47.780
Thanks again to naturebox.com, where you can get your free sampler box of great-tasting,

52:47.780 --> 52:49.940
wholesome snacks like barbecue kettle kernels.

52:49.940 --> 52:54.740
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother, and we're gonna get you those free fucking snacks.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.100
You should already be doing it as we speak.

52:59.220 --> 52:59.460
Yep.

53:01.460 --> 53:03.940
This is our 240th episode, I guess.

53:03.940 --> 53:05.060
Almost 420, isn't it?

53:05.060 --> 53:05.780
Almost 420.

53:05.780 --> 53:06.820
Almost 420.

53:06.820 --> 53:11.620
There's 239 more of these at teengoogle.com.

53:11.620 --> 53:17.540
So go there, and while you're there, check out some other Maximum Fun shows, like Jordan

53:17.540 --> 53:22.900
and Jesse Go, or The Goose Down, or One Bad Mother, or Baby Geniuses.

53:22.900 --> 53:23.860
Travis produces that.

53:23.860 --> 53:24.580
You should listen to that.

53:25.300 --> 53:26.340
Listen to whatever you want.

53:26.340 --> 53:29.940
Sawbones, that's a show I do with my wife about medicine.

53:31.220 --> 53:31.460
Thanks.

53:31.460 --> 53:32.660
You should check out Bunker Buddies.

53:32.660 --> 53:39.140
It's a show I do with Andy, where we talk about apocalypses from a comedic bent.

53:39.860 --> 53:44.420
Or check out Adventure Zone, which I hope we'll be able to get up this week.

53:44.420 --> 53:46.660
Here's the situation, Adventure Zone fans.

53:47.700 --> 53:49.860
Dad lives 45 minutes away from Justin.

53:51.460 --> 53:54.180
30 to 45, depending on the traffic.

53:55.220 --> 54:00.580
And right now, there's the goddamn ice wall from Game of Thrones in between the two of

54:00.580 --> 54:05.060
them, so if Dad can find a way to scale that, then we'll have an episode this week.

54:05.060 --> 54:08.500
If not, we may have to drop back and punt.

54:09.220 --> 54:10.100
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

54:10.740 --> 54:11.220
Something.

54:11.220 --> 54:11.940
We'll figure out something.

54:13.540 --> 54:16.340
Did you thank John Rodgers with the long winners for the use of the theme song?

54:16.340 --> 54:18.180
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed?

54:18.180 --> 54:18.980
No, didn't do that.

54:18.980 --> 54:21.620
But you just did, because I mentalist-ed you.

54:21.620 --> 54:25.300
There are still a few tickets available for the Chicago and Milwaukee shows.

54:26.500 --> 54:29.380
Not very many for that Milwaukee one, last time I checked.

54:29.380 --> 54:30.180
Yeah.

54:30.180 --> 54:31.380
So get on that.

54:31.380 --> 54:36.340
It's bit.ly forward slash mbnbamchicago and bit.ly.

54:39.060 --> 54:40.420
Bit.johnlway.

54:40.420 --> 54:42.180
Bit.johnlway.

54:42.180 --> 54:46.100
Bit.ly forward slash, I think it's mbnbamil.

54:48.340 --> 54:52.500
Those URLs are so confusing, you can just pop those into Team Google and it'll auto-populate

54:52.500 --> 54:52.900
the rest.

54:53.460 --> 54:56.580
If you want to have a message on My Brother, My Brother, and Me, or the Adventure Zone

54:56.580 --> 54:59.380
now, we also started doing Jumbotrons for that.

54:59.380 --> 55:03.460
Go to maximumfun.org forward slash jumbotron.

55:03.460 --> 55:08.660
It's a great way to wish someone happy birthday, or happy wedding, or happy non-specific ceremony.

55:09.380 --> 55:10.100
It's terrific.

55:10.820 --> 55:15.620
Or we can pimp your product and push your podcast, or talk about your website, or whatever

55:15.620 --> 55:16.340
you want.

55:16.340 --> 55:17.140
We'll dance for you.

55:17.860 --> 55:18.100
Yeah.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.260
We will be your haunted dolls.

55:24.660 --> 55:26.180
You got a last question, Griffin?

55:26.180 --> 55:29.780
This final Yahoo Answer was sent in by Level 9000 Yajushaman Drew Davenport.

55:29.780 --> 55:30.580
Shoot, that was close.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.540
I was about to say.

55:31.540 --> 55:32.900
We almost went a whole episode.

55:32.900 --> 55:33.300
I know.

55:33.300 --> 55:34.580
Drew Davenport, thank you so much.

55:34.580 --> 55:41.940
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tracer, who asks, what does Ja Rule think about all this?

55:45.780 --> 55:47.220
I'm Justin McElroy.

55:47.220 --> 55:48.980
I'm Travis McElroy.

55:48.980 --> 55:50.260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

55:50.260 --> 55:51.780
This has been My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

55:51.780 --> 55:53.380
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

55:53.380 --> 56:02.820
See you Google.

56:13.060 --> 56:14.980
Maximumfun.org.

56:14.980 --> 56:16.020
Comedy and culture.

56:16.020 --> 56:17.140
Artist owned.

56:17.140 --> 56:18.420
Listener supported.

56:18.420 --> 56:18.980
Hey, everyone.

56:18.980 --> 56:23.780
We're The Flophouse, one of the newest additions to the Maximum Fun Podcasting Network.

56:23.780 --> 56:25.060
I'm Dan McCoy.

56:25.060 --> 56:26.260
I'm Stuart Wellington.

56:26.260 --> 56:27.780
And I'm Elliot Kalin.

56:27.780 --> 56:30.500
What is The Flophouse, you may very well ask?

56:30.500 --> 56:32.740
We watch a bad movie, and then we talk about it.

56:32.740 --> 56:34.020
A bad movie podcast?

56:34.020 --> 56:36.580
Isn't that like every fifth podcast on the internet?

56:36.580 --> 56:40.420
I'd answer that by saying, one, we've been doing this show for over seven years, long

56:40.420 --> 56:43.380
before the entire premise of our show was a cliche.

56:43.380 --> 56:44.900
And two, shut up.

56:44.900 --> 56:46.020
Sick bird.

56:46.020 --> 56:48.820
I'd say that our show is more of a comedy podcast.

56:48.820 --> 56:51.220
A podcast about words that sound like other words.

56:51.220 --> 56:55.860
A podcast about me singing long irritating songs like this one.

56:55.860 --> 57:01.060
A podcast about pitches for a Ziggy comic book movie or discussions about sex tarps.

57:01.060 --> 57:05.860
Yeah, I mean, mostly it's a show about three friends just hanging out and talking about

57:05.860 --> 57:06.660
ding dongs.

57:06.660 --> 57:07.700
That's mostly used to.

57:07.700 --> 57:08.580
Wait, what?

57:08.580 --> 57:15.380
